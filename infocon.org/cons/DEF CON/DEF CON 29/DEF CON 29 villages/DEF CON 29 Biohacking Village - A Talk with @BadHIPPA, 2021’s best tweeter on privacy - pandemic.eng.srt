8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,039
twitter handle bad hipaa takes

9
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:20,880
by way of introduction

10
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,359
um at the start of the pandemic

11
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:25,279
um all the way through the insurrection

12
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:27,680
in the capital and on into the vaccine

13
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:28,720
rollout

14
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,039
nationwide healthcare privacy law hipaa

15
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:33,280
with two a's and one p

16
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,960
has gotten more famous and more

17
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,360
misunderstood than ever

18
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,760
out of this morass of politization and

19
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,239
polemic emerged the twitter handle uh

20
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:46,320
bad hypothetics at bad h-i-p-p-a notice

21
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,079
the misspelling

22
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,079
this twitter handle shines a light on

23
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,399
the absurd the funny the sad and even

24
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:54,719
the accurate in a must follow for anyone

25
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,320
interested in privacy

26
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,559
today i'm going to be interviewing the

27
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,640
author of that handle and asking them

28
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,480
some questions based on what they've

29
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,199
seen in the past year and the future of

30
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,280
uh health information privacy law in the

31
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,439
u.s so i'm just going to kick it off and

32
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:10,960
get started

33
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,560
i think the first question we want to

34
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,240
know is what motivated you to start

35
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,840
tweeting about bad hepatics

36
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,680
it all started with the epidemic of

37
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,400
masks exemption cards that showed up on

38
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,320
twitter back in may of 2020 when i

39
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,840
created the account

40
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,079
these were being shared all over by this

41
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:36,560
fictitious freedom to breathe agency and

42
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,880
they were talking about how you know

43
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,520
hipaa spilled incorrectly of course and

44
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,000
the fourth amendment prohibit people

45
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,240
from requiring masks and not being able

46
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,759
to ask about what you know why you're

47
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,600
not wearing a mask and those sort of

48
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,560
things

49
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,040
and those cards you know referenced

50
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,479
those those

51
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,320
those laws and

52
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,880
used official government logos to

53
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,280
appear credible and official

54
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,399
this misinformation campaign

55
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:05,840
really bothered me

56
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,479
i wanted to see if i could do something

57
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,038
to put a stop to it

58
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,280
in retrospect the answer is no clearly

59
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,200
but

60
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,280
that's just that's here we are

61
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,080
um and i'm a follower of the bad legal

62
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,480
takes account and a few others in that

63
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,440
same bad takes vein on twitter and i

64
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,959
thought that was a pretty good format to

65
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:28,400
emulate

66
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,319
so i started there and it just kept

67
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:33,519
going and here we are

68
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:36,959
13 months later yeah

69
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,480
and and we're going to be at it for a

70
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,120
while no doubt now when we were first

71
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,720
arranging this i checked and you had

72
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,959
about 15 000 followers that was a couple

73
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:46,560
of months ago what are you up to today

74
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,560
and does it surprise you that that many

75
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,840
people are following along

76
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,319
i'm over 18 000

77
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:57,280
and growing as of today there's actually

78
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,800
literally as we're recording this

79
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,800
session there's an incident going on

80
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,480
with one of the

81
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,720
one of the people that has has become a

82
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,280
favorite bad hipaa tweeter marjorie

83
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,480
taylor green

84
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,280
and you know my mentions are absolutely

85
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,560
exploding i i'm tremendously surprised

86
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,120
by this i i never imagined

87
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,120
that such a niche

88
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,599
area of interest would attract this kind

89
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:22,959
of attention

90
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,599
you know i think i tapped into a moment

91
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,760
people found the message relevant and

92
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,400
humorous i get a lot of gratification

93
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,159
from knowing that i make people laugh

94
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:35,120
with my content i get some nice dms from

95
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,319
people thanking you for running the

96
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,640
account which is which is always good i

97
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,920
don't do any kind of you know tweet

98
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,400
promotion or monetization or advertising

99
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,640
i've had solicitations for it it's just

100
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,879
not my thing so it's all been

101
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,799
purely organic growth

102
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,120
um you definitely people definitely get

103
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,879
more with honey than with vinegar and i

104
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:55,120
think humor you know goes a long way

105
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,319
about that

106
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,560
um and we'll get to marjory taylor green

107
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,400
maybe in a minute but i guess my next

108
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,840
question is sort of looking back over

109
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,720
the last 13 months almost 14 months now

110
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,599
do you feel like the takes you you find

111
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,200
sort of have categories and what would

112
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,760
those categories be

113
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,519
yeah for sure i mean the lowest hanging

114
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,280
fruit is just the simple misspelling

115
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,639
which you know that's that's kind of

116
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,160
boring on its own

117
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,918
you know people spelling it with you

118
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,000
know two p's in one a thinking that the

119
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,919
peas stand for privacy protection most

120
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:25,600
of the time which of course there's no

121
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,400
privacy mentioned in the name of the act

122
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,680
um then there's you know the the excuses

123
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,680
for not wearing masks and wanting

124
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,520
exemptions from that excuses for not

125
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,440
talking about vaccination status that's

126
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,120
another kind of major category and

127
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,479
probably the largest overall in volume

128
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,560
early on when contact tracing was a new

129
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,120
thing people were learning about because

130
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,639
probably most people had never heard of

131
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,160
it before

132
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,600
that was a big topic people were

133
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,840
thinking that contact tracers were you

134
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,160
know violating hipaa by asking about you

135
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,120
know how you came to contract the virus

136
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,400
right then there's

137
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,680
reporters

138
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,240
you know talking about sports injuries

139
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,560
or players being out for covet or you

140
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,400
know whether they're vaccinated or not

141
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,880
and you know this this is all stuff

142
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,680
that's like the the players have waived

143
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,080
their privacy in most cases you know

144
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,160
under the league collective bargaining

145
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,280
agreements and other contracts so that's

146
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,120
not not really a violation but it keeps

147
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,360
coming up and then there's the final

148
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,840
category really is the

149
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,800
celebrity and politician stuff you know

150
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,919
this this politician saying you know

151
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:36,880
x y is a hepa violation when it's not

152
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,120
or you know the members of the public

153
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,280
getting upset when you know their guy

154
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,280
has some kind of you know health

155
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,199
information out into the public by you

156
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:46,880
know reporters or people on twitter or

157
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,240
whatever

158
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,680
yeah yeah exactly and then in terms of

159
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,919
all of those categories and i'm sure

160
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:55,280
there will be more

161
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,840
hot bad takes coming in the future but

162
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,160
like what's your top one or the favorite

163
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,759
one you've had so far and i saw the

164
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:04,240
green day one just today i was checking

165
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,120
um and so that was pretty good but um

166
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,080

167
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,080

00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,800
so so many and i tried you know

171
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,960
researching back through my timeline and

172
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,199
couldn't find one that really jumped out

173
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:24,000
but you know by just by volume you know

174
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,319
the reactions by the public to

175
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,560
the the contact tracing early on and the

176
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,319
more recent announcements by the

177
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,080
administration about the door-to-door

178
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,560
vaccination outreach that one got a lot

179
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,479
of attention very quickly

180
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,400
and you know i i wanted to say something

181
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,000
about that you know personally i'm very

182
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,560
disappointed in the messaging on both of

183
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,840
these topics

184
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,000
the administration really stepped in it

185
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,240
when they spoke out so vaguely about

186
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,400
this door-to-door initiative and left

187
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,599
room for

188
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:54,400
the most disingenuous of their opponents

189
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,960
to you know make all these these

190
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,560
accusations that the government was

191
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,919
keeping you know secret lists of

192
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,680
unvaccinated people and all kinds of

193
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,240
this this nonsense

194
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,319
you know and and the whole just overall

195
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:09,360
politician politician politicizing our

196
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,919
response to the pandemic has has cost

197
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:14,240
people their lives and and that's just

198
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,440
it's just unforgivable yeah no it's and

199
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,120
i mean as somebody who used to explain

200
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,880
hipaa to the rest of my political

201
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,680
colleagues in the government i i i feel

202
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,240
that very um at a very empathetic level

203
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,080
because i remember my own conversations

204
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,360
where somebody would say well doesn't it

205
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,960
do blah blah i'm like no actually it

206
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,560
doesn't do that at all

207
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,240
um and so i think

208
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,800
a and a really important object lesson

209
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,880
uh in the privacy realm for all this is

210
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,199
that you can't explain it simply enough

211
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,880
often enough

212
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,319
and that's one of the great things about

213
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,639
your handle is that it it

214
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,879
tries to get to the nut of what what

215
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,720
really is the health information privacy

216
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,160
law and what it what it means and then

217
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,680
of course we'll talk about this in a

218
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,720
little bit

219
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,319
where does it not apply which is a

220
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:57,520
really key

221
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,879
key part of it

222
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,080
um

223
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,720
so i wanted to ask you you may it makes

224
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,080
people who read your handle laugh but

225
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,879
you must be laughing yourself sometimes

226
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,599
so do you have you know a favorite

227
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:14,879
humorous uh moment with your handle or

228
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,000
reply

229
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,599
to uh something you posted

230
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,360
yeah there was one

231
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,680
you know a day ago which you know

232
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,039
there was a good hypnotic because there

233
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,440
was an actual violation involved

234
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,360
but the the comedy of it was the set of

235
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,200
circumstances surrounding it i'll i'll

236
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,519
read the tweet and kind of paraphrase

237
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:36,880
what uh what they say because there's

238
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,559
some stuff in it that's a little you

239
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,360
know

240
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,599
adult in nature but you know oh i think

241
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:42,719
i know which one you're going to talk

242
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,360
about that one was that i bet you do

243
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,640
yeah so this is

244
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,880
a warning on the recording uh people

245
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,399
under 18 shouldn't be listening to this

246
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,880
part of the recording now go ahead

247
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,680
yeah

248
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,160
so the the handle that tweeted it out

249
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,120
you know

250
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,360
goes by the name bowl cut boy

251
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,519
they said you know

252
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:04,320
one of my fans got fired from his job

253
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,399
because he violated hipaa when he posted

254
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,480
a video of him

255
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,720
performing a sexual act i'll say in a

256
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,600
private inventory room for his only fans

257
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,519
and exposed six patient names and

258
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,760
addresses no words

259
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,320
and i mean this one was just hilarious

260
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,399
to me because you know it's

261
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:26,000
talk about a a bad way to get fired and

262
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,320
you know a ridiculous way to violate

263
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,440
hippa

264
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,279
and not to mention

265
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,120
is the person who tweeted that should

266
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,560
they even be telling the story of

267
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,120
somebody else's firing in such uh

268
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,800
extraordinary circumstances like there's

269
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,719
a whole privacy angle to that too right

270
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,560
the person

271
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,240
they're telling a story about somebody

272
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,279
else they're not telling their own story

273
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,920
yeah of course who knows if it's true or

274
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,519
not i mean you know if it's on the

275
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,200
internet it must be true

276
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,760
right insert left track here

277
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,839
right well that kind of takes me to the

278
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:01,760
one that i i found one of the funniest

279
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,680
ones here which was

280
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,600
several months ago you you had a whole

281
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,200
string from a

282
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,880
twitter author who was claiming that

283
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,200
hipaa derived from the nuremberg treaty

284
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,279
and i know quite a lot about the history

285
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,920
of privacy laws and most people date our

286
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,920
concern about health information privacy

287
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:21,680
to the 1970s the belmont report or maybe

288
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,360
farther back to justice brandeis but

289
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,360
i've never really heard the nuremberg

290
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,560
trials cited um i have to say i did go

291
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,160
down the rabbit hole of that tweeter's

292
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,600
tweets to like kind of see what was

293
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,720
there and whether there was any

294
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,399
substance like did i miss something

295
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,000
should i educate myself on something it

296
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,079
turned out to be a complete dead end

297
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:40,720
um but i wonder if you ever see takes

298
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,959
yourself that you're like hmm is there

299
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,480
is it should i go down that rabbit hole

300
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,079
should i check on whether that thing is

301
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,360
true or not um or mostly uh you avoid

302
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,839
the bait

303
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,680
so

304
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,600
like any human

305
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,200
i'm not always as thoughtful as i

306
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,200
probably should be

307
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,800
but there are definitely times when i

308
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,480
will pause and review

309
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,640
the regulation review the content that

310
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,040
i'm looking at look for more context and

311
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,519
try to find you know find out more about

312
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,079
who said what and why and what's behind

313
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:14,079
it there are plenty of submissions i

314
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:15,600
won't take on at all

315
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,600
just due to the nature of the topic some

316
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,680
some things are too radioactive

317
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,000
even for an anonymous account to really

318
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,519
want to engage with or things i just

319
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,920
don't want to associate myself with

320
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,800
you know a recent example

321
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,720
you know and this isn't too bad but you

322
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,640
know there there was a another tweet

323
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,160
i'll kind of you know paraphrase a

324
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,920
little bit because again it's got some

325
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,760
you know profanities in it

326
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,839
uh from a a person saying they're an er

327
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:44,000
nurse um had a effing cop come up to the

328
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,079
nurse's station trying to find out if a

329
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,399
patient was getting discharged so we can

330
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,079
detain the individual on the way out of

331
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:51,680
the hospital

332
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,200
i told him to get asked if he thought i

333
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,040
was going to violate hipaa and called

334
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,120
security felt good

335
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,000
so this was a person who you know in a

336
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
you know healthcare provider capacity

337
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,079
right hipaa does apply

338
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:05,760
but does it apply to this exact

339
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,000
situation and i you know i had to go

340
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,560
re-read the regulation and specifically

341
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,560
look for some cases where disclosures to

342
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,160
law enforcement without you know patient

343
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,720
authorization are allowed and you know

344
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,399
it's quite possible that there that this

345
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:19,839
does fall under one of those exceptions

346
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,440
but i don't know i would be speculating

347
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,720
because there's not enough facts in the

348
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,639
tweet to really come to a solid

349
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,800
conclusion so that's that's one where i

350
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,079
i i couched my response a bit with you

351
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,079
know the possibility that there's not

352
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:33,440
enough information

353
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,440
right well and there are always that i

354
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,600
mean i have this myself i don't have 18

355
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,000
000 followers so i'm envious but uh

356
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,519
where people really just want you to

357
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,920
give them the entire regulatory analysis

358
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,079
not only on twitter but in public and

359
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:47,760
for nothing and since certainly for me

360
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,600
i'm in the business of being a lawyer i

361
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,839
like to get paid for my expertise um

362
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,200
unless i'm doing something as fun as

363
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,880
this in which case i'm all in on

364
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,399
volunteering

365
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:57,200
um

366
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,240
but uh

367
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,079
let me let me ask you about sort of some

368
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,839
a few more serious things right now so

369
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:03,839
18 000 followers is a pretty big

370
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,959
following in a really rarefied niche and

371
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:09,120
i have a few questions about this sort

372
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,320
of niche part of it the first one is um

373
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,079
you know that's a pretty loud big

374
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:16,079
platform i know i know who follows you

375
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,160
and it's a lot of people who can be good

376
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,639
amplifiers of well-placed

377
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,200
comments and ideas um do you ever want

378
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,720
to use your platform to like sort of

379
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,279
change the way our laws work and and if

380
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:30,880
so what would you want to change

381
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,120
i i think

382
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,760
it would be great to find an avenue for

383
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,760
using my you know using my powers for

384
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,680
good as it were

385
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,839
i think my desire for privacy and

386
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:43,600
anonymity might ironically present a

387
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,920
substantial obstacle to that i don't

388
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,839
think congress takes anonymous testimony

389
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:50,959
from novelty twitter accounts

390
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:52,959
but in the meantime you know in my

391
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:55,040
personal capacity you know i do what i

392
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,000
can to emphasize

393
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,920
appropriate customer privacy controls

394
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,800
and security as the first classes and of

395
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,639
the work that i do in

396
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,160
in my day job

397
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,839
um as far as

398
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:09,040
you know

399
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,800
going further than that

400
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,279
i'm not sure what you know what a good

401
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:14,720
approach would be but you know maybe

402
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,399
there is some space for collaboration

403
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,320
with some of the other higher profile

404
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,639
folks folks like yourself and others

405
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,959
that uh that are you know

406
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:25,040
on my timeline who would

407
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,480
be able to amplify some interesting

408
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,160
ideas

409
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,920
i don't know if you wanted to segue into

410
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,760
that one about prospect for changes in

411
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,000
hipaa or something else yeah i i think

412
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,560
that'd be great um i it's definitely

413
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,240
something for this particular audience

414
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,480
at the biohacking village that we talked

415
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,959
a lot about last year last year i did a

416
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:45,360
presentation about how to you know what

417
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,279
were the laws and how to influence them

418
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:48,480
i think that

419
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,240
in many ways the

420
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,320
consumer privacy conversation is

421
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,240
somewhat more abund obviously the bind

422
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,760
administration came in with some very

423
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,199
specific

424
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:59,279
um

425
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,120
agenda items that you know have to do

426
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,199
with covid and getting the economy back

427
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:05,279
on track and infrastructure and then of

428
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,519
course the politics of congress are very

429
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,000
complicated right now with these

430
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
uh very thin majorities sort of not

431
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,839
really a majority in the senate um but

432
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:18,560
it's also a situation from to my mind uh

433
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,880
being sort of in privacy and a digital

434
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,959
health advocate that if we don't fix the

435
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:25,360
consumer privacy side of the equation

436
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,680
then the power of digital information to

437
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,360
really help us improve our society will

438
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,320
be

439
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,560
quite a lot for stalled and so i'm a

440
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,800
huge advocate of actually individual

441
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,639
citizens letting their congress people

442
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:39,040
know what's important to them

443
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,480
but what do you think i mean you're

444
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,920
looking at that you're getting a lot of

445
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,440
information from people on twitter and

446
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,959
there are a wide a wide variety of

447
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:46,399
people are people

448
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:47,759
obviously they they don't understand

449
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:49,839
where hipaa ends so there's that but

450
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:52,000
what else are you observing in the way

451
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,800
people are interacting with you about

452
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,720
their consumers awareness of their

453
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,560
privacy rights whether privacy is

454
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,920
important to them

455
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,360
as opposed to like a convenient

456
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,240
political excuse

457
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:07,680
yeah i think it's both um

458
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,639
you know

459
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,880
as far as awareness goes i don't i don't

460
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,880
think that like over the last year i

461
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,480
don't think i've observed

462
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,399
that people are becoming any more aware

463
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:19,440
of their privacy rights and laws

464
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,199
you know even with

465
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:23,440
recent articles that they've been from

466
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,959
uh some of the trusted news outlets

467
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:27,279
highlighting how incorrect people are

468
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:30,000
about what hipaa is really about there's

469
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,240
so much resistance to those facts you

470
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,399
know again just going back to like

471
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,720
marjory taylor green she continues to

472
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,519
spout about hipaa and wrong ways and

473
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:41,360
she's making it worse

474
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,519
um i don't have data to support you know

475
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,759
the level of awareness um you know and

476
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:47,680
my my viewpoint on it will be naturally

477
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,759
biased by what i'm observing right i'm

478
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,839
looking for the worst and dumbest things

479
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:53,199
that i can find

480
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:54,399
because they're the funniest to talk

481
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:55,279
about

482
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:58,160
um but you know what i really think is

483
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,120
hipaa for a lot of people is a stand-in

484
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,120
for the general privacy protections that

485
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,280
they wish they had

486
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,839
it may be the only thing the only

487
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,439
raw regulation

488
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:11,199
that they've been exposed to in the

489
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:12,640
privacy space

490
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,720
so i don't blame most normal people for

491
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,480
not understanding it after not even

492
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,160
reading the notice of privacy practices

493
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,520
that they got handed at their doctor's

494
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,199
office like that's probably how most lay

495
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:22,400
people are even introduced to the

496
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,919
concept of hipaa

497
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,000
so short on details

498
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,599
they're they're they can be excused you

499
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,120
know for not knowing

500
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,039
yeah you know i i think i think that's a

501
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:32,559
as a standard i think that's a really

502
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:35,200
great way to frame it but uh then we

503
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,039
have to assume that people wish they had

504
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:38,720
some kind of better

505
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,880
privacy rights what are our prospects

506
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,799
for that and and

507
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:43,760
i mean you know there's like the

508
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,200
european method there's like the

509
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,200
brazilian method there's the you know

510
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,720
state of california state of colorado

511
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,320
there's a lot of different ideas kicking

512
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,280
around

513
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,000
um do you see kind of any prospects for

514
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,679
that and and if so where do you think

515
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:57,600
they should go

516
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,799
which direction should we go

517
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:03,440
i think um you know thinking about some

518
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,120
of the other laws that are out there you

519
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,440
know gdpr pivot uh you know

520
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,160
the uk's privacy uh data privacy act

521
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,160
there's all these templates right

522
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,400
california has the cpp colorado just

523
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,760
passed a new one

524
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,000
you know and all of these things

525
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,480
can serve as templates and experiments

526
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,440
for

527
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,360
you know figuring out what works and

528
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,520
what doesn't and what consumers and you

529
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,760
know individuals need and don't care

530
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,880
about

531
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,799
you know and so that state by state

532
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:33,280
aspect is interesting you know it's one

533
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,280
of the benefits of federalism you know

534
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,799
we can try things across different

535
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:39,760
states and see how it goes and you know

536
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,520
people in their own kind of unique

537
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,000
cultures and in those states can can ask

538
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,919
for the things they want

539
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:47,600
um and then it gives us the opportunity

540
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,240
to observe and correct and continuously

541
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,280
improve

542
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,600
the downside of it though is

543
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,760
the resulting confusion and disparity in

544
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,440
how individuals are protected and how

545
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,679
companies must act you know think about

546
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:01,679
the this huge shift to remote work we've

547
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:02,640
seen

548
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,480
what do you do and you're an employer

549
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,000
and you've got employees in multiple

550
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,840
states office locations in multiple

551
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,600
states the business is incorporated

552
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,799
somewhere else

553
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:12,080
you've got probably maybe even some

554
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,400
global offices how do you possibly begin

555
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,559
to manage the the different privacy

556
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:18,640
regulations in you know in a single

557
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,120
population that has unique laws that

558
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,320
apply to it

559
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,080
you know even in the consumer retail

560
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,240
space how does somebody like amazon

561
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,400
handle 50 different privacy regulations

562
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,240
for 50 different states

563
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,600
what if you're a customer and you have

564
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,960
homes in different two different states

565
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,320
and now you

566
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,320
when you buy a thing which privacy

567
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,559
regulation applies to it so i i would

568
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,000
advocate that

569
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,240
you know that this is just to give a

570
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,919
little bit of window into my my

571
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:45,679
philosophy i think this is one of the

572
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,240
rare cases where i were where i would

573
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,400
want the federal government to

574
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,799
take a position and for that position to

575
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:54,559
be largely driven by

576
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:57,120
individuals who have done like you said

577
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,880
earlier contact your your congress

578
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,000
person

579
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,679
let them know what matters to you about

580
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:03,919
privacy let them know how you're not

581
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:05,360
being served let them know how you've

582
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,880
been injured by

583
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,280
your privacy breaches

584
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,200
and and that sort of thing

585
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,480
and then maybe we can actually get

586
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,799
something that represents uh the needs

587
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,960
of a broad cross-section and doesn't

588
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,960
create undue burdens

589
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,880
for everybody to try to implement and

590
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,080
understand

591
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,080
yeah and i think that's right and i mean

592
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,080
it's you know the whole conversation in

593
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,640
congress is moribund good good thing for

594
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,960
the states that can take action but

595
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,600
it is you know the people are mobile and

596
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,360
so is their data

597
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,440
and that for that reason alone we should

598
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,559
have something that's the same

599
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:41,120
everywhere i'm i'm supposedly an expert

600
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,080
in this and i don't want to have to

601
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,600
think about it as i move from state to

602
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,480
state or buy something from through

603
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,720
amazon but the shipper is actually in

604
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,400
kentucky like i don't want to have to

605
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,760
think about it

606
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,000
you know and and and i can imagine what

607
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,400
it's like for somebody who barely who

608
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,840
knows enough about hipaa to know that

609
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,679
it's a thing and spells it wrong

610
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:00,559
right

611
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:03,200
um as opposed to being a general law

612
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,600
that applies to everyone i i i don't

613
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,679
know what will make the

614
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:09,120
will jump start the political

615
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,440
conversation perhaps it's

616
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,120
um something having to do with cyber

617
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,240
security or the other activities that

618
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,080
are occurring relative to our big social

619
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,760
media platforms and so i want to turn

620
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:20,799
there

621
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:24,640
um in uh some of our remaining time

622
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,520
um so you know the biden administration

623
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,360
has done a couple of things since coming

624
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,480
into office one is it enacted a really

625
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,200
uh what appears to be a very uh broad

626
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,799
and cross-cutting executive order on

627
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:39,280
cyber security but my take on it is that

628
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,760
it's primarily about um

629
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,000
the supply chain particularly the supply

630
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,080
chain controlled by the government which

631
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,440
makes a lot of sense given what

632
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,360
executive orders do they don't regulate

633
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,360
private conduct they tell the executive

634
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,240
branch how to execute their duties

635
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,720
um but sometimes especially in the

636
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,880
purchasing realm the way the executive

637
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,880
branch executes its duty can really have

638
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,440
a great ripple effect into the rest of

639
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,159
society and so a question has come up

640
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:08,159
that we would we really would appreciate

641
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:10,080
your insights on which is you know will

642
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,720
that executive order on cyber security

643
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,120
change anything about the we what we

644
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,280
experience as consumers and health care

645
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,200
patients or health care

646
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,000
people working in health care um from a

647
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,320
privacy and security perspective i don't

648
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:28,240
see that but maybe i'm missing something

649
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,720
yeah i mean executive orders can only do

650
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,400
so much as you pointed out right by

651
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,400
their nature and constitutional limits

652
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,840
on executive power their scope is

653
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:36,799
limited

654
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:38,240
biden can direct his agencies to

655
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,240
undertake these efforts and figure out

656
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,520
how they spend money and who they spend

657
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,559
it with but this infrastructure

658
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:46,799
hardening is going to take a ton of time

659
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,000
and money

660
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,120
whatever they don't have in the budget

661
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,200
they'll have to run through congress

662
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,679
and back your point about congress and

663
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:55,919
it's you know moribund nature

664
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:58,960
uh i don't see progress happening there

665
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,559
and with all you know

666
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:01,520
what we

667
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,200
if we do manage to spend the money i

668
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,200
think what we'll mostly see is

669
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,960
an enrichment of existing i.t

670
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,200
contractors federal i.t contractors like

671
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,720
general dynamics boozell and hamilton

672
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,039
raytheon et cetera i see these kinds of

673
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:15,039
executive orders more as a vehicle for

674
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:17,520
publicity and call to action than

675
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,559
something that actually does a whole lot

676
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:22,400
yeah you know i i'm not i'm not

677
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,400
especially bothered that

678
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,240
this order doesn't mention health or

679
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,039
health care you know it i think to the

680
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:30,720
extent that there are federal systems

681
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,679
that handle health care data you know i

682
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:35,120
guess medicare and medicaid could be

683
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,799
affected by this so if we've hardened

684
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:38,320
the infrastructure that supports those

685
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,080
services and those

686
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,640
those agencies then you know the people

687
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,240
that are using those services should

688
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,080
experience some knock-on benefit from

689
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,039
that

690
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:48,000
but

691
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,640
uh you know the the other side of it the

692
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,159
thing that scares me about executive

693
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:54,480
orders like this is that whenever the

694
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,320
government starts talking about and

695
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,240
using the language of fear which you can

696
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,080
definitely read that in in that

697
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,240
executive order the fear of you know

698
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,480
cyber attacks and all these things

699
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,480
you can expect bad things

700
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,120
um yeah when we passed the patriot act

701
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,720
and you know and all that domestic

702
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,240
surveillance that came with the patriot

703
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,159
act that's one example so i worry about

704
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:19,200
a potential expansion of that kind of

705
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,840
activity you know with like an unholy

706
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,600
alliance between the federal government

707
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,279
and network carriers

708
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:28,159
you know and trying to do things like

709
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:29,200
you know

710
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,440
go go and get get those back doors to

711
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,600
encryption methods that the the federal

712
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,440
government's been begging for for

713
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,559
decades

714
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,240
so that's that's what i see as a

715
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,880
potential downside of this kind of of

716
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,240
order and the things that might come out

717
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,600
of it

718
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,520
you know it's an interesting discussion

719
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,600
point as a person who whose data was

720
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,880
stolen by whoever hacked opm

721
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,279
um you know they they took a whole big

722
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:55,679
file i know i know exactly of mine what

723
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:57,760
they took but also many many many

724
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,559
millions of americans um you know and at

725
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:02,559
the end of the day i think the the story

726
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:04,080
in the po in the washington post which

727
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,679
has pretty good reporting in cyber

728
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:08,240
security was that you know opm

729
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,159
outsourced something that outsourced

730
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:11,600
something that outsourced it to somebody

731
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,039
else who outsourced it to china and a

732
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:14,799
backdoor got built in

733
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:17,120
um and so that all i always think about

734
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,880
the supply chain and how it basically

735
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,559
uh is a uh

736
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:24,240
something that comes into conflict with

737
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,840
the government's desire to spend as

738
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,520
little of taxpayer money as possible and

739
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,760
it's a complicated a complicated thing

740
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:33,919
good cyber security takes resources

741
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,000
yes it certainly does and that supply

742
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,200
chain i mean

743
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,360
that's you know we've seen lots of

744
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,600
supply chain attacks in the last few

745
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,360
years and that's going to continue to

746
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,679
grow especially when there's valuable

747
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:47,520
data targets out there

748
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,760
yep and and when people are you know

749
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,320
giving giving them short shrift um

750
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,919
that's almost a whole conversation for a

751
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:55,279
whole nother day

752
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:57,360
but i had a second thing i wanted to ask

753
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,039
about relative to the bite

754
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:00,480
administration so the second thing

755
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,840
they've been doing and some of the

756
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,760
states back to the trump administration

757
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,760
and the last years of the obama

758
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,760
administration as well but some of it is

759
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:11,679
new is really kind trying to look at um

760
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:15,120
the the relationship of um

761
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,600
platforms large platforms dominant

762
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,520
platforms with

763
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,000
higher volumes of data and i'll get to a

764
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,320
few of those in a second and that the

765
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,840
impact of that on competition so um

766
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,440
you know we have a new a brand new

767
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,600
caught off the press last week executive

768
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,480
order on um competition in

769
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,799
uh social media platforms really looking

770
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:38,799
at or you know the facebooks the

771
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:40,640
twitters the googles the amazons of the

772
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,480
world but even before that we had um the

773
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:48,159
hhs attempt to kind of unblock health

774
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:50,559
information that was really held by two

775
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:53,520
or three dominant ehr systems which are

776
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,360
uh from a structural standpoint

777
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,320
analogous to a google or a facebook like

778
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,240
everybody is there and that's why you go

779
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,000
there right that's the walled garden and

780
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
all that kind of stuff and so and that

781
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,919
resulted in this you know ban on

782
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:07,919
information blocking and the

783
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:10,039
governmental attempts literally since

784
00:27:10,039 --> 00:27:13,279
2015 to fortify

785
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:15,840
um the right of you and i as individuals

786
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,080
to get and control our own health data

787
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:21,600
from a holder of it so in my mind those

788
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,080
things are related because the more you

789
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,399
hoard the data the harder it is for

790
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:27,840
incumbents to

791
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,520
bring new ideas to market new

792
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,880
innovations to market of course the

793
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,799
harder it is for patients

794
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:35,039
if their data is being hoarded to you

795
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:36,880
know take the action they might want to

796
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,399
take to find another doctor or whatever

797
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:39,679
it is because it can't get their data

798
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:41,919
out of the place it is and i was

799
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:44,000
wondering if you had um sort of any

800
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,600
thoughts about

801
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,720
um whether really focusing on these

802
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,960
incredibly large data data oh i was

803
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,159
going to say one more thing and the

804
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:54,799
third thing is obviously within the big

805
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:57,039
social media platforms people do use

806
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:59,840
those to you know to talk about their

807
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,880
health their facebook is chock full of

808
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,720
um

809
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,360
uh you know groups where people are

810
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,679
providing peer support for particular

811
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:12,240
health conditions from hiv aids to

812
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,520
domestic violence to breast cancer to uh

813
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,520
veterans with ptsd it's really the whole

814
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,440
gamut and they're all kind of trapped

815
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,919
because there are no other networks that

816
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:22,799
have

817
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:25,760
that level of peer interaction you know

818
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,080
the same number of peers as it were so

819
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,399
people really feel stuck there as well

820
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:32,799
so looking at that whole big stew of the

821
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:35,039
relationship between large caches of

822
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:36,000
data

823
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,399
and the effect of that on competition

824
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:40,559
both from a business innovation

825
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:42,640
perspective that might benefit consumers

826
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,799
and from uh the perspective of consumer

827
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:46,000
empowerment

828
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,440
do you see the same kind of uh

829
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,279
issues that i see or do you have a

830
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:53,039
different perspective that you know it's

831
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:54,159
okay

832
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:56,799
how would we go about uh how and if if

833
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:58,320
it's not so great what should we do

834
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,720
about it

835
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,640
i agree completely that privacy and

836
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:08,000
competition are inextricably intertwined

837
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:08,880
you know

838
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,799
just from my own experiences you might

839
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:13,120
guess that i'm a fairly outspoken person

840
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,960
i've had my share oh gee i never would

841
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,960
have thought that

842
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,720
right

843
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,240
i i've had my share of run-ins with

844
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,080
facebook's defective in my opinion

845
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,159
content moderation system

846
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:26,320
i don't mean the algorithms only i mean

847
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,919
the people that review bad automated

848
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:29,360
decisions as well

849
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,679
and i would love nothing more than to be

850
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:33,679
able to take you know take my toys and

851
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:35,600
go home take my data from their platform

852
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,520
and take it to somewhere else you know

853
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,440
maybe miwi or some other social network

854
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,399
upstart

855
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:42,799
could build an import method so that i

856
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:44,799
could download my facebook data from

857
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:46,799
there and import it over there and then

858
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:48,960
boom now i'm kind of you know i still

859
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,279
have all my stuff

860
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:53,200
but the problem with that is the network

861
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,399
effect

862
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:57,600
i can't convince many people to migrate

863
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,520
off of facebook despite all of the

864
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,840
things that they also don't like about

865
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,640
it it is just so powerful and the force

866
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,559
of inertia keeping people in that one

867
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:07,520
place

868
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,919
makes it very very hard to to make that

869
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:11,760
kind of a move

870
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,000
so

871
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:16,960
because that

872
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,360
the competition is limited both

873
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,120
naturally by that network effect and

874
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,799
mechanically by the information service

875
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:24,640
providers like facebook

876
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,720
there is no way to migrate your data

877
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,159
from one to the other you can't migrate

878
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:30,080
your your friend network from one you

879
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,399
know service to another

880
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:34,320
consumers don't really have a way out to

881
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,159
your point these support groups that are

882
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:36,960
on

883
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,880
you know facebook or take your pick of

884
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,640
whichever network

885
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,960
it's very very difficult to to pick up

886
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,360
and move that and there's so much value

887
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,279
in those communities being able to

888
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:49,200
support each other and do all of that

889
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,039
work that

890
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:53,360
you know it feels like

891
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,840
there's a spot for the government to

892
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,760
push on this somehow

893
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,399
i'm a fan of a light touch from our

894
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:01,679
government

895
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:03,039
but there's

896
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:05,600
got to be some way to balance the the

897
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,440
property rights of service providers

898
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,039
who've built these immense platforms and

899
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:11,360
run them at incredible cost

900
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,240
and the privacy protections and maybe

901
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:17,200
portability protections for individuals

902
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,720
and thinking about hipaa you know tying

903
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,880
this back to hipaa that was originally

904
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,880
about portability right the ability to

905
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,039
move from one employer to another move

906
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:26,399
your health data move your health

907
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:28,159
coverage all that stuff

908
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:29,919
and so i think there's a pretty strong

909
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:32,399
parallel there for you know a personal

910
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:35,440
information portability regulation that

911
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,960
if if you are

912
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,240
submitting all your information and

913
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,919
getting stored in these these massive

914
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:41,360
databases

915
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,279
you ought to be able to have control

916
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:45,120
over it i think that's something that

917
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:48,320
people can all kind of agree to i think

918
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,840
if you talk to individuals they would

919
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,039
agree to that

920
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:53,039
but getting people to think about that

921
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:54,799
and care about that enough that they

922
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:56,559
would talk to their representatives

923
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:58,640
about it that's a different kind of

924
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,679
effort

925
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:01,760
yeah no i think i think that's right but

926
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,519
that that's a great segue to my next

927
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:06,640
question which is of course um hhs and

928
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,799
omc and the office for civil rights are

929
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:10,399
working on this pretty hard with this

930
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:13,039
fortification of the long-standing right

931
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:14,799
under hipaa of an individual to get a

932
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:17,440
copy of their own data and of course 20

933
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,519
years ago that meant a photocopy from a

934
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:22,000
manila folder but it's come to mean you

935
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,120
know the electronic data in the ehr

936
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,440
that um your doctor's office is storing

937
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,440
on you or in fact in this case your

938
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,880
health plan as well

939
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:34,159
and um you know the requirement that

940
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:36,080
covered entities make that data

941
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,120
available

942
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,360
when you you as a person present an app

943
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,640
to them i was actually just talking

944
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,399
about this at work yesterday

945
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:44,399
and i can tell you i will be changing

946
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:46,480
doctors in uh january changing health

947
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,480
systems and i plan on taking all my data

948
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,919
with me if i can

949
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:51,919
depending on how hard it is um but i was

950
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:53,919
wondering i know you're aware of that

951
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:55,519
what are your plans are you gonna are

952
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:57,519
you gonna get your data and put it you

953
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:00,000
know on your files at home or pull it

954
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,320
into your apple um health kit or

955
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,320
whatever your own personal phr is you're

956
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:07,678
gonna take advantage of your right

957
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,240
to whatever extent i need to you know

958
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,480
i'll say i'm i'm blessed with generally

959
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,399
very good health so i have what i would

960
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:17,279
say is fairly limited you know phi

961
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:18,880
hanging out out there in various

962
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,320
databases

963
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,880
so you know for me i don't

964
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,799
i don't typically experience difficulty

965
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:27,039
with getting that data from the doctor's

966
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:29,039
offices or hospitals or whoever when i

967
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:31,600
when i need it but that's also because i

968
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,559
know about these rights and i am able to

969
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:36,559
as an outspoken person be a strong

970
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:38,240
advocate for myself with the house

971
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,360
health system

972
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,200
that's not something that everybody

973
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,640
is blessed with

974
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,200
right you know but all that said like i

975
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,919
think the requirement that phi be made

976
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:49,760
available electronically and

977
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,679
transferable to personal health app is

978
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:52,720
great

979
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:55,440
i think going back to the the commentary

980
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,640
about

981
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,279
portability and

982
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:02,720
competition and privacy and security

983
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,600
you know

984
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,440
there have to be some pretty strong

985
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,279
controls and

986
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:09,599
i think pretty significant penalties in

987
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:11,839
place available for those personal

988
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:14,320
health apps you know if those become

989
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,560
pretty rich targets again for cyber

990
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,639
security threat actors

991
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:21,280
and so where where that data

992
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,040
consolidates

993
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,599
it becomes an interesting target

994
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:26,719
it might

995
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:28,320
it might have the opposite effect if

996
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,079
there's an explosion of personal health

997
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:33,040
apps then maybe that distribution of the

998
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,599
data across you know dozens of

999
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:37,918
of different systems and databases and

1000
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:39,280
applications

1001
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,440
means that there's never as much of a

1002
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,639
single big important interesting target

1003
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:45,760
you know that that might be an

1004
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,679
interesting effect

1005
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:50,079
sort of like blockchain but for real

1006
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:51,199
um

1007
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:53,760
sorry i'm a cynic about but yeah

1008
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,079
you know i understand and also it could

1009
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:58,320
be in in our dream world that if there's

1010
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,119
an explosion of competition in the space

1011
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:03,359
of people helping you as an individual

1012
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:04,960
manager health data that there will be

1013
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,440
competition on privacy i mean it might

1014
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,680
be that it turns into pay for privacy

1015
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:10,960
but it also

1016
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:11,920
could be

1017
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,079
just

1018
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:14,880
right

1019
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,680
rising tide of privacy in in in the way

1020
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,440
these apps function that's that's for

1021
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,480
sure

1022
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,240
um well we're coming up to the end of

1023
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,000
our time i have one last question for

1024
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,240
you which is here we are we're making

1025
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,680
this recording for the biohacking

1026
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,480
village at defcon if you had one thing

1027
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,400
about hipaa that you want your audience

1028
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,079
to take away with them today what would

1029
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:36,320
it be

1030
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:40,320
uh the big thing really is

1031
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,680
hipaa is about more than just your

1032
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,119
privacy

1033
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:47,839
a key thing that i think everybody needs

1034
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:49,440
to know about it and we talked about it

1035
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,880
a little bit already is that right of

1036
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,000
access

1037
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,320
the ability for you the patient to

1038
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:57,040
always have the right to receive your

1039
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:00,000
health information is so important

1040
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,359
for you to be able to advocate for

1041
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:04,160
yourself um you know you have to be able

1042
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,079
to see what your records say you might

1043
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:08,000
need to audit them and correct things

1044
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,680
that aren't accurate because not

1045
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:10,960
everything is perfect in the health

1046
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,880
system and

1047
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,119
you know the ability to then share that

1048
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:17,200
data with other providers that might not

1049
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,880
be connected with

1050
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,480
you know the insurer that you're working

1051
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,560
with or might be in it you know

1052
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,560
a specialty provider in another state

1053
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,240
and it's difficult for them to interact

1054
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:29,119
with your provider directly you know i

1055
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:30,480
have friends who

1056
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,720
i've counseled about this where they're

1057
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,720
having terrible time you know they're

1058
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,640
they've got complex health problems that

1059
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,160
they're trying to navigate

1060
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,800
and they're having difficulty getting

1061
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,520
their data delivered from you know like

1062
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:44,960
the imaging

1063
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,000
provider

1064
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,320
hasn't been able to send imaging over to

1065
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,760
their specialist

1066
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,560
right

1067
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,359
yeah

1068
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:53,440
so for me like

1069
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,200
yeah well different formats different

1070
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,960
applications different systems i mean

1071
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,560
that's all it's all hard right you go to

1072
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,920
you go to the imaging place and they had

1073
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,920
you with a cd and it's like what am i

1074
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,000
going to do with this right

1075
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,599
well you know imaging is weird so the

1076
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:07,040
other

1077
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,640
i was just gonna say imaging is a weird

1078
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:12,000
one because in fact the radiology

1079
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,839
centers are usually using storing it in

1080
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:15,040
the cloud and they could just give you a

1081
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,520
credential

1082
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:18,960
right they don't actually have to give

1083
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,800
you the cd they could give you a

1084
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,920
credential or they could give a

1085
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,839
credential to the person you want to

1086
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:25,599
have read the image it doesn't have to

1087
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:27,359
be a cd but that's like a whole nother

1088
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:29,359
problem yeah

1089
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:31,440
did hipaa scare them off from being able

1090
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,839
to do that were all of the the scary

1091
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:35,599
regulations and things something that

1092
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:37,200
made them say well no i have to do this

1093
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,440
in this like maximally secure way and a

1094
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,359
cd nobody could ever intercept that you

1095
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:42,079
know

1096
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:44,000
i don't know i that's one of the myths i

1097
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,599
never got to bust but it's definitely

1098
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:47,440
i've looked at it myself for my own

1099
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,720
radiology like why don't you just give

1100
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,160
me a credential to your cloud and i'll

1101
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,480
go look at it

1102
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,000
right

1103
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,079
and then beyond that the other thing

1104
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:58,720
changing in that right of access is a

1105
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:01,599
new requirement to go to 15 days instead

1106
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:04,079
of 30 for the delivery of those records

1107
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:05,920
so that's really key to

1108
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:09,040
you know when when you're trying to get

1109
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:09,920
something

1110
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,839
you know when you have a health problem

1111
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:14,480
time is of the essence and you know you

1112
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,400
can't be waiting on providers to send

1113
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,760
data back and forth to each other

1114
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,280
sometimes you have to take it into your

1115
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,200
own hands to acquire that data and move

1116
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,960
it to them yourself

1117
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,960
and so i think again just right of

1118
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,599
access everybody should go go visit the

1119
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:30,640
hhs.gov website search for hipaa right

1120
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,800
of access read about your provider's

1121
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,720
obligations understand what they have to

1122
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,560
do and and what they're not allowed to

1123
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:37,359
do

1124
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:39,200
and make sure that you're able to

1125
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,560
advocate for yourself in the health

1126
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,440
system

1127
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,040
there's also hot tip there are actually

1128
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,040
some really great videos live action

1129
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,440
videos that are on the ocr's youtube

1130
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,520
channel and you can uh put the links on

1131
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:50,960
your phone and then you can just play

1132
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,400
them in the doctor's office for the

1133
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,040
receptionist

1134
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,240
even better

1135
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,920
i know having having written the check

1136
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,240
for those videos uh we had a lot of fun

1137
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,400
making those well we were we are kind of

1138
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,599
at time and i'm really glad to have been

1139
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:07,119
able to do this i want to give you a

1140
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:09,280
chance to ask me a question if you want

1141
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,119
i kind of live out loud and people know

1142
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:12,960
who i am but if there's anything i can

1143
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,440
answer for you i'd be happy to

1144
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,280
any questions that you want to put on

1145
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:20,000
out on the table

1146
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,079
i guess what do you what do you think is

1147
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:23,040
going to be

1148
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,320
the

1149
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,880
evolution of things over the next decade

1150
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,040
in

1151
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,960
health i.t you know where where are we

1152
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,400
really going to go i mean there's stuff

1153
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,400
starting to happen now you know systems

1154
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,920
are getting more interoperable and all

1155
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,920
that does that just kind of continue

1156
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,520
does that accelerate

1157
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,400
uh

1158
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,520
what do you what do you see happening

1159
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,480
there

1160
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,839
i mean i've i've been working in this

1161
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:45,440
space for a long time and i definitely

1162
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:48,560
see that the digital technology has um

1163
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:51,119
really enabled a convergence

1164
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:53,599
of economic sectors that used to operate

1165
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:55,040
pretty separately

1166
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:57,040
and they're converging at kind of at a

1167
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,440
business to business level

1168
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,760
the thing i don't know is that back to

1169
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,599
sort of more abundant consumer privacy

1170
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:05,280
law i think that they will

1171
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,240
um

1172
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,800
we will never really get the value of

1173
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:12,800
that from a uh an economic learning and

1174
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,640
improving our society

1175
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,359
uh

1176
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:18,160
perspective until we can make sure that

1177
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,160
consumers feel 100

1178
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,240
secure or far more secure than they feel

1179
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,640
now about how data about them is being

1180
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:27,040
used because the consumer mistrust will

1181
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,160
erode

1182
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:31,359
the ability of the digital technology to

1183
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:32,400
innovate

1184
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,079
it's it'll be like a little like the

1185
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:35,440
tide coming in and out right there's

1186
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,359
always a wave in but there's always the

1187
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:38,960
undertow pulling back

1188
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,960
um so that's what i would really like to

1189
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,200
see solved i would really like to see

1190
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,440
a world in which consumers feel a lot

1191
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,119
more confidence

1192
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:48,960
both about what's happening specifically

1193
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,800
with information collected in the health

1194
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,560
information system so technically

1195
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:55,200
subject to hipaa right now but also

1196
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,119
information that is some people call

1197
00:40:57,119 --> 00:40:59,280
health adjacent information's about your

1198
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,599
health but is being exposed about you in

1199
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:03,599
the rest of your life in facebook in

1200
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:06,079
your amazon shopping in your google

1201
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:06,960
search

1202
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,119
um you know in your in your personal

1203
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:10,960
social media posts wherever you post

1204
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,960
your your own status your flu tracking

1205
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,400
and all that kind of stuff so that

1206
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,800
people feel that they can contribute

1207
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,839
knowledge without

1208
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:21,440
actually having it harm them that's

1209
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,599
where i want to go is people to be more

1210
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:25,680
confident about contributing knowledge

1211
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:26,960
that they're not going to be harmed when

1212
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,720
they do that so that's why i hope that's

1213
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,240
where i hope we go that's why i get up

1214
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:33,440
every morning and keep working at it

1215
