1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:03,199
hi i'm sunil yu and i'm the creator of

2
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:05,359
the cyber defense matrix the cyber

3
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:07,120
defense matrix is a model that i created

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,120
to help navigate the cyber security

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,800
landscape and i think it has some

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,400
applicability for some of the challenges

7
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,559
that we see in healthcare

8
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:15,920
a little bit about me before we get

9
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:16,880
started

10
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,800
so i'm currently the cso and head of

11
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,439
research at jupiter 1. jupiter 1 is a

12
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:23,920
startup that is building a cloud-native

13
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,920
cyber asset management and governance

14
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,599
solution

15
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:29,519
before jupiter 1 i was the chief

16
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,679
security scientist at bank of america

17
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:34,239
and while there i had the opportunity to

18
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:36,239
serve in a couple different roles

19
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:37,920
one of them was to be a mad scientist

20
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,320
where i had a chance to build a lot of

21
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,280
interesting and new crazy capabilities

22
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,120
aside from building capabilities i also

23
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,320
was the

24
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,440
main person that was in charge of

25
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,680
looking at new startups and testing

26
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,840
those capabilities to see whether or not

27
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,039
all the claims that they make actually

28
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:56,559
whether they actually work

29
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:58,640
and then lastly i was i had a chance to

30
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,800
be a red team lead lead where i got a

31
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,960
chance to break a lot of things

32
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,240
now in my role as a product evaluator of

33
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,000
a lot of different startups

34
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,680
i faced a

35
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,000
an immediate challenge which was just

36
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,439
trying to dissect through all the

37
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,520
buzzwords that they throw at me to

38
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,000
understand one what they do and two to

39
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,360
see whether or not it actually meets the

40
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,200
need that i have

41
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,200
well one of the one of the

42
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,880
responsibilities i had as the chief

43
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,040
security scientist was to

44
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,040
develop the technology roadmap for the

45
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,880
organization

46
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,240
well to be able to do that you have to

47
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,960
understand where you have gaps right

48
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,880
but when you just stare at a bunch of

49
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,439
buzzwords like you see here it's hard to

50
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:42,240
find a gap because what you see is all

51
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,360
there is

52
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,280
if i were to ask you what's missing out

53
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,280
of here you would have a hard time just

54
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,119
because

55
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:51,119
it requires you to have to dissect every

56
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,360
word here and understand what what might

57
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,720
be missing

58
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,719
so i needed a better more structured

59
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:59,520
approach and as a as

60
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,200
in my attempt to come up with a more

61
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,560
structured approach

62
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,640
i came up with again something i call

63
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,719
the cyber defense matrix the cyber

64
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,878
defense matrix uh

65
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:12,080
at its core consists of two dimensions

66
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,239
on one dimension it's the things that i

67
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,120
care about these five asset classes

68
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,120
devices applications networks data and

69
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,560
users

70
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,319
on the other dimension it's the five

71
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,239
functions of the nist cybersecurity

72
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:28,480
framework identify

73
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,519
protect detect respond and recover

74
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,599
when we bring these two dimensions into

75
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,440
a 5x5 grid

76
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,280
we get what i call the cyber defense

77
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,640
matrix

78
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,879
and the cyber defense matrix provides a

79
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,400
50 000 foot strategic view of the entire

80
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,640
cyber security landscape it provides a

81
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,800
view that helps us understand where we

82
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,959
might have gaps in our program where we

83
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:52,640
need to go

84
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,720
where some of the where our capabilities

85
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,760
fall

86
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,599
all the things that we need to do to run

87
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:00,239
a mature and robust cyber security

88
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:01,360
program

89
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,440
what you also see on the bottom is

90
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,879
something that

91
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:07,840
i've conjecture or assert

92
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,760
depicts the degree of dependency that we

93
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,400
have on people process and technology as

94
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,400
we go across the five functions of the

95
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,480
net cybersecurity framework

96
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,440
so

97
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,720
when it comes to the functions of

98
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,959
identify and protect we should largely

99
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:23,280
rely upon technology to do the work

100
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,200
there as we move to detect respond and

101
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,319
recover what i have found is that

102
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,480
despite whatever technologies that come

103
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,200
our way we still have a very

104
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,120
we're heavily dependent upon

105
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,760
people to do a lot of the work on the

106
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,239
right side of boom boom by the way is

107
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,239
between protect and detect and on the

108
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,720
right side of boom it tends to be that

109
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,200
we need people to do a lot of the work

110
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,480
there

111
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,280
throughout all five functions we have a

112
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,519
equal amount of dependence on process

113
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,200
meaning we always have a need for

114
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,799
process throughout

115
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:58,239
all of five functions it's not something

116
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,840
that we should disregard

117
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,120
so

118
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,799
to be able to test the cyber defense

119
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,720
matrix then i would want to take all

120
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,040
those buzzwords that we saw previously

121
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,560
and see whether or not i could find a

122
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,400
home for each one of these buzzwords

123
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,120
right and for uh for the most part i was

124
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,120
able to do that i was able to take a lot

125
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,279
of those buzzwords and fit them in

126
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:22,160
and in doing so i can see for example

127
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,400
what the buzzwords mean

128
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,400
in relation to the function and the

129
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,560
asset class where it's trying to perform

130
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,960
some security function it also allows me

131
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,440
to see adjacencies it lets me see gaps

132
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,000
as well potentially in the marketplace

133
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,700
now just because there's a word in

134
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,040
[Music]

135
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,880
one of these boxes doesn't necessarily

136
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,040
mean that all the the individual

137
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,080
functions within

138
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,199
[Music]

139
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,280
the five functions of the subsequent

140
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,440
framework are actually being performed

141
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,160
so

142
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,400
again it's a 50 000 foot view and as you

143
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,360
get lower into the 25 000 and ten

144
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,840
thousand and five thousand for view

145
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,240
um as you see more granularity and start

146
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,800
seeing more tactical view of the

147
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,600
landscape uh we'll see more gaps emerge

148
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,520
just because uh there's only so much you

149
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,479
can see

150
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,280
at this sort of scale

151
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,840
now the cyber defense matrix

152
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,840
i wanted to find an easy way to put it

153
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,520
into practice or help people put it into

154
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,000
practice so i came up with an approach

155
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,320
that i call the stack

156
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,400
and the stack uh

157
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,280
is

158
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,479
i use

159
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,639
a food analogy when describing the stack

160
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,720
because well we all have to eat food so

161
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,320
hopefully it's something that everyone

162
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,600
can relate to

163
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,000
the stack uses the cyber defense matrix

164
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,520
as a foundation

165
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,759
and then we what we are going to do is

166
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,039
to

167
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,759
to map various layers

168
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,000
and these layers consist of different

169
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,680
parts of how we

170
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,479
make food okay so the first layer is a

171
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:51,520
recipe

172
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,120
these are proven practices these are

173
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,800
frameworks these are

174
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,039
architectures that we have to abide by

175
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:58,880
and this represents the things that we

176
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,479
have to do

177
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:01,759
the kind of requirements that we have to

178
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:04,639
meet to to have a robust cybersecurity

179
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:05,759
environment

180
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,639
the next layer is our pantry basically

181
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,360
what do you have today in your existing

182
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,520
portfolio capabilities that can help

183
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,319
secure your environment

184
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,560
the third layer is the market so what

185
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,000
can you find in the grocery store what

186
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,759
can what's available from vendors to

187
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:23,199
help you

188
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,120
meet to to

189
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,800
fulfill the recipe that you're trying to

190
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,880
try to make

191
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,400
now we can't

192
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,319
not everyone can eat every kind of food

193
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,440
likewise within a business

194
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,520
not everyone can

195
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,840
adhere to all the security controls that

196
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,800
we want to

197
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,759
implement

198
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,160
so we have to somehow capture business

199
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,560
constraints and exceptions and things

200
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,039
that will cause impact to the business

201
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:51,280
and so these allergies is something that

202
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,960
we also want to capture in the matrix as

203
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,639
well

204
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:56,000
and then lastly we want to capture

205
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,080
nutritional needs and this represents

206
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,080
the risks that we see in our environment

207
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,000
the attack surfaces the threats the

208
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,240
vulnerabilities that uh

209
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,960
can potentially harm us

210
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,720
and the combination of these then is

211
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,440
what i call the stack

212
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,840
what we're going to do is to

213
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,440
map each of these different layers to

214
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,199
the cyber defense matrix and i'll show

215
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,880
you how we might go about doing that

216
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:22,880
in doing so we should be able to answer

217
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,720
these three questions

218
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,720
how secure are we

219
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,479
and to answer that question we would

220
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:31,120
look at our existing capabilities

221
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,280
next how secure should we be and here

222
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,759
we're looking at proven practices plus

223
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,560
the risks that we have to address

224
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,479
and then lastly how do we get there and

225
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,000
for this we're going to look at what's

226
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,800
available in the market plus be mindful

227
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,160
of the constraints that we have to deal

228
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,400
with

229
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,160
and my hope is that we can take this

230
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,759
approach

231
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,360
i've used this approach for enterprise

232
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,199
security but my hope is that we can use

233
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,120
a similar type of approach to help us

234
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,400
address some of the challenges that we

235
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,198
see in healthcare

236
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:02,720
so first

237
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,960
let's look at our pantry

238
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,560
now if you're trying to do enterprise

239
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,720
security there's a lot of capabilities

240
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,120
that are at our disposal

241
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,479
unfortunately though i think when it

242
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,160
comes to healthcare many of those

243
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,479
capabilities don't exist and so

244
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:17,440
we

245
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,360
have to be mindful that our pantry may

246
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,479
be a little bit more thin for healthcare

247
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,479
and and also just understanding what's

248
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:25,840
available for the enterprise security

249
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,479
market gives us a template if you will

250
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:30,639
to say hey why why don't we have some of

251
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,039
these capabilities for healthcare let's

252
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,559
find investment to be able to build some

253
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,760
of these capabilities out

254
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,679
so capturing the existing capabilities

255
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,919
um that's that's a representation of how

256
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,360
secure we are

257
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,399
let's now move to the proven practices

258
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,560
one of the ways that

259
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,480
proven practices are articulated is

260
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,040
through the cis controls

261
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,760
as a version seven actually they already

262
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,839
map directly to the cyber defense matrix

263
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,839
so if you look at version seven and the

264
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:03,680
more recently released version eight

265
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,120
you'll see that there's actually already

266
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,519
a mapping to the cyber defense matrix

267
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,320
i'm not a healthcare expert and

268
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,080
i haven't worked in healthcare before

269
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:12,959
but

270
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,279
i'm not sure to what degree the cis

271
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:18,000
controls can apply to

272
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,920
healthcare environments but i suspect

273
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,760
that a good amount of it can overlap or

274
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,200
can be applied

275
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,279
in those environments so um but

276
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:27,120
nonetheless i think it's important to

277
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,640
recognize that not everything is going

278
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,800
to fit exactly but

279
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,120
the cis controls at least is a starting

280
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,320
point to be able to say here are

281
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,399
controls that we we can implement but

282
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,240
not only that here's a here's a set of

283
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,680
controls that we can implement in a

284
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,000
certain priority order so

285
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,600
we should do number one first before we

286
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,519
do number two number two before we do

287
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,519
number three and so on so forth

288
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,120
um so anyway the cis controls provides

289
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,519
an example of how we take this notion of

290
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,600
recipes and map it directly to the cyber

291
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,920
defense matrix again the

292
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,680
cis has already mapped it to the matrix

293
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,240
so the work's already been done for you

294
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,920
and this gives you a sense of the

295
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,959
controls that you would need to

296
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:06,880
implement for each of these boxes as

297
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,160
well as the priority order that you

298
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,640
would follow

299
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,839
so we've captured existing capabilities

300
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:16,399
we've captured proven practices

301
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,000
and to be able to answer the rest of the

302
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
question on how secure we should be

303
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,399
let's also look at risks

304
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,640
and to that end the cyber defense matrix

305
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,959
provides a a way that we can actually

306
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,240
visualize

307
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,800
um our risk and attack surfaces and

308
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,399
vulnerabilities and so on and so forth

309
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,000
so here's an example of how we can look

310
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,839
at attack surfaces

311
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,839
if i look at a traditional three three

312
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:40,000
tier web application there's a lot that

313
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
i need to secure i need to secure the

314
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,519
server i need to secure the application

315
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,600
i need to secure the network i still

316
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,279
need to secure the data

317
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,880
and when we consider

318
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,560
all that i need to secure and the attack

319
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,760
surface is associated with it

320
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,040
we can see that there's a lot of

321
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,959
controls that are needed

322
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:58,720
compare that to let's say a serverless

323
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,680
function

324
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,880
where

325
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,360
i can remove much of my attack surface

326
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,360
or at least transition the risks

327
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,120
associated with that to the provider

328
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,360
that's providing this ribulous function

329
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,600
but ultimately it gives me a visual

330
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,040
depiction of

331
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,040
of a path that i want to encourage

332
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,360
others to take which is i want to move

333
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,560
from uh this traditional 3d architecture

334
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,480
to one that actually has a reduced

335
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,480
attack surface and the reduced attack

336
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,880
surface is something that gives us an

337
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,640
opportunity to be more secure because

338
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,079
we're building on

339
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:32,000
more defensible infrastructure that has

340
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,760
fewer attack surfaces

341
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,120
just being able to visualize this i

342
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,560
think is a powerful

343
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,839
way to

344
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:38,640
help

345
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,600
our partners and stakeholders move to

346
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,480
more defensible infrastructure overall

347
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,399
and it allows us to understand again

348
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:49,120
what controls can be maybe needed to be

349
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,120
able to address some of the risks that

350
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,200
we see

351
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,040
another mapping that i'm sure you guys

352
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,279
are another

353
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,040
mechanism another tool that i'm sure

354
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,320
many of you all familiar with is the

355
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,480
miter attack framework that

356
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,800
characterizes a lot of the ttps that we

357
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,240
see attackers

358
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,839
following

359
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:09,839
and if we look closely at the mitre

360
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:11,839
attack framework

361
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:14,320
you'll see that there's also

362
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,040
specific asset classes that are

363
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,440
represented in the ttps so not

364
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,440
everything

365
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,079
or many of the ttps that you see in the

366
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:26,160
mitre attack framework tend to be device

367
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,000
oriented attacking things like your

368
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,760
workstation and windows and so on and so

369
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,720
forth

370
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,600
but there are other ttps in the attack

371
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,160
framework that map to an attack against

372
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,560
an application or attack against a

373
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,000
network or data or users

374
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,079
within each of the ttps there's also

375
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:46,320
additional information in terms of

376
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,480
how would you find these attacks how

377
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,399
would you know that an attack occurred

378
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,560
or one of these ttps

379
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,800
were used and so it captures information

380
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,040
like what data sources you need it also

381
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,800
captures information on what protective

382
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,320
mitigations you might want to put in

383
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,160
place and if you're not familiar with

384
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,440
the cyber analytic repository or car

385
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,240
car that mitre that org

386
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,040
it also provides the analytic approach

387
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,279
or method the logic to be able to look

388
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:15,040
for these attacks within one's

389
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,240
environment

390
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,760
and what i've done here is to be able to

391
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,079
just map each of those different types

392
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:22,480
of information to the different asset

393
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,760
classes that are within the cyber

394
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,560
defense matrix

395
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,800
so

396
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,320
that maps

397
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,360
the

398
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,279
the attack surfaces and the risks that

399
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,279
we see in our environment

400
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:36,720
and to be able to characterize how

401
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,399
secure we should be

402
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,160
lastly we want to understand how do we

403
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,279
get there

404
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,279
and to that to that end let's look at

405
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,360
market capabilities so what sort of

406
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,120
vendors are out there

407
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,279
now i i tried to do my best here to

408
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:52,399
find

409
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,720
vendors that are specialized towards the

410
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,560
healthcare market

411
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,959
and it seemed relatively small

412
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:00,000
now

413
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,519
again i don't know the mint market as

414
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:04,639
well um and so if i make a mistake here

415
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,320
or if i left somebody up you know please

416
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,320
forgive me i'm not endorsing any of

417
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,480
these vendors in fact the ones that you

418
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,720
see here are really based on how easily

419
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:17,120
i could find their logo so um uh yeah

420
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,720
i'm sure i'm missing plenty of vendors

421
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,680
out there

422
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,600
and the mapping itself again

423
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,160
is based on what i could dissect in the

424
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,680
marketing language that i see in the

425
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,160
vendor website but nonetheless i think

426
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,839
overall you can still see that there's

427
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:32,240
interesting concentrations and gaps as

428
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,560
well uh and some interesting conver

429
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,639
concentrations in that there's a ton of

430
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:39,600
companies that are helping to identify

431
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,120
uh the presence of medical devices but a

432
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,040
lot of the other places are a bit weaker

433
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,839
in terms of uh being able to uh perform

434
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:49,120
the various functions that you see in

435
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,639
the in the

436
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,560
in the separate defense matrix by the

437
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,880
way uh also if there's plenty of vendors

438
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,880
who will come to me and say hey no i do

439
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,480
x y and z

440
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,760
there's a distinction that i want to

441
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,920
make between i do something versus i

442
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,000
support something so

443
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,800
there are capabilities where

444
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,360
a particular vendor will definitively do

445
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,560
something

446
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,160
associated with let's say identifying

447
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,320
devices but oftentimes they may not

448
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,880
necessarily protect them rather they

449
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,279
will enable something else to protect

450
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:21,040
that device

451
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,000
and so it requires a bit of

452
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
synthesizing or just dissecting the

453
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,839
wording of the um

454
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:29,759
the marketing details

455
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,079
but that that's an important facet of

456
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:33,360
understanding how to use this matrix

457
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,839
properly to understand the primary

458
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:37,519
function of a

459
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,120
particular vendor product and a

460
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,759
secondary one the secondary one

461
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:43,519
or a second order function tends to

462
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:46,079
require another first order capability

463
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:47,920
to be in place and that's something that

464
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,560
the cyber defense matrix also helps us

465
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,399
understand and navigate as well

466
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,880
so that's the market capabilities

467
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,160
and then

468
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,959
lastly we want to understand constraints

469
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,320
and to that end

470
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,839
um

471
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,639
if we had our own way we could pro if

472
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,880
security folks could have our own way we

473
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,720
might want to actually implement i think

474
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,079
we may want to implement all these

475
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:14,240
controls that we have available to us

476
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,199
but

477
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:16,959
that may not necessarily be the most

478
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:19,519
wise or cost efficient

479
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:21,279
a lot of people look at the cyber

480
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,920
defense matrix as a bingo card

481
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,079
you can see why that's the case

482
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:28,399
but our goal in security isn't always to

483
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:29,920
play blackout

484
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,160
we we don't necessarily need to

485
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,079
check all the boxes on here what we want

486
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:35,600
to be able to do is to be able to

487
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,959
declare bingo

488
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:37,920
by

489
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,480
filling in just enough boxes that

490
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,040
satisfy satisfies our risk tolerance for

491
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,199
them for the environment

492
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:46,720
and oftentimes

493
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,240
some of these boxes we may not be able

494
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,480
to check because they

495
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,000
create some sort of business impact

496
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,160
there's some sort of allergy associated

497
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:54,880
with

498
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,800
implementing a certain control here or

499
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,399
there

500
00:16:58,399 --> 00:16:59,839
to be able to capture that uh

501
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:01,920
systematically the cyber defense matrix

502
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,759
again provides a great organizing

503
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:05,439
framework to be able to

504
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:06,480
see

505
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,559
what controls

506
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:12,720
we have but also where we have

507
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,319
where we need to consider

508
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,559
the the business impact that may come

509
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:17,919
from implementing a certain set of

510
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:19,280
controls

511
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,199
in certain environments we may have no

512
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:22,880
constraints at all so for example in a

513
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,079
call center

514
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,839
we can implement whatever controls we

515
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,679
want but again like i said we may not

516
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,280
want to because

517
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,240
it's expensive and for for the

518
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,280
particular environment that we're

519
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,640
dealing with

520
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,240
we may be willing to accept some degree

521
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,280
of risk um and not have to implement

522
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,039
every possible control that even even if

523
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:42,320
we could implement every possible

524
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,160
control uh it just may not be cost

525
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,080
effective based on the

526
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,520
risk exposure that we might have

527
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,880
in other cases

528
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,799
we may not be able to

529
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,160
implement a sufficient amount of

530
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,000
security controls because it creates a

531
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,600
business some some degree of business

532
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,600
impact and ultimately what we want to be

533
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,320
able to do is to uh have a systematic

534
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,559
mechanism where we can capture

535
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:07,200
those conflicts those uh trade-offs this

536
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,960
risk those risk management tradeoffs

537
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,559
where we're saying

538
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,160
uh we're willing to

539
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,880
to forego a certain set of security

540
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,200
controls even though we want to

541
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,799
uh implement them or need to implement

542
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:20,240
them because it's going to create some

543
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,520
business impact or alternatively uh when

544
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,760
we implement a certain set of security

545
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,280
controls that does create business

546
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,960
impact at least we're knowing we're

547
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,400
doing it knowing that it's going to

548
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,640
create some business impact and we've

549
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,799
negotiated that and discussed that with

550
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,960
other stakeholders where they're willing

551
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,160
to accept that business impact as well

552
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,080
an example of this in the financial

553
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,360
services environment would be something

554
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,720
like uh

555
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,320
high-speed trading so

556
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,760
um

557
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,760
high-speed trading if you put a firewall

558
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,880
in there you might as well close

559
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,200
business because um

560
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,799
it's all predicated on being able to get

561
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:57,520
information very quickly and so uh we

562
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,600
may have a security requirement to put a

563
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,240
firewall in place but we we know that

564
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,600
that's going to create some

565
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,280
significant business impact and so we

566
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,280
forego the use of the firewall but there

567
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,120
may be other compensating controls or

568
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,120
other mitigating controls what we want

569
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,880
to be able to do systematically as a

570
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,720
community is to be able to capture these

571
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,000
constraints for these different types of

572
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,160
user environments or different types of

573
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,240
business environments and be able to say

574
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,080
okay consider

575
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,799
uh there are alternative design patterns

576
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:30,640
that helps us still increase the

577
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,880
security posture or address the security

578
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,320
challenges that we might have for that

579
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,160
particular environment without creating

580
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,240
business impact i'm sure that um you

581
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,919
and pretty much every organization you

582
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:43,280
have some sort of sales and marketing

583
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,799
team where you have some set of

584
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:47,520
developers or analysts um

585
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,840
we oftentimes are recreating the wheel

586
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,160
every time as we learn how to work

587
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,320
within these environments by creating a

588
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,679
set of controls

589
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:58,480
without creating distance impact the the

590
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,640
this understanding and this this

591
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,240
these design patterns that we come up

592
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,039
with

593
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:04,640
what i'm hoping we can do with the cyber

594
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,880
defense matrix is to find a way to

595
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,320
to

596
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,159
consistently capture in these design

597
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:12,000
patterns and these things that we learn

598
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,840
so that we don't have to always keep

599
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,080
recreating it and also be able to

600
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:20,360
improve upon it over time as well

601
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,280
so now i've mapped each of these layers

602
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,520
to the cyber defense matrix

603
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,559
and in doing so we can now see how each

604
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:30,320
of these layers can help us answer the

605
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,799
question of how secure are we

606
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,400
how secure should we be and how do we

607
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,679
get there

608
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:37,039
and what we want to do is to then

609
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:40,159
combine these five layers

610
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:42,320
and in doing so

611
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,559
we can actually understand our overall

612
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,799
decision space and the range of risk

613
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:48,559
management options that we have in front

614
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:49,679
of us

615
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:51,360
so

616
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,280
in combining these we can then say there

617
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,640
are a couple areas for example um right

618
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,679
here

619
00:20:57,679 --> 00:20:58,640
where

620
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,880
it may be just table stakes adjust to it

621
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,880
sort of opportunity so in this

622
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,600
particular situation right here we have

623
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,720
a

624
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,240
proven practice that we know we should

625
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,280
implement

626
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,640
there are commercial capabilities

627
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,320
available

628
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,840
there's an active

629
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,480
risk issue that's here but we just don't

630
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,000
have any existing capabilities and

631
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,600
there's no business constraints that

632
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,000
limit our ability to implement a control

633
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,520
so that will be a situation where we

634
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,120
could just do it there's no nothing

635
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,200
really stopping us

636
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,720
conversely

637
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,480
let's look at this situation over here

638
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,559
where uh it's a similar sort of

639
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:34,080
circumstance

640
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,080
with a proven practice with commercial

641
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,000
capabilities available with

642
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,559
an active risk here as well but there is

643
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,159
a mission constraint or some business

644
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:44,320
constraint and so in those situations

645
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,520
what we want to be able to do is to

646
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,080
recognize that

647
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,840
that there is some business impact that

648
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,240
may occur if you implement some control

649
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,480
um but ultimately it's a discussion that

650
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,559
we need to have with the business to say

651
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:58,159
do we want to

652
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:01,520
address this issue

653
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,600
do we want to forego it and accept the

654
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,520
risk associated with it are there other

655
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,520
opportunities to mitigate that control

656
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:11,960
by putting in controls elsewhere

657
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,919
all right

658
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:15,520
now um

659
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,039
what i've showed you is

660
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:19,840
the uh these five layers uh is a

661
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,240
starting point for how i look at uh

662
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,760
using the cyber defense matrix but we

663
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,760
can go beyond even in capturing

664
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,640
additional information that

665
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,679
helps us

666
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:31,520
further develop and mature our security

667
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:35,360
program so think of the initial

668
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,360
five things that we talked about before

669
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,640
as

670
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,559
creating the food right

671
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,320
now it's a question of how good does it

672
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,520
taste

673
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,240
or

674
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,120
how cost effective is it

675
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,799
and so what we want to be able to do is

676
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:50,720
capture measurements here

677
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,720
as i mentioned earlier the cyber defense

678
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,520
matrix is a great organizing construct

679
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,760
and we can organize lots of interesting

680
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,120
information

681
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,120
into the matrix here and so here's an

682
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,640
example of how we can

683
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,280
organize for example the the metrics and

684
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,960
measurements that we have associated

685
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,880
with our program as well as how much

686
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,320
we're spending

687
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,600
associated with each of the different

688
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,200
buckets or each of the different

689
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,280
capabilities that we see in the cyber

690
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,280
defense matrix what i'm showing here is

691
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,280
just a range of different things that we

692
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,600
could potentially capture and organize

693
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,360
into the cyber defense matrix

694
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,799
measurement is a really hard challenge

695
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:26,320
for many of us

696
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,320
and i would offer there's a couple

697
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,600
different levels of measurement that we

698
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,600
can use to

699
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,000
to capture to understand our security

700
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,080
program and then subsequently be able to

701
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,120
capture it

702
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,480
some of the measurements are easier some

703
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,880
of them are harder um

704
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,880
easier ones are going to be just do we

705
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,799
even have the capability at all that we

706
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:46,720
have a firewall for example

707
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,159
um it's like saying that we have a

708
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:49,600
vaccine

709
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,360
the next level will be

710
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,760
is the firewall turned on okay has has

711
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,440
we have we actually opened the vaccine

712
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,480
vial

713
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,559
the next one would be um

714
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:00,480
are we actually turning on the features

715
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,640
associated with the firewall so

716
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,039
number two can be yes we have a firewall

717
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:08,000
but it's just it hasn't any any rule uh

718
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,520
number three would be we've actually put

719
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,880
in specific acls into the firewall

720
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,720
and number four is well okay great you

721
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,320
have a firewall you have some product

722
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,840
you have some capability how well does

723
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,679
it actually work in in dealing with the

724
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,520
threats that we see

725
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,880
and then lastly

726
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,360
um is a cost uh

727
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,080
we

728
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,400
introduce cost which is ultimately

729
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,919
how cost effective is it uh relative to

730
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:34,480
the security benefit that we're getting

731
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,919
each of these different

732
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:37,360
there's again different levels of

733
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,919
difficulty in getting these values

734
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:42,080
and i don't expect any organization to

735
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,880
have all these values but we oftentimes

736
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,240
have some of these values but don't

737
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,480
really have a great home for it and what

738
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,159
i will propose is that the cyber defense

739
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:52,320
matrix at least provides us a place to

740
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,400
organize this information put it in a

741
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,720
place where we can see it relative to

742
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,039
other bits of information and just be

743
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:02,000
able to methodically uh improve upon

744
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,919
uh what we already have today once it's

745
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:07,200
organized in this fashion

746
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,640
now the cyber defense matrix um

747
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,640
i've just showed you really just a small

748
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,480
handful of

749
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,679
use cases

750
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:18,000
my original use case as i mentioned was

751
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,760
just a map then there's

752
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,159
but back in 2016 i showed a whole bunch

753
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:24,080
of other use cases

754
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,559
which i'm not really presenting here but

755
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:28,159
if you wanted to dig further into some

756
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:29,760
of these feel free to look at the link

757
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,120
here and you'll see some of the use

758
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,559
cases that

759
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:35,039
that i presented then

760
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:37,120
and in 2019 i gave an update to that as

761
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,840
well with a ton of other use cases

762
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,200
at this point in time i have roughly

763
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,000
about 50 some use cases

764
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:44,799
which

765
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:46,720
will take me too long to go through in

766
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,320
this session but nonetheless it's a rich

767
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,799
it's a very

768
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:56,720
interesting framework that we can use to

769
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,880
understand our space better and to be

770
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,080
able to find ways that we can

771
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,919
improve the security posture of our of

772
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:06,080
our environment as i mentioned i use

773
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,000
this at the bank of america i've used it

774
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,840
since then to be able to understand the

775
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,840
space better and to

776
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,600
create new use cases i think it has a

777
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,440
lot of applicability for health care

778
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,000
especially since um where some of the

779
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,360
problems that we're seeing

780
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,520
in healthcare we've already addressed in

781
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,200
the enterprise security space the

782
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,799
enterprise security space in fact

783
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:26,799
provides a template for what the

784
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:27,919
healthcare

785
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,400
side needs to also address as well so

786
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,240
why not use what we learned and the

787
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,760
structures and the

788
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,000
approaches and

789
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,400
understand how that can be used to help

790
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,240
guide investment and areas for

791
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,960
investigation

792
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,600
and with that

793
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,919
if you have any additional questions or

794
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:49,360
want to get additional information about

795
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,960
the cyber defense matrix here's how to

796
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:54,240
contact me and i hope that

797
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,240
you find the cyber defense matrix useful

798
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,679
if you have any use cases that you come

799
00:26:57,679 --> 00:26:59,279
up with or you wanted to offer any

800
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:01,840
feedback on what you saw please please

801
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,520
feel free to reach out and thank you

802
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,679
very much
