00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,240
hello everyone and thank you for joining

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,120
me today in the session about the cti

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,600
league i call this session watching the

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,519
watchmen because

5
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:12,880
first i really like comics and i really

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,360
really admire the watchmen comics but

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,199
second i think that

8
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,240
this is the question of the cti league

9
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,600
who watched the watchmen who saved the

10
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,400
people that protect in our lives

11
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,439
who

12
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:29,679
take care of the people that

13
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:32,079
taking care of our life this is really

14
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:34,320
really important and today we are going

15
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,680
to speak about the cti league about the

16
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,320
effort of us and how we are trying to

17
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,360
make a safer cyberspace for the medical

18
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,840
sector and a little bit about cyber

19
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,000
intelligence

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,719
we will start with an introduction for

21
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:53,760
the cti league about our mission and how

22
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,559
we are trying to achieve this mission

23
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:59,359
then we are going to speak about cyber

24
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,039
threat intelligence on the matter of the

25
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,080
threat actors the organization focused

26
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,280
in the

27
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,920
unknown world of the intelligence and a

28
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,760
little bit about

29
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,280
what is the future for the cti league

30
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,080

moreover i'm a cti researcher cyber

36
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,720
threat intelligence researcher mainly

37
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,280
focus on threat hunting and intelligence

38
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,000
for the past 10 years i'm doing that and

39
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,240
focus on learning how to make

40
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,400
intelligence better

41
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,439
the cti live founded in the first wave

42
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:45,280
of covered in march 2020 by me alongside

43
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,079
with nate warfield mark rogers and chris

44
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:49,280
myers

45
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,000
we started as an organization that tried

46
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,640
to neutralize cyber threats looking to

47
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,119
exploit the coordinating pandemic and

48
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,439
today we are more focused on the

49
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:02,719
healthcare sector in general

50
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,719
we are non-profit organization

51
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:06,560
all volunteer land

52
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,440
it means that for the first time there

53
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,319
is an organization that based and

54
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:15,120
derived by its community that based on

55
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,360
the community and the members of the

56
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,080
community the volunteers have the right

57
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,959
to say hey i think we should do

58
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,840
something differently

59
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,920
our members are from all around the

60
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,680
world in the past

61
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,800
one year and six months of operating we

62
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,840
had more than

63
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:39,040
1500 members across industry cti

64
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,440
researchers form an intelligence company

65
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,840
from intelligence companies from the

66
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,200
infosec industry but not only from any

67
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,280
organization that can support our

68
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,239
mission from all around the world around

69
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,560
80 countries

70
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,200
including countries that i as an israeli

71
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,640
can't go to

72
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,440
including law enforcement organization

73
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,239
and agencies from all around the world

74
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,239
let's take a look on our volunteering

75
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,080
map you can see that

76
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,720
almost every continent is representing

77
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,920
in the league

78
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,800
and

79
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,840
more importantly we can achieve

80
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,400
greater result by breaking the silos and

81
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,879
barriers between countries this is what

82
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,080
we believe in

83
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,959
therefore we developed the open cell

84
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:27,440
model it's a community model for the

85
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,599
first time we want to build

86
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:32,159
not a national cells that protect

87
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,959
hospitals lifetime and organization and

88
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,599
medical sector in general we want to

89
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:40,799
build an organization a cert in the

90
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,400
derived by its community by the people

91
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,040
that share with us their time their

92
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,560
skills their capabilities anything

93
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,760
we believe that if they share it with us

94
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,720
and share it with the league basically

95
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,360
we need to give back and give back is

96
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,400
the right to speak and to say hey

97
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,760
i think

98
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,000
that we need to do something differently

99
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,280
and we are part of a trend walter and

100
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,680
and i really really like it of course

101
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,880
for good like other organizations as the

102
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,918
biological village as trace labs we are

103
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:21,600
trying to do

104
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,240
better thing with austin

105
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,560
currently we are not connected to any

106
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,520
hospital in the world but we can make

107
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,160
large impact for them today i'm going to

108
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,080
share with you how we are trying to make

109
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,240
this impact

110
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,000
in order to understand that we need to

111
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,080
speak about the mission so the city

112
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,880
league mission as i said before was to

113
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,639
neutralize cyber threats looking to

114
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,759
exploit the copy 19 pandemic

115
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,759
today our mission is

116
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,720
larger within uptick of the attacks

117
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,120
against the medical sector hospitals in

118
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,840
particular during this year

119
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,960
we saw how vulnerable they are

120
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,680
and therefore we want to be there for

121
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,160
them not only during coverage of course

122
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,199
in kovid it's an emergency it's a world

123
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,919
crisis and someone need to protect them

124
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:15,120
but a ransomware that attacks hospital

125
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,759
it's not something that we can say okay

126
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,000
this is fine in regular days which is

127
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,080
which are not days of pandemic

128
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,560
we have to be there for them we spoke

129
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,479
with so many citizens from all around

130
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:30,080
the globe and some of them told us

131
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,880
unbelievable equations that they needed

132
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,759
to make one of them for example from

133
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,160
israel told me that the boat of the

134
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,199
hospital told him that if he wants to

135
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:42,000
build

136
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,919
stock department

137
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:45,680
in the hospital

138
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,080
he need to choose between

139
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,600
purchasing

140
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,800
beds for er department or to building

141
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,840
the soft

142
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,800
no cso no manager need to make this

143
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,520
decision their mission is to protect

144
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,880
people to save lives to give therapy

145
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,199
our mission is to create safer

146
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,400
cyberspace for the medical sector and

147
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,919
any life-saving organization of course

148
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:13,840
we focus on the segment of the

149
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,919
stakeholders the organizations that

150
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:18,000
can't really protect themselves they

151
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
don't have the budget they don't have

152
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
the skills they don't have the knowledge

153
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,120
of the

154
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,520
they are not capable to do it and we

155
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,840
believe that this is

156
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,600
the greatest mission

157
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,880
that we chose to protect the people that

158
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,080
watch us to watch the watchmen

159
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,720
in order to achieve this mission we

160
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,039
develop the three layer of protection

161
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:42,479
methods

162
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,400
the first layer is prevention

163
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,520
prevention is like wearing a mask

164
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,800
trying to reduce the level of threat for

165
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,720
any organization

166
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,440
and i would we do that by supplying for

167
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,599
example reliable information regarding

168
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:59,759
cyber attacks not only we're going to

169
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,720
discuss about this mainly today

170
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,280
in the future we hope to train medical

171
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,599
organizations from all around the world

172
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:09,520
how to protect themselves from cyber

173
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,400
attacks how to overcome cyber attack

174
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,440
and of course the supporting phase what

175
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,240
do you do if your organization was

176
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,800
already targeted or attacked or there is

177
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,120
a data leak from the organization we

178
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,759
want to support cyber capabilities with

179
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:28,560
guidance and technical advisors we want

180
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,039
to mitigate attack and help them to

181
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:34,080
mitigate the attacks and in special

182
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,120
cases

183
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,280
like the coordinated october attack

184
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,360
against u.s hospitals

185
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,319
we will build operations or intervention

186
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:45,919
team to help them to exceed the maximum

187
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,280
impact we can make on these

188
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,280
organizations

189
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,000
but

190
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,840
as i said we wish to be assert

191
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,319
so if we want to be a servant we need to

192
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,680
make something more radical and in order

193
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,360
to do that we developed the third layer

194
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,879
of the protection which is

195
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,680
neutralization it's not only reducing

196
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,000
the level of threat with masks or going

197
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,319
to the doc to the doctor for therapy

198
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:11,440
it's

199
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,639
vaccine

200
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,160
how to cut from the root the threats

201
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,800
how to disrupt the ability to conduct

202
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,800
the criminal activities

203
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,639
we escalate information for law

204
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,400
enforcement organizations that have

205
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,560
mentioned before from all around the

206
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,560
world hopefully

207
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,479
they will make the further step and we

208
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,958
know they already did we had

209
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:35,279
amazing collaboration with them and in

210
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:38,958
some cases we found the personnel that

211
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:41,120
executed the attack

212
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,640
with that we can make the biggest impact

213
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,880
for the organization without even

214
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,720
talking with them

215
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,920
but today i want to focus mainly on the

216
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,080
prevention aspect

217
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,240
we are going to do that we are speaking

218
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,600
about cyber threat intelligence so let's

219
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,040
start with

220
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,920
some intelligence point of view

221
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,720
for

222
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,680
me as an israeli former soldier in the

223
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,279
israeli army

224
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:12,399
everything is divided to three so

225
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,959
if i try to summarize the points of view

226
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,440
of intelligence we can take a look on

227
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,440
the matter of cyber of course we can

228
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,399
take a look of three main aspects or

229
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:23,760
points of view

230
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,800
the first one is the three attractor

231
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,680
searching information about the threat

232
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,160
act of specifically

233
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,440
the second one

234
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,240
is

235
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,480
on the matter of the organization the

236
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,120
victim the sector it doesn't matter but

237
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,600
we are not trying to find information

238
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,839
about a specific threat actor we are

239
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,320
trying to find information that enable

240
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,959
us protect specific organizations or

241
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:52,000
specific sectors or to learn more about

242
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,160
an attack that happened in the sector so

243
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,200
we can say okay if something happened to

244
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,279
this organization it's going to be

245
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,839
reflected to other organizations

246
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:04,240
the term for the few which is the

247
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,040
unknown it's like likely in the style

248
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,839
you know that is there but no one knows

249
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:11,839
a lot about it this is really

250
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,880
challenging and in the following minutes

251
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,600
we're going to discuss about each part

252
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,560
of this point of view and we're going to

253
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,200
see how the cti really trying to make

254
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,000
the impact to find the information that

255
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,360
enable us

256
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,600
to share it with the organization and

257
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,360
enable the organization

258
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,120
prevent cyber attacks

259
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,160
if they would prevent the cyber attack

260
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,279
they would be

261
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,200
more protected

262
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,360
and then they can give

263
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,800
more good therapies from any people that

264
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,519
go into the hospital

265
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,600
the question that we need to ask when we

266
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,959
are working on cyber intelligence or any

267
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:56,240
other type of intelligence is fishing or

268
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,360
hunting

269
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,560
by fishing

270
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,560
we spread nets in a lake in the ocean in

271
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,720
something that we are familiar with and

272
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,680
we believe that there are fishes though

273
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,480
but

274
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,160
we don't

275
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,680
focus on specific fish we can say okay

276
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,640
the probability of this fish in the same

277
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,600
spot is really high so we are going to

278
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,440
spread the net and we are going to try

279
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,560
to find

280
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,800
anything that we are trying to but we

281
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,640
can focus on a specific threat

282
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,800
because it's hard it's really really

283
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,399
hard you can you know trying to find and

284
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:38,720
hunt like in hunting the specific threat

285
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,200
every type of intelligence have the pros

286
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,399
and cons

287
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,720
and in the city i live we are doing the

288
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,480
both

289
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,680
aspects

290
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,639
we are spreading the nets and also and

291
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,240
for the information

292
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,959
so let's start with the threat atos the

293
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,519
main aspects of cyber threat

294
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:59,519
intelligence

295
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,800
who targets the healthcare sector

296
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,720
is it the aptly the

297
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,320
nation-state-sponsored

298
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,760
attackers

299
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,480
is it the e-crime the financial

300
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,200
attackers that want to make profits from

301
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,480
cyber attack is the activist

302
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,680
sadly

303
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,959
it's everyone

304
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:22,160
from north korea and iran the apt is to

305
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,519
the e crime as we saw in the coordinate

306
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,200
attack on hospitals in the u.s or as we

307
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,160
see

308
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,440
almost weekly about hospitals from all

309
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,000
around the world that were infected by

310
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,440
ransomware

311
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,160
we saw some activists trying to leak

312
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,839
data and so this information operations

313
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:46,959
so if we ask is only the shouts the

314
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:49,839
largest fish in the ocean

315
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:51,920
not except the whales of course but the

316
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,760
largest fish in the ocean

317
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,639
no

318
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,160
it's everyone

319
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,160
so another question that we need to ask

320
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:58,880
is

321
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,399
why they target the healthcare sector

322
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:03,680
because

323
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,120
at first

324
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,680
it wouldn't make sense for me at all

325
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,639
i thought every country in the world

326
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:12,959
has its own hospitals

327
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,839
so they know that hospitals are in

328
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:19,360
charge of people life of therapy

329
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,839
in days of pandemic for example like

330
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:23,279
countries

331
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,040
like iran

332
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,279
know how challenging

333
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:31,600
this time is so why to attack hospitals

334
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,399
this makes it so tricky

335
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:35,760
my

336
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,079
feel when we

337
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:40,160
developed the cti league when we first

338
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,600
established the league that the staining

339
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,160
that happened in one high in the uk

340
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,399
hospitals for example the slow motion of

341
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:51,519
the therapies is going to happen again

342
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:54,320
and we saw that it happened

343
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,160
someone died

344
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,880
in september not directly because of the

345
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,880
ransomware but the delay of in a

346
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,079
hospital

347
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:06,639
make it really really challenging

348
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:09,680
so we don't have a case now that someone

349
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,279
died directly because a

350
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:16,560
cyber attack but it affects people if it

351
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,000
slows down the therapies if it

352
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,399
disables some therapies like

353
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,800
mris or some

354
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,680
other therapies it can affect people it

355
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,680
can cause death

356
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,399
so

357
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,279
what can we do about it and

358
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,760
let's share some insights

359
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,800
today i want to focus on two main threat

360
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,079
actors not apts

361
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:45,120
i'm going to speak about the ransomware

362
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,760
and the initial access workers

363
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,639
these

364
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,760
two actors are really really relevant

365
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,839
for the medical sector for the public

366
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:56,639
health sector and any other life-saving

367
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:58,160
organization

368
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,880
let's start with ransomware

369
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,800
in the darkness report that we've shown

370
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,040
february the early darknet report we

371
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,160
explained why the cti league prioritized

372
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,519
ransomware

373
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:12,320
we said that we see the uptick the

374
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,760
increasing

375
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,800
of the attacks from ransomware against

376
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,480
hospitals

377
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,320
some ransomware group like maize

378
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,839
declared in the beginning of the

379
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,199
pandemic that

380
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:25,680
they are not going to attack hospitals

381
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,079
that was false claiming

382
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:29,600
they did

383
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,000
a lot of groups did

384
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,880
and for example we learned that a cancer

385
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,800
center that was a victim of a ransomware

386
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,399
was so impacted by this attack so the

387
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,399
staff and the patients

388
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,680
needed to try to make the therapies the

389
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,920
treatment rebuilding it

390
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,639
from memory this is something that we

391
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:56,000
can't accept as the infosec community we

392
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,199
can't accept that some criminals will

393
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:02,560
make this impact on people's lives it's

394
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,120
not a fair game between countries it's

395
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,680
not a fair game between people it's not

396
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,399
about

397
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,759
spying or espionaging on

398
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:14,480
something that's related to the country

399
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,279
this is against stable people

400
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:19,279
it's not okay

401
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:22,560
so here some insights that we learn from

402
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,800
the efforts of the darknet team

403
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,120
before that some words about the darknet

404
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,839
team the city league dark is an amazing

405
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:31,920
collaboration between people from all

406
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,560
around the world professional and expert

407
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,040
in the darkness domain that also focus

408
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,399
on ransomware

409
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,759
led by

410
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:42,000
really good people that also

411
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,720
helped me to build this presentation and

412
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,839
i will acknowledge them uh afterwards

413
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:50,399
and these are some of the insights that

414
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:53,040
we found you can also find

415
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,000
this insights and more in our website

416
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,160
cti-league.com

417
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,959
in the dartmouth report

418
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:04,160
so we found that the main variants the

419
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,599
main ransomware groups in 2020 that

420
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:10,480
targeted hospitals were conti

421
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,400
males networker ryouk and evil

422
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,359
they are not alone a lot of ransomware

423
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:21,199
groups attacks targeted hospitals during

424
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:24,160
this one year and six months since we

425
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,079
invented the league

426
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:29,200
but these are the main variants

427
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,760
in some cases it doesn't matter if they

428
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,120
are sophisticated they are really clever

429
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,000
they know how to execute the most

430
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,559
brilliant attack in the world because we

431
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,280
saw ransomware group like dark side make

432
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,720
a huge impact on the us

433
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,160
and here some data about with what we

434
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,039
found in the last quarter of 2020 and

435
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,960
it's really important

436
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,799
18 publicly reported ransomware

437
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:00,480
on hospitals

438
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,080
were shared

439
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,200
in the last quarter of 2020

440
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,080
but

441
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,720
23 victims

442
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,600
their data was leaked online

443
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,400
so

444
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,440
there are more attacks that not reported

445
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,480
publicly and it's important no one wants

446
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,400
his personal data or

447
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,520
medical data to be shared online

448
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,080
it can affect the people that the data

449
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,600
was left but also it

450
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,760
destroyed the

451
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,799
resilience of the hospital to overcome

452
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,720
this turmoil

453
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,760
you know when someone is shell private

454
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,320
data from hospital people can take a

455
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,000
look at this hospital and say

456
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,480
this hospital is not secure enough this

457
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,440
hospital not protect my data

458
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,000
i'm not going to believe this hospital

459
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,080
i'm not going to go to this hospital

460
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,039
again

461
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:58,400
and this can cause undermining of the

462
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,400
authorities

463
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,880
with and this is a cycle that we can't

464
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,679
enter now the disinformation of covetous

465
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:07,760
we learn from our disinformation team in

466
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,440
the city i live

467
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,320
it's so large that we can't accept

468
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,640
someone that

469
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,200
harming the resilience of the

470
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,880
organization

471
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,400
and 24

472
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,080
we may they're made up over 35

473
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,640
of all attacks against the article

474
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,480
system and since then guess what it only

475
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,000
increased

476
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,280
it means that more and more threat atos

477
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:39,039
focusing on the healthcare system

478
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:41,280
they want to attack them no matter if

479
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,080
they are in charge of our life no matter

480
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,200
if they

481
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,080
also have some therapies in hospitals

482
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,120
they attack not only hospitals the

483
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,640
healthcare system

484
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,919
in general the public health healthcare

485
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:58,160
of course as i said the cti league focus

486
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,160
on the hospitals that can protect

487
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,720
themselves but we want to learn

488
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,760
about any attack because then

489
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,400
the implication of it can be shared with

490
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,880
another hospital and maybe prevent the

491
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,320
next attack

492
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,120
and

493
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,760
last but not least rdp

494
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,000
as the ransomware attack vector

495
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,760
significantly rose compared to 2019

496
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,799
this lead me to the next threat actor

497
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:27,360
the initial access brokers

498
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,600
so for those of you that never heard

499
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,120
about the iab the initial accessbook

500
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,440
let's define them

501
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,679
visual access broker is someone that

502
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,159
gains access into a victim network and

503
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:42,960
then selling that access to the highest

504
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,559
bidder it can be one actor or it can be

505
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:50,480
more so if we saw before that rdp as a

506
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,600
ransomware vector significantly rose

507
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,960
these people

508
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,919
are the people that in charge of selling

509
00:20:57,919 --> 00:20:59,120
out fees

510
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,480
this is the map from the dartmouth

511
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,159
report that shared the presence of

512
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:03,280
attacks

513
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,520
of the initial access brokerage shared

514
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,720
in 2020 as you can see the majority

515
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,640
attacked north america but it's a world

516
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,080
epidemic

517
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,200
a lot of threat actors now use the data

518
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,520
of the initial access broker

519
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,039
it's a ripple effect

520
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:22,159
they hack

521
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:24,960
they compromise for example rdp

522
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,200
as the main vector of the initial access

523
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,320
broker

524
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,200
and then they sell it online here is an

525
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,720
example for that

526
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,480
they sell it online for the highest

527
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,480
bidder the ist builder can be a

528
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,720
ransomware group that

529
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,039
doesn't necessarily need to have skill

530
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:42,720
of exploitation

531
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,360
they do it for them and then

532
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,000
they can sell it for the ice to be there

533
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,240
the ransomware can use it they can lift

534
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,360
the data

535
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,799
all the cycle all these ripple effects

536
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:59,200
effect on our life someone need to

537
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,360
gather information about it

538
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,400
and say first of all here's the you see

539
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,440
as simple as that block the iocs we had

540
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,000
a conversation back in april 2020 with

541
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,120
some sales from europe and one of them

542
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,559
told me that they don't know how to

543
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:17,120
digest information for missed so we

544
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,679
created the github of the cta league

545
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:22,080
with block list and a loud list think

546
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,960
that as that anything that we can share

547
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,360
the information deliver it

548
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,000
we develop sticks and miss of course

549
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,400
take tax and missed to share it and in

550
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,120
the future i really hope to have

551
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,480
complete intelligence cycle for them

552
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,400
so if we know the blc's the behavioral

553
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,520
ifcs and the iocs and we know the main

554
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,679
vectors that the initial access box

555
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:50,400
operates we can share the data about

556
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,720
these threat actors these specific

557
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,039
threat actors with

558
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:57,039
law enforcement organizations

559
00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:00,159
or with the hospitals the medical sector

560
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:03,039
and other life-saving organizations and

561
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:06,840
what happened reduce the level of stress

562
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:11,200
the awareness of any type of attack is

563
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,880
the first step of every prevention

564
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,679
if we want the mission of us is to

565
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:19,520
create safer cyberspace for these

566
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,120
organizations

567
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,760
we should start with giving them the

568
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,960
knowledge

569
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,760
first these are the threat actors that

570
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,400
we know that want to target you

571
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,679
block

572
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:34,480
block it make sure that you are covered

573
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,760
from tip to toe if the rdp station is

574
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,679
the main vector

575
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:43,440
focus on that monitor it

576
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,880
but not only

577
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,600
we can't look only on threat actors

578
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,559
because then we can spread the other

579
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:52,159
wolves the nets

580
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:54,880
of the transactors we can learn about

581
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,679
them

582
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:58,159
but if we are looking only on the threat

583
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:00,720
actors that we're familiar with

584
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,440
we are going to miss a lot of attacks so

585
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,679
we need to make sure that

586
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:06,760
unlike the

587
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,720
organizations we focus on the

588
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,640
organization make sure they are

589
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,000
protected enough regardless any type of

590
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,520
attack

591
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,240
so how can we protect an organization

592
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,159
without any access to it as i said

593
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,720
before we are part of the world trend of

594
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,919
austin for good and we are not connected

595
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:28,720
to any hospital and they share the data

596
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,840
with us well not a software server

597
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,159
this is the challenge

598
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:36,480
if we spoke about the main vector of

599
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,640
attack remote access

600
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,159
why don't we

601
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:41,279
monitor

602
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:44,880
some vulnerabilities or some open rdp

603
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,360
for example share it with the

604
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,000
stakeholders with the organizations that

605
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,240
need and want

606
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,799
our help and we can help them

607
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:57,200
and then reducing the level of threat

608
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,880
regardless of a specific threat actor

609
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,279
i'm going to present two type of

610
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:05,679
intelligence that we gather in the city

611
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:07,120
a living shelter

612
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,120
first of all the prevention aspect is

613
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,360
protecting the gates of the organization

614
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,600
if we spoke about remote access and we

615
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,840
spoke before about vulnerabilities the

616
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,000
importance of vulnerabilities we need to

617
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,039
find it

618
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:21,360
so i'll get to the data i want to

619
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,480
emphasize the importance of discovering

620
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,840
one days

621
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,039
in

622
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:28,480
your system

623
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,000
this is very very important because

624
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,760
there are threat tattoos

625
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:35,919
apts e-crime activism anyone that can

626
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:38,320
exploit it in days

627
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,440
maybe

628
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,480
from

629
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,480
the moment that someone shared the one

630
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,760
day

631
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,919
then for the exploitation it's going to

632
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:46,720
be

633
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,159
minutes hours days but the organization

634
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:53,279
response is going to be so low

635
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:55,200
and we need to alert them so we

636
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,919
prioritize critical vulnerabilities and

637
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:00,799
we prioritize some vectors that we learn

638
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:04,159
that are very very very risky and make

639
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:06,480
the organization very vulnerable

640
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,799
we created a monitoring system on that

641
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:11,440
and i want to start with say special

642
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,679
kudus to show them that enable the

643
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:14,960
system

644
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,520
alongside with good people we develop

645
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,919
the system that monitor on that

646
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:20,960
and

647
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,559
then we can

648
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:25,600
find a vulnerability validate it

649
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,440
share the notification to the

650
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,679
organization if we have connection with

651
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:31,919
the organization if not we can share it

652
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:34,000
with the law enforcement organization in

653
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,799
some cases in their language it means

654
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:39,360
that if we send a message for for

655
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,919
example for the thai cell that we really

656
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:44,640
really really

657
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,799
love the connection with them because we

658
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:48,320
really believe this is a prominent

659
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:52,080
connection between the city ali and nsl

660
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,159
really really really far away from the

661
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:56,159
critical mass of this league that which

662
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:57,440
is in the us

663
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,840
so we can send it in thai language and

664
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,799
then they can just forward it to the

665
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:04,799
organization to the hospital to the

666
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:09,039
vaccine company that need this alert

667
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:10,960
and they can make it

668
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,880
as fast as they can

669
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,919
because we translate it to the language

670
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:18,159
let's take a look on the data

671
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:20,399
before i make this presentation

672
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:24,000
i checked how many notifications we sent

673
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,679
only in july

674
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:28,559
in july we sent more than

675
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:30,559
550

676
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:32,320
notifications

677
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,840
now

678
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,320
consider that we are opening for one

679
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,279
year and five months almost six

680
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:41,520
how many vulnerabilities how many

681
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,200
critical

682
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,480
vulnerabilities whether they are cves or

683
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,760
human vulnerabilities like open rdp how

684
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,799
many we found how many we sent and how

685
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:56,480
many organizations can be protected more

686
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,559
the level of threat reduced

687
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:00,240
significantly

688
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,000
because

689
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,159
organizations patched

690
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:06,559
and if we can help them

691
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:07,679
this is

692
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:09,600
our main mission

693
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:13,840
so you can take a look of cve

694
00:28:14,279 --> 00:28:17,240
2018.0708 for example

695
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:22,480
338 alerts only in july 2021

696
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,320
well law enforcement organization

697
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:27,440
receiver alerts daily basis

698
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,919
anytime that we found it and it passed

699
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:31,760
the validation process

700
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,679
to all around the globe and this is

701
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:36,720
really important to us we believe that

702
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,520
we can work together as one unit no

703
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,600
matter what your country no matter what

704
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,679
your place no matter what you believe

705
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:46,000
your political agenda

706
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,039
working together collaboration is the

707
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:52,080
key to make impact because one attack

708
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,200
that

709
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,880
the uk suffered

710
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,880
can be returned in

711
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,279
any other country in the world so if we

712
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,760
learn the insights

713
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,559
from this attack we can give

714
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:07,600
recommendation for any other

715
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,360
organization in the world

716
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,440
this is what we are trying to do with

717
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,679
the collaboration within the city i live

718
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:15,520
with promoting and encouraging the

719
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,039
collaboration

720
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:19,440
of course we make friends and of course

721
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:22,159
we make a lot of impact for the people

722
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:25,039
that volunteering but mainly we can make

723
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:28,159
a huge impact for the organization as

724
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:30,720
salt and this is only on the prevention

725
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,320
level

726
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:35,360
so if we spoke about collaboration

727
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,440
let's talk about another organization

728
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,000
that helped us in the monitoring system

729
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,399
0bs and we want to talk ma to thank

730
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:45,440
marcus for this details

731
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,600
the obs monitoring system they call it

732
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,159
infrastructure team slash notification

733
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:53,520
connected to 16 cells worldwide 21 2

734
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,799
socks worldwide they prioritize 95

735
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:58,720
critical vulnerabilities

736
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,559
and they send

737
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:03,840
on behalf of the cti league more than 2

738
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:07,880
000 notification since we created league

739
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:11,520
61 millions more than 61 million ips

740
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,880
reported

741
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,520
by zlbs to the league and from the

742
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:19,520
league to anyone this collaboration and

743
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,520
more collaborations like this

744
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,279
are very important

745
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,600
if you want to make impact

746
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,880
this is the key

747
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,440
the obs and other companies that

748
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,559
exist in the league has the data

749
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:35,039
in most cases because no one pays for

750
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:38,080
that and i understand it on the mba in

751
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,799
the university i know the importance of

752
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:43,200
have the business plan you can share the

753
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,159
data

754
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:45,919
really and this is what we are trying to

755
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:46,720
do

756
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,159
we are trying to

757
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:50,399
encourage the collaboration and make

758
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:53,760
safe and trustful platform for people to

759
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,600
share their data

760
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:59,279
and then we can use this data together

761
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:01,600
to make the impact of the hospitals so i

762
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,080
want to say again thank you for xerobias

763
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,000
both for the data and for the amazing

764
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,080
collaboration in one year and six months

765
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,080
remediation

766
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,360
is the key

767
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:16,960
so if we take all the data

768
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,120
both on the threat actors and the

769
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,880
organization

770
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,640
now let's speak about

771
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,679
some actual medals that any organization

772
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:26,880
can take

773
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,799
if we speak about intelligence we need

774
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:30,799
to understand the lack

775
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:33,519
of the information that we have we don't

776
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:36,480
know everything and then therefore we

777
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,840
don't know for

778
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,159
a lot of zero days that exist we don't

779
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:44,000
know for any type of attack any ttp

780
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,640
even if we look at the mitral attack we

781
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,799
can see that every time more and more

782
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:51,519
reports came out and

783
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:52,880
we have

784
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,679
new methods to attack so if we have the

785
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:58,840
sense that no one is 100

786
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:01,600
protect and we know that

787
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,960
we know that we need to make some errors

788
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,120
so the first matter is to connect to

789
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:10,240
yourself and your local authorities

790
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,279
make the low rich barriers it means that

791
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:16,240
if you got attacked by a ransomware and

792
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,480
you need someone to call

793
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,720
you don't you don't start to search and

794
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,519
do all this process from the beginning

795
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:25,919
you have already someone to reach and

796
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:27,600
say hey

797
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,480
call it by name i got attacked no dear

798
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,120
cell this is the first time i'm calling

799
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,000
you

800
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:34,799
and

801
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:36,799
my name is

802
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:40,159
from hospital x and now i need your help

803
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:42,960
make these connections collaboration and

804
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,200
working with people is the key for

805
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,880
succeeding

806
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,200
prepare for the attack make strong

807
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,200
password to a phase protecting the other

808
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,440
piece restrict access gear or

809
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,120
dislocation for example

810
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,960
we've talked about some of the measures

811
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,519
before and we are trying in the

812
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,440
supporting layer

813
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,760
to guide and advise

814
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,559
any organization that we work with how

815
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:09,679
to protect better so the organization

816
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:12,880
have to be protected as you can it's not

817
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:16,720
going to be 100 protected of course but

818
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,600
make it highest as you can

819
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,559
but

820
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:22,640
know your weakness

821
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,600
know

822
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,320
when you can't protect and what do you

823
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:29,679
do about it for example if you have some

824
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:31,360
antique

825
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,240
work

826
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:36,559
workflow or you have some machines from

827
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:38,640
i don't know from the 90s if you're

828
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,679
using

829
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:40,880
some

830
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,039
windows xp for example

831
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:44,720
there are so many critical

832
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,360
vulnerabilities about it there are so

833
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:50,240
many critical vulnerabilities exposed

834
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,440
yearly and every time it's like double

835
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,279
the number or more

836
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:56,640
so know

837
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,440
what are you your weaknesses and know

838
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,640
how to take care of it no one is 100

839
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,279
protect even if you building the tallest

840
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:07,200
wall

841
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,040
that cover your city

842
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,359
but if someone will dig

843
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:13,679
in your soil and get into the city like

844
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:16,719
that or if you know the story about you

845
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:18,079
know the

846
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:20,560
i guess the green the greek force

847
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,480
this is something that you need to

848
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,159
consider so

849
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:26,560
connect yourself prepare for the attack

850
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,760
of what you know that you can protect

851
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,440
know your weaknesses

852
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,760
take care of the human factor

853
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,599
your users

854
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:37,918
your employees need to know

855
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:41,199
better not only use strong password and

856
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:44,639
use to say explain them directionally

857
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:47,760
remember that they are not people

858
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,399
experts in the cyber domain you need to

859
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:53,918
explain the end point behind any steps

860
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:57,839
the importance and not the policy alone

861
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:00,880
if you said to them do not connect your

862
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,440
phone to the computer

863
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,520
it's not some policy that you need to

864
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,880
take care of it

865
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,920
there is a rationale behind it explain

866
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:13,040
how it can effect on the system on the

867
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:16,640
network how they can enter malwares into

868
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,400
the network

869
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,760
by explaining them by communicate with

870
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,960
them by working together as one you need

871
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,520
to protect the organization you make

872
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:30,480
them the first soldiers that protect the

873
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,400
organization you reduce the immune

874
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,880
factor you never going to believe if you

875
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,359
check the numbers how important the

876
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:39,520
human factor and how critical human

877
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:43,200
factor in any cyber attack

878
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,760
they can protect you from any decoy

879
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,440
document for example

880
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:50,000
if they know not download

881
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,079
they have documents that send to them in

882
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:54,800
emailing still patient campaign and not

883
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,160
to press

884
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,560
immediately the enable contact

885
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,200
you made a lot of change you reduce the

886
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,440
level of threat to your organization

887
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,240
and

888
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:08,000
without the last parties have a plan

889
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
any cyber attack is a thermal whether

890
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,560
it's small cyber attack

891
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,800
like a defacement attack

892
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,440
or largest the largest attack that you

893
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,920
can ever imagine like the leave the

894
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,960
kerem's evil attack or swallowing

895
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,400
every plane

896
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,800
every organization that get into the

897
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,280
cyber attack with a plan

898
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:32,480
can succeed to overcome the turmoil we

899
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:35,200
learnt it for example in the october

900
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,640
coordinated attack against u.s hospitals

901
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,760
a lot a few hospitals were attacked in

902
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:46,079
at the same time in october 27 2020

903
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:48,480
and the organization that had a plan

904
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,680
that the best practice and the

905
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,200
compliance

906
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:54,480
knew how to overcome it so if you know

907
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,119
that your weakness is in a system

908
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:58,480
specifically

909
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:01,440
if you connect if you can disconnect it

910
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:04,320
from the old network it's better but

911
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,359
it's not

912
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:07,680
prepare for cyber attack

913
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:10,640
take caring in your consideration that

914
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:13,040
you can be attacked from a ransomware

915
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:16,000
someone will disrupt your ability to

916
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
help the patients

917
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,960
and what do you do next

918
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,960
so we spoke about

919
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,200
the three tactus we spoke about the

920
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,560
organization

921
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,320
and the cti league

922
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,400
holds the third

923
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,960
also the third aspect of cyber security

924
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,960
the unknown

925
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,680
the third aspect of intelligence it's

926
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,960
wide risky and required to think of out

927
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,960
of the box because

928
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,119
you need to search for something that

929
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:48,320
you don't know that is exist

930
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,320
then you need to ask yourself the

931
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,240
intelligence questions

932
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,400
what is the pir

933
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,320
what i'm trying to understand

934
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,640
what is the question that i'm asking

935
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,680
myself

936
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,400
and with that question in my mind i'm

937
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,800
going to search and trying to identify

938
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,280
the new information what is the end

939
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,160
point

940
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,560
for example if i'm going to search for

941
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,760
data leak

942
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,640
of in hospitals that i don't know what

943
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,640
is the hospital and i don't know which

944
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,040
threat actor can lick the data or

945
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:22,079
compromise the organization

946
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:23,280
what do i do

947
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,920
how do i find this information i need to

948
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,400
think about the pir and i think need to

949
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:31,280
think about the end point the end point

950
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:34,000
as we spoke before is to alert the

951
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,119
hospital to help them save their cyber

952
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:40,160
resilience to protect the patients that

953
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,240
their data was left online

954
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:45,040
and if we can to neutralize it then we

955
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,480
neutralize it

956
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,320
so let's take an example

957
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:51,200
some of the ctl missions

958
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,760
first identifying compromised remote

959
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,480
access platform in the wild it's both on

960
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:59,119
the dark net but not only

961
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:01,200
are trying to do that without thinking

962
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,200
of any organization

963
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:06,480
without a list of hospitals from all

964
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,920
around the world that we are searching

965
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,160
the name we do that on the matter of

966
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,640
organizations if we have the data we

967
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,760
will do it

968
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:16,480
but here we are trying to search the

969
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,200
remote access platform that

970
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:22,000
was leaked or sell online

971
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,200
and if we identified it then we can move

972
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,119
it forward for law enforcement

973
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:29,760
organization they can check they can

974
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,640
protect the hospitals because they have

975
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:36,160
the data collaboration is the key we are

976
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,880
not trying to make a profit here we are

977
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,839
trying to make impact so it doesn't

978
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:43,839
matter if we search the name of the

979
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:46,079
hospital or the law enforcement searcher

980
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:49,040
the name of the hospital

981
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,920
we're trying to make an impact

982
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,839
monitoring attempting to sell

983
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:56,240
compromised assets

984
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:58,640
mainly in the dark web

985
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:01,000
for that we develop scrapers the

986
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,800
scripters

987
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,319
will try to find

988
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:08,240
any setting of compromised assets

989
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,319
this is really important because then

990
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:12,480
we're searching the unknown we can't you

991
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,800
know follow specific users

992
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,359
in the dark web or searching for

993
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:20,000
specific queries or terms we need to

994
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,359
search and think out of the box

995
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:24,400
these two

996
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,359
can be

997
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:28,079
done with fishing with spreading nets as

998
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:30,160
i said scrapers

999
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,920
but it's not enough

1000
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,520
we want to hunt

1001
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,400
so

1002
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,920
we hunt for the information the

1003
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,960
numerator operation in the dark web

1004
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:41,280
theme of the city i live which named

1005
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,920
city i like dark we have professionals

1006
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:46,400
that are really really good and can hunt

1007
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,520
the information from the threat actors

1008
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:52,880
and take for example rdp sessions

1009
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,480
that

1010
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,800
someone is trying to sell to steal the

1011
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,839
information back and then we can share

1012
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:00,640
it

1013
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:03,040
in these operations you need

1014
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:05,359
experts you need the talented the people

1015
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:06,640
in the industry

1016
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:07,440
and

1017
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,920
for luck there are a lot of good people

1018
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,880
that believe in the mission of creating

1019
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,200
safer cyberspace for the medical sector

1020
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,960
and other life-saving operations and

1021
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:19,200
want to join us in order to fulfill our

1022
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,640
mission

1023
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,720
hunting for new vulnerabilities

1024
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:25,040
we don't search for zero days we don't

1025
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,920
check the uh vulnerabilities in the

1026
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,480
systems of a specific hospital

1027
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:33,280
but if we find something that can

1028
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:36,240
indicate of a new vulnerability like the

1029
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:40,560
4th of july operation that we understood

1030
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:44,319
first that there is the f5 uh

1031
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:47,119
vulnerability back in last year in july

1032
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:50,160
last year we created a team work

1033
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,400
for the entire weekend to search

1034
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,000
vulnerabilities

1035
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,800
that's related to the f5

1036
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,839
so we have the two type of methods

1037
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:02,800
fishing and hunting we have the three

1038
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,760
point of views of intelligence

1039
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:08,480
so before we speak about the future

1040
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,160
let's summarize

1041
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,079
we are the cti league

1042
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:12,960
we

1043
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:16,000
established in 2020 as a community of

1044
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,480
people that wanted to do some good

1045
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:21,520
during the pandemic to make a change for

1046
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:25,280
hospitals and to prevent and neutralize

1047
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,599
cyber threats looking to exploit the

1048
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:29,920
current winning pandemic in this one

1049
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,200
year and a half

1050
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,440
we learned how vulnerable

1051
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,680
these organizations are

1052
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:38,000
we chose the segment of organizations

1053
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:38,960
that

1054
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:41,040
we don't want them to make the questions

1055
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:44,240
that i made before or they can't protect

1056
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:46,800
themselves from a lot of reasons

1057
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:47,920
it can be

1058
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:50,960
larger organization or small but

1059
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:54,000
as long as they in our segment we want

1060
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,920
to protect them we will do everything

1061
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,760
that we can to protect them

1062
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,920
we work with members from all around the

1063
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:02,079
globe in the last one year and six

1064
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:05,680
months we have more than 1 500 members

1065
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:07,920
that join us in in the way

1066
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:10,240
to fulfill our mission

1067
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:13,440
we now have a mission of creating safer

1068
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,839
cyberspace for the medical sector and

1069
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:18,800
lifesaving organization and we do that

1070
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:19,680
by

1071
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:23,359
three levels of protection prevention

1072
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:24,640
supporting

1073
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,400
and neutralization

1074
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:29,119
here in the stock we spoke about the

1075
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:31,839
first layer the prevention layer

1076
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:34,240
in order to prevent cyber attacks we

1077
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:35,760
need intelligence

1078
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:39,040
we had three types of inter intelligence

1079
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:41,359
in general terms the first one is the

1080
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:44,240
threat actor the second is working on

1081
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:46,319
the organization and the third one is

1082
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:48,640
the unknown we spoke about ransomware

1083
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:52,160
and initial axis broker as some insights

1084
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:55,040
that we found during this walk in the

1085
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:58,319
league mainly by the cti league dark

1086
00:43:58,319 --> 00:43:59,920
team that

1087
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:02,240
is is just amazing team and i

1088
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:05,440
want to uh thank every single member

1089
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:08,000
that joined this team during this time

1090
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,480
we talked about the initial smoker

1091
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:11,280
we

1092
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:15,280
focused on rdp sessions is a main vector

1093
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:18,000
and prominent vector but not only any

1094
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,640
remote access is important

1095
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:22,880
alongside we've exchanged we found some

1096
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:25,520
uptick in the last months in uh

1097
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:28,240
exploiting exchange vulnerabilities

1098
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:30,640
we spoke about the organizations how we

1099
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:34,079
do that by our monitoring system or this

1100
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:37,280
new obs monitoring system and every

1101
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:40,000
other organization that helps us

1102
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,480
in this mission in fulfilling the

1103
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,160
mission this is what's great about the

1104
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:46,720
city i live we are searched that derived

1105
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:49,680
by community and within the community we

1106
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:52,319
have the talented people in the universe

1107
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:55,040
that want to do some good that believe

1108
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:56,560
in the mission

1109
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,000
they join us because they wanted to

1110
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,400
neutralize cyborg that's looking to

1111
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:01,760
exploit

1112
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:02,960
the karen

1113
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:05,920
19 pandemic and now they are here

1114
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:07,040
because

1115
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:10,000
they want to create safer cyberspace for

1116
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,359
the medical sector and lifestyle

1117
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:12,480
organization

1118
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,720
and we spoke a little bit about

1119
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,319
remediation

1120
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:18,800
about some steps how to overcome the

1121
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,960
thermal cyber attack

1122
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:23,920
you spoke about starching in the unknown

1123
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:27,200
both in the nets in the fishing method

1124
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,760
or in the hunting method

1125
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:33,040
and now it's time to speak about the

1126
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:34,560
city

1127
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:37,040
future i spoke about the collaboration

1128
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:39,040
so much in this session

1129
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:42,000
and the people that know me already know

1130
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,520
that is

1131
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:45,280
my first mission

1132
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:46,720
this is the will

1133
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:49,599
that i'm sure that i'm hearing with me

1134
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:51,760
so collaboration is hard but rewards are

1135
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:54,400
great and these are two rewards that cti

1136
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,560
league members should be proud of

1137
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:59,119
because this is not about

1138
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:03,440
me or my partner smart this and nate

1139
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:04,880
all the people that volunteered the

1140
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:06,160
watchtower

1141
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:07,839
you know you are

1142
00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:11,440
these are for all the cti league you

1143
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,280
made it so

1144
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:17,119
had two rewards in 2021 is the cti

1145
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:19,440
league one the difference maker award

1146
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:23,200
winner for 2020 by sans institute

1147
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,599
really really really amazing ownership

1148
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:28,160
and the second one is the highlighting

1149
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:31,839
of the cti league in while 25

1150
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:32,560
in

1151
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:35,920
people who are making things better

1152
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:38,400
the members of the cti league are the

1153
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:41,119
people that making things better

1154
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:43,280
the members for example of the dagner

1155
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:44,480
team

1156
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:47,359
making the way of monitoring and finding

1157
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:49,599
information in the dark web

1158
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:50,960
differently

1159
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:53,680
and they make it in the best way

1160
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:55,680
the information that they fund

1161
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,359
can prevent cyber attack and reduce the

1162
00:46:57,359 --> 00:46:58,480
level of threat

1163
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:00,560
can support any organization to

1164
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:02,400
remediate attacks and to mitigate

1165
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,640
attacks and also

1166
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:06,800
they work so hard with law enforcement

1167
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:07,839
organization

1168
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:10,160
escalate information

1169
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,480
hopefully we will disrupt

1170
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:14,480
the criminal's abilities

1171
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:17,839
to conduct the criminal activity

1172
00:47:17,839 --> 00:47:21,119
so this is the time to look of every

1173
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:23,200
single member and say

1174
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:26,720
thank you build prices are yours

1175
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:30,880
and we are hope that we can expand our

1176
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:32,000
services

1177
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,040
increase the impact that we make for the

1178
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:36,400
organization

1179
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:39,200
and how we do it this is our way to do

1180
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:40,000
it

1181
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,440
open cert

1182
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:43,920
we have the watchtower that develops the

1183
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:46,400
independent services that we don't want

1184
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:47,839
to rely

1185
00:47:47,839 --> 00:47:49,920
only on the community because we

1186
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:53,200
understand that volunteering is hard a

1187
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:55,520
lot of people don't have spare time to

1188
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:58,319
volunteer or it's really hard to share

1189
00:47:58,319 --> 00:48:00,960
skills resources of organization so in

1190

automatic

1193
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:10,400
