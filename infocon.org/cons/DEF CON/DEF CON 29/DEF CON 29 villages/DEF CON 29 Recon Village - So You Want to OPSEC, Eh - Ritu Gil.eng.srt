1
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,919
hey everyone thank you for joining me

2
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:08,720
today

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,200
my presentation is called so you wanna

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,320
opsec

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,480
before we start just a little disclaimer

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,000
i'm not here on behalf of any

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:16,960
organization

8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,560
and anything i say are my beliefs and

9
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,920
not represented about the canadian

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:20,720
government

11
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,400
i'm here to talk about operational

12
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,480
security from my perspective as an

13
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,760
austin investigator

14
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,400
so osun is open source intelligence

15
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,080
which is information that is collected

16
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:30,400
from

17
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,440
publicly available sources we ocean

18
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,280
investigators will find a ton of digital

19
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,040
breadcrumbs that help with our research

20
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,200
but i'm here to show you the privacy

21
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,840
side of why this should matter to you

22
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,200
it doesn't mean that you have something

23
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,039
to hide because you're a bad person

24
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:46,800
but it's sometimes about a bad actor

25
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,559
having ill intentions

26
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:50,320
and you could be targeted for something

27
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,680
like identity theft

28
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,320
so i hope by the end of this talk the

29
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,360
why you should care

30
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,480
question should be answered

31
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,559
let me introduce myself my name is ritu

32
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:02,559
gill i'm an intelligence analyst with a

33
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:04,080
total of 14 years

34
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,438
with the canadian government

35
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:07,360
specifically law enforcement

36
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,439
12 of those years was with the royal

37
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:10,640
canadian mounted police

38
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,280
which is canada's national police force

39
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,320
i am a in

40
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,280
uh ocean enthusiast you can find me a

41
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,960
lot of places online

42
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,799
including twitter where i go by the

43
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,799
handle oh sent techniques

44
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,280
i have a website which is at

45
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,119
oceantechniques.com

46
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,079
this is the overall agenda of my talk

47
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:32,960
i'll cover

48
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,960
the definitions of opsec and threat

49
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,159
modeling

50
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:38,400
then cover sharing content and how it

51
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,360
can expose

52
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,159
your information online i'll cover poor

53
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:42,720
opsec

54
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,399
because these are learning opportunities

55
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,880
for us and then i'll move into ways on

56
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,880
how you can stay secure

57
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,640
and resources that may help with

58
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,200
discovering your digital content

59
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,920
and then go into how we can remove some

60
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,880
of this content

61
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,320
as well so what is opsec

62
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,320
it's a term from the us military that

63
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,719
stands for operational security

64
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:07,680
the purpose of opsec is to deny

65
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,280
adversary information that can

66
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,878
compromise emission

67
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:13,280
so the objective is to prevent sensitive

68
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,000
data

69
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,319
from falling into the wrong hands i want

70
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,959
to introduce another concept here

71
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:20,879
people will sometimes say opsec when

72
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,560
they actually mean persec

73
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,120
which is personal security and it is a

74
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,879
way to identify control

75
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,480
and protect information about your

76
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,640
personal security and life

77
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,040
and for the purposes of this talk i'm

78
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,040
addressing behaviors that impact both

79
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,000
opsec

80
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,720
and persec so you don't need to be in

81
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,319
the military to have opsec

82
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,400
or per sec apply to you it works both

83
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,440
ways

84
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,920
examples someone could use the

85
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,680
information you're sharing online and do

86
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,360
something nefarious like break into your

87
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,360
house when you're on vacation

88
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,519
or if you're part of military or law

89
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,440
enforcement and you post things online

90
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,120
that could compromise the current

91
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,280
location of your troop

92
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,239
so the sharing of this data in our

93
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,319
online lives can have a huge

94
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:07,840
impact some questions to think about

95
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,159
when what we can ask ourselves is what

96
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,319
can an adversary or a bad actor gain

97
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,159
from looking at our online footprint

98
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,720
that's a great question so where do we

99
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,159
expose ourselves online

100
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:21,120
or where do we expose ourselves too much

101
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,040
and then how can we minimize these risks

102
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,560
these are questions to help

103
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,200
make our assessment for you having

104
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,000
better opsec

105
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,640
might mean preventing bad actors from

106
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,519
identifying

107
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:33,599
you online or knowing where you live and

108
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,840
work

109
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,080
so what is your threat model well a

110
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,000
threat model first it's a method of

111
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,280
evaluating security and privacy risks in

112
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,440
order to strategically mitigate them

113
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,040
so everyone's threat model will look

114
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,959
different depending on who you are and

115
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,319
what you do

116
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:52,000
but to define your threat model you can

117
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,680
answer questions such as

118
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,840
what information you want to protect

119
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,120
what are your assets

120
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,280
what are you doing now that expresses

121
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,280
exposes you online

122
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,000
who might want to gain this access so

123
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,920
who is your adversary

124
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,400
where is that information stored online

125
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,200
and available

126
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,480
that's a good question all those

127
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,319
different platforms and apps

128
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,879
and things we use and then lastly what

129
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,560
can we do about this so what are those

130
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,478
mitigating factors like what can we

131
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:19,040
change in

132
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,040
our behavior to prevent leaks of data

133
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,680
so when you conduct an assessment like

134
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,000
this it's a good reminder of how our

135
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,199
online activity can impact us you may

136
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,360
move into a new job role where you need

137
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,680
to reassess your threat model

138
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,600
that's why it's important to think about

139
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,960
this often

140
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,320
and reassess as necessary just remember

141
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,360
this

142
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,639
risk factors will include you and what

143
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:47,759
you do online

144
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,600
but they also include your family

145
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,080
members your associates your friends

146
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,120
colleagues that can inadvertently expose

147
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:55,520
you

148
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,759
online so let's talk about

149
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,960
sharing it is easy to accidentally share

150
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,720
information online at times

151
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,280
in this example on the left you'll see

152
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,320
lisa kudrow

153
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,400
who accidentally reveals her computer

154
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,479
password that was written on a post-it

155
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:13,120
no

156
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,919
she then takes a selfie and she posts it

157
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:16,400
on

158
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,840
instagram where people um identify

159
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,080
that hey like you posted your password

160
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,240
that's that's really poor opsec

161
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,160
um and then on the example on the right

162
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,880
you'll see a photo posted by lapd

163
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,479
which shows in the background

164
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,800
information um their login information

165
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,320
for a software they were using at the

166
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:34,960
time

167
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,960
so the moral of the story is think twice

168
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,080
before you post

169
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,400
if you're considering posting images or

170
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,360
photos

171
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,520
make sure it doesn't include sensitive

172
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,720
information in that

173
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,680
background but we humans we do make

174
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,720
mistakes

175
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,639
but it's important that we can learn

176
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:51,759
from others

177
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:54,800
like in these situations so here's

178
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,080
another example of how

179
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,560
people will leak information about

180
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,639
themselves

181
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:03,360
so these are those social media quizzes

182
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,720
some people like to call them

183
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,560
i just call them social engineering

184
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,759
questions

185
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,080
people keep answering and it's a prime

186
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,199
example of over

187
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,240
sharing so answering questions

188
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,720
where they'll say hey who what are your

189
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,720
siblings names what's your favorite song

190
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,360
what's the

191
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,319
first concert you went to um this is

192
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,080
like way too much information

193
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,960
and sometimes some of the questions are

194
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,759
answers to your security questions

195
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,759
so i know most people know not to post

196
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,000
photos of like credit cards or disclose

197
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,160
sensitive login information but a

198
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,400
surprising number of people will post

199
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,400
phone numbers and home addresses

200
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,360
on social media and related to some of

201
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:43,919
these

202
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,840
questions posted out there i've seen it

203
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,479
and i was shocked

204
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,160
so again you might ask hey what's the

205
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,000
risk well someone guessing your

206
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,199
passwords

207
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,039
that gives them access to pretty much

208
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,319
everything

209
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:57,759
and then we talk about those social

210
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,759
engineering attacks against you and

211
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,240
physical harm maybe and whatnot so those

212
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,840
are things to think about

213
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,440
so the takeaway as mentioned in the

214
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,880
slide here uh

215
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,560
on the screenshot on the left is stop

216
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,880
giving people your personal info to

217
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,120
guess your password and security

218
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:18,240
questions period that is the lesson here

219
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,680
so sharing content be mindful of what's

220
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,080
in the background your photos and video

221
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,759
conference calls this way you just have

222
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,280
more control of the information you

223
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,639
expose

224
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:31,120
privacy settings don't always work on

225
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,160
all platforms

226
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,800
facebook is leaky privacy settings on

227
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,599
facebook are not black and white

228
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:40,160
keep that in mind and don't let privacy

229
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,080
settings be the be-all end-all of what

230
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,440
you do and do not do

231
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,319
on some of these platforms before

232
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:46,960
posting

233
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,879
ask yourself if what you posted was

234
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,280
leaked would it compromise you in any

235
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,960
way would it compromise your location

236
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,000
where you live

237
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,039
your family members too many details

238
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:57,360
just

239
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,240
being put out there then proceed with

240
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:00,800
your action

241
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,160
before i post anything on social media

242
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,080
whether those privacy settings on or not

243
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,599
i ask myself that question

244
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:09,919
then i proceed i'm like would i want

245
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:11,280
people to see this

246
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,680
maybe maybe not then i determine the

247
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,120
risk there

248
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,879
it is easy to overshare online and

249
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,520
overlook those risks but we have to ask

250
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,080
ourselves what criminals or fraudsters

251
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,479
might do with this information

252
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:27,440
and remember that everything that you

253
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,720
are posting online

254
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,360
is building your digital footprint

255
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:31,840
that's

256
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,958
always key and that's what this

257
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:38,000
uh talk is about right um your digital

258
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,519
footprint

259
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,919
leads back to you and what it says about

260
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,200
you and

261
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,120
how to make it better which we'll cover

262
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,279
as well

263
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,200
so the last couple years pretty bad for

264
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,839
oversharing and

265
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:53,680
you'll see here in this example i have

266
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,839
some photos where you could see vaccine

267
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:58,000
cards so different countries

268
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,080
vaccine cards have different information

269
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,200
some are just a name

270
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,720
and the days that they had their

271
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,640
vaccines and some are

272
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,959
date of birth included as well so this

273
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:08,640
is sensitive information

274
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,080
um you'll also see over sharing like and

275
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,000
not realizing right buying all those

276
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,279
amazon packages

277
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:16,800
and then leaving that label on and then

278
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,000
throwing it and recycling

279
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,440
and people you being able to find your

280
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,839
name and your address well that's gold

281
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:28,080
so something to keep in mind airline

282
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,839
tickets people going on a

283
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:32,480
flight to wherever and posting it online

284
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,440
um

285
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,480
on on instagram or whatever platform

286
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,800
and then there's also this photo of a

287
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,720
male wearing a

288
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,000
work id here well he wore that work id

289
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,680
and then he stormed the capitol

290
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,720
in january well that's a good way to get

291
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,240
fired from your job

292
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,200
but these are all examples of what some

293
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:53,920
some of that over

294
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,200
sharing looks like so

295
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,760
there are tons of examples of poor opsec

296
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,800
but

297
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,040
there are also your online habits of

298
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,240
using the same

299
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,120
username say across platforms so we

300
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,560
ocean researchers know

301
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,200
username aggregators are very helpful

302
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,640
when we're looking for

303
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,880
finding accounts belonging to the same

304
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,720
individual or maybe belonging to the

305
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,000
same individual

306
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,800
well don't be that person that uses the

307
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,800
same username on all your platforms so

308
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,040
you're easy to find

309
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,920
defeats the purpose when you expose too

310
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,279
many details about yourself

311
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,680
you can be targeted for spoofing crimes

312
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,760
so spoofing is where someone calls say

313
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,720
my family

314
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,079
with what looks like my phone number

315
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:37,920
because they've spoofed it so it says my

316
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,279
phone number is calling

317
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:41,120
and then next they tell that my family

318
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,360
members that hey i'm kidnapped until

319
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,360
they pay up a ransom um there's also

320
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,440
sharing photos so sharing photos with

321
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,440
passports and i know a lot of people use

322
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,959
those hashtags

323
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:54,959
um and there's a bunch up on the slide

324
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,560
here but there's also like hashtag

325
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,240
passport

326
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,800
or hashtag boarding pass which are

327
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,640
interesting well i had someone who

328
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,680
didn't know that

329
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,200
bar codes can have important information

330
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,240
so they shared a photo of their airline

331
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,519
ticket

332
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:15,120
and they put their thumb over their name

333
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,440
well i know that barcodes do have

334
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,160
information

335
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,560
embedded in them so i was able to snip

336
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,720
the photo and able to reveal their real

337
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,440
name

338
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,480
by visiting uh online bar barcode reader

339
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,000
so these are the things that sometimes

340
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,839
people aren't aware of

341
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:31,680
but you're still exposing yourself when

342
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,800
you don't think you are

343
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,839
so i could have easily showed you

344
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:38,959
facebook or

345
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:41,760
google's apps but we already know they

346
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,839
collect so much information

347
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:46,160
um i was reading an article written by

348
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,320
bellingcat related to tracking military

349
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,120
positions

350
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,760
and there's an app called untapped i

351
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,560
wanted to highlight that

352
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,959
even seemingly safe apps can be used

353
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:57,839
against you

354
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,000
or against us because not just the

355
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,760
military uses this app

356
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,680
it's anybody that likes beer because

357
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,680
untapped is a beer drinking app

358
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,639
and it can be used to track habits um

359
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:09,519
including

360
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:12,880
a location of an individual so i went to

361
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,440
a reg just a random user just to see

362
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,959
like what i found well

363
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:19,200
username full name locations they

364
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,000
visited

365
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,760
and then not only that how many times

366
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,320
they've visited the locations so

367
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,000
i could probably find out they probably

368
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,920
live in the area that kind of stuff

369
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,639
and again just that's a lot of

370
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:33,120
information out there so

371
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,680
the awareness here is just understanding

372
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,240
that

373
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,040
be aware of what you're signing up for

374
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:39,760
um

375
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,399
with some of these apps and you know how

376
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,160
much information is going to be put out

377
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,200
there

378
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,040
about you so what can you do

379
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,720
to protect yourself well these are some

380
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,320
general tips

381
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,279
uh where you could start just for better

382
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:56,720
privacy and security

383
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,440
using strong passwords um you know don't

384
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,639
use them

385
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,399
don't use passwords based on your pet's

386
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,399
name or your kid's name or your favorite

387
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,800
vacation spot

388
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,040
use a password manager that's also

389
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,320
helpful

390
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,320
but also think of things like your

391
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,680
browsing habits

392
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,320
so using a secure search engine like

393
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,920
duckduckgo

394
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,600
duckduckgo does not save your

395
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,079
search history or your personal data the

396
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:25,760
next few slides are going to cover

397
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,279
some things that can help with your

398
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:29,040
searching habits

399
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,920
so let's first talk about google chrome

400
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,320
um

401
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,200
and also there's other uh browsers which

402
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,079
will have this

403
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:39,440
incognito mode um

404
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,040
and they're called different things in

405
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,560
different browsers but this one

406
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,120
it's called incognito and i notice

407
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,639
there's a lot of confusion about what

408
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:47,519
incognito

409
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,320
mode does well using incognito mode it

410
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,839
doesn't really protect you

411
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,240
it it the thing it does protect you from

412
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,639
is if you have like a shared computer

413
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:59,440
and you don't want your searches uh to

414
00:13:59,440 --> 00:13:59,839
be

415
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,360
found by the person that you share the

416
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,959
computer with well

417
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:04,560
it won't save that information on the

418
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,720
computer you're using but your internet

419
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,639
service provider your isp

420
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,399
and other websites can still see your

421
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,720
searches so it's really understanding

422
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,680
like what

423
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,680
what what it does versus what it does

424
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,600
not do

425
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,320
so if you want to see what your browser

426
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,920
appears like to other

427
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,199
sites use one or

428
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,040
a couple of these free services to see

429
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,279
the details of

430
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,519
your ip address the type of browser you

431
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:33,600
use the operating system maybe other

432
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,720
details

433
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,760
this information gives us some insight

434
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,279
in how identifiable

435
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,519
you are to other sites and people and

436
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:43,360
sometimes it is worth

437
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,720
taking a look at more than one of these

438
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,199
sites just to do a comparison

439
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:49,600
of what they observe as your browser

440
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,959
fingerprint

441
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:53,600
so after trying some of these sites you

442
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,199
might be thinking well what can i do to

443
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:58,480
fix or change that well

444
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,399
we have something called browser

445
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,320
extensions that you can use to adjust

446
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,320
your privacy settings

447
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,639
there are many out there but i only just

448
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:07,600
mentioned three

449
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,760
that i use at least there's https

450
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,160
everywhere this encrypts your

451
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,440
communications with

452
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,839
many websites you might visit it makes

453
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:19,199
your browsing

454
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,040
more secure so what it does is it

455
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,000
switches sites from the insecure

456
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,560
use of http to the secure site of

457
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,399
https

458
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,160
and then we also have things like the

459
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,759
privacy badger which

460
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:35,759
blocks advertisers and third-party

461
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:38,000
trackers from secretly tracking where

462
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:38,480
you go

463
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,040
and what pages you visit online and

464
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,880
lastly we have user user

465
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,160
agent switcher for chrome so this is

466
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,399
an extension that changes the user agent

467
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,240
which is something that identifies

468
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,079
what browser is being used the version

469
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:54,399
and what operating system you're using

470
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,639
so when you activate this extension it

471
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:59,040
helps change your browser and operating

472
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,759
system footprint so i'm using an ios

473
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:03,920
operating system and say chrome

474
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,880
but we can spoof these details with this

475
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,600
extension

476
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,839
so it's kind of neat take a look if you

477
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:12,480
don't already use it

478
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,920
so what else can you do to secure

479
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,120
yourself what are some solutions

480
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,079
well we have security by absence so not

481
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,519
posting information out there in the

482
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:23,440
first place

483
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,440
you can't get hacked through services

484
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,440
and apps you don't have

485
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,199
right that's something to keep in mind

486
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:30,560
but

487
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,560
one thing i do want to highlight here is

488
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,399
it's just a good reminder that

489
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:35,920
there's times where we used to use

490
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,639
certain sites and apps and services

491
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,240
well if you don't use them anymore if

492
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,680
you stop using them delete those

493
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,079
accounts related to them

494
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:45,759
this is part of cleaning up your digital

495
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:47,360
footprint

496
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,279
i've conducted security assessments

497
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:51,120
where i often find

498
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,440
users old accounts that were never

499
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,160
deleted

500
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,079
but they contained tons of information

501
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:57,920
like their old photos and everything

502
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,440
and who they hung out with and what they

503
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,839
did so that's just something

504
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:05,839
really important to do as well

505
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:09,359
there's also another technique used

506
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,199
which is called disinformation

507
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:12,720
so this is where you plant some fake

508
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,480
information to mix up your digital

509
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,839
footprint

510
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,640
you can create fake accounts especially

511
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,559
if you have a unique name

512
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:22,400
so if you have a common name like mine

513
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,240
ritu gill very common

514
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,760
this helps me kind of hide in some ways

515
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,160
but if your name isn't common you'll

516
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,679
have to put in more effort and

517
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:34,160
disinformation is one way to do that

518
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,640
the goal here is to make attribution to

519
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,760
your name difficult

520
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:43,679
and next let's educate those around us

521
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,640
that's part of our job not only we want

522
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,559
to educate ourselves but the people that

523
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:51,039
we're closest to our friends and family

524
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:53,200
they need to know this stuff too letting

525
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,400
them know how they

526
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,640
could be impacting or compromising some

527
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,919
of their privacy

528
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:00,000
and security out there on the online

529
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,039
world

530
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,880
there's a really cool video that might

531
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,720
help with this just to give people an

532
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,000
idea

533
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,160
it's called data to go which show it

534
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,320
shows you how easy it is to obtain

535
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,400
information about people online it's a

536
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,480
fun little video and i created a short

537
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,960
link or you can just enter data to go in

538
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,559
youtube and you can find the video that

539
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:20,000
way

540
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,600
typically i'd say don't click on short

541
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,520
links but you can trust me

542
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,400
on the open web i would always use a url

543
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,600
expander to view

544
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,600
any short links just to see where they

545
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,959
take you before clicking on it

546
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,559
data breaches so have you checked if

547
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:38,240
your accounts have been part of a data

548
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,760
breach

549
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,320
troy hunt's website have i been polled

550
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,200
let's use search

551
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,400
email and phone number to find breaches

552
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,240
associated to that email or phone number

553
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,200
that you search

554
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,200
this site also allows you to set up

555
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,280
notifications or when and if

556
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,360
that phone number or email is part of a

557
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,960
new breach

558
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,679
if you find there are breaches

559
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:01,520
associated to an email or a phone number

560
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,480
that you have

561
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,320
well maybe go delete that account

562
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,320
altogether or that app that you were

563
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,320
using that got breached

564
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,919
or you might want to go change well

565
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:10,960
you're going to want to go change your

566
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,000
password for sure

567
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,679
but depending on the situation you might

568
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:15,440
want to do different things

569
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,600
it's all about minimizing the data about

570
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,760
us out there so breach data breaches

571
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,799
happen every day

572
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:22,960
but breach data can end up on the dark

573
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,360
web so it's important for us to stay on

574
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,080
top of

575
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,400
these things and that's why you want to

576
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,280
sign up for

577
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,000
notifications right associated to your

578
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,520
personal

579
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,879
email addresses and whatnot

580
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:39,760
other useful sites with descriptions of

581
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,919
what they include are on this slide

582
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:43,360
i'll just go through a few of them so

583
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,280
the first one stands for

584
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,679
terms of service didn't read it's for

585
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:48,960
all of us who

586
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,120
didn't read the terms and services of

587
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,440
websites for clicking i agree

588
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,120
this website will break down what the

589
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,039
terms and conditions are for popular

590
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:57,440
sites

591
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,559
very helpful um because lots of people

592
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:01,360
don't want to

593
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,840
read through the pages and pages of the

594
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,039
terms and

595
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:07,679
conditions of sites we sign up for and

596
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:08,919
then we have a website called

597
00:20:08,919 --> 00:20:10,880
privacytools.io which provides a bunch

598
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,559
of information to learn about tools

599
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:13,919
again that can help you

600
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:19,679
right justgetmydata.com is helpful when

601
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:20,880
you want to find out how to get your

602
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,039
data from certain sites

603
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:24,720
because sometimes some sites don't make

604
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,640
it easy where i'm like hey how do i

605
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,480
download my information or how do i find

606
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,960
out where to delete my information

607
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,400
so there's some sites here that will

608
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,360
help you with some of that as well

609
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,520
all right so there's a documentary that

610
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,919
is or was on netflix

611
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:42,320
called the social dilemma it is a good

612
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,440
awareness film

613
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,440
and it shows the many ways that social

614
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,480
media

615
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,360
companies have influenced society so i

616
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,880
don't want to say too much about it but

617
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,480
it's interesting because

618
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,320
the documentary features interviews with

619
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,400
several former employees and

620
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,480
executives of companies like facebook

621
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,159
google and twitter

622
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:01,600
so it's interesting to see their

623
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,280
perspective but it's something

624
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,960
go take a look at um when you have time

625
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,120
all right so an exercise well this is

626
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,880
one of the easiest ways that you can see

627
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:11,760
what your digital

628
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,360
footprint looks like or start with at

629
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,880
least start with

630
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,840
what you use online your your name or

631
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,159
usernames or email addresses you've used

632
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:22,320
and so on so that's the first step in

633
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,840
identifying like hey what's all the

634
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,039
stuff out there

635
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:28,320
out there about me um and use a few

636
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:28,720
different

637
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,960
search engines at least two i'd say so

638
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,720
google and bing

639
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,840
those are some options and then

640
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,000
once you've identified what your online

641
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,600
footprint looks like

642
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:43,280
well there's some of these services

643
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,600
sorry so there's a bunch of blog posts

644
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,720
here that i have

645
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,120
mentioned um whether it's by micah

646
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,520
hoffman which is at webreacher or josh

647
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,320
huff which is

648
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,600
learn all the things his website

649
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,440
they provide useful tips to clean up

650
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,880
your digital footprint

651
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,520
so check these out and see what and how

652
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,799
you can remove some of that digital

653
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:03,520
footprint

654
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,600
one of the caveats here is that there

655
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,280
will be challenges due to the

656
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,360
availability of public records in some

657
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,000
countries

658
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,559
like the united states but there are a

659
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:14,559
lot of other places

660
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:16,000
that include your digital footprint

661
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,080
where you do have more control

662
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,039
so that's the second step of after

663
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:21,520
you've

664
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,159
looked at your digital footprint well go

665
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:26,080
go ahead and remove some of that stuff

666
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,840
that you can and these are some of those

667
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,360
resources that will assist you

668
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,600
final thoughts well if you could just go

669
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,440
ahead and keep opsec in mind that would

670
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:35,760
be

671
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,320
great so the idea here is don't be a

672
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,520
soft target

673
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,919
by exposing too much personal

674
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:45,679
information or details about your life

675
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,640
