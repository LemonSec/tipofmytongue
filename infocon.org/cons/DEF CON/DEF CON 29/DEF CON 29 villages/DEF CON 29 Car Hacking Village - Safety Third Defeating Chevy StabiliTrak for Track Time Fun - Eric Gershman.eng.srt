1
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,160
hey i'm eric gerschmann

2
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,320
and i'm going to be talking about

3
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,320
defeating the chevy stabilitrak for

4
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,119
track time fun

5
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,760
this is a bit about me it's some of my

6
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,800
contact info

7
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,039
uh you can find me at eric gerschmann on

8
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,599
twitter eric at ericgerschmann.com on my

9
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:32,558
email

10
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:35,919
and hexis on discord

11
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,600
so i've started out in it as a systems

12
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,559
administrator

13
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:43,120
and uh i quickly made my way into

14
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,120
infosec

15
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,760
during that time i was hacking most of

16
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,039
the most of

17
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,160
my career on the side or either for work

18
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,000
and i've been a pentester for the last

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,360
five years

20
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,000
i learned how to wrench in college how

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,160
to work on cars in college because

22
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,480
i just couldn't afford to get my oil

23
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,280
change i had to do my oil changes myself

24
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,320
and that quickly led to changing my

25
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,280
breaks

26
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,479
and then finally at one point i got a 93

27
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:13,360
miata

28
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,320
and i edit i i changed my clutch on the

29
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,040
miata

30
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,080
and that was the the largest work uh car

31
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,400
project that i've ever done

32
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,479
this photo here is from the car hacking

33
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:25,759
village

34
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:28,880
from def con 24 in 2016.

35
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,960
it was the first time i went to the car

36
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,079
hacking village

37
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:36,799
i came up to uh this car setup that

38
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:38,960
was designed so that people could

39
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,880
interact with it and find sensors i

40
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,560
looked inside and everyone had picked

41
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,280
over

42
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,920
the interior got into all the sensors

43
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,880
and uh

44
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,880
so i decided to look under the bumper

45
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,479
and was quickly stopped by the car

46
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:51,680
hacking village uh

47
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,119
staff because they didn't want me to

48
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:56,880
start removing body panels to get to

49
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,719
sensors they just wanted

50
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,520
so us to really look at the interior uh

51
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,079
it

52
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,840
i feel like i've come a really long way

53
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,920
since then i just wanted to say that i'm

54
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,439
excited about

55
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,119
contributing back to the car hacking

56
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,959
village after

57
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,400
uh experiencing it over the past uh

58
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,280
several defcons

59
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,239
a quick disclaimer the electronic

60
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,520
stability control which is what

61
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,319
uh stabilo track is each manufacturer

62
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,160
uses their own

63
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,160
trademark name for their electronic

64
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,519
stability control

65
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,920
uh reduces the likelihood of crashes by

66
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,519
up to 43 percent

67
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,720
according to the iahs so disable

68
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,680
stability track and other safety systems

69
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,720
in your car

70
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,599
at your own risk

71
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,120
now going into the reason why the

72
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,440
the starting of the title for this talk

73
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,879
is safety third

74
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,840
uh that being said safety can't really

75
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,160
be

76
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,519
ranked safety third is the idea that um

77
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,000
it should be jarring uh most of the time

78
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
we hear safety first

79
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,760
but uh safety really is a mindset

80
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,280
and it's it's up to us you can't always

81
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,800
have safety first there has to be a

82
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,280
balance with risk

83
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,239
so for electronic stability control it's

84
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,480
commonly disabled from motorsport events

85
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,280
in classes

86
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,040
even if it does save lives because

87
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,959
in the end you're responsible for your

88
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:28,080
own

89
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,000
acceptable risk level

90
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,519
you might be asking like why would you

91
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,000
disable elect esc

92
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,599
and these other safety systems if they

93
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,280
work so well on the road

94
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,440
and the best summary i could find was

95
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,400
from

96
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,080
the team o'neill rally school in new

97
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,440
hampshire uh

98
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,799
in their video the best card

99
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:50,560
modification they say

100
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,640
that the easiest and best performance

101
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,480
modification you can do is to disable

102
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,239
traction control abs and stability

103
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:57,439
control

104
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:01,599
because those systems are

105
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,360
designed for the stream they'll work

106
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,519
different when you're on the track

107
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:06,959
and they'll prevent you from really

108
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:08,959
learning and becoming a better race car

109
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,280
driver

110
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,159
now the flip side of that is even when

111
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,639
racing it it really is a case-by-case

112
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:17,839
basis

113
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,639
uh it depends on what car you're driving

114
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:21,120
so

115
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,400
for uh for a car like a like a tesla

116
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,520
model y

117
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,960
um the stability control on that car

118
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,280
is supposed to be amazing i've never

119
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,240
driven one

120
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,400
but it's supposed to be spot on with the

121
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,080
balancing performance

122
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,639
and being able to keep traction and keep

123
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:39,759
you safe

124
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,440
so there's a lot of cars out there

125
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,000
performance cars like corvettes

126
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,240
the toyota subra where the traction

127
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,240
control and the stability control

128
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,280
systems

129
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,040
are tuned for the performance of those

130
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,280
cars and

131
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,680
also the likelihood of you crashing if

132
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,600
you turn those systems off

133
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,320
increases a lot when compared to slower

134
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,280
cars

135
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,680
with team o'neill they're racing and

136
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,600
teaching on

137
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,479
sometimes base ford fiestas that when

138
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,919
you lose traction

139
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:13,039
or you slip the wheels you're not

140
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:14,639
getting in as much trouble as if you

141
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,560
were in a much faster car

142
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,560
and uh that's really represented by this

143
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,080
article from road and track about

144
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,080
turning off stability control

145
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,639
they say the the author says that the

146
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,479
fact is that you can get them

147
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,720
most cars to within two or three seconds

148
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,320
of their best lap time with all these

149
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,280
systems turned on

150
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,440
now um getting past just the safety

151
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,400
aspects of this

152
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,479
and my um and the disclaimers

153
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,080
you might be asking why am i trying to

154
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,600
race and why

155
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,000
uh why am i getting what started this

156
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,720
talk

157
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,400
and it really is that i want to share my

158
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,080
love of cars and racing with

159
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,160
my son if uh if i really just wanted to

160
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,520
race for myself

161
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,759
i would buy another 90s miata that has

162
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,680
none of these safety features

163
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,759
and uh and add safety features like a

164
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:04,960
rollover bar

165
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,160
and proper seats um

166
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,080
but really i want to share this with my

167
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,720
son and

168
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,840
i was really inspired by jalopnik's

169
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,880
will it baby line of like articles where

170
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,280
they

171
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,319
test different cars and come up with

172
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,720
can you transport your little ones in it

173
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,319
and still have fun

174
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,759
and so i test drove a large number of

175
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,120
different cars

176
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,840
and from the fiat 500 to the pacific si

177
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,759
a lot of cars that they recommended

178
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,199
unfortunately the miata didn't make a

179
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:39,919
cut

180
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:43,440
but i did end up on a what i thought as

181
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,160
like a

182
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,720
compromise between hot hatches when i

183
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,160
did the test drives i

184
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,280
i realized that i either wanted a

185
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,560
a fast manual transmission car or a car

186
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:54,880
that

187
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,440
had a single speed and didn't have the

188
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,599
lag of an automatic transmission

189
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:02,639
and i came upon the sparky v

190
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,400
while researching electric cars and

191
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,080
coming across this car and driver

192
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,039
article

193
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:12,080
about the 2014 2013-2014 compliance cars

194
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,400
and they were super impressed by the

195
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,080
spark it was the quickest

196
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,039
car that they had which is still close

197
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,080
slow when you look at like hot hatch

198
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,280
uh other hot hatches like the fiat 500

199
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,400
it was getting 0 to 60 in in mid 7 mid

200
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,560
to i7's but uh

201
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,120
i decided to give this car a try and um

202
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,720
when i uh

203
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,720
when i started driving it more and more

204
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,560
i realized that the traction control was

205
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,080
going to be a huge

206
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,599
issue so um that's that's the reason

207
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:51,039
that um that's really the motivation

208
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,720
behind this talk

209
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,560
um moving on to esc itself

210
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,680
esc is a system that detects when

211
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,759
vehicle steering is going in an

212
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,919
unintended direction when the vehicle is

213
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:05,199
going the wrong way

214
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,319
compared to the direction that the

215
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:10,080
driver wants to take it

216
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,120
and it compensates that

217
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,080
understeer or oversteer by using single

218
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,840
wheel braking in the abs system

219
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,639
the esc components most electronic

220
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:23,840
stability control

221
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,639
systems include a electronic stability

222
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:27,759
control module

223
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:30,400
in this case the chevy calls that the

224
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,640
electronic brake control module

225
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,679
um sensors for the throttle the pedal a

226
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,839
sensor for each wheel to detect wheel

227
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:38,880
slip

228
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,839
um the angel like anti-lock brake system

229
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:43,839
modulator which would

230
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,200
is able to break each of the four wheels

231
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,519
and then a number of other sensors

232
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,519
including the twerk angle sensor

233
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:55,839
yaw rate and steering angle

234
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,760
to sum this up the you can think of the

235
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,000
electronic stability control as an

236
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,160
add-on on top of abs

237
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,279
and it takes the

238
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,279
sensors and the components are required

239
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:10,399
for abs

240
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,720
and it adds a yaw sensor and a steering

241
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,120
wheel angle sensor to detect

242
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,160
the um the intended direction and the

243
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,560
direction the car is going now

244
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,920
knowing those components um one of the

245
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,880
first steps i took

246
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,480
was trying to pull the fuses team o'meal

247
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,839
has a lot of good

248
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:34,800
videos on

249
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,519
how to disable the different safety

250
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:38,320
systems

251
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,320
and they recommend pulling the fuses

252
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,240
first so i went through my owner's

253
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,760
manual and i found that there were four

254
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,959
different fuses

255
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,839
there was an abs pump fuse a valve fuse

256
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:48,160
an

257
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,240
oil feeding fuse and a fuse for the

258
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,200
computer itself the ebcm fuse

259
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,920
out of all these i had the best results

260
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,519
with the valve fuse

261
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:00,959
um the pump and oil fuse didn't come up

262
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:02,399
with any results

263
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,959
other than a check engine light and the

264
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:05,839
evcm

265
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,519
fuse cut half the power to the epcm

266
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,399
where the traction control system still

267
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:13,680
seemed to be enabled

268
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,720
but uh the throttle was still

269
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,760
being cut even though

270
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,680
even though it wasn't doing the same

271
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,200
braking as before

272
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,240
so i pulled the abs valve fuse and i

273
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,680
immediately got a message

274
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,560
for service to build track so that means

275
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,760
that the stability track

276
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,079
system is disabled and that worked out

277
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:35,600
great i was able to

278
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,240
drive with uh i was able to produce

279
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,000
understeer i was able to

280
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,120
do skid um the car wasn't being

281
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,399
cut off on power and it worked pretty

282
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,320
well the brakes didn't seem

283
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,040
like they were up to up to the previous

284
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,839
performance with stability track enabled

285
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:56,320
um but it worked well for the first

286
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,279
ignition

287
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,440
switch when i turned the car off and

288
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,880
turned it back on

289
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,079
i got a service brake assist message

290
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,959
and the power uh brakes on the car

291
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:07,519
actually

292
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,640
cut off uh so on that next ignition

293
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,519
cycle

294
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,160
i had no power brakes it may break in

295
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,000
really hard so i quickly put the fuse

296
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,120
back in

297
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,920
and uh this turned out to be not a

298
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,240
tenable solution because

299
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,200
it messes with the power brakes even and

300
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,720
i would have to pull

301
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,880
pull and put the fuse back in for each

302
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,240
ignition cycle

303
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,560
and also it seemed to disable the

304
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,320
electronic brake distribution that

305
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,160
controls the brake bias

306
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,079
and that's the the braking that the car

307
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:40,480
does uh the percentage of braking that

308
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,079
it that it does between the front and

309
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:44,399
rear wheels

310
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,320
so i moved on from there and i decided

311
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,240
to go after the rest of the attack

312
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,200
service

313
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:54,000
starting with the yaw sensor i uh

314
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,760
i know i just bought the car but i

315
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,600
quickly pulled the interior

316
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,519
i pulled the seats out i pulled the

317
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:00,800
carpet out i started

318
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,200
searching everywhere in the car for the

319
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,279
off sensor and i couldn't find it

320
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,839
uh at the same time i was checking

321
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:09,920
chilton diy and all data that had

322
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,399
service manuals for this newer car

323
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,920
a relatively newer car and the only

324
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,639
thing that the chilter manual said was

325
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,279
that the yaw sensor would take an hour

326
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:22,480
to be replaced

327
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,720
it didn't say where the yaw sensor was

328
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,160
it said how to calibrate it

329
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,880
but didn't say where it was in the car i

330
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,160
checked on forums

331
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,320
i uh i learned a little bit more about

332
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,000
the yaw sensor and how it works

333
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,320
that should be in the center of mass and

334
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,519
i still couldn't find it

335
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:39,600
inside the car i even talked to the

336
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,440
local parts dealer

337
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,920
and they said that it just doesn't exist

338
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,399
the yaw sensor part doesn't exist

339
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,040
so it must be included in another

340
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:49,760
component

341
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,760
or they may have a simulator and that

342
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,680
could be why it's cutting in

343
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,079
so much for people who drive the sparky

344
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:56,880
v

345
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,720
um so i had to move on from there

346
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,120
and i moved to the steering sensor if i

347
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,040
could maybe unplug the steering sensor i

348
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,480
might be able to disable

349
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,920
just the stability track and not the abs

350
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:14,240
um the ebcm when i looked up

351
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,680
for the steering angle sensor um

352
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,480
when i tried to get to it i couldn't get

353
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,800
to it without pulling the steering wheel

354
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:27,200
and that involved when i looked into

355
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,040
the uh the specifics on it 150

356
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,079
steering wheel puller from chevy and uh

357
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,480
i also at that point tried to go after

358
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,079
the ebcm

359
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:41,440
and the unfortunately the ebecm is not

360
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,279
accessible um unless you go

361
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:48,399
through the radiator and take the

362
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:49,360
radiator out

363
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,399
in the electric spark they

364
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:56,079
mounted the edcm under the

365
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:59,279
car battery and behind the

366
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:03,120
radiator so it's really hard to get to

367
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,000
from there i was inspired um by an

368
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,079
article by rapid7 on building car

369
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:09,920
hacking development workbench

370
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,160
uh to try to put together a workbench

371
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,519
for a gas

372
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,440
sparky b because there were no sparky

373
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,680
bees at the local pole parts

374
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,480
near my house uh finally i found a spark

375
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,399
pb a gas rbv

376
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:25,839
made it out to the junkyard and

377
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:28,240
immediately found the yaw sensor that

378
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,720
was super frustrating i was excited but

379
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,760
it was uh it was right under where

380
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,000
the noisemaker is the pedestrian

381
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:36,959
noisemaker is

382
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,600
on the electric version of the car and i

383
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,000
was

384
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
able to pull it out of the junkyard car

385
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,199
in like five minutes

386
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:48,560
the uh abs module was super easy to pull

387
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:52,399
um for the jump for the gas

388
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,000
part because it was right where you

389
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,120
would expect the brake modules to be

390
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,920
easily accessible from the hood so i

391
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,800
pulled the abs module

392
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,920
which included the edcm and i

393
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,800
pulled the yaw sensor and i tried

394
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,320
pulling the rest of the

395
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,120
wiring harness but i quickly went over

396
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:13,680
my

397
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,480
estimated effort on pulling this and it

398
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,839
ended up having to cut the wiring

399
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:20,079
harness

400
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:23,519
because of the time limit i i wasn't

401
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,120
able to create a full harness but i was

402
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,959
able to pull the ebcm

403
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:30,480
module which is on the lower half of

404
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,160
this picture here and hook it up to a

405
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,160
bench power supply

406
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,800
after hooking it to the bench though it

407
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,399
didn't power on correctly

408
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:41,920
the voltage was lower um i found some

409
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,880
pads

410
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,600
i have the evcn module here i found some

411
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,560
pads inside the module i made some

412
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:52,000
uh wire cut offs to like

413
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,199
access the diagnostic pads but the

414
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:58,480
um module itself or the uh when i hooked

415
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,920
a multimeter up to it

416
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,199
it came into uh it produced a fraction

417
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:05,839
of a vault so i knew something was wrong

418
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:09,839
and that ended up being a dead end

419
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,079
so um that's kind of

420
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:17,279
where my research stops at this point

421
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:20,079
if uh i plan on racing in the next month

422
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,000
so i'm gonna try and go after a few

423
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,720
other future attack paths the first one

424
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,360
is that i

425
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,120
i believe that i can decode the traction

426
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,040
control shutoff message

427
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,600
from the physical switch that's in the

428
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,880
center console

429
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,079
um it it hooks into the body control

430
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,079
module which is a separate module that

431
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:40,959
controls auxiliary functions in the car

432
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,519
and appears to only talk to the edcm

433
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,560
over

434
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,279
can bus so i'm going to attempt to see

435
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:49,120
if there's

436
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,480
any messages that can further disable

437
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:52,959
the

438
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:54,959
tracks to build a track or at least make

439
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:56,639
it easier to disable

440
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:59,519
the second option is uh i believe i can

441
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,199
get to the ebcm

442
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:03,680
through the front driver side wheel well

443
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,839
uh i've used this trick before when

444
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:06,799
changing

445
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:09,359
uh oil and when trying to access

446
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,280
components in cars

447
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,439
sometimes the manufacturer says to do it

448
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:14,319
one way

449
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,480
and uh you're able to go through the

450
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,400
wheel well on

451
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,400
one side or the other to access

452
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,439
something that

453
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:22,959
uh that would normally take a much

454
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,559
longer amount of time

455
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:26,400
and then finally i'm going to build

456
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,919
another non-ev stabilitrak bench

457
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:31,919
in a car that doesn't require a steering

458
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:33,919
wheel puller i know the chevy cruze

459
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:35,360
doesn't require that

460
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,280
thankfully my junkyard has about five

461
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,720
chevy cruises

462
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,840
uh so the local junkyard

463
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:45,120
seems like the best bet for that

464
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,360
and from there i would be able to start

465
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,960
reversing each of the components and

466
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,559
observe them

467
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:52,960
by hooking up a logic analyzer while the

468
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,160
system is

469
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,039
more functional

470
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,720
um going on the lessons learned uh

471
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,799
while i had the interior out on the

472
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:04,000
spark i

473
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,799
i thought you know i traced all of the

474
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:08,320
modules in the interior

475
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,080
and one of them was onstar which i don't

476
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,679
have a subscription for

477
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:13,760
and i don't need for racing like i'm not

478
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,000
going to be calling on star

479
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,840
anytime soon especially in an electric

480
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,240
car that only gets 80 miles range

481
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,559
um so i decided to pull the onstar

482
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:23,280
module

483
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,360
and immediately the check engine light

484
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,280
came on i was like okay that that's kind

485
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,559
of expected

486
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:31,760
and i started driving and um

487
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,760
the first time this happened i made it

488
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,840
onto one of the main roads

489
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,480
uh or closer roads near my house and the

490
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,960
propulsion for the power was cut

491
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,960
uh the uh it came up with this

492
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,440
propulsion powers reduced message and

493
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,440
i was like okay this isn't too bad i

494
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,960
should be able to make it home fine

495
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,760
um i'm still getting like 14 kilowatts

496
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,799
in this screenshot

497
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:59,600
or in this picture of a power you know

498
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,039
that's still a decent amount of

499
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,160
acceleration

500
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,559
but then while i was driving i hit 20

501
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:05,600
miles per hour

502
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,520
and it drastically kept power um

503
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,720
it said speed limit set to 20 miles per

504
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,679
hour

505
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:17,520
on the uh on the message and uh

506
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,799
then uh the

507
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:24,559
i i floored the um the accelerator

508
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:27,120
and it only gave me like one or two

509
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,160
kilowatts

510
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,360
of propuls of energy for going to the

511
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,320
motor

512
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,440
that meant that the miles per hour was

513
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,720
only incrementing like

514
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,919
once every two or three seconds so it

515
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:41,520
was a really scary moment

516
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,400
um but i want to learn from it and my

517
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,679
plan is to

518
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,640
figure out why the onstar system does

519
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:48,960
this

520
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,799
when you unplug it the only thing i can

521
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,240
think of is

522
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,760
um for immobilizing in the event that

523
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,200
somebody stole the car and tried to

524
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,760
disable onstar by unplugging it because

525
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,440
it's easily accessible

526
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,000
um the other thing i want to see is

527
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,600
could this be triggered by canvas

528
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,240
messages

529
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,159
or by by uh flooding the can bus with

530
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:10,640
the

531
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,480
the onstar messages

532
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,679
or the lack of a non-start like uh

533
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:20,960
basically silencing the onstar messages

534
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,360
the other lesson was pretty unfortunate

535
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,080
too

536
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,919
uh and that was bring a scope to the

537
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:28,240
inspection now the chevy spark

538
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,520
uh ev has a lot of plastic cladding they

539
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,720
tried to hide

540
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,799
kind of that it's an electric vehicle

541
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,799
and uh all this plastic

542
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:38,720
cladding meant that during when i went

543
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,480
to buy the car

544
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,080
and when i looked in the engine bay i

545
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,600
didn't see any problems

546
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,000
everything seemed fine um but when i

547
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,200
actually pulled the plastic off to try

548
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,000
to get to the ebcm i came across this

549
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,520
nest here

550
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,480
and it's using like insulation from the

551
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:56,880
car

552
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,520
and a bunch of sticks i discovered the

553
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,080
nest and i was like oh no birds moved in

554
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,760
but then i started looking more through

555
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,600
it and looking at the components of the

556
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,679
car and i found mouse droppings

557
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:10,559
so i definitely recommend getting it the

558
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:11,760
like 25

559
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,320
scope from harbor freight or from online

560
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,760
a usb scope

561
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,360
and looking around in the engine bay

562
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,200
when you're going to buy a used car

563
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,799
i haven't seen that recommendation in a

564
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:22,960
lot of places for when inspecting a used

565
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,000
car but

566
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,280
it would have saved me on this

567
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,000
thankfully it seems that the mice

568
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,840
really didn't like the orange cables the

569
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,440
high voltage cables in the car but it

570
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,360
looks like i'm gonna have to replace

571
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,600
at least one or two ground straps before

572
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,960
i take the car

573
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,159
on a track um

574
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:43,039
and that's my talk uh thank you car
