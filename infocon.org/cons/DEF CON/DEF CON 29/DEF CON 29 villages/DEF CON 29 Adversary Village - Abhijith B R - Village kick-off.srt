00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:14,240
hello everyone

2
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:16,480
welcome to arduino village at defcon 29

3
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,560
my name is abhijit i'm the founder and

4
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,400
organizer of advocacy village at def con

5
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:23,279
conference this year

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:26,080
so what is advocacy village so just to

7
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:29,039
give a quick intro about arduino village

8
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:31,679
so we are a community with pure focus on

9
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,840
to address the simulation emulation

10
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:36,800
addressing tactics addressing life

11
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,680
adversity stories advisory philosophy

12
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,360
uh urban survival skills and a bit of

13
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,640
property

14
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,360
so i would say

15
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,520
uh there is no globally

16
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,760
agreed uh standard definition for

17
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,399
advocacy simulation or emulation so we

18
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:54,320
are all approaching uh this concept or

19
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:55,840
in a in a different manner right we are

20
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:59,199
approaching them in a different manner

21
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:01,440
every time right so i had uh addresses

22
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:03,760
simulation emulation or threat

23
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,560
termination they're basically the same

24
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,400
concept but i mentioned before uh they

25
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,640
are being approached in a different way

26
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,400
you know so that's how people or

27
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,040
organizations are defending them you

28
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,520
know based on how they approach these

29
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,520
concepts

30
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,439
unlike of a full scope team engagement

31
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:26,320
addressing simulation is a bit different

32
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:27,680
so the simulation exercises they always

33
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,680
focuses on

34
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,960
mimicking the actions of a well-known

35
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:35,520
adversary or well-known threat actor or

36
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:38,240
tactics of an adversary right so that is

37
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:41,600
the the basic element of adversary

38
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:43,520
emulation or addresses simulation

39
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:46,000
adversity simulation could be

40
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,600
a continuous process it would help

41
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,920
organizations to

42
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:52,840
uh deal with an actual attack or a

43
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:55,280
threat actor in a good good

44
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:57,360
manner right

45
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,560
so i would do one thing i i could

46
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:03,119
compare uh addresses simulation to

47
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,119
martial art uh let's take karate for an

48
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:07,520
example so what is the purpose of a

49
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:10,239
martial art so that will strengthen your

50
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:12,959
body that will strengthen your mind in a

51
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:15,599
continuous process right finally you get

52
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,760
into a tournament or you get into a

53
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:20,080
real life maybe a street fight so you

54
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,080
could defend yourself in a pretty good

55
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,160
manner right so if you are getting into

56
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,400
a tournament you can also attack your

57
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:29,280
opponent right so that's how that's a

58
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,120
that's a purpose of a martial art so

59
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,000
i would compare addresses simulation

60
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,760
exercises to martial art

61
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,319
uh as i mentioned before like you know

62
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,239
when you get into your martial art uh

63
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:42,080
the very first thing you don't get to

64
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,959
fight your opponent on your first day at

65
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:47,280
a dojo or on a character right so you

66
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:49,760
get to the master will teach you how to

67
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,080
take a fall you know how to fall on your

68
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,840
back how to follow on your feet right

69
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,239
the very next thing would be

70
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:59,519
uh they will teach you uh hardening

71
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:02,560
exercises how to harden your body right

72
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:04,800
then uh then uh there will be uh attack

73
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,720
movements so you get to they'll teach

74
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,000
you how to find someone either to you

75
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,200
they will teach you how to you know

76
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,879
block uh your entire opponent's attacks

77
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,400
step like the different karate moves are

78
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:15,200
there hundreds of karate moves are there

79
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,720
right

80
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:20,080
all that is done

81
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:23,120
uh then there would be a sequence of cat

82
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,560
attacks they would call us uh cody just

83
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,519
cut us right

84
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:30,080
here we could compare the addressing

85
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:32,000
tactics as character movement

86
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,159
and the combination of character

87
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,360
movements which is a cutout can be

88
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:38,159
compared as attack simulation scenario

89
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,920
right

90
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:42,480
we know that different type of

91
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,879
addressing tactics form together to

92
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,560
create an attack scenario right

93
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:49,200
so let's take an example

94
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,680
of what what happens after you learn the

95
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,840
character movements and uh

96
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,120
or scenarios so you you get to fight

97
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,120
with someone right

98
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:00,159
so you will be uh getting

99
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,560
a sparring opponent a sparring friend

100
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:04,319
maybe someone from the same dojo some of

101
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,040
your friends or a colleague so you get

102
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:09,680
to carry out all these attack movements

103
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,200
against your opponent your sparring part

104
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,360
so in that way

105
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,840
you can fine tune all of your attack

106
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,880
tactics let's say uh your attack

107
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,959
movements

108
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,320
you know then you get to better yourself

109
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,280
right you get to better your attack

110
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,240
tactics or different tactics right

111
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,639
let's say

112
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,400
uh the character tournament is there so

113
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,800
what would karate tournament

114
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:33,040
uh or kumite so you could mention that

115
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:36,080
as uh compare that to

116
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:38,240
uh threat intel powered uh advocacy

117
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:41,120
emulation how is that

118
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,800
that means uh we know how we i mean when

119
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,960
he's going to be a tournament or who is

120
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,800
going to be your opponent right so you

121
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,560
get to fight against that you get to

122
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,880
fight against that person

123
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,880
in that case you get to train

124
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,199
to defend that person right

125
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,680
or you get to train yourself to

126
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,880
perform better the tournament

127
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,000
right

128
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:03,759
so then take an example of uh

129
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,759
a state fact or you are getting into a

130
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,840
real or someone is trying to attack you

131
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:10,000
on the street or something right so you

132
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,880
could compare that with an actual team

133
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,560
engagement if a organization

134
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:19,600
uh is getting interesting without having

135
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:22,639
proper defenses without having proper

136
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:24,800
attack tactics or different tactics

137
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:27,440
right that organization going to get

138
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,720
bullied pretty hard right that is on

139
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,199
side of it

140
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,440
so in that case if the organizations are

141
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:37,759
trained well uh using addressing

142
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:39,919
simulations you know uh trying to get uh

143
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:42,000
you know the betterment of their

144
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:44,000
different mechanisms when they get into

145
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,720
a straight fight they can defend

146
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,320
themselves pretty easily and maybe if

147
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,320
they are they are

148
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,000
trying to fall back out for on their

149
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:54,080
backs you can they can come up pretty

150
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,440
easily right so this would be a perfect

151
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,720
example to

152
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:01,280
explain addresses simulation right

153
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:04,240
so let's just say uh cannot a or any

154
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:06,880
other martial art digits or boxing when

155
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:09,199
it comes to certain self-defense they're

156
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:11,759
all going towards a certain goal right

157
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:14,240
similar to that adversary emulation or

158
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:16,800
simulation or threat termination they're

159
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,800
all going towards the same goal right

160
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,280
the betterment of our cyber defense

161
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:24,479
systems and uh you know betterment of

162
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:26,880
new addressing tactics or ttps right so

163
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:29,199
that would be a perfect example to

164
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,199
explain addresses solution to someone in

165
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:34,400
in an easy scenario with an easy

166
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:36,240
scenario right finally the goal of our

167
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:39,919
district village would be

168
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:42,240
uh to build a strong community of

169
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:44,080
researchers and organizations who are

170
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,000
putting together new means and

171
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,360
methodologies towards address

172
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,360
dissemination or

173
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,280
submission tactics

174
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,120
uh here our community our district

175
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,680
village can be considered as a character

176
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:58,560
dojo where all the offensive security

177
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,560
researchers or artistry could come in

178
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,360
share their knowledge collaborate on

179
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,160
different products different projects

180
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,919
and

181
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:09,360
you know sharpen their abrasive tactics

182
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:11,039
or ttps so that is on uh door of arduous

183
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,520
village

184
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:16,080
then uh now we can uh go back to the

185
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:19,360
argenta of adversary village this year

186
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:23,199
uh we are totally visual uh

187
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:24,080
at def con 29 there are going to be 24

188
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,319
talks

189
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:29,280
four different workshops three panel

190
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:31,039
discussions and on awesome ctf named

191
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:33,520
