1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,040
welcome to my presentation about fish

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:07,839
like an apt with the slogan phenomenal

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:10,080
pretext thing for persuasive fishing

4
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:12,799
in the next 30 minutes i'm going to

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:15,440
pitch why we need to think about what we

6
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:16,720
send in a fishing meal during adversary

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,199
simulation

8
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:21,199
um so first who am i

9
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,760
uh my name is sola masochist and i'm

10
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:26,000
from the netherlands uh i think that's

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,960
why my last name is so hard to pronounce

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,880
i guess

13
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,199
and i work in the red team and in the

14
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:33,760
research and infusion team so that means

15
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:37,280
i do red teaming but also advise

16
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:39,280
companies about threat intel and write

17
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,160
strategic reports

18
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:44,800
if i have to think about two things in

19
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,800
my career

20
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:50,000
in the apt or fishing field i think i

21
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,559
have two things i'm really proud of and

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,879
first one is that i once successfully

23
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:57,120
fished the white team so during a red

24
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:59,760
team we have we had to fish a couple of

25
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,480
people and i also sent one of the

26
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:05,600
messages to one person of the white team

27
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:07,840
so they know what we were doing and that

28
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:10,720
person well

29
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:13,040
that person knew that we were going to

30
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:15,759
send a fishing mail but still thought

31
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,759
this was a real and a legit one instead

32
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:20,320
of the fishing mill we were about to

33
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,720
send for uh for the for the simulation

34
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:25,360
so that's really nice i guess and the

35
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:28,400
second one is that i was the apg during

36
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:31,280
the biggest cyber crisis exercise

37
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:34,799
it was last june and i had to create an

38
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:37,280
attack for the well-known

39
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:40,079
country raspberry in the middle east so

40
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,560
i had to make up the ttps myself and

41
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:45,119
have had to create an attack um

42
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,439
targeting all governmental and vital

43
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:49,200
organizations of the netherlands so that

44
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:51,040
was really nice normally you do red

45
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,680
teaming for one company and now it was

46
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,680
96 though it was really a milestone in

47
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,719
my career so far

48
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:01,200
so fishing during adversary simulation

49
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:03,360
um well we know that fishing is a

50
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,680
commonly used technique to get initial

51
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,720
access research showed that i think

52
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:11,599
around 90 percent of attacks start with

53
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,280
uh with a phishing email with uh well a

54
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:16,480
weaponized um

55
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:19,920
document for example so if we look at

56
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:22,680
the mitre tech framework we see that uh

57
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:25,520
they have defined technique

58
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:27,680
t-1566 which is fishing and has three

59
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,440
slip techniques so the three sub

60
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,040
techniques are the spear fishing

61
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,360
attachment

62
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:36,160
so it's a fishing meal with

63
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,440
an attachment like a maldoc for example

64
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:41,120
or

65
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:43,200
archive um which is malicious so you

66
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,519
send an email to the victim add an

67
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:48,000
attachment that a victim opens the

68
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:50,480
attachments executes it and

69
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,720
then you infected the victim

70
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:55,040
the next one is the spear phishing link

71
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:57,680
so the email includes a link maybe to a

72
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,920
phishing website maybe for credential

73
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,440
harvesting login

74
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:05,120
page

75
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:08,570
also could be a link to a known

76
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,760
known surface for example so you um

77
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:11,599
[Music]

78
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,879
you

79
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:14,720
host

80
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:17,599
your malicious document

81
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:19,840
for example on google drive or dropbox

82
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:21,120
and the last one is spare phishing vs

83
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:25,440
surface and

84
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:28,159
i think you see that sometimes that um

85
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:30,080
attackers don't use email for delivering

86
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:32,879
your payload or for your weapon

87
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,760
delivering your weapon but also services

88
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,640
like

89
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:39,200
linkedin twitter

90
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:41,360
or telegram

91
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,760
and why do we do that why

92
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:47,360
why do attackers steal fish because it

93
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:49,599
just works every time um

94
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,159
well people still click on it it has a

95
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:54,959
great return on investment so why would

96
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:58,400
you not send as a spear phishing email

97
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,519
to to target an organization because

98
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,439
we

99
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:04,000
as humans

100
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:06,400
get a lot of email every day and we have

101
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,280
to decide every time whether it's a

102
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:11,519
legit email or a phishing email and we

103
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,200
have to decide in a split second and in

104
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:16,239
that split second

105
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:18,560
we have to check if it matches

106
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:20,000
everything we got your security

107
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,880
awareness training

108
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,720
so why do people click actually is

109
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:27,120
because we don't know

110
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,520
what a legit email or a phishing meal is

111
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,800
so we didn't get security awareness

112
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,120
trainings

113
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,240
um well that's really bad i think

114
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,000
everyone

115
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,199
must have a basic knowledge about

116
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,360
phishing emails um but yeah if you don't

117
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:43,680
know what a phishing email is or a legit

118
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,960
email you cannot distinguish them from

119
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,040
each other

120
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,000
well that's really bad and you don't

121
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,120
know

122
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,040
how to process that email the second one

123
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,960
it was is because the email is more

124
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,120
advanced than the

125
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:00,320
awareness training conference so what i

126
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:02,960
see is that training uh in security

127
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:06,639
awareness is sometimes really outdated

128
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:09,039
but also sometimes uh email is just way

129
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:11,280
more advanced and very very hard to

130
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:15,120
distinguish from um

131
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:17,680
yeah from a legit uh legit one um so

132
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,720
yeah your basic training is just not

133
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,000
enough

134
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,520
to see whether it's legit or not and the

135
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,360
last one is because you're just

136
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:29,919
distracted at the moment so yeah um

137
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:32,479
maybe you know everything about fishing

138
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:34,000
meals but you're running running kids

139
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:36,000
around the house because you're working

140
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,759
from home they kind of get to school

141
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,919
because of covert

142
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:42,800
uh you have annoying colleagues in teams

143
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:45,600
meetings all day and you still have to

144
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,600
clear your uh clear your inbox or you

145
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,600
didn't have your morning coffee yet so

146
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,759
you're not as sharp as you would like

147
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,880
and in that case sometimes you click on

148
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:56,240
something so that's why fishing works

149
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,199
for example

150
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:01,759
um

151
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:04,720
by influencing um as an attacker um

152
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:07,199
influencing your your emotions you make

153
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,039
easier decisions or a decision decision

154
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:11,759
making is way easier

155
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:13,919
because it associates new information

156
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:16,319
with existing patterns you already know

157
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:19,120
so like a little bit like mental

158
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:22,400
shortcuts and by mental shortcuts i do

159
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:24,880
not mean these shortcuts of course

160
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:28,960
so if you have a phishing email you want

161
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:31,440
to influence someone to click or to yeah

162
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,160
to to to interact with the email whether

163
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,840
it's

164
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:38,880
um login or download or whatever

165
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:41,120
give information so the influence is

166
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:43,039
based on the email itself it's not only

167
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:47,440
the text it's way more than the text in

168
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:48,400
the email itself so um it's about the

169
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,280
link

170
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:53,199
or the attachment so uh what how do you

171
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,840
influence clicking on the link is the

172
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:58,319
link is it the domain name domain name

173
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:02,880
that is known is it something typos

174
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:05,840
quoted for example is it a legit service

175
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:08,639
with hosted malware uh does it contain

176
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:12,080
an attachment um is that attachment

177
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:14,720
named like an attachment that should

178
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:18,000
be relevant for the for the recipient

179
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:21,039
for example um and next to that we have

180
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,720
the content so um next to the to the

181
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:26,400
page you have to contact how many meals

182
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:28,720
constructed um itself so the email body

183
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,960
um so i'm talking about the language

184
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,880
what language was used is the language

185
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:35,759
also the used language and the

186
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:38,000
organization does it have a design is it

187
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:40,960
plain text or is the copied corporate

188
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,280
identity from another known organization

189
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:45,759
or is it just neutral and does it

190
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:48,560
contain personal information sometimes

191
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:50,960
you see that it has to do the the

192
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:55,599
correct salutation so dear miss on the

193
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:57,680
mouse occurs or sometimes um it also has

194
00:07:55,599 --> 00:08:02,400
some some personal information like your

195
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:04,960
email or linkedin profile and such so

196
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:08,080
attackers also influence people by using

197
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,759
personal information of that person

198
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,080
they got from

199
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:14,400
from open source

200
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:17,199
and the last one is the context so

201
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:19,680
that's everything around the content and

202
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:21,520
debate and the attachment so that could

203
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,560
be who's the sender is it something

204
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:27,520
someone you know is it someone internal

205
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:30,479
in your organization is it a colleague

206
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:32,399
is it from a company you know it or is

207
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:33,200
the company you should know

208
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,240
no

209
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,479
um

210
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,959
those are all the possibilities what is

211
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:41,279
the theme of the email is the relevant

212
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:43,120
activity um or

213
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:46,000
is it something you really like is it

214
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:48,560
for charity you really like is it about

215
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,600
your hobbies is it about your recent

216
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:55,200
event uh is it the timeless activity

217
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:56,399
just like here's my payslip for example

218
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,560
and the goal

219
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:01,839
what is the goal of the attacker is

220
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:05,120
sending the message um is it getting

221
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:09,440
information uh by replying and sending

222
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:10,720
it sending you to a login page

223
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,200
maybe

224
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,160
get you a payment done

225
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,800
or

226
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:20,160
download an attachment somewhere so it

227
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:22,399
has different goals so if you

228
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,399
if you combine this all

229
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:27,040
uh you can get a gr you can create a

230
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:29,120
framework so uh that's this framework i

231
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:32,480
made this framework

232
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:35,120
next to the all these items i just uh i

233
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:37,760
just named um one of the most important

234
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:40,880
is the principle of influence so you can

235
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:44,000
apply principles of influence defined by

236
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:46,399
cialdini he has defined seven

237
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,440
principles of influence you can apply to

238
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:49,600
every

239
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,680
part of an email so the content to

240
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:55,200
contacts and um

241
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:56,160
and the debate for example so before i

242
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,839
start

243
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:01,440
telling about the principles of

244
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:05,200
influence on apt fishing males i'm going

245
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:07,760
to introduce introduce you to uh five

246
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:10,800
uh principles of influence in apt

247
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:13,680
fishing wheels well cieldini defined

248
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,920
seven but i think five are only suitable

249
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,800
for uh for emails so i'll show you a

250
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,839
couple

251
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:23,040
uh with a couple of uh of examples so

252
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:25,519
the first one is reciprocation

253
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:28,640
and that means that if i do something

254
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:30,560
for you you do something for me back um

255
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:33,440
well that's nice so

256
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:35,519
so um that's why i want to offer you

257
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:38,160
something so you do something back i

258
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:40,800
think you see that a lot in emails

259
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:43,519
um where they offer coupon if you

260
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:45,440
register or log in or something

261
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:49,200
but you also see them with in more

262
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:52,480
malicious meals by offering you helping

263
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:56,480
you and then asked for for a favor so in

264
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:57,360
this email i um notified someone that

265
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,279
the

266
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:02,079
their account was going to expire and

267
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:04,320
you have to log in to reactivate it well

268
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:06,959
as a recipient you're thinking okay

269
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:09,680
thank you for letting me know i will

270
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:11,600
definitely log in because you feel like

271
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:13,680
indebted somehow

272
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:16,000
so that's the first one

273
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,279
the second one is an email and it was

274
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,480
actually

275
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,360
highly

276
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,560
well

277
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:25,440
it was not copied but i was highly

278
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:28,480
influenced by uh by one of the apt

279
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:32,000
groups this was an email sent by lazarus

280
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:35,360
group uh in the cofit times and in the

281
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,120
email um they said

282
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,200
a package they sent out a package of

283
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,760
temporary timely and targeted measures

284
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,279
to support public services people and

285
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:46,079
businesses through this period of

286
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:47,120
disruption caused by government

287
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:50,320
um

288
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:51,360
so they are offering you a package to

289
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,240
help you

290
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:58,800
and the late last day to register your

291
00:11:54,240 --> 00:12:00,880
business is 2016 june 26 2020 by 2 pm

292
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,880
and this was sent in this in the same

293
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:06,240
week so actually

294
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:08,160
they want you to do something

295
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,920
in a short period of time and you call

296
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,440
it scarcity

297
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,920
so you offer something for a short

298
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:16,639
period of time people think we need to

299
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:18,240
do this we don't want to miss out and we

300
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:20,399
should click you also see that on

301
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,959
websites and the fishing mills oh only

302
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:25,200
one day left we only have limited stock

303
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:27,360
please buy from us

304
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:30,720
well there's a principle of influence

305
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:32,160
that is proven to to be a working

306
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:35,600
principle

307
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:37,920
um and then the third one is authority

308
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,800
and i think this is a really clear one

309
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:43,600
if someone sends you a mail from a

310
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:45,760
proven or known authority i think you're

311
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:48,000
more likely to click on that link or on

312
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:50,720
the attachment so in this

313
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:54,720
example i used the ceo

314
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:56,399
which is just like ceo fraud okay um you

315
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,160
must assure that all the pending deal

316
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:01,760
payment shall be completed by the end of

317
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:05,279
the day um this was uh

318
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:08,880
an example highly inspired by ta 505

319
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:10,959
email so i saw this email several times

320
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:13,120
asking if you could please do a payment

321
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:16,160
and payment instructions and information

322
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:18,800
was in the attachment um so this is one

323
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:22,160
that really works as well

324
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:24,160
and then uh the next one is the

325
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,279
principle of liking

326
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:29,120
if

327
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:31,519
someone has shared interest or you just

328
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:34,079
like someone because it's a colleague

329
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:36,959
it's a known person you are more likely

330
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:39,199
to interact with the email so now i made

331
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:42,399
an um made an email it was a little bit

332
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:45,600
inspired by an email of apt 28 uh where

333
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:47,440
i say ho ho ho it's almost christmas

334
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,440
and the elves are working really hard

335
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:53,199
and have a message for you and it was

336
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:55,440
sent by santa or the holiday committee

337
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:57,279
committee from the organization you

338
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,720
think i really like that person they

339
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:01,040
also really like

340
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:03,600
really nice christmas branches

341
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:06,959
i'm going to click on that link because

342
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:09,920
i want to see my christmas greeting

343
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:13,120
and the last one uh but definitely not

344
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:16,560
the least i really like this one is the

345
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:19,440
principle of social proof um

346
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:22,399
i have here an example it's a it's a

347
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:25,360
linkedin header and you maybe you think

348
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:27,680
okay but why is this principle social

349
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:30,800
proof this principle of social proof is

350
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:33,760
like if someone likes it and you really

351
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:36,800
know then you would also like it and

352
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,680
this one is inspired by also a lazarus

353
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:41,279
um

354
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:43,680
a lazarus attack um because there was a

355
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:45,839
person they created a person on linkedin

356
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:48,720
added a lot of your colleagues and then

357
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:50,800
wanted to chat with you so you check out

358
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:54,000
the connections the shared connections

359
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:57,040
and you see okay i have a lot of shared

360
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:00,399
connections so this person should be a

361
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:02,800
nice person or i could trust this person

362
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:04,880
so this is the way that they wanted to

363
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:07,839
influence the person receiving the

364
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:09,680
connection request from wilson

365
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:10,639
i think in the real

366
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,720
life

367
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:15,199
you also see this a lot on the website

368
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:18,720
booking.com they are really good

369
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:20,639
influencers because it's also known that

370
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,839
the principle of social proof is used on

371
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:26,800
the website by saying 40 people of your

372
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:29,920
country book this room today hurry up

373
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:32,240
hurry up um that's also

374
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:34,480
the principle of social proof because

375
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:36,800
you know that a lot of people from the

376
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,880
same country also booked that hotel so

377
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:42,320
it should be right right

378
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:44,560
so these are the principles of influence

379
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:47,199
and now i'm going to apply those

380
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:51,199
principles of influence and everything

381
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:54,639
what is in an email on emails of an apt

382
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:57,519
so first i need emails of an apt of

383
00:15:54,639 --> 00:16:00,959
course so i needed an adversary the

384
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:03,279
emails data set so first

385
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:06,639
okay i need adversaries which ones are

386
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:09,440
the most suitable for my research so

387
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:12,720
first check out all the adversaries who

388
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:14,399
have a fishing procedure uh defined well

389
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,399
you can check out the mitral tech

390
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:19,279
framework and you see that there are a

391
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:21,040
lot of uh adversaries using spearfishing

392
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:23,199
so that's really nice

393
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:25,279
second is okay

394
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:27,199
i need to

395
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:29,279
choose what kind of groups are

396
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:32,000
interesting for my

397
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:34,000
adversary emulation so during a sea vest

398
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,320
or a tiger you have to select a real

399
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,800
threat for the organization so i need a

400
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:41,440
real threat for the organization

401
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:43,759
what are the most uh

402
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:46,240
most likely threats for an organization

403
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:48,800
that's the insider threat a crime group

404
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:51,680
a nation state and a pro a nation to

405
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:54,079
estate slash proxy well insider threat

406
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:56,320
is not going to work if i want to do an

407
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:59,440
adversary simulation so i have prime

408
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:01,600
groups and nation states left so with

409
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,839
this information and

410
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:06,240
choosing

411
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:08,439
multiple groups over the world i came

412
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:12,959
with ta 505

413
00:17:08,439 --> 00:17:15,600
apt-28 apt40 and 80-38

414
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:18,160
so these are the four groups i selected

415
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:20,959
for my research because these are really

416
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:23,600
good groups we should use during our

417
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,480
next adversaries emulation

418
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,720
um

419
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,000
so how do i do the

420
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:31,679
research then

421
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,840
um i got a lot of emails

422
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:36,640
i got some from my pride intel

423
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:38,000
colleagues which are really badass in

424
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:41,039
gathering these

425
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,520
but i also found a lot on fire's total

426
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:46,480
because you can find for

427
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:49,840
attachments with attack attachment and

428
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:53,280
if you know the iocs of the

429
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:55,840
or the hashes of the malware docs you

430
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:57,120
can find the current email parent of

431
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,520
that of those

432
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:02,320
documents as well on various total if

433
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:06,480
you do some advanced searching so that's

434
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:10,240
why uh that's how i found 200 emails of

435
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:12,400
of apts um and the next one is getting

436
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,720
screenshots from research a lot of

437
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,960
companies uh did already a lot of

438
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:20,559
research on this uh one not on this

439
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:23,360
topic but on uh phishing um

440
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:25,280
of apts so they presented it in a

441
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:27,200
research report okay we saw a full

442
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:29,280
attack of this apt and it started with

443
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,200
this email so i gathered all the

444
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:33,679
screenshots of those

445
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:36,240
of those phishing emails and also used

446
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:38,000
it to enrich my first data set

447
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,720
and the last one is finding the

448
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,760
associated iocs

449
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:45,679
of these apts for example domains will

450
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:48,400
tell you how the phishing domains are

451
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:51,200
constructed if you find modocs you see

452
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:54,720
how they use the principle uh principle

453
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:57,280
of influence in the mahadox etc so find

454
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:59,200
also other information in other sources

455
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:02,400
about these apts

456
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:06,000
um so now we're going to apply the

457
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:07,039
research of principles of influence on

458
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,120
those

459
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:12,400
groups so first

460
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:14,320
my first one is uh russia so groups on

461
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:17,280
russia i'm going to start with the least

462
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:20,400
advanced to the most advanced

463
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:23,600
so i start with ta505 that's not really

464
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:26,880
an apt but i guess you also have to

465
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:29,200
emulate crime groups during uh cbs or

466
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:32,880
tiber so that's why i choose this one

467
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:35,520
it's tfta 505 located in russia and i

468
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:38,400
would call those this group hashtag lazy

469
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:40,880
mode it's really a lazy mode because

470
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:43,200
they're not really an influencer to be

471
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:46,640
honest so what i see

472
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:49,280
is that they use they don't use really

473
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:51,679
they don't use uh influencing techniques

474
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:53,919
in their mail they just say this email

475
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:56,640
is sent automatically or please see

476
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:59,840
attachment or please pay this by the end

477
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:02,400
of the day um so

478
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:03,760
yeah maybe a little bit of scarcity but

479
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,440
not really

480
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:07,679
that they're using

481
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,520
they are using the the principles of

482
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:12,159
influence in their meals

483
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:14,880
um also what i saw is that emails are

484
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:16,080
impersonal can be sent to anyone so

485
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,400
there is no

486
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:20,320
right information personal information

487
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,840
right salutation or whatever in the

488
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:24,080
email

489
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:26,320
next one and i think that's really funny

490
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:28,960
the sender email address uh is not

491
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:30,720
matching the sender name what ta 505

492
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:33,280
does is compromise a lot of email

493
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:35,120
accounts and sends emails from those

494
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:37,760
compromised email accounts

495
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:40,799
so that they have to dkm and the dmarc

496
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:44,240
set correct so it won't actually end up

497
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:46,000
in your spam folder so they send emails

498
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,480
from those compromised account but they

499
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,760
change the sender names of it so it

500
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:55,200
looks like it's the sender

501
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:57,679
and what they do is that they

502
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,679
add html attachments

503
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:01,360
or maldox's attachments and sometimes

504
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:04,159
they also host it

505
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:06,960
on a website i see this more nowadays

506
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:09,600
with the a505 because it's really hard

507
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:12,480
to evade these spam filters and fire

508
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:15,200
scanners and stuff like that so i have

509
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:17,840
three examples of those emails where you

510
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,520
can see the lazy mode with the sender

511
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:22,320
email address and the sender name so

512
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:24,960
this is the first one the second one and

513
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:28,159
the third one and you see it's

514
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:29,360
in all the three emails it's sent from

515
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:31,520
krishna

516
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,720
up but the email addresses are different

517
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,520
every time

518
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:38,480
so this is what ta505 does

519
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:40,480
let's go to a more advanced advanced one

520
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:43,120
and that's apt-28

521
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,720
um and what i see in apt-28 that they

522
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,720
use two

523
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:49,440
main principles of influence that's

524
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:51,840
principle of liking and an authority

525
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:54,159
because they are

526
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:55,679
they are using an external company a

527
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:58,400
known company

528
00:21:55,679 --> 00:22:00,559
copy everything from that and send

529
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,799
emails so they send

530
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:04,960
with spoofed domain names booth email

531
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:07,120
addresses for example or they use

532
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:09,200
authority by uh spoofing from an

533
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:12,080
internal colleague or

534
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,840
internal ceo or something so they use

535
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,919
the corporate uh

536
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:18,480
they use the corporate identity of

537
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:21,840
another organization like google or they

538
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:23,360
just use plain text or use the um

539
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,440
corporate identity used in the

540
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:27,520
organization they

541
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,480
are sending

542
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,919
from

543
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:33,200
sending from

544
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:36,159
um and what i see is that uh they

545
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:38,320
use domain names uh which are typos

546
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:40,640
quoted with predictable patterns so for

547
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,520
example when you have

548
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,080
a

549
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:47,120
subdomain they use their full name would

550
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:48,480
replace the subdomain by a dash so if

551
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:51,120
you have the website

552
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:55,360
onedrive.office365.com

553
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:56,480
they use the domain name office365

554
00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:00,799
dot com

555
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:02,640
so that's fun um and they use the tlds

556
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:05,600
of a domain name in the domain name

557
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:10,080
itself so for example one is nato.int

558
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:12,320
they use nato dash ins.com to make it

559
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,679
look legit and next to that they also

560
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:16,720
use the

561
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:20,559
the regular type of squad kind of things

562
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:22,799
like using an rn to be an m for example

563
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:25,200
so these are two examples this is the

564
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:28,640
first one it's by google uh this is the

565
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:30,480
one used to uh to disrupt the uh hillary

566
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:33,200
clinton campaign a couple of years ago

567
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:35,360
in usa and this is the second one here

568
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,919
you see that you use the

569
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:39,760
of liking someone has the same interest

570
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:42,799
this is really on your

571
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:45,840
uh it's a known authority in the same

572
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:48,799
area as where you work in so

573
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:51,520
they use it this kind of way

574
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:55,120
then the next one going over to china i

575
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:57,840
chose apt40 well i don't know if they're

576
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:59,039
still active uh if you see the news from

577
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:01,279
last week's

578
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:03,440
um so what do they use they use the

579
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:06,559
principle of liking and they pick

580
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:08,720
relevant themes for the recipient

581
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:12,640
so they use the local news they use

582
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:14,480
activities and events in their emails

583
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:16,480
and those are the main theme of the

584
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,559
fishing meals so

585
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:20,720
to do that in order to do that they do

586
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:22,640
profiling of the victim by using open

587
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,880
sources to get more information about

588
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,720
the victim and enrich the email with

589
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,400
that kind of information to make it more

590
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:31,120
relevant

591
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:34,400
and what i see that the level of the

592
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:37,919
fishing mill is really diverse so i see

593
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:41,840
typos all the way everywhere and i see

594
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:44,080
really well crafted emails so um well

595
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:45,360
maybe it's because there are a couple of

596
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:48,080
people with

597
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:50,480
diverse levels of sending emails but it

598
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:52,320
could also be that they have someone for

599
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:54,480
creating the well-crafted emails and

600
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:57,120
when you interact they don't have that

601
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,640
person so it's uh it's not that good

602
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,480
anymore

603
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:02,640
i want see season to use maldox and

604
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:05,840
attachment or hosted on google drive for

605
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:08,720
example and when they send you to their

606
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:11,200
own website or compromised website you

607
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:14,559
can download uh you can download one of

608
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:18,080
their uh their droppers and it downloads

609
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:20,799
a payload for you and redirects it to a

610
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:22,960
to a legit document they also packed

611
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:26,559
with it

612
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:31,360
and the last one and that's north korea

613
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:33,919
uh and it's it's 838 or lazarus group

614
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:35,039
and i think this is my favorite as long

615
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:37,919
as

616
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:41,039
if you can have a favorite apt but this

617
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:43,360
is definitely my favorite apt because it

618
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:45,440
knows how to social engineer

619
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:48,720
they are building full characters or

620
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:52,320
impersonating real people to influence a

621
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:56,320
person they literally use every

622
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:58,159
principle of uh of influence in their um

623
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:01,279
in their campaigns so they're using

624
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:03,760
email linkedin telegram or twitter uh

625
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:06,720
for communicating with the people so

626
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:10,559
first do your initial uh chat on

627
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:13,679
linkedin then go to telegram that was

628
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:15,520
described in the camp kid in the dream

629
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:17,279
job campaign

630
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,720
research

631
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:21,200
they always use

632
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:23,039
important value for the recipient

633
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:25,919
they do a lot they target a lot of

634
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:29,200
military organizations so they really

635
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:32,000
read a lot about military operations in

636
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:34,640
order to make it more uh legit uh they

637
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,159
spoof email addresses or create an

638
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:38,400
unknown company

639
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:41,600
so if you are a recruitment company you

640
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:43,600
can also just register a new domain name

641
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:46,400
and call your recruitment company that

642
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:48,799
way uh so that's what they do

643
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:52,480
and they use uh dropbox or onedrive for

644
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:54,320
a delivering mower as well and they are

645
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,279
adapting to the language and form of

646
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,760
speech

647
00:26:55,279 --> 00:27:00,320
but it's not always flawless

648
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:02,080
so um a couple of slides earlier i

649
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:03,360
showed you the rob wilson linkedin

650
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:06,320
profile

651
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:10,400
i created based on information in

652
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:12,000
research and this is um how it

653
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:14,720
um which

654
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,120
these are the next steps after someone

655
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:19,840
connected through with that brock wilson

656
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:21,360
you see that it sends a sense a message

657
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:23,760
i like to chat with you for a job

658
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:27,120
opportunity and then bonds with the

659
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:29,919
person and then add them on on telegram

660
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:32,799
and have some uh have some conversations

661
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:35,440
this one is one is about an assessment

662
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:37,840
someone needs to do in order to check if

663
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,720
it has the right expertise

664
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:41,679
and

665
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:43,440
send someone to a website

666
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:46,159
this was

667
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:48,000
this was covered in in the research of

668
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:51,360
this company

669
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,640
so concluding during your next adversary

670
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:55,600
emulation

671
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:58,320
i would please ask you just not grab the

672
00:27:55,600 --> 00:28:01,120
default scenario from the shelf you have

673
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:02,720
you always use because it just works

674
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:05,600
please use your

675
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:08,320
creativity and create something that's

676
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:11,840
really like the the adversary you have

677
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:14,480
to emulate during uh during uh

678
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:17,440
the assignment um

679
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:20,320
check uh influence by using the content

680
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:23,840
of the of the email and the context uh

681
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:26,240
so not only uh change the um the text of

682
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:28,640
the email but make it a full package

683
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,679
check if there's a design check if they

684
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:33,200
um

685
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:36,000
they use uh typo squad domains etc

686
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:39,200
um but keep in mind

687
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:41,760
when you're performing an adversary

688
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:44,159
emulation you have maybe a couple of

689
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:46,080
weeks maybe a couple of months uh real

690
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:48,559
adversaries have like

691
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:50,480
a couple of months or years to perform

692
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:53,360
the attack so keep this in mind

693
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:55,679
sometimes you have to make choices based

694
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:57,440
on the time you have so sometimes you

695
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:59,840
have to have to make it a little bit

696
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:03,520
more advanced in order to have someone

697
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:05,360
click uh on the link or execute or open

698
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:07,440
uh your attachment

699
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:10,159
so if you want to read a little bit more

700
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:11,919
about this uh research uh or you want to

701
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:15,440
use it during your next adversary

702
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:18,720
emulation you can go to to my blog

703
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:20,880
it's uh here with the link and i made

704
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:23,200
for the four um

705
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:26,320
adversaries i made a full list with

706
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:29,039
examples what to use or what not to use

707
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:31,840
during your next fishing campaign

708
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:33,600
so this was my presentation i hope you

709
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:36,080
liked it and if you have some questions

710
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:39,279
