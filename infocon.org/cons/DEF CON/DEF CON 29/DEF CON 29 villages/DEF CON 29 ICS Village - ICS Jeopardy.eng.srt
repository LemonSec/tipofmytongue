1
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:07,120
so

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,440
everyone welcome this is jeopardy

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:10,240
industrial

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,360
control systems security style my name

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,160
is mary brooks and i am your host today

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,160
r.i.p trebek i will not be nearly as

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,439
good as you

8
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:21,920
so the rules of the game today are very

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:22,480
simple

10
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,920
they're pretty much the same as for a

11
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,840
normal game of jeopardy with

12
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,160
a few distinctions when the question

13
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,760
comes up on the screen you will have the

14
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:30,720
chance to buzz

15
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,880
in on your phone everyone show me your

16
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,559
phone and that you've got the buzzer

17
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:38,320
ready to go this is not a camera do not

18
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,200
look at the sticker

19
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,160
after three seconds of waiting the

20
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,920
buzzer is going to unlock

21
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,840
and you can shoot your shot by buzzing

22
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,520
in to answer the question

23
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,360
i will be reading the question out loud

24
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,039
but you can cut me off

25
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,120
if you decide that you know it faster

26
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,120
than i can finish speaking

27
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,600
um you'll have a further 10 seconds

28
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,039
after you buzz in

29
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:02,960
to answer the question before the whole

30
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,239
thing cuts off so

31
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:05,438
it's not a lot of time if you're not

32
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:07,119
good under pressure but it's plenty of

33
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:08,000
time for it to get

34
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,280
really awkward if you don't know the

35
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,600
answer to the question

36
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,159
when that's what we'll be waiting for

37
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:15,200
yeah

38
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,960
when you buzz in you have to finish

39
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,880
answering within five seconds

40
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,479
um no take backs if you start to say an

41
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,320
answer you got to continue with it

42
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,159
if someone answers incorrectly everyone

43
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:26,159
else gets a chance to buzz in

44
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:27,840
and there will be two rounds like in

45
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,280
regular jeopardy plus

46
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,560
a final jeopardy question there are

47
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,200
only three distinctions from regular

48
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,320
jeopardy

49
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,320
the first is that double jeopardy is

50
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,000
just an automatic doubling of points

51
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,640
awarded

52
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,159
i don't know i didn't make the system

53
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,159
and no one wanted to create a bespoke

54
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,680
jeopardy application for me so what

55
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,880
that's just what we're going to have to

56
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:47,759
do

57
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,920
the next thing is that there is no panel

58
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,040
of judges

59
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,840
so if you disagree with me on anything

60
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,240
the

61
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,799
only way um that you can get the points

62
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:57,920
back is by

63
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,759
fighting me for them so just really

64
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,000
angrily respond

65
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,920
you know present proof say i was there

66
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,439
in the room and you're wrong

67
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:08,720
angry angry angry tweet at her with yes

68
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,720
angry tweets um you guys have better

69
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,160
twitter followings than me

70
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,120
so i won't support it flip it can we

71
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,959
make twitter the jedis can we stand up a

72
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:19,520
live twitter poll

73
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,280
no because this is recorded

74
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,000
live for now not live for when they play

75
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,840
it christopher

76
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,520
also if you can get your other teammates

77
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,879
on the panel to

78
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,879
tell me that i'm wrong that's extra

79
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,080
points but obviously they have an

80
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,200
incentive

81
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,640
to tell you that you're wrong you're

82
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,040
always wrong yeah

83
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,080
yeah you get the point all right and

84
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,840
then again just a final reminder that

85
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,599
the third difference is i do not have to

86
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:46,879
finish reading the question before you

87
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:47,599
can buzz in

88
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:52,319
just go for it does that all make sense

89
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,239
yes yeah sure awesome okay

90
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,920
so let me start by introducing our

91
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,120

chris is prolific on twitter where he

97
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:15,920
regular regularly posts

98
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,120

i'm wearing flip-flops right now so

104
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:30,799
that'd be no

105
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,040
deeply disappointing all right not off

106
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,560

electric

110
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,959
it is a lesser known fact that maggie

111
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:43,280
was

112
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,040

jokes as a service

116

so give her a follow on twitter as well

117
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:53,519
as

118
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,680
chris goes back to his luddite days of

119
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,280
these scientific times

120
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,720
from 1819 was it chris 1890

121
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,599
1890 excellent last but not least

122
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,680
tatiana bolton

123
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,720
give us a wave or a hook as it were

124
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,120
she's the former cyber security policy

125
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:11,840
lead at

126
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,519
the department of homeland security's

127
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,360
sisa not sisa sissa

128
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,120
always sissa right tatiana that's

129
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,120
correct always sissa i'll fight you

130
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,040
about it

131
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,440
don't cross tatiana or the hook and a

132
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,280
policy director at the cyberspace

133
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,400
solarium commission um tatiana loves to

134
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,440
ballroom dance

135
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,560
and she has not one not two

136
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,120
not three but four children i think

137
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,360
that's one fewer than kris krebs

138
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,120
oh that's correct there you go that

139
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,880
could have been a question

140
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,280
could have been a question um and before

141
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,080
you ask

142
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,120
yes she is my boss and i did offer her a

143
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,880
copy of today's questions in exchange

144
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,680
for a raise

145
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,160
which she declined so you're all on the

146
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,080
same playing field

147
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,880
so finally last thing is the prizes so

148
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,759
behold here you have

149
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,479
first prize this is the joystick of

150
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,880
honor

151
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,039
moves in four directions you can set it

152
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:09,120
on your desk or something i don't know

153
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,400
what's chris's face right now the hard

154
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:12,880
hat

155
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,479
of mediocrity with a promise

156
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,840
and then finally the supply vest

157
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:26,000
of you know sadness

158
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,360
shame sadness

159
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,680
on it at the very end it says

160
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,919
so the hard head of mediocrity is

161
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,320
probably preferable don't be lost

162
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,520
all right any questions

163
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,400
no bonus points if we wear either of the

164
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,960
last two during a real life compliance

165
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,960
audit and take a picture

166
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,440
yes you will have to resend that um

167
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,039
you'll have to submit it retroactively

168
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:54,000
to twitter and then

169
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,759
i will automate automatically make you

170
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,520
win so it doesn't matter if it's like a

171
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,880
year two years from now

172

00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,759
data exchange

208
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,680
oh telephone pbx adx gotcha

209
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,720

00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,879
to introduce our categories my

211
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,199
significant apologies and we will

212
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,000
start with that so first category ics

213
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,800
and the middle east

214
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,560
give me the industrial patrol system

215
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,879
related vulnerability or event that

216
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:05,440
happened

217
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,120
somewhere in the region loosely defined

218
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,919
as the middle east by americans

219
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:12,720
two if only or that easy you will tell

220
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,199
me

221
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,400
the simple solution to fix all your isds

222
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,440
problems

223
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,919
third is alphabet city you're gonna give

224
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:21,840
me the full phrase of the abbreviation

225
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,039
or acronym

226
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,520
fourth is colonial pipeline in the usg

227
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,800
that may or may not be

228
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,160
tatiana's soul category depending on

229
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,159
nda restrictions by our other two

230
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,200
players

231
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,640
and finally the last is dune apparently

232
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,559
it's mandatory to read this book if you

233
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,599
care about

234
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,440
uh industrial control systems is that

235
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,880
true

236
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,720

one

241
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,640
all right well let's go colonial

242
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,480
pipeline on the usg for

243
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,600
200 trebek

244
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,399
the ransomware targeted colonials it is

245
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:04,880
believed

246
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,800
this trend in which business computers

247
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,080
are linked into control

248
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,160
systems that contributed to the pipeline

249
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,640
shutdown

250
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,230
it's really easy yeah i know

251
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:18,320
[Music]

252
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,279
um what is

253
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:25,110
i-t-o-t convergence

254
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:28,210
[Music]

255
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,600
i think she got the answers in advance

256
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,279
she got the answers in it no i told you

257
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:34,720
i held it hostage for a raise and she

258
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,160
didn't give it to me so i can't buy

259
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,080
shoes and she can't answer the questions

260
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,440
works out tatiana next to you i'll go

261
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,600
colonial pipeline of the usg for 300

262
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,600
please

263
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,360
new guidance was issued following the

264
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,959
colonial pipeline hack

265
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:50,959
to whom in the federal government are

266
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:53,200
pipeline operators required to report a

267
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:53,760
breach

268
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,600
maggie essay

269
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,440
wait do you have to do that

270
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,519
yeah oh mary i did this card

271
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,160
yeah sorry you missed this that's sad

272
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,200
that's that scratch

273
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,079
i was definitely gonna say scissor so if

274
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:12,399
you're

275
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:13,839
definitely gonna say it tatiana well why

276
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:15,839
don't you pick the next

277
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:17,600
to be fair if there's an error it goes

278
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,200
back to the previous person thinking i

279
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,200
will go colonial pipeline in the usg for

280
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,959
400 please

281
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:25,120
all right colonial pipeline had not

282
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,440
implemented this login verification

283
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,880
system for its accounts when it was

284
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:29,600
breached

285
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,680
leading some in congress to criticize it

286
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,239
harshly

287
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:38,160
for those with nda's reporting reports

288
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,839
that it had not done this tatiana uh

289
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:47,839
what is two-factor authentication

290
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,880
must remain silent

291
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,399
oh no okay what is

292
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,680
if only it were that easy for 200

293
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,720
trebek this term

294
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,640
is a measure of how quickly a system can

295
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,079
be brought back online

296
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:10,440
following an incident chris

297
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,000
[Music]

298
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,079
so is it a term or an abbreviation can i

299
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:15,839
ask that question

300
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,760
um it was a term but if it's the correct

301
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,320
abbreviation it's a

302
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,519
mean time between failure

303
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,839
mtbf god you're thinking way too

304
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:26,720
sophisticated

305
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,839
i i think you're right

306
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,320
but it's really simple can you can you

307
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,320
extend

308
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,920
i mean yeah i think

309
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,519
resilience just bringing it back all

310
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,360
night what

311
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,480
no one uses that term

312
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,560
that's fair chris's answer is correct

313
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,600
we're sicilian resilience would mean it

314
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,600
would never fail in the first place

315
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,079
that's true it's makes you feel better

316
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:57,120
when i saw

317
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,240
the adx for alphabet city i thought it

318
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,160
was supposed to be airports an air

319
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,399
airport code yeah i would say you're

320
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,560
like

321
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,920
all right negative 200. all right uh

322
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,600
let's uh let's do if only we're that

323
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,160
easy

324
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,440
for 500 all right

325
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,600
here goes don't look at me kaspersky or

326
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,760
this practice warns certain scanning

327
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,040
software to skip it

328
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:38,560
chris what is antivirus antivirus

329
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,839
exclusion list okay same thing well you

330
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:43,360
put that in the do not scan

331
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,480
folder yeah

332
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,600
all right um

333
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,760
if only we're that easy 400

334
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,240
nist has warned against this practice

335
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,240
explaining that system security should

336
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,079
not depend on the secrecy

337
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,160
of the implementation or its components

338
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,760
maggie

339
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,839
security by obscurity

340
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,519
to you maggie

341
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:17,120

00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,200
in the dune series this is the

first half winner is maggie

567
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:32,640
and we will now be copying these over

568
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,320
because the date the game does not allow

569
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,240
you to do two at once

570
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:40,880
oh so we

571
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,760
call this our commercial break all right

572
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,559
so i've

573
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:47,039
now re-entered your points so right now

574
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:48,799
in the first half of the game

575
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:51,520

um

586
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,039
all right we'll allow the person with

587
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:19,440
the fewest amount of points to lead off

588

right 400.

746
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,039
the number of lines of code that were

747
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:07,360
used in aurora to blow up the generator

748
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:11,279
chris i think it was 19

749
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,760
dang it maggie 27 nope

750
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:20,480
tatiana i'm not losing 400 points

751
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,678
it was none

752
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:29,760
what that's

753
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:33,039
how's that possible uh

754
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:35,760
well you might find me on this one but

755
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,120
keep going ask the next one

756
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,039
they had to reprogram the switch

757
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:40,840
engineering labs

758
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:44,159
relay to fix it right

759
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:47,519
to to make it go bad anyway

760
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:50,640
they had to use anyway all right 500 uh

761
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,159
aurora

762
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:53,360
type of vulnerability that was

763
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:56,320
weaponized in aurora chris well

764
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,080
there could be two answers it had

765
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,559
default passwords in the relay

766
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:05,200
or also the uh the vulnerabilities

767
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,559
was being able to change

768
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:12,960
the settings with no authentication

769
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:16,320
i mean dave default

770
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:20,000
credentials or a password

771
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,120
i actually don't know if that was an

772
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,159
additional one i was looking for

773
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:24,320
something slightly different um if you

774
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,080
can google it and show me that i will

775
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:29,279
okay well um the other vulnerability was

776
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:33,440
is uh it was had to do with electrical

777
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,559
engineering

778
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:38,080
um so it was closing a breaker out of

779
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:42,399
out of sync for that reason

780
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:45,279
we said it had no lines of code because

781
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:46,880
it was just closing it out of sync

782
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:50,159
oh yeah they had to change the code in

783
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:52,320
the

784
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,440
okay so we'll give you guys both points

785
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:00,000
back for that

786
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:05,840
she's such a benevolent dictator no i'm

787
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,120
just not going to fight with people who

788
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,440
may have investigated it

789
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,000
oh we just saw at the time i was at the

790
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,599
power company we had to go change all of

791
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:15,040
our passwords

792
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:18,000
oh and yank all remote access it's

793
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,079
probably a good thing

794
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:24,079

849
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:56,879
we all knew that yeah yeah

850
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,280
he was cried at the tip of my tongue if

851

i saw my controls just

852
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,880
trying to talk to that tld i'd be

853
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:03,839
worried

854
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:06,880

857
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:12,079
nice they probably got substations

858

getting increasingly popular it's like a

866
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,280
little boutique stamp of

867
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:36,400
might be hacked mary i

868
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,440

871
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:44,720
fake

872
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,440
i just saved into our street dot ai with

873
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,680
my oh so i get to

it's your turn this is gonna be a super

876
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,160
fun one if you like framework potpourri

877
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,640
for 100.

878
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,480
arguably the most popular security

879
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,320
framework this government driven setup

880
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,160
has a framework core

881
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:07,839
chris cyber security framework

882
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:11,599
hi nist nist

883
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:18,000
christie uh framer potpourri for 200.

884
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,079
this proprietary framework models the

885
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:22,640
behavior of cyber adversaries

886
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:26,720
chris the miter attack

887
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,079
framework um

888
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:33,280
framework ready for 300.

889
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:37,119
this 2002 act updated in 2014 gives dhs

890
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:38,480
official authority over the federal

891
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:41,760
government's i.t practices

892
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:46,880
titanic isn't this your like job

893
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,320
i want to guess but i'm not going to hit

894
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:51,520
the button i mean i don't want to

895
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:55,040
no sure go for it

896
00:38:55,040 --> 00:39:01,119
um the

897
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:03,839
i don't know the dhs act that's not that

898
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:05,440
was in 2003 the

899
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:08,320
cyber security

900
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:14,000
i don't know fisma

901
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,280
security management act

902
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,520
all right christie framework potpourri

903
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:22,079
for 400.

904
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,560
a set of standards focused on protecting

905
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,320
the bulk power grid

906
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:30,800
chris yeah it's going to be a nerf ship

907
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:36,240
and the last one 500.

908
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,920
the international series of standards

909
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,760
for industrial control systems

910
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:44,640
chris isa 62443

911
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,920
well deserved 500 points

912
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,800
all right so it is the final jeopardy

913
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,760
time

914
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,520
aka final factor because apparently they

915
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,680
don't have the rights to jeopardy

916
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:58,160
so you can either enter your wager on

917
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,839
your own device or you can tell me and i

918
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:10,319
will enter it myself

919
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:12,160
chris we're waiting on you i i know i'm

920
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,359
doing some math here

921
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:15,759
go ahead

922
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:23,119
schneider would say all right

923
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:25,760
all right you have 30 seconds for this

924
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:28,240
question

925
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:31,839
this security model which happens to be

926
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:33,599
a homophone with a major chicken

927
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:35,040
processing company

928
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,440
includes one or more demilitarized zones

929
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,200
in its architecture and defines

930
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,610
different levels of critical

931
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:50,839
[Music]

932
00:40:50,839 --> 00:40:53,839
infrastructure

933
00:40:53,890 --> 00:40:58,870
[Music]

934
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:03,920
all right tatiana i start with

935
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:07,040
you i think that's just said blockchain

936
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,400
just tell me what you said i have to

937
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,160
reveal it oh

938
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:13,680
uh i just said that you got it right

939
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:17,040
well you have to hit click see answer is

940
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:20,800
tyson we'll fix that in a minute

941
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:24,079
all right maggie what did you say purdue

942
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:25,599
model

943
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:31,280
that is correct you wagered 2300

944
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:36,720
and chris purdue model as well

945
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:43,760
the winner is team chris

946
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:47,760
so overcoming the adversity of the nda's

947

have to read it

952
00:41:56,319 --> 00:41:58,000
there's supposed to be a new doom movie

the vest that's sound i'm actually

961
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,280
i'm actually very excited for this hat

962
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,040
yeah because you talked about blockchain

963
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:23,920
in your research

964
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:28,400
and i have to wear the vest of sadness

965
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,280
and

966
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,599
infuriating i i need that controller

967
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:33,920
what do i get to control with it though

968
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:36,160
usually you won't it's actually fully

969
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,119
functional

970
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:40,560
um so you bought it out of china though

971
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:43,119
so i'm probably controlling something

972
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:44,240
around the world

973
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:46,640

974
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:47,359
industrial

975
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:50,560
control system somewhere but uh barbecue

976
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:51,599

jeopardy that kind of turned into

996
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,599
