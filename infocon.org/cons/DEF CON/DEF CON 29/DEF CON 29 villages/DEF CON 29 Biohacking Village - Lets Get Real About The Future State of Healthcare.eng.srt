1
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,240
hey there biohacking village thanks this

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,160
opportunity to speak today my name's

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,719
quadi and the name of my talk today is

4
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:12,160
there and back again a healthcare

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,240
cybersecurity policy tale

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,280
uh we're going to go ahead and get

7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,680
started

8
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,760
a little bit about myself before i begin

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,080
uh first and foremost i'm a hacker so i

10
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,840
grew up in the hackers space

11
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,400
i go to hacker conferences i

12
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,160
really identify with the hacker mindset

13
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,400
and i use a lot of the same skills and

14
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,600
tools as hackers to do my day job

15
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,200
which is actually being an emergency

16
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,120
medicine doctor so

17
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,879
most of the time when i'm at work i'm in

18
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,280
the emergency department taking care of

19
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,879
all sorts of sick patients that come to

20
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:44,800
me whether or not they'd be having heart

21
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,719
attacks or strokes or having severe

22
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,120
infections like sepsis or over the last

23
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,120
year and a half or so been having

24
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,440
coveted infections

25
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,079
uh really combining those two worlds was

26
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:57,680
something that i've had the tremendous

27
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,320
honor of being able to do so i am both a

28
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,320
hacker and a doctor combine those

29
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,440
together

30
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,840
it really guides my research

31
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,240
so i do some active research on medical

32
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,840
device vulnerabilities hospital

33
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,439
infrastructure vulnerabilities and the

34
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,680
point of that really being i care a lot

35
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,520
about patient privacy and security but i

36
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,799
care more about

37
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,960
their health and safety and that cyber

38
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,360
attacks including transfer attacks are

39
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,119
impacting my patient's health and i want

40
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:24,320
to study that

41
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,799
i'm also unapologetically a geek sorry

42
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,640
not sorry you're going to see a lot of

43
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,799
geeky meme references in my presentation

44
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,159
and i'm sorry you're going to have to

45
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,520
deal with that

46
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,920
my twitter account is at cdmfmd hit me

47
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,479
up if you have questions

48
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:40,799
so

49
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,799
when contemplating what to speak about

50
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,640
today i had a lot of different things i

51
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,320
could go over i could talk about some

52
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,159
new research that came out i could talk

53
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,360
about some new aspect of the problem

54
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,799
that people might not understand from a

55
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,680
clinical workflow situation but really

56
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,680
the more and more i thought about it the

57
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,840
more i felt kind of hopeless

58
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,159
and it's that the

59
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,119
problem has not changed much since we

60
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:07,439
started talking about this right

61
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,639
hospitals are still under attack

62
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,720
in fact the ransomware attacks of the

63
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,200
last several years are increasing in

64
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,280
frequency sophistication disruptive

65
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,560
potential that's not going away

66
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,400
and then medical devices you know there

67
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,239
has been a lot of work done by the fda i

68
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,480
see maybe a shimmering uh glimmer of

69
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,959
hope in the future for uh really

70
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:31,120
improving the medical device

71
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,519
cyber security posture but with that

72
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:35,040
being said there's still a lot of

73
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,959
operational issues a lot of problems

74
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,720
with legacy medical devices and as a

75
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,040
consequence what we have is pretty much

76
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,959
the same damn conversation that we've

77
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,200
been having uh for the last 10 years on

78
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,760
this and um what what i wanted to do

79
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,800
with this talk is to say okay well uh

80
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,120
we've admired this problem uh so long

81
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,040
we've danced around some potential

82
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,840
solutions most of those uh we say are

83
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,360
call to action you know do something

84
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,959
about it but what are we talking about

85
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,760
would be required to actually

86
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,080
make this problem even a little bit

87
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,120
better at a scale that would matter

88
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,040
so i hope today to talk a little bit

89
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:11,920
about

90
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,599
maybe moving in a little bit of a

91
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,680
different direction and realizing that

92
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,599
um although it's very important for

93
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,519
hackers uh in the community to get

94
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,840
involved we're only so we can only do so

95
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,840
much and truly we need to be talking

96
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,879
about really big solutions uh to try to

97
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,120
move this needle

98
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,560
so

99
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,040
i think to reframe the problem is that

100
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,680
we're continued we're continually

101
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,080
having these issues and uh not having

102
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,879
much improvement we're pissed off and

103
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,879
we're tired

104
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:45,840
and that's not a dangerous combination

105
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,760
uh to have people not care about this

106
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,239
problem as much as they should and you

107
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:51,599
can ask a lot of people in the space i

108
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,200
think they feel the same way and they

109
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,599
work so hard to try to move the needle

110
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:59,200
and it doesn't really work

111
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,760
so the other thing to say is well hold

112
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,680
on a second is this even a fixable

113
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,720
problem and i think that the answer is

114
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,400
of course

115
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,560
you know you can't fix cybersecurity

116
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,319
vulnerabilities

117
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,200
that's not the nature of the problem

118
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,040
there are going to be inevitable flaws

119
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,358
in hardware and software uh that are

120
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:20,880
going to allow for vulnerabilities and

121
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,040
exploitation of those vulnerabilities to

122
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,560
change the function

123
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,479
of a system to where it wasn't intended

124
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,639
so this discussion that you know we need

125
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,639
to finally push this boulder to the top

126
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,800
of the mountain and then we'll fix this

127
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,880
issue we can move on is one that is just

128
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,199
not based in reality

129
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,880
instead what we should be understanding

130
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,360
is that we have a particularly

131
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,040
vulnerable

132
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,800
set of circumstances right now that we

133
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,479
need to fix and then we need to

134
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,800
establish sound policy and a good

135
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,160
foundation

136
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,479
to not fix this issue of healthcare

137
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:53,919
cybersecurity or vulnerable medical

138
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,639
devices but to instead be able to reduce

139
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,880
the risk to an acceptable level

140
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,280
so that we can take care of patients

141
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,120
patients get the care that they need you

142
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,400
know in a hospital in their clinic

143
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,000
wherever it may be

144
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,440
and the risk

145
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,759
of a large cyber attack disrupting that

146
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,840
and impacting their safety or their data

147
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,160
is greatly reduced so what is that going

148
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,919
to actually require it's not going to be

149
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:18,560
a fix we're not going to finally

150
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,479
do some legislative action or finally

151
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:21,680
some hackers are going to stand up and

152
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,880
it's going to be fixed instead this is

153
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,680
going gonna be something we're dealing

154
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,560
with a very long time and if we actually

155
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,320
take a little bit of an outward case of

156
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,680
it uh we could fix a vast majority of

157
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,960
the problems we have now of course there

158
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,880
will be new ones but then we have to

159
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,400
really look at a global approach and

160
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,680
understand how we tackle this issue not

161
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,919
just in the united states but across the

162
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:44,320
globe that's also a very very hard

163
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,520
problem so

164
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,600
a little bit of a continuation of the

165
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,759
we're pissed off and we're tired but i

166
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,080
think if anything it should encourage us

167
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,039
to be renewed in our

168
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:57,520
enthusiasm to try to try to make this

169
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,719
problem at least a little bit better

170
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,360
the first things i wanted to bring up

171
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,280
you know quite frankly is that we have

172
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,600
very little data

173
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,000
this is a problem

174
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,280
you know we can't make meaningful

175
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,639
decisions

176
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,639
and really get to the heart of an issue

177
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:19,280
if we can't even measure how big the

178
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,639
problem is

179
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,240
you know there are

180
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,520
many possibilities in this one that

181
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,120
the data if we thought it would show

182
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,120
that cyber security risks to patient

183
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,759
safety and care quality are overblown

184
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,520
that's a possibility

185
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,160
and that all of this energy and

186
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,919
time and technology and money that we

187
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,080
put into trying to make this problem

188
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,919
better could actually be better spent by

189
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,880
giving it to cancer research for example

190
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,800
um that's one possibility the other

191
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,560
possibility is that

192
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,440
there is

193
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,639
much

194
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,039
patient harm going on right there's uh

195
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:54,240
to the degree that we don't even

196
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,000
understand

197
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,840
and currently can comprehend there may

198
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,000
be drastic impacts of patient safety and

199
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,400
care quality to where this is a really

200
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,599
meaningful

201
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:07,199
thing to focus on and to work to improve

202
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,360
the truth probably lies somewhere in

203
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,400
between but again if we can't even

204
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,360
collect the basic data

205
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,599
we can't even measure the magnitude of

206
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:20,639
the problem it's unreasonable for us to

207
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,720
expect to have a decent solution

208
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,639
what is that going to mean for us moving

209
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,479
forward well we're going to have to

210
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,800
collect that data there are a lot of

211
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,160
problems

212
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,479
with that first of all

213
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:36,560
when i went to go write a paper i went

214
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,280
to go see if there was a centralized

215
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,919
repository or a database of ransomware

216
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,720
healthcare attacks right i want to see

217
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,120
really how prelim this was and most of

218
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,120
what i was getting are industry reports

219
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,039
there are companies that have a vested

220
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,720
interest in selling products and

221
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,960
services around ransomware protection or

222
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,720
response or mitigation whatever it may

223
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,440
be

224
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,120
and uh that they

225
00:07:59,120 --> 00:07:59,919
use

226
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:02,160
their methodology to try to extract the

227
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,240
magnitude of the issue and um it's

228
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,240
better than nothing for sure but what i

229
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,919
would suggest we need is a more rigorous

230
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:11,840
approach to collecting this data a more

231
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,160
academic and scientifically validated

232
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,199
process why when we collect even

233
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,840
something as basic as uh how many

234
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,960
hospitals are getting hit with

235
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,639
ransomware and what are the impact and

236
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,479
magnitude of that

237
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,639
of those attacks the first thing i'm

238
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,080
going to kind of throw a wrench into

239
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,599
here is the discussion of whether or not

240
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,680
there should be mandatory reporting this

241
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,599
is not a easy thing to suggest or uh it

242
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:36,799
is so

243
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,399
obvious a solution to our problems

244
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,919
instead it's just a first step into

245
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,399
discussing you know would something like

246
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,159
if you're infected with a ransomware at

247
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,519
a hospital you have to report to a

248
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:48,000
centralized agency you know for example

249
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,760
when you were hit when you fully

250
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,959
recovered

251
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:52,480
what you were hit with and perhaps if

252
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,240
you paid the ransom and how much those

253
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,279
basic demographic type of things um

254
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:58,880
aren't present and i think what we

255
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,440
should be focusing on is how can we

256
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,399
encourage an environment where reporting

257
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:06,800
of this isn't disincentive and

258
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,519
disincentivized what do i mean by that

259
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:12,240
because ransomware attacks involve often

260
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,560
protected health information

261
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,279
many hospitals immediately after being

262
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,839
hit by ransomware do not discuss the

263
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:21,279
specifics of the ransomware they're

264
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:22,880
trying to recover they're trying to

265
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,360
negotiate potentially a ransom payment

266
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,440
they're trying to show up their systems

267
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,800
uh they and they are also afraid of a

268
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,279
violation of hipaa and a big fine

269
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,519
those are all kind of a perfect storm

270
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,200
for

271
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,320
hospitals and other healthcare

272
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,680
organizations to not want to have to

273
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,760
talk about this so how do we

274
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,640
destigmatize this as well as allow an

275
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,279
environment where reporting isn't seen

276
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:48,720
as such a negative thing and said the

277
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,120
value of the data is so important that

278
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,720
it's self-evident that people should

279
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,720
report and if that doesn't work you know

280
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,839
how do we compel organizations in a uh

281
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,080
give-and-take way to report that for

282
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,600
instance discussions of safe harbor or

283
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,680
anonymization of data to a meaningful

284
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,440
way with hospitals who get assurances

285
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,040
that they won't be identified if they

286
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,959
report that particular information

287
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:13,279
but even something as basic as that

288
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,079
would go a long way for us to record and

289
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:18,240
then measure the impact of cyber attacks

290
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,399
in healthcare

291
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,000
the other thing i'm going to say is that

292
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,600
it's very clear

293
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,399
that

294
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,160
in addition to have having a lack of

295
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,000
just very basic information we do not

296
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,079
have a research infrastructure in place

297
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,640
to study this what do i mean by this

298
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,000
heart disease cancer diabetes these are

299
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,079
horrible horrible pathophysiological

300
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:40,560
conditions that result in

301
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,880
lots of morbidity and mortality for

302
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,079
human beings across this entire planet

303
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:47,600
there are organization government

304
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,079
organizations that fund research

305
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:52,000
into these types of diseases for the

306
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,680
purpose of alleviating human suffering

307
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,200
and death what does that mean they

308
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,200
invest in researchers to actually study

309
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,720
these phenomena these particular

310
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,720
diseases well my second call here and

311
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,560
perhaps not too much of a controversial

312
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,959
one is really that these types of

313
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,240
agencies the national institute of

314
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,240
health the national science foundation

315
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,200
should prioritize funding into this not

316
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,440
just by giving dollars and cents but

317
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,160
also to encourage researchers across the

318
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,959
united states and globally to actually

319
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,279
make this an area of study

320
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,040
if you go and look at the research you

321
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,279
go go into pubmed and start looking into

322
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:29,680
the patient care implications of cyber

323
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,440
attacks you're going to find a handful

324
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,760
of papers if that that's amazing to me

325
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,440
we see this on the front page of

326
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,360
magazines almost every single day

327
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,880
newspapers magazines on the internet

328
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,320
almost every single day healthcare

329
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,079
ransomware healthcare cyber attacks

330
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:44,240
medical device vulnerabilities but yet

331
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,120
our infrastructure our scientists at the

332
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,560
heart of being able to study a problem

333
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,279
like this aren't focusing on it and i

334
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,120
think that's a missed opportunity so my

335
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,480
call is is then to develop a funding

336
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,560
stream for research and encourage

337
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,200
researchers across the globe to actually

338
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,839
study this

339
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,160
this paper

340
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,440
that we publish discussing how cyber

341
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,480
attacks

342
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,160
are like disasters for a hospital

343
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,320
hospitals prepare for certain disasters

344
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,800
as part of being a hospital if there's a

345
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,720
hospital in tornado alley they have a

346
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,320
plan for what happens if a large

347
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,000
tornado's around them or if a tornado

348
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,920
actually hits the hospital if they're in

349
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,240
an earthquake zone they have the same

350
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,639
these types of hazards to the hospital

351
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,600
and their ability to take care of

352
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,000
patients and do business

353
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,320
should take into consideration cyber

354
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,560
attacks and many of them do it's become

355
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,480
so relevant now that many forward

356
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,320
thinking hospitals are preparing for

357
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,720
cyber attacks like disasters this is a

358
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,360
relatively new concept and why am i

359
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,880
bringing this up i've talked about this

360
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,560
in other forms before of course it makes

361
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,240
sense cyber attacks can be so

362
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,680
debilitating to a healthcare

363
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,360
organization and of course they can look

364
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,600
like disasters but the point of it is

365
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,399
now we're learning something new

366
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,639
cyber disasters impacting a particular

367
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,959
hospital hit with ransomware for example

368
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:08,800
is one thing what happens to the care of

369
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,720
patients at that facility where they

370
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,320
don't have an electronic health record

371
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,000
or they don't have medical devices such

372
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,839
as ct scanners whatever it may actually

373
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,320
be there's the impact of patient care at

374
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,720
that specific hospital or hospitals that

375
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,240
are hit

376
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,040
but now we know something new

377
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,639
it's truly this concept of this

378
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,839
healthcare ecosystem unfortunately 2020

379
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:32,399
was such a horrible thing 2021 shaping

380
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,920
up to not be much better but we learned

381
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,519
something here which i think is

382
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,600
important to point out

383
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,000
and is very obvious

384
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,519
when you think about it

385
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:46,079
so hospitals and other healthcare

386
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:48,240
organizations we'll talk about a slide

387
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,440
in a minute about what this healthcare

388
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,839
ecosystem is like they form symbiotic

389
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,079
relationships and so what happens to one

390
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:55,839
affects the other

391
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,199
this makes sense

392
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:59,440
let's talk about that in the concept of

393
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,480
a ransomware attack if you have a a

394
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,440
metropolitan area taking care of five

395
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,959
million people

396
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,279
there's going to be a finite number of

397
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:10,560
hospitals

398
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,480
and other health care facilities in that

399
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,279
region right well uh not every hospital

400
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:16,639
is equipped to take care of every type

401
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,399
of patient we have trauma centers we

402
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,480
have stroke centers we have

403
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,199
cardiac arrest and um

404
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:26,079
heart attack centers that focus on

405
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:28,000
particularly sick patients and

406
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,120
specialize in their care and furthermore

407
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,560
there's a finite number of hospitals to

408
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,920
take care of all the patients but we

409
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,000
don't have redundancies meaning we don't

410
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,880
have backup hospitals if things go down

411
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,880
what we learned uh with a recent

412
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,199
ransomware attack was that

413
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,320
five hospitals in a geographic location

414
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,600
went down

415
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,399
and then all the adjacent hospitals to

416
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,720
that system that went down had to pick

417
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,720
up the slack

418
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,760
they saw huge influxes of patients to

419
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,560
the emergency department they saw

420
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,480
huge increases in the amount of

421
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,399
ambulances that had to come to their

422
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:05,600
facilities

423
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,760
they saw increased numbers of strokes

424
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,560
and heart attacks what does that mean it

425
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,720
means that even if you aren't hit by

426
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,120
ransomware because of the healthcare

427
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:19,519
ecosystem you can still be impacted what

428
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,600
you should take away from that

429
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,720
is that

430
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,959
hair can suffer across a geographic area

431
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,839
when one health care system of many goes

432
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:31,440
down

433
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,959
we could realize that we're only as

434
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:36,320
protected

435
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,240
as our least defended communities

436
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,320
meaning one hospital might invest a lot

437
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,399
in cybersecurity one may not but it

438
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,880
matters that they all do because what

439
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,959
happens that one will affect the other

440
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:50,880
as wise obi-wan here said

441
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,519
it's not just hospitals

442
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,079
you know we had this miracle um you know

443
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:57,040
i'm not religious i mean like a

444
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,560
spiritual or religious miracle but i

445
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,720
mean we had this amazing thing happen

446
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,480
where the

447
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,800
where covet happened and we were very

448
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,800
quickly able to develop a vaccine for it

449
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,160
that's amazing that required a lot of

450
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,120
science research infrastructure drug

451
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,480
development

452
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,600
and

453
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,680
logistics to actually make that happen

454
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,560
in the short amount of time that it did

455
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,880
that was to respond to a crisis and what

456
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,720
i think it shows is that of course that

457
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,160
makes sense that there are so many

458
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,480
pieces of this healthcare ecosystem all

459
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,440
of which are running vulnerable

460
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,199
connected infrastructure and that if

461
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,440
something happens at one part of the

462
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,959
ecosystem it's gonna affect the other if

463
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:37,600
the researchers uh doing coveted

464
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,839
research and developing that vaccine

465
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:41,759
were hit with ransomware even a delay of

466
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:43,920
weeks to months in that regard would

467
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,959
have resulted in millions more dead

468
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:48,720
and likewise with things like ppe

469
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,480
production etc

470
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,680
it's a

471
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,320
very complex and intricate web and what

472
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,399
we should realize is that we really have

473
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,880
a bigger problem than just biting off

474
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,800
medical device cyber security or just

475
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,160
talking about

476
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,240
hospital infrastructure security and

477
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,919
ransomware resiliency truly to actually

478
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:09,839
make a resilient

479
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,159
and

480
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,640
thinkable health care system we have to

481
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,919
raise the bar for everybody

482
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,959
this is the concept the cyber halves and

483
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,199
have nots

484
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,679
i worked in all of these hospital types

485
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,840
of hospitals i've worked in

486
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,480
hospitals that are very poor

487
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,480
that have no resources they don't have

488
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,400
two nickels to wrap together

489
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,240
they have they don't have the latest

490
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,559
connected medical devices they have old

491
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,720
antiquated electronic health records

492
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,480
they have very vulnerable infrastructure

493
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,480
and i've worked at other facilities that

494
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,960
had marble floors and

495
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,919
were very well resourced and and

496
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:53,520
could take and have the and have the

497
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,000
expertise in-house to do a decent job of

498
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,160
cyber security

499
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,480
these hospitals can be across the street

500
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,360
from each other sometimes or in the case

501
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,320
of rural uh hospitals or critical access

502
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,320
hospitals sometimes there's only one

503
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,919
hospital near you and the next one can

504
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:12,400
be 500 miles away

505
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,360
what we truly have are cyber haves and

506
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,520
have-nots in healthcare and what we need

507
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,440
to realize is that we need to raise the

508
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,799
bar for everybody because one affects

509
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:24,720
the other and it's just the right thing

510
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,039
to do

511
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:29,200
so how do we do that how do we

512
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,120
accomplish something like that given

513
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,640
that that's a pretty tall order

514
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,080
well um

515
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,200
perhaps the second thing i'm gonna talk

516
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,720
about today

517
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,440
is to say i've really

518
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,360
seen recently that we need to engage

519
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,000
this at a national policy level

520
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,760
and that we could

521
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,600
continue to try to solve this at the

522
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,039
micro level and that will be a big

523
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:52,080
important thing we're going to need

524
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,760
hospitals to step up individually of

525
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,799
course we're going to need medical

526
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:56,400
device manufacturers to continue to do

527
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,799
that clinics et cetera we need the

528
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:00,320
private sector to help accomplish that

529
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,720
but i think i'm thinking more and more

530
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,840
i'm convinced that we're going to need

531
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,840
some real national legislation on this

532
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,320
and what would that look like and how

533
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,080
would we be able to do this in a way

534
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,160
that's actually effective and not

535
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,120
counterproductive

536
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,480
when i thought about that and some other

537
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,000
people have been talking about using

538
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,520
this mechanism

539
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,440
to do such a thing

540
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,640
i wanted to bring it to everyone's

541
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,480
attention here and to discuss what

542
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,280
something like this might look like

543
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,799
and what

544
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:32,320
many people are talking about and what

545
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,840
it reminds me of is something called the

546
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,960
2009 high tech act as part of a large

547
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,559
investment

548
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,400
in america there was a big spending bill

549
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,799
and part of this was this high-tech act

550
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:44,960
at a part it was designed to improve

551
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,360
electronic health record adoption among

552
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,760
health care it did many other things but

553
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,600
just the at the heart of it that was one

554
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,880
of the biggest things they tried to do

555
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,120
so what do you what do you mean in 2009

556
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,520
we had a bill that said hospitals should

557
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,840
be off of paper records and be an

558
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,120
electronic health record the answer is

559
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,320
yes and prior to that many hospitals and

560
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,400
health care systems um

561
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,840
were still on paper in even in 2009

562
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,679
and so many people are shocked to find

563
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:13,760
that like well i don't go every hospital

564
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,280
i engage in now is on electronic health

565
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,840
record well it probably was because of

566
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,000
this 2009 high tech act and there were

567
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,919
people and there were hospitals before

568
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:23,600
that electronic health record sometimes

569
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,760
over a decade but it took this

570
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,080
legislation to really catalyze the

571
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,000
change

572
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,159
there are reportedly there were three

573
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:34,400
stages to the legislation and basically

574
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,200
stage one was data capture and sharing

575
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,880
stage two was advanced clinical

576
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,720
processes and stage three was to try to

577
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,320
leverage all that technology to improve

578
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,080
healthcare the thought was is that

579
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,280
electronic health records are much

580
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,840
better than paper they're more efficient

581
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,080
we can save money by sharing records

582
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,919
there are lots of reasons why the united

583
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:54,480
states would care about uh making sure

584
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,320
our hospitals were on electronic health

585
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,520
records

586
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,240
uh and it did a good job in doing that

587
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,720
now there were a lot of failures and

588
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,760
we're going to talk a little bit about

589
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,600
that in a minute but one of the things

590
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,679
that it succeeded in was at least

591
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:10,240
offering uh carrots you know this

592
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,080
concept of carrots or sticks you want to

593
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,120
incentivize people versus penalize them

594
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,559
as a way to catalyze change

595
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:20,240
what they did was

596
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,720
they would increase the amount of money

597
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,400
that the federal government would give

598
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,960
them for certain uh medicare funding for

599
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,720
patients so for example

600
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,520
you have medicare you go see a hospital

601
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:37,200
and if they met um stage one

602
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,799
they were self-certified that they met

603
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,480
this level of electronic health record

604
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,480
use that satisfied stage one well then

605
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,240
when they send a bill to the federal

606
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,039
government for your health care the

607
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,799
government would give them a little bit

608
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:50,960
extra because they met this particular

609
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,880
standard so that was the parrot if you

610
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,720
go to electronic health record you meet

611
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,559
these types of standards under stage one

612
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:00,320
or stage two or stage three as time went

613
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,039
on

614
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:01,919
uh then we're gonna give you a little

615
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:03,120
bit more money

616
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,960
well that was thought to be a way to

617
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,480
incentivize the hospitals to do that

618
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,080
they'd get these incentive payments and

619
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,760
they could use that to pay back the

620
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,440
investment that they made in the

621
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,039
electronic health record

622
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:14,640
and what was realized is that we can't

623
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,240
keep giving money out

624
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,679
for everybody for

625
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:19,520
for the type of stuff for in perpetuity

626
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,919
so it transitioned from a carrot to a

627
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:24,240
stick and where uh wherein as the years

628
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,320
moved on you'd get less and less money

629
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,400
and in fact at one point it flipped and

630
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,480
said you will give you less money taking

631
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,480
care of medicare patients uh unless

632
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,720
you're on electronic health record and

633
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,360
that was successful in a lot of ways of

634
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,880
making hospitals and healthcare

635
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,559
organizations go towards electronic

636
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,080
health records there were a lot of

637
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,919
failures uh

638
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:45,840
some people cite the involvement of

639
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,280
vendors in this

640
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,840
diluting the recommendations some

641
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:50,799
cited

642
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:52,880
failures in clearly defining

643
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,360
interoperability requirements and long

644
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,559
story short despite its failures it was

645
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:00,480
successful in catalyzing change the

646
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,640
question is can we use this model

647
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,080
as a

648
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,679
way to improve

649
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:09,679
health care cyber security in some type

650
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:12,559
of legislative action

651
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,240
so the thought is is this something that

652
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,640
could pass you know could you get the

653
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,720
house and the senate to agree on a bill

654
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,080
could you get the president to sign

655
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,039
something

656
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:23,039
that would improve meaningfully the

657
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:25,039
cyber security of health care

658
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:26,880
and could you do so by using this type

659
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:27,679
of

660
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:31,360
stages meaningful use type model

661
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,720
so

662
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,080
none of this

663
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,559
to my knowledge is very public

664
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:38,480
or exactly what would potentially end up

665
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,640
in a bill yet i think is still being

666
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,559
figured out but the thought would be

667
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:44,880
something like staged approaches you

668
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,960
know you can't take a rural critical

669
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,360
access hospital that has basically no

670
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,200
cyber security protections and expect

671
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,600
them to have a high level of protections

672
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,240
in a year without substantial

673
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,000
internal investment

674
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,720
money as well as expertise which we've

675
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,159
talked about time and time again we just

676
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:03,360
really don't have a lot of healthcare

677
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,960
cybersecurity expertise so you can't do

678
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,640
that overnight

679
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,000
the thought would be that you could do

680
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,520
it in stages

681
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,240
and perhaps you um list a bunch of

682
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,720
controls you can say hey multi-factor

683
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,000
authentication is useful in

684
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,520
in protecting some of these types of

685
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,840
attacks or reducing your risk perhaps

686
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,240
multi-factor authentication will be on a

687
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,120
list of certain controls

688
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,400
that could

689
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,840
be part of

690
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,360
a stage one

691
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,400
satisfying stage one

692
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,039
and then stage two may be a little bit

693
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:38,880
more stringent

694
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,520
you'd move towards a better architecture

695
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,159
for example or you would adopt

696
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:46,320
additional controls to continue to

697
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,400
harden your infrastructure and then

698
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,960
stage three of course hopefully meeting

699
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,159
some really meaningful defensive posture

700
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,000
for hospitals as well as have built in

701
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,159
the appropriate infrastructure at each

702
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:00,400
individual healthcare organization so

703
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,000
they can continue

704
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,880
uh defending updating patching learning

705
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,240
about the latest vulnerabilities and

706
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,120
defending their enterprise essentially

707
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,039
um there has been thoughts you know

708
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:14,320
about self-attestation you know auditing

709
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,000
hospitals and healthcare organizations

710
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,080
that say yes we meet these certain

711
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,080
benchmarks um

712
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,240
and then if you get audited and you

713
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,039
actually didn't then perhaps you could

714
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:27,760
suffer some tremendous fine

715
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30,000
would we use and send incentivation

716
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,640
incentives should we use incentives like

717
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,279
cms monies right so

718
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:37,760
should we say you get more money

719
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,200
from the government for every patient

720
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,600
you take care of with medicare if

721
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,240
you're particularly secured

722
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,000
a very controversial one but one i want

723
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,159
to bring out is that

724
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:50,720
perhaps we use this type of legislation

725
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:54,480
to also provide some type of safe arbor

726
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,760
or protections for certain data breach

727
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,279
implications and i know that's very

728
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:01,520
controversial but let me just hear me

729
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,559
out for one second as there's a

730
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:04,240
potential mechanism to incentivize

731
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,120
hospitals to do this if a hospital was

732
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,360
to meet a certain criteria of cyber

733
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,679
safety or cyber security protections and

734
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:13,120
then they still get breached right they

735
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,039
have a state actor

736
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:17,440
or a zero day hits them

737
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,000
and they have loss of patient records

738
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,159
the thought being because they met

739
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:23,919
certain benchmarks that were clearly

740
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:26,080
defined by the law should they still be

741
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,520
liable for

742
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,960
hipaa fines under ocr for example and

743
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,279
some would say that that would be

744
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:35,279
incentivizing if hospitals to do this if

745
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:37,760
they could say we met a certain standard

746
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,400
we had this particular type of attack

747
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,240
and we shouldn't be fined the same

748
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,559
amount as if we had not invested in

749
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:46,400
cyber security at all

750
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,320
and then perhaps to

751
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,440
further

752
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,600
incentivize hospitals to not pay fines

753
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,760
but use that type of money to reinvest

754
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,440
back into cyber security would

755
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,480
potentially be another carrot to offer

756
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,279
hospitals to do this because it's clear

757
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:04,080
that such a endeavor as this would be

758
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,279
tremendously expensive

759
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:08,799
i think it's clear that many people who

760
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:10,320
would say the government should fund

761
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,559
something like this would probably also

762
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:14,720
say that we should have the same uh

763
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,559
carat eventually turns into a stick and

764
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:19,279
that certain hospitals that don't meet

765
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:21,200
standards eventually

766
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,880
should have some disincentive for

767
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,039
continuing to do that

768
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:26,399
could you tie

769
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:29,679
uh this bill uh into other types of in

770
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:31,840
additional efforts uh outside of this

771
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,080
meaningful use framework yeah you could

772
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,159
there's been uh john corman and others

773
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:37,840
have discussed this concept of a cash

774
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,679
for clunkers for old medical devices

775
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:41,279
with this big legacy medical issue

776
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:43,600
medical device issue how do we just get

777
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,200
those out of circulation the thought

778
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,799
would be that you could subsidize the

779
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:48,799
cost of buying new more secure medical

780
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:51,760
devices and turn in your old ones uh

781
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,520
could also be a part of such a

782
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:56,159
legislative action or a legislative bill

783
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:57,520
and then i think it's clear and you've

784
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,640
probably heard me talk about this

785
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,480
previously it's clear that we need to

786
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,440
educate nurses doctors technicians other

787
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,440
people in this space about health care

788
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:09,679
cyber security not only for a um

789
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:12,320
an issue of patient safety but also for

790
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,159
data protection you know they're users

791
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:16,559
of this technology and they're often

792
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:18,720
responsible for these breaches through

793
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,600
phishing attacks etc

794
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,120
there's a lot

795
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,799
there's a lot of things in here i think

796
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:25,610
that will be

797
00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:27,039
[Music]

798
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:29,120
encouraging of a further dialogue and

799
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:32,000
conversation you know there'll be

800
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,919
many people on the spectrum

801
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:35,520
one the private sector can solve this

802
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,880
uniquely two hospitals are

803
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,039
over-regulated why would you encourage

804
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:41,760
something like this three uh this isn't

805
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,760
improving we need something else to spur

806
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,720
action

807
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,679
i hope that this talk was a

808
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:49,840
was received in a way to spur dialogue

809
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,720
and then encourage you to engage with

810
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,279
your representatives that is probably

811
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:56,880
the biggest thing i could recommend at

812
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,880
the end of this is that there's it's

813
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,200
clear that we need to do something big

814
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,559
and bold in my mind and doing that in a

815
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:08,240
mindful and uh thoughtful way as to how

816
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,240
it will impact

817
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,799
actual healthcare delivery is important

818
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:14,480
all of you out there listening today

819
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,880
have tremendous expertise and knowledge

820
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,960
in the space that needs to be

821
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,799
harnessed to craft

822
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:22,480
a meaningful bill

823
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,840
and so i would hope that if you have

824
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,679
strong opinions on any

825
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:28,000
part of this so and more that you made

826
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,159
those make those known to your uh your

827
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:31,760
representatives in congress and

828
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,240
elsewhere and then i hope that we as a

829
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,880
community of hackers can have meaningful

830
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:40,080
policy conversations because we possess

831
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,480
unique technical insights that often

832
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,320
representatives don't and so when

833
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,320
they're drafting language and using

834
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,440
particular

835
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,840
explanations of what particular controls

836
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,159
can be they can make mistakes and us as

837
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:53,440
hackers

838
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,240
are experts at gaming systems and we

839
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,440
don't want that to be the case in

840
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,799
something like this we want something to

841
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:00,799
be meaningful and with that i'm going to

842
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,640
go ahead and say send me any questions

843
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,320
you have on twitter

844
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,159
and if you have

845
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:07,679
any thoughts about something you'd like

846
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:09,440
in policy please send it my way uh

847
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,279
perhaps we could establish some type of

848
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:12,880
form and dialogue where we can collect

849
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,919
all that

850
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:16,000
hit me up on twitter and again thank you

851
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,159
