hello defcon

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:07,200
um a little bittersweet to be presenting

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:07,759
here

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:10,480
to you today unfortunately by wreck by

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,200
recording

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,080
instead of in person in las vegas but

7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,200
hopefully next year

8
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,400
will be together i'm susan green hall i

9
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,160
am the senior advisor for election

10
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,480
security at free speech for people

11
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,519
i'm going to share my screen

12
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:28,400
now um

13
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,320
and hopefully you can see that uh um

14
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,239
freeze feature people is a non-partisan

15
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,520
not-for-profit public um

16
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,640
advocacy and legal organization and we

17
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,120
have

18
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,239
um several projects that are aimed at

19
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:48,160
our mission which is to

20
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,800
um strengthen and improve democracy for

21
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,160
all people

22
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,039
um we work on things like money and

23
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:56,000
politics and

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,359
corporate abuse of power and we have a

25
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,600
specific project on election security

26
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,039
which i

27
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,240
am the senior advisor for

28
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,920
um now we are here today to talk about

29
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,119
the wireless odyssey or why the blink do

30
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:13,600
we have

31
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,119
wireless connectivity in voting machines

32
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:20,400
um i really want to describe all the ins

33
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,560
and outs of a mind-blowingly

34
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,119
reckless and stupid decision made by the

35
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:26,720
federal

36
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,799
agency that oversees voting technology

37
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,119
to allow wireless networking devices

38
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:34,479
and federally certified voting machines

39
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:37,759
considering the state of confidence

40
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,920
in election systems in the current cyber

41
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,000
threat landscape it would seem to be a

42
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,360
complete no-brainer

43
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,040
that we should ban all wireless

44
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,799
networking in

45
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,399
voting machines but that's not what

46
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,880
happened instead

47
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,640
over a tremendous amount of public

48
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,479
opposition the united states election

49
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:55,600
assistance commission

50
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,799
or eac extra legally

51
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,200
with met with the voting machine

52
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,719
manufacturers and stripped

53
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,960
provision out of the proposed federal

54
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,479
voting system guidelines that would have

55
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:06,880
banned

56
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,959
any device capable of connecting

57
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,038
wirelessly to the internet

58
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,680
um but i don't want to get to ahead to

59
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,239
to the

60
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:18,080
end i'm skipping to the end um this is

61
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,239
some of the press about that um because

62
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,080
i want to talk about all the things that

63
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,360
led up to the ultimate um conclusion

64
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,440
which you know put us in this position

65
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,800
um and sort of uh

66
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,040
uh foreshadowed the fact that we would

67
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,959
see the federal agency

68
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,640
uh siding with the vendors to um

69
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,519
uh to permit wireless networking in

70
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,040
voting systems

71
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,959
um so the um u.s election assistance

72
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:51,760
commission

73
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,080
or the ac is the federal agency that is

74
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,680
tasked with setting the federal voting

75
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,519
system standards those are

76
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,159
um called the voluntary voting system

77
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:02,080
guidelines they are voluntary but most

78
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,040
states

79
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,400
many states adopt them and they impact

80
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,480
the marketplace considerably so they're

81
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,920
quite

82
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,440
influential um and states look to them

83
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,560
to develop their own standards as well

84
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,080
even if they don't require eac

85
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,920
certification

86
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,519
um the first set of standards developed

87
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,560
by the ac was in 20 uh

88
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,959
2005 um and the eac is still certifying

89
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:28,720
voting systems to this day to that to

90
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,879
those standards from 2005 so wildly out

91
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:32,239
of date um

92
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:34,239
those standards explicitly permit

93
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:35,840
wireless modems and networking

94
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,120
connectivity

95
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,400
um yet like many um other election

96
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,640
officials the eac commissioners helped

97
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,640
to spread the myth that voting machines

98
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,280
are never connected to the internet and

99
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,360
so i'm gonna have to

100
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,280
um slip out of zoom share for one second

101
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,360
and then i will reshare to show you the

102
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,400
video

103
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,840
that i have

104
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,840
okay

105
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,479
okay so that's just a little sampling

106
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:23,040
there were

107
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,320
multiple instances where the eac

108
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,320
commissioners made public statements or

109
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:28,880
provided

110
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,120
testimony to congress saying that the

111
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,560
voting machines are never connected to

112
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,840
the internet and that the federal

113
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,880
standards ban

114
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,479
any sort of connectivity or any sort of

115
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,240
wireless modems um

116
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,479
but that was not true but what was

117
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:41,360
interesting

118
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,280
um is that um oh wait i have one more

119
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,080
video

120
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:50,000
um let's

121
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:57,840
go back again

122
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,599
thank you zoom

123
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,840
okay so um

124
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,440
we established that they have made this

125
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,960
statement um

126
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,639
but what was interesting is that the

127
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,000
this demonstrates the ac

128
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,759
sort of recognized that there was

129
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,400
pr value to making these claims even

130
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,360
though

131
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,400
they weren't true um yet

132
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,000
when the eac actually had the

133
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,240
opportunity to update the standards and

134
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,039
adopt a ban

135
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:38,080
into federal voting system um

136
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,080
that would prevent any sort of internet

137
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,280
modems or

138
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,600
a wireless networking connectivity they

139
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,520
did everything they could do to subvert

140
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,039
it

141
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:50,479
in 2015 the eac began developing a new

142
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:52,080
set of standards which was going to be

143
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,199
termed vbsg

144
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,280
2.0 voluntary leading system guidelines

145
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,319
2.0

146
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,800
this process is very specifically

147
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,000
dictated by

148
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,400
the help america vote act um and it's

149
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,240
subject to other federal laws like the

150
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,840
administrative procedures act federal

151
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,520
advisory committees act

152
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,600
the standards must be drafted by the

153
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,160
eac's technical

154
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,160
guidelines development committee then

155
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,319
submitted to the eac's board of advisors

156
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,000
and standards boards also published to

157
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,520
the federal register and subject to a

158
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,000
90-day

159
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,160
public comment period all and as well

160
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,120
they also held

161
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,080
public hearings all of this to ensure

162
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:26,960
that there was

163
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,880
um you know robust public

164
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,680
oversight and engagement um any

165
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,360
modifications have to go through the

166
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,639
same process

167
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:39,120
so at this stage the eac did two

168
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,639
unexpected things that are

169
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,360
relative to what unfolded first they

170
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,639
separated out

171
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,080
the standards into a high-level set of

172
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,840
principles and guidelines things like

173
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,280
the voting machine should record your

174
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,960
vote accurately

175
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,080
it should be auditable um and then they

176
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,440
um had a separate uh document

177
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,639
that was the very detailed

178
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,560
requirements that would ensure that the

179
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,080
voting system met these high-level

180
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,759
principles and guidelines

181
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,880
and they decided that both of these uh

182
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,000
uh parts of the the standards document

183
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,400
needed to go through the same

184
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,599
public comment period

185
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,000
public hearings advisory boards review

186
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,080
et cetera et cetera

187
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,400
and then second they set up

188
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,639
topic-specific public working groups so

189
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,240
they had one on human factors

190
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,840
there was one on cyber security and i

191
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,440
participated in the cyber security

192
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,960
working group as probably some of the

193
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,800
people watching did as well

194
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,560
um this was comprised of computer

195
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,240
scientists advocates like myself

196
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,039
election officials and vendors

197
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:47,120
after the high level principles were

198
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,080
completed

199
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,000
the public working groups dug into

200
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,879
drafting suggestions for the detailed

201
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,319
requirements

202
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,240
and the issue of the wireless modems in

203
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,800
voting machines was very hotly debated

204
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,160
it quickly

205
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,599
became clear this was going to be a big

206
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:03,440
point of contention the vendors and

207
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,599
election officials opposed a ban

208
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:07,840
cyber security experts and advocates

209
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,000
like myself were in favor of a ban

210
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,720
um and we saw we were we were facing a

211
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,000
major fight

212
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,520
um and so with some allies

213
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,680
um we worked up a plan to try and

214
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,479
engage the public on this in the spring

215
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:25,560
of

216
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,639
2019 at the same time the wireless issue

217
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:28,960
was

218
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,680
hotly debated in the public working

219
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,120
group the high level principles and

220
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,640
guidelines were going through the public

221
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,559
comm period

222
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,958
providing a unique opportunity to

223
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,479
address this issue

224
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,760
um so and and we felt that this was such

225
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,480
an important

226
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,440
issue that it actually rose to the level

227
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:47,920
of

228
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,000
being included in the high-level

229
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,920
principles and guidelines not permitting

230
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,200
any sort of wireless

231
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,519
networking technology uh technology or

232
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,360
devices in the system

233
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,800
um so several um

234
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,640
allied organizations from all sides of

235
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,160
the political spectrum

236
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,800
um including common cause public citizen

237
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,680
daily coast

238
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,640
and freedomworks all sent emails to

239
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,800
their members lists

240
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,880
asking their members to send in public

241
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,240
comments to the eac

242
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,360
asking it to include a ban on wireless

243
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,519
networking devices and voting machines

244
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,680
and this caught fire

245
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,959
um the all combined all the groups

246
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:27,600
together

247
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,279
uh we got over 50 000 public comments

248
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,800
submitted to the eac

249
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,279
asking them to include the ban now by

250
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,279
any measure of success that's a pretty

251
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,399
good

252
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,600
return on investment to get that many

253
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,000
people

254
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,800
engaged in this sort of weedy wonky

255
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,600
issue

256
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,120
sending public comments to this tiny

257
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,519
agency nobody never heard of

258
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,760
and about voluntary voting system

259
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,640
guidelines something else

260
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,640
a lot of people never heard of um but

261
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,880
evidently the eac was not familiar with

262
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,640
online organizing

263
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,079
so they did something extraordinary when

264
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,320
they started to see the volume of emails

265
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,440
come in

266
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,240
they shut off the email address that was

267
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,200
receiving these messages

268
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,000
so that it could no longer receive any

269
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,040
emails

270
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,880
they did not make any public

271
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,880
notification of that

272
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,800
nothing in the federal register nothing

273
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,320
on their website

274
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,279
they um did not include a bounce back

275
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:27,120
message that would tell you

276
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,959
this email is no longer receiving

277
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:30,640
messages please

278
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,200
submit your comments in another fashion

279
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:33,760
so

280
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,160
anyone who submitted comments after they

281
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,360
closed the email

282
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,000
address or shut it off or disconnected

283
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,279
it

284
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,720
would have gone into a black hole and

285
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,839
they would never know

286
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:48,560
um uh yeah so they were essentially

287
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,480
tell and this was in in the midst of the

288
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,680
public commentary there were still

289
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,279
several days like almost a week i think

290
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,760
a little less than a week was still left

291
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,600
um when they shut off the the email

292
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,200
address um

293
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,120
a day and a half later they put out a

294
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,040
tweet that said that they were asking

295
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,160
people to go to

296
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,640
an online platform instead to submit

297
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,600
their comments

298
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,959
um uh but they still had not put

299
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:12,640
anything in the federal register

300
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,320
and so some of the groups that had

301
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,680
organized around this were

302
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,160
were pretty understandably upset and

303
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,399
they complained that the eac

304
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,720
was um violating the administrative

305
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,200
procedures act which requires the

306
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,720
90-day public comm period and they'd

307
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,079
already advertised it in the federal

308
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:29,200
register

309
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,320
um because the eac had screwed up the

310
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,320
public comment submission so badly the

311
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:34,880
ac

312
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,560
agreed to extend the common period by a

313
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,959
week and a few days later they published

314
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:40,320
the extension of the federal register

315
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,480
which was required by law with a link to

316
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,399
the submissions page

317
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,120
so a few months after this debacle in

318
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,000
september

319
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,079
of 2019 the eac's technical guidelines

320
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:53,600
development committee

321
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,360
met and during the meeting an eac

322
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,959
staffer gave an update

323
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:59,680
on the development of the standards and

324
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,639
the public comment

325
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:04,320
period and quite unexpectedly the eac

326
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,760
staff said nothing

327
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,600
about receiving tens of thousands of

328
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,040
comments on

329
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,600
the issue of wireless instead the eac

330
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,800
staff told

331
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,680
the committee that it had received 2 800

332
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,320
comments

333
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,959
and i have a slide on that as well

334
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:22,839
because i can show you the slide that

335
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:26,000
the um

336
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,920
eac oh

337
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,519
shoot not visible in my windows right

338
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,279
now okay you'll have to take my word for

339
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,439
it

340
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,079
um

341
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:41,279
the eac um

342
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:44,560
the eac gave

343
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,920
told the the the uh um

344
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,440
committee members it was that it was

345
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,000
2800 comments that they had received

346
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,200
um but what happened was that the

347
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,639
committee members asked to see the

348
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,639
comments they said can we see the public

349
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,240
comments that were received

350
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,000
and the eac staff said no now this

351
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,120
i know i have uh queued up here

352
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,839
and this was the exact exchange so this

353
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:11,200
is judd and that's the

354
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,600
uh election director for the state of

355
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,360
colorado who is a member of this

356
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,399
committee

357
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,399
is are you cliff saying that the public

358
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,079
comments aren't public

359
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:22,240
and this is the eac's general counsel

360
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,920
said the public comments have not been

361
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,680
accepted by the commissioners to be made

362
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,079
public that's correct

363
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,560
the colorado election director says so

364
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,839
we can't see or talk about the public

365
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:34,160
comments

366
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,720
and that's pretty much what they got no

367
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,360
you can't

368
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,680
talk about the public comments um they

369
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,079
never got the public comment or

370
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:44,240
i'll qualify they did not get the public

371
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,680
comments um

372
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,959
in any timely fashion it took about

373
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,040
more than a year before the eac

374
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,120
eventually published all of those 50

375
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,360
000 comments and acknowledged that they

376
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,639
were that they had

377
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:59,360
been received um and that was because of

378
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,480
a lot of pressure

379
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,639
so just to recap there was a clear and

380
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,639
concerted effort by the eac

381
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,320
to prevent the public from submitting

382
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,680
comments in support

383
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,560
of a ban on wireless net network uh

384
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,839
wireless networking

385
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:14,560
then the eac expressly misrepresented

386
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,480
the number of comments it received to

387
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,160
its development committee

388
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,480
and then when the committee asked to see

389
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,920
the comments they said no

390
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,360
you can't see the comments the public

391
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,360
comments aren't public

392
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,079
now we skip forward a few more months

393
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:29,120
though the eac

394
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,440
didn't seem to get the profound dangers

395
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,399
associated

396
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,560
with including the wireless devices nist

397
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,920
sure did

398
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,920
and because nist chairs the technical

399
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,040
development

400
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,760
committee nist prepared the draft

401
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,040
standards

402
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,519
for the committee and in december of

403
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:46,480
2019

404
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,480
a nist official gave a presentation to

405
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,600
the committee

406
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,120
that starkly explained that these

407
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,720
devices create a

408
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:57,440
huge uh vulnerability in voting systems

409
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,760
um and that they should not be present

410
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,680
in voting machines um and then this

411
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,440
provided the draft standards

412
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,639
which included a ban on an explicit ban

413
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,720
on any devices capable of wireless

414
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,639
networking and voting machines

415
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:13,920
this draft was voted on by

416
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,480
the technical development committee and

417
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,440
passed on to the eac

418
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,000
at this point it seemed to be settled um

419
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:22,959
nist had given

420
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:25,440
its recommendations loudly and clearly

421
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,120
and the technical development committee

422
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,360
which is directed by law to provide the

423
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,959
standards to the ac had

424
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:33,360
endorsed that version the draft

425
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,040
standards were then published and put

426
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,360
out for public comment

427
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,600
eac and nist also suspended all the

428
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,519
public working groups because the work

429
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:43,680
had been done

430
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,360
the standards were then subject to

431
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,720
multiple public hearings and they were

432
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,839
also sent to the

433
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:50,959
eac standards and advisory boards

434
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:53,519
in the summer of 2020 last year as the

435
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,199
draft standards were going through these

436
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:56,880
public reviews the eac

437
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,600
let's slip on a call with the standards

438
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,360
board that it was meeting weekly

439
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,199
with the voting system vendors in a

440
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:05,440
working group to solicit the vendor's

441
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,440
comments on the standards

442
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,120
so the vendors had already been involved

443
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,880
in public working groups they provided

444
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,240
their own public comments but now there

445
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,680
was a special meeting

446
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,720
that was closed to the public that was

447
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,800
um uh not being

448
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,120
no minutes were being published no

449
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,880
documents or readouts were being made

450
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,480
available to the public but they

451
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,399
that was still going on um specifically

452
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:34,839
to solicit the vendors comments

453
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:37,279
um um and

454
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:40,320
remember that um that there were the

455
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,759
the public working group and they had

456
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:43,519
the opportunity and that was already

457
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,560
disbanded

458
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,000
so this meant that there was this new

459
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
private working group when i learned

460
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
this i immediately wrote to the ec and

461
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,839
asked to be added to the working group i

462
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:53,839
assumed it was maybe an extension of the

463
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:55,440
other public working groups

464
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,759
the ac wouldn't wouldn't even respond so

465
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:59,600
i put in a foia for all of the

466
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,440
documentation and communication between

467
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,519
the eac and the vendors regarding the

468
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:06,160
meetings to try and learn more about it

469
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,640
we waited for several months for the esd

470
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,319
to produce the documents and while we

471
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,280
were waiting

472
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,280
we started to hear rumors that the eac

473
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,199
was revising the standards

474
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:17,520
to allow wireless devices in voting

475
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,480
machines

476
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,240
provided they were disabled but that

477
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,000
could be disabled by software it didn't

478
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,559
require

479
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:25,599
physical disabling

480
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,439
now we know the vendors like to push the

481
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:29,520
wireless networking devices and

482
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,679
electronic transmission of electronic

483
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:33,520
results from polling places to county

484
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,600
headquarters but there are other factors

485
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,760
that were driving this there are vendors

486
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,200
that are building their systems

487
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,720
using entirely cots hardware and they

488
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,480
those vendors have insisted it would be

489
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,559
way too expensive to have to remove the

490
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:49,679
wireless devices

491
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:52,080
or any chips or radios or anything

492
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,120
additionally

493
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,360
including the wireless devices could

494
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,360
allow vendors to use them

495
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,240
to update machines at the same time if

496
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,360
they had to

497
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,080
put in a software update or or upgrade

498
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,120
it

499
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,200
rather than having to manually update

500
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,840
each individual machine

501
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,600
and so these are changes that we know

502
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,160
directly benefited the vendors

503
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,400
we wanted to head off this terrible

504
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,360
decision so

505
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,240
free speech for people enlisted a bunch

506
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:20,960
of

507
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,720
top computer scientists and election

508
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,520
security experts to send a letter

509
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,480
to the eac warning of the dangers of

510
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,360
permitting wireless devices

511
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,880
and in voting machines wireless

512
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,640
networking devices

513
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,200
not surprisingly the eac never responded

514
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,080
but they did respond to the news stories

515
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,919
by publishing a document that tried to

516
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:45,120
spin the changes as a mere clarification

517
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,440
um and that the draft was never intended

518
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,160
to actually

519
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,720
prohibit the presence of any wireless

520
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,080
capability

521
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,799
um this wasn't supported out by the

522
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:56,720
facts or the record

523
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,280
or even the eac's own statements to the

524
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,120
press before they decided to take this

525
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,160
tax so they took

526
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,200
one attack and then took another deck

527
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,480
on january 13th the eac held a meeting

528
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,080
of the board of advisors

529
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,799
which the members in which the members

530
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:14,320
repeatedly asked

531
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,000
about the new draft they wanted to see

532
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,520
it because they

533
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,280
knew that they were voting on uh it was

534
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,120
supposed to be coming up soon

535
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,960
um eac refused to provide it to them

536
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,080
even though they are the board of

537
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,840
advisors

538
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,160
put there by the help america vote act

539
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,919
on january 26

540
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,960
in 2021 the eac announced it would meet

541
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,120
on february 10th to vote on the new

542
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,720
voting system standards but they still

543
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,559
had not published

544
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,559
this what they were going to vote on we

545
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,080
still had no idea what

546
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,880
changes they had made if any you know

547
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,320
they really shouldn't be making any

548
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,799
the stage without it going through the

549
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:52,320
process again a public process

550
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,760
and a couple of days later on february

551
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,280
1st 2020

552
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,080
they published the revision to the draft

553
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:00,960
um

554
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,919
which had not been subject to any review

555
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:05,600
by the advisory boards to the public

556
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,320
the new version allowed wireless devices

557
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,799
provided they were disabled by software

558
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:13,440
it also gutted some robust requirements

559
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,720
that guaranteed

560
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,559
public access to any system submitted as

561
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,080
ede verifiable or

562
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,720
unverifiable there had been a very

563
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,400
robust provision to make sure

564
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,919
that if anyone tried to submit a system

565
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:31,679
as and unverifiable to

566
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:34,000
avoid the paper ballot requirement they

567
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:34,880
would have to

568
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,240
make the protocol available to the

569
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,200
public readily available

570
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,960
for an extended period of time for

571
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,480
anybody that wanted it

572
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,600
um completely got it um

573
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,720
no public review of and verifiable

574
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,240
systems any longer

575
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,559
um and there were some other pro vendor

576
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,640
changes like removing a provision to

577
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,559
prevent the vendors from advertising on

578
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:57,360
ballots

579
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,039
so now you can look at your ballots and

580
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:01,120
have a nice advertisement from es and s

581
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:01,520
or

582
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,559
heart inter civic or dominion um nine

583
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:05,679
days later

584
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:08,720
eac voted to accept the new standards

585
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,919
um and several weeks after that we had

586
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:14,080
free speech where people sued the eac

587
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,480
over the unfulfilled foyer request for

588
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,159
the communication with the vendors and

589
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:20,240
the private meetings

590
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,679
that was in march we sued after we sued

591
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:25,919
the esc began to produce the documents

592
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:27,760
and we found more details of the what

593
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,919
weekly meetings that esc was holding

594
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:33,039
with the vendors which documented

595
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:35,520
the regularity and some of the topics

596
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,799
that they were covering we still haven't

597
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:38,960
gotten the full production

598
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,039
a few months after that though we sued

599
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:42,559
again and this time we did it

600
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:44,080
under the federal administrative

601
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,159
procedures act the federal

602
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:49,200
advisory committees act and um

603
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,679
and the help america vote act and so we

604
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:52,240
used

605
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,799
uh we sued under those um acts and i'm

606
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:57,919
not a lawyer so i'm doing my best to

607
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:00,000
explain the administrative procedures

608
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,200
act requires certain

609
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,120
um documents to be made public to go to

610
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,559
the federal register

611
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:07,280
etc um as mentioned the public comment

612
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,720
period was

613
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,919
there were issues with public home

614
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:12,159
period um the federal advisory

615
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:13,760
committee's act requires that

616
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,360
any sort of um group that's formed like

617
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:17,760
the

618
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,200
working group with the vendors that that

619
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,440
needs to be made public um keeping that

620
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,159
private is a big no-no under federal law

621
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:26,480
um and the help america vote act which

622
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,520
requires that

623
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,600
um when the standards are modified they

624
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,200
need to go back through the same public

625
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,400
process and they did

626
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,320
substantially change them so they were a

627
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,679
modification and they should have gone

628
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:36,480
back through

629
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,520
the public comment period and um to the

630
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,159
eac

631
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:44,159
standards board and board of advisors um

632
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:46,159
our lead plaintiff is professor philip

633
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:48,080
stark many of whom you know philip is a

634
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:51,120
member of the esc's board of advisors

635
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,600
um so his rights as a member of the

636
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,480
board

637
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:58,000
were explicitly abrogated when the ac

638
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:58,640
did not

639
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,280
let him review the standards before they

640
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:01,840
were

641
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,799
published we are seeking relief to

642
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:06,880
reinstate the original provisions and

643
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,520
roll back these changes that were made

644
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:13,600
um so you can make your own judgment

645
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,840
maybe i i've given you a presented a

646
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,280
bias story here

647
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,280
but it seems evident to me that the eac

648
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,280
is an agency that is way too close to

649
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,480
the vendors it is supposed to be

650
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,520
regulating

651
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,200
and it went far out of its way to

652
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,799
dismiss the public

653
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:28,799
in favor of the vendors preferences on

654
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:30,960
this issue while pretty brazenly

655
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:31,760
flouting

656
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,679
the federal laws that would have

657
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:35,360
prevented the agency

658
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,360
from holding clandestine meetings with

659
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,960
the vendors and making substantial

660
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,159
changes to the

661
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:42,000
voting system guidelines secretly

662
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,880
outside of the legally mandated process

663
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,880
the lawsuits are currently pending

664
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,240
under the foia lawsuit the eac has begun

665
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,159
to produce the documents

666
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:56,400
um and we'll see if they continue to

667
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,279
comply

668
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:59,039
for the second suit that alleges

669
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:01,039
violations of federal law we have

670
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:02,960
um regarding the development of the

671
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,400
standards we have yet to see a response

672
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,080
so we'll have to see how they respond to

673
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,039
that

674
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:09,360
the bottom line is that despite all of

675
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,520
the public statements

676
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,880
um by the eac and others there

677
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,960
are wireless networking devices and

678
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,880
voting machines around the country

679
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,559
and that the new federal voting system

680
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:23,360
standards adopted by the eac

681
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,279
when they had the opportunity to ban

682
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:27,200
them all together the eac did

683
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,760
everything it could to subvert that um

684
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,120
it's pretty incredible and pretty

685
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,480
disappointing

686
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,880
