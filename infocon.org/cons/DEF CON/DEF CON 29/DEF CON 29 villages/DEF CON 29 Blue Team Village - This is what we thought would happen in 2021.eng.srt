1
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,320
hello everyone

2
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,599
it's a pleasure to be here welcome to my

3
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,320
temporal blue team village weather

4
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,080
studio

5
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,400
um in the next 30 minutes i'll be

6
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,840
sharing with you

7
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:30,080
what we all thought would happen in 2021

8
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,840
every year and more specifically the

9
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,040
beginning of each year a lot of

10
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,559
companies publish their understanding of

11
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,000
what they believe will happen in the

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,920
upcoming 12 months

13
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,160
this includes vendors consultancy firms

14
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,520
etc

15
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,960
and today i'm going to share with you

16
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,800
what happens if you do a meta-analysis

17
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,360
on

18
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,239
all these understandings verified

19
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:49,520
against the present

20
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,840
and a personal outlook for the second

21
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:52,640
half of

22
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,440
2021.

23
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,399
i've been doing these analysis for a

24
00:00:58,399 --> 00:00:59,600
long time

25
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,520
yet mostly for clients to support them

26
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,600
in either their security program

27
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,720
develop their threat management

28
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,000
capability or create threat scenarios

29
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,040
for them to actually test

30
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,159
now for me this has been very useful

31
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,119
and i basically take all this published

32
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:18,640
content

33
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,040
and actually think about how i can make

34
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,759
better assessments on using new upcoming

35
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,880
future risk or threat scenarios

36
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,119
so that being said you know let's let's

37
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:30,640
dive into it a bit more

38
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,880
so when we're doing when doing this

39
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:33,759
analysis

40
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,759
three main elements came up the first

41
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,119
one is there

42
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:38,960
you know there's all sorts of forecasts

43
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,560
and predictions each year

44
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,280
but is it any good is it on point the

45
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,000
second thing i

46
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,759
actually thought of was when folks

47
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,520
create these products how are they

48
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,200
created and more importantly how can

49
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,640
these products influence our thinking

50
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,840
about risk and threats to our

51
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,439
organization

52
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:56,719
thirdly are there any surprises let me

53
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:57,520
be clear

54
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,920
no there are no surprises in specific

55
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,439
themes or topics

56
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,520
what was interesting though is how

57
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,439
publishers delivered and emphasized

58
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,680
everything

59
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,239
we will dive into these three data the

60
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:12,640
goal of this exercise is basically

61
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,400
first of all changes the norm folks have

62
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,840
to do with predictions

63
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,040
and second provide in-house teams

64
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,840
some guidance on how they can deal with

65
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,840
this

66
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:28,160
now before we get into those details

67
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,680
just an example

68
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,640
mostly because things are shown in front

69
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,800
of us that's what we know that's what we

70
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,360
care about that's what we think about

71
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,080
and if you have

72
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,599
for example if you have certain network

73
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,080
telemetry but like host based telemetry

74
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,400
then your view and priority will mostly

75
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,720
be dictated by that

76
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,319
this then translates into budget and

77
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,400
eventually can lead you having a limited

78
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,200
understanding of

79
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,519
other risks or areas of risks that are

80
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:54,480
outside of your

81
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,280
viewpoint and i will refer to this

82
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,000
metaphor

83
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,200
a couple times throughout the

84
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,760
presentation

85
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,920
first of all i would like to introduce

86
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,080
you to the concept of forecasting

87
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,080
technically speaking forecasting is the

88
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,840
process of making predictions

89
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,239
based on past and present data and most

90
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,879
commonly by analysis of trends

91
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,959
now prediction is something else it's

92
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:18,080
basically the process

93
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,959
of estimating outcomes of unseen data

94
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:23,280
and forecasting is just a sub-discipline

95
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,200
of prediction

96
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,879
but why would you bother about

97
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:28,879
forecasting since we all have thousands

98
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:29,440
of things

99
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,480
to do right now well this goes a long

100
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,080
way to help you shape your response

101
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,599
strategy in the face of an uncertain

102
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:36,640
future

103
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,280
an example could be being prepared for

104
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,879
specific ransomware trends

105
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,840
or preemptively checking your supply

106
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,120
chain

107
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,720
it will help you answer not just you

108
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,640
know the why and the how and what

109
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,959
questions but it will also help you

110
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,319
shape the answers to the when question

111
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,840
finally there's also the concept of

112
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,159
super forecasting and this comes from a

113
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,680
great study performed by philip e

114
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,319
tedlock

115
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:05,040
various others i simply said that a lot

116
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,879
of people do forecasts or specific

117
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:07,760
questions

118
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,599
and there are some people that excel

119
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:10,959
basically performing better than a

120
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,239
random selection

121
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,200
aka a dart throwing chimp and he

122
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,959
explained i explored

123
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,079
why now there are multiple interesting

124
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,440
pieces to this study

125
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,560
um besides the monkey of course

126
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,560
one of the outcomes was that the average

127
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,240
of everyone's forecast was generally

128
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,840
true

129
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,520
and this inspired me to do a little

130
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,919
experiment on what everyone thought that

131
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:34,479
would happen

132
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:37,359
in 2021

133
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,000
so once you think about an experiment

134
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,320
you

135
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,759
also think about the analytical

136
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,160
techniques and it's basic it's important

137
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,919
to understand the basics of forecasting

138
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:51,040
analysis

139
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,040
basically you have two types a

140
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,040
qualitative and a quantitative type

141
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,120
quantitative breaks into time series and

142
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,240
causal models

143
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,280
where time series are trend lines we all

144
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,560
recognize

145
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,039
and causal models represent complex

146
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:06,720
complex models

147
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,160
for which can for example compute

148
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,720
which compute where rain is going to

149
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,240
fall

150
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,880
now a qualitative approach emphasizes

151
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,039
the human telling what's up

152
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:20,160
and this is what we're going to be

153
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:25,840
focusing on

154
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,840
so the experiment so if you're

155
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,440
interested in the details reach out to

156
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,160
me

157
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,680
through the contact details on the last

158
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,240
page happy to discuss this

159
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,120
the essence of what i did was i grabbed

160
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,320
all the thread prediction third

161
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,199
landscapes

162
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,880
i could find through open sources in q1

163
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,360
321

164
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,759
i did the same thing for q2 i analyzed

165
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,120
it based on recent events

166
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,800
and assessed what direction the next

167
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,160
half 2021

168
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,160
will take and full disclosure

169
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,800
there was so much to unpack and too much

170
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,520
to unpack

171
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,199
that i basically kept it to the most

172
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,319
impactful components

173
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:08,000
now let's get into some of the details

174
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,520
i've broken it down into four main

175
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,919
topics publishers document

176
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,960
themes and topics

177
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:19,280
first of all i looked into 44 unique

178
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,639
pieces

179
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,360
that's documents and articles it's

180
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,639
important to note that i

181
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,240
found four that were actually released

182
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,039
before 2021 and i excluded them from

183
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,800
the upcoming contents and slides you

184
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,400
will see

185
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,720
most of them were reports published in

186
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,520
q1

187
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,360
and the highest release moments were

188
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,120
january and april

189
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,800
and of the total 67 percent was a report

190
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,360
and the remainder online articles all of

191
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,479
them accumulating to a whopping 1100

192
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,160
pages

193
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,319
smallest was two pages the biggest one

194
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:53,759
22

195
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:57,199
and with an average of 27.5 pages per

196
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:58,319
document

197
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:01,520
it was a lot of documents a lot of pages

198
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,280
some interesting things that popped up

199
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,599
on my end

200
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:09,360
only 10 incorporated might attack

201
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,000
framework this actually told me

202
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,360
something about

203
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,880
how actionable a certain report or

204
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,800
fender actually is or at least the

205
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,720
content they produce

206
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,120
twenty percent of that includes explicit

207
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,800
forecasts

208
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,960
and this usually tells me what are the

209
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,720
parties that are looking ahead

210
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,400
and thinking about the future 45 percent

211
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,680
used proprietary

212
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,160
telemetry as far as i could actually dig

213
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,280
up

214
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,280
and the remainder basically applied

215
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,160
expert analysis

216
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,840
finally 49 of all the con the documents

217
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,800
and

218
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,080
articles i reviewed build their piece

219
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:50,400
with

220
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,638
explicit company and service marketing

221
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,000
now when comparing all these documents

222
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
it seems like publishers sometimes have

223
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,080
an identity crisis

224
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,080
most of the content is used as marketing

225
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,520
and sometimes they want actually

226
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,520
a full-fledged research paper you know

227
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,680
in essence this is also visible

228
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,000
in the average structure they differ

229
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,759
across all documents

230
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:18,000
with pros and cons to various topics one

231
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,479
can add in

232
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,240
just breaking them now first of all you

233
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,840
know

234
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,440
everybody understands that these kind of

235
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,120
products are actually marketing and this

236
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,479
is okay

237
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:30,319
but just remember to keep your third

238
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:31,599
landscape factual

239
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:33,120
keep marketing separate from any

240
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,519
produced intelligence value

241
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:38,839
i'd like to hear your take not your

242
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:41,839
pitch second observation focuses on

243
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:44,640
creativity more creativity can be put in

244
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,560
structuring your messaging

245
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,120
it doesn't have to be the good old

246
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,560
academic paper approach

247
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,160
and a great example of that is the

248
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,600
verizon's

249
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,839
where data is at large and tone of voice

250
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:57,440
is at times comical

251
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,519
and this makes reading a joy in my

252
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,600
opinion

253
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,080
i know obviously also incorporate time

254
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,519
stamps in your documents

255
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,279
white papers and blogs without dates and

256
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:08,640
citation info

257
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,600
makes it very difficult for researchers

258
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,320
to track that

259
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,600
thirdly machine readable text structure

260
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,160
text versus unstructured text

261
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,519
well this is actually an uncharted

262
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,760
territory for most and examples of that

263
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,480
could be

264
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,800
the area of attack framework or

265
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,000
sticks-enabled

266
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,880
document structures this is actually one

267
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,720
of the areas i'm looking into to develop

268
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,440
that further

269
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,600
all right to be honest i haven't figured

270
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,959
out the answer quite yet myself

271
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:42,000
finally the use of forecasting language

272
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,080
most companies look back but one do we

273
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,839
look forward

274
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:47,680
isif's threat horizon report is an

275
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:51,440
excellent example how one can do this

276
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,839
i believe this is the area where you see

277
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,200
the most differences in themes and

278
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,399
topics

279
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:59,120
and mature and the maturity of the

280
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,519
threat intelligence teams

281
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,160
another element obviously of mature

282
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,519
third intelligence teams

283
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,279
is that they will also do a recap of

284
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:09,120
their anticipatory statements

285
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,680
to continuously improve and adjust which

286
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,519
gives in my opinion them massive street

287
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,680
creds

288
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,120
and the final tip ties into the

289
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,920
last point as well

290
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,920
so first of all it's good to mention

291
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,519
that i made the distinction when diving

292
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:30,160
into

293
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,519
the content between themes and topics

294
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:35,360
themes are more or less overarching

295
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,440
concepts where topics are

296
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,720
well topics the dominant themes

297
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,279
give no surprises all of them are on

298
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:44,079
point

299
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:46,880
per the first half check we've all seen

300
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,560
them by the way i think

301
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,200
the outlier themes or the themes that

302
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,720
are not as vocal as others

303
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,680
that's where the differences were an

304
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,160
example

305
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,880
is iot that was certainly a thing

306
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:03,040
combined with botnets and ddos

307
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,279
one thing i actually missed this year

308
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:06,959
was the hardware and processor

309
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:07,680
discussions

310
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,399
for example in addition to that macos

311
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,399
security is not a theme as well

312
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,440
that is being vocalized often and the

313
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,560
same goes for

314
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,680
5g and artificial intelligence

315
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,760
both concepts which are regularly in the

316
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,160
news but not yet manifested itself in

317
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,800
the mainstream

318
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:29,839
yet

319
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,440
now if we look into specific topics the

320
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,600
five most reference topics

321
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,600
mostly imperial in front of us are

322
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,640
ransomware phishing

323
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,399
the supply chain vulnerabilities and

324
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:43,680
details

325
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,279
let's take a quick look into all of them

326
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,240
before i start same as a weather

327
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,800
forecast i'm looking at the moment of q1

328
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,800
as the reporting on monday our check

329
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,160
today is wednesday

330
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,560
and the end of the year is saturday

331
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,800
saturday is my personal analysis a cyber

332
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,519
weatherman

333
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,760
for the next half based on the check

334
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,240
done today

335
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,880
obviously this will come to no one as a

336
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,760
surprise

337
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,639
we had major runs from berenson globally

338
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:13,920
and in addition

339
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,639
we saw an increase to take down the big

340
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,880
players

341
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,600
biggest change to me was that ransomware

342
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,680
finally became a topic of geopolitics

343
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,160
now for the rest of the year i believe

344
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,000
we will witness a small activity drop

345
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,760
over the summer

346
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:36,320
following the the legislative crackdown

347
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,800
an actress will pop a backup in q4 once

348
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,560
the new status quo has been established

349
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,440
and they know what they can and can do

350
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,720
as two evolutions

351
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,000
and techniques and procedures i'm

352
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,440
anticipating one being victim pressuring

353
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,959
this could for example be double

354
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:52,880
extortion

355
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,639
social media naming and shaming and ddos

356
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,560
all designed to pressure victims into

357
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,680
paying more and

358
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,519
faster second thing

359
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:06,480
which is actually something that has

360
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,320
been done in the last 20 years and that

361
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,079
was the ability for malware to evade

362
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:11,600
defenses

363
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,560
i think this we can surely expect this

364
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,639
to still be the case

365
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:19,440
and one pro tip i'd like to highlight

366
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,000
here

367
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,040
is the the use of the so-called cis

368
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,600
keyboard layouts and these reference

369
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,279
languages of the former sovereigns

370
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:30,079
soviet states basically off-limits to

371
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:31,600
most eastern

372
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,480
europe-based groups once malware hits

373
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,920
pcs with these layouts

374
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,160
it doesn't detonate and there's actually

375
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,560
a fun article from brian krebs

376
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,519
where he explains this concept and

377
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:44,560
obviously

378
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,880
tying back to my forecast in good

379
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,480
fashion of the evolution of defensive

380
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,399
agent we will then probably see more

381
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,320
creators start integrating time and look

382
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:52,800
at

383
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,199
english

384
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:00,000
number two was social engineering

385
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,959
through phishing

386
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,560
and what we like to call business even

387
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,040
compromise bc

388
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,959
phishing subjects have always been what

389
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:08,720
is trending at the point in time

390
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,600
for now it's coveted in cryptocurrency

391
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,880
who knows what's next

392
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,959
i mean this was pretty consistent for

393
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:16,800
the first half and it will probably be

394
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,760
so for the next half

395
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,720
we saw vendors responding to new trends

396
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,600
faster

397
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,519
an example for that is the use of these

398
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,320
fishy microsoft authentication emails

399
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,560
that was actually quickly shut down by

400
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,600
additional authentication methods

401
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,680
despite it all uh macro enabled

402
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,680
documents and zip files

403
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,680
consistently state the main source of

404
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,360
problems

405
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,199
and i believe we will not see a fishing

406
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,279
drop it is just

407
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:48,160
too effective and we will become it will

408
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,760
just become more and more refined

409
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,000
in addition i also believe that cross

410
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,839
medium integrations will occur

411
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:57,920
for example pretexting through something

412
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,639
like whatsapp

413
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:04,240
finally specifically for

414
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,800
business email compromise the dex are

415
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,240
expected to be become a bit more

416
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,760
sophisticated

417
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,839
and for example targeting group

418
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:13,360
mailboxes to construct

419
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,399
changes of payment details

420
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:18,320
and i think it's safe to say that

421
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,079
ransomware and this and

422
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:22,480
phishing slash visit email compromise

423
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,279
are still

424
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:27,839
the industry's two biggest problems

425
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,720
i'm always surprised actually about this

426
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,920
one the supply chain compromise

427
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,519
especially about volks referencing

428
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,040
supply chain compromises as something

429
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:41,839
new

430
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:43,519
this technique was around when i was in

431
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,680
diapers and it will probably exist until

432
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,600
i'm not there anymore

433
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,000
most interestingly major service

434
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,680
providers got hit in the first half and

435
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,560
cloud providers

436
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,360
have been at the crosshairs continuously

437
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,399
that being said

438
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:59,680
we haven't seen any uh the latest uh

439
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,160
we haven't seen the latest of this big

440
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:02,720
instance

441
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,920
this will continue to happen and

442
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,160
i'm expecting this to also appeal to the

443
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,959
geopolitical theater

444
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:12,800
now one element that actually doesn't

445
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,240
get a lot of attention is the

446
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,160
non-technical aspect of gaining initial

447
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:16,880
access

448
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,120
you really don't need a comprehensive

449
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,040
targeting program when you can just

450
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:21,839
course people

451
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:24,720
into clicking a link right by paying

452
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,279
them or

453
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:27,440
finding them nothing sophisticated about

454
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,040
that

455
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,639
let's see if we see some more on that

456
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:38,480
vulnerabilities right when it rains it

457
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,160
pours and this is unfortunately the same

458
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,079
for our friends at microsoft

459
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:43,600
when his vulnerabilities dominated the

460
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,839
last six months with the exclusion of

461
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:46,959
some vpn

462
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:49,199
basically anything remote work centric

463
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:50,720
vulnerabilities

464
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,399
the essence appears to reside in

465
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:54,000
vulnerabilities in older versions of

466
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:54,639
windows

467
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,320
which are then weaponized in modern

468
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,920
versions

469
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,519
and this will most likely not change

470
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:03,680
all this media attention however does

471
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,599
deflect from

472
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:08,000
security of other voices like mac os

473
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:08,640
linux

474
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,240
etc another big thing

475
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,520
to keep an eye out on is the new chinese

476
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,760
regulation for vulnerability disclosure

477
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,839
just putting it out there

478
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,520
this regulation forces chinese

479
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,799
researchers to first share

480
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:24,640
vulnerabilities with the mss

481
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,240
with all consequences you can think of

482
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,280
this is a very in my opinion concerning

483
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,559
development

484
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,400
for our friendly chinese vulnerability

485
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,960
researchers

486
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,320
and finally we have ddos to me ddos came

487
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,640
actually as a surprise when analyzing

488
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,120
the keywords of all the as part of the

489
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,120
meta analysis

490
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,559
but the conclusion today is quite simple

491
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:56,080
this is still a valid technique in the

492
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,320
arsenal fair the pandemic and the role

493
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,080
of card services needed for work i've

494
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,799
made us vulnerable to peak flooding

495
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:04,720
and remember that time when slack was

496
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,520
down oh boy

497
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,919
i'm going out on the limit and forecast

498
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:11,760
that we will see more than 10 million

499
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,520
details attacks this year

500
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,320
and i'm expecting new innovations that

501
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,799
will lead to more effective targeting

502
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:22,160
thus you know that being more refined

503
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,640
and at this point in time ddos extortion

504
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,080
for example is not the whale

505
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,880
machine and it is that it could be but i

506
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,679
can imagine

507
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:33,760
people can do that

508
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,640
so that being said these are the five

509
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,520
topics

510
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:43,760
which are most referenced

511
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,520
now what happens if you take all top

512
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,480
fives threes etc and put that in a chart

513
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,840
then you get something like this what

514
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,000
you see on screen basically what

515
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,520
everyone is thinking

516
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,080
in a chronological order there's a

517
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,919
couple of interesting highlights

518
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,320
the first one is that initial access is

519
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,000
consistent with the main topics we

520
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,120
identify

521
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,200
phishing supply chain vulnerability

522
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,880
expectation

523
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,120
the second is that once inside droppers

524
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,000
take care of dropping

525
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,679
additional malware this could be in for

526
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:14,559
steelers trojans or ransomware

527
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,799
third one is that ransomware is more

528
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,559
often deployed

529
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:20,480
at the end of the compromise when the

530
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,760
trojans are in place

531
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,440
the actions on objectives have been

532
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,600
fulfilled for example asks for trading

533
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,080
that

534
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,520
confidential information and the fourth

535
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,520
is the crackdown of law enforcement that

536
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,520
is also clearly visible in this order

537
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,400
my compliments go out to all the people

538
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,480
working day at night to stop this misery

539
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,000
now what makes these kind of overviews

540
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,520
useful in my opinion is that you can

541
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,960
leverage this understanding to prepare

542
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:45,520
your circuit

543
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,240
program so are we sufficiently equipped

544
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,200
to combat

545
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,760
remote accessories yes so let's check

546
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,360
that

547
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,080
another example could be how well

548
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,760
equipped are we to identify the fan

549
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,400
favorite cobalt strike activity

550
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:06,080
let me know what you think about this

551
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,240
now there's a couple other themes and

552
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,280
topics

553
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,440
uh you you should be monitoring which

554
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,799
are not let's say

555
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:15,919
in front of everyone first one is that

556
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:17,840
risk is great everybody says the overall

557
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,000
risk is becoming greater every year i'm

558
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,280
seeing this area

559
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,440
i think this is [ __ ] they're just

560
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,960
movements

561
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,320
challenge every vendor that tells you

562
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,080
this so for example

563
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,760
the over dominance of ransomware and

564
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,520
phishing articles

565
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,080
does that actually align with real world

566
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,919
activity

567
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:38,400
in this case it probably does but the

568
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,320
point is to do the work

569
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,640
sometimes forks need a fresh angle which

570
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,679
they didn't think

571
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:47,280
of another theme is the evolution of

572
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,880
crimeware

573
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,440
especially the business behind that so

574
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,720
imagine this you know

575
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,080
these are the kids that

576
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:03,039
were growing up in the zeros

577
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:05,600
excuse me so these are the kids that are

578
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,280
growing up for the zeroes um

579
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,039
who otherwise could have been successful

580
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:10,960
internet entrepreneurs

581
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,559
unfortunately they now took the dark

582
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:15,200
route and i think this conversation on

583
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,240
crime drives profit and attracts talent

584
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,640
so we're you know i'm expecting nations

585
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,520
to

586
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,200
further collaborate join forces share

587
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,760
resources to target common enemies

588
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,440
also considering victim vetting and

589
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,080
service modularity

590
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,240
even heard somebody say the dirty word

591
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,039
an apex third actor oh boy

592
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:38,400
now run for a treat right another

593
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,039
element

594
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:41,360
to consider is the role of western bias

595
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,799
in arthur landscapes

596
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:45,919
primary adversaries china iran russia

597
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:47,600
and north korea

598
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,159
well the east says no it's us it's

599
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:51,679
israel

600
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:53,440
the reality is that most countries

601
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,720
actually have developed

602
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,440
powerful capabilities not to mention

603
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,799
foreign versus domestic

604
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:01,520
actor groups

605
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,679
now we also have the macos based threats

606
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:06,960
and in the next half

607
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,960
we might even see the development of the

608
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,280
first ever malware to take advantage of

609
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,039
linux visualization streamlined on mac

610
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:14,799
computers running apple silicon and the

611
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:15,760
big sur

612
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:19,280
who knows and finally we have another

613
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:19,919
big one

614
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:22,240
is the winner's high ground and what i'm

615
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,840
what i'm saying trying to say with that

616
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,799
is the dominance of the windows terrain

617
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:28,720
has a big impact on everyone's

618
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:33,039
landscape mostly the windows user base

619
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:34,880
and that drives security research

620
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,120
obviously into new attack factors

621
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,919
in that majority and as also

622
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:41,039
demonstrated by

623
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:44,000
the recent exchange vulnerabilities but

624
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
also the new features

625
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,960
announced related to android signal some

626
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:54,000
interesting discussions

627
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,960
now if we have some specific topics uh

628
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:57,600
to

629
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,039
to monitor one the first one could be

630
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:04,080
um the focus on the old we mentioned

631
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,600
earlier that the research that goes into

632
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,120
old versions of windows and this is a

633
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,960
big thing

634
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,600
another big thing yet simple is attack

635
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,600
web applications between these simple

636
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,240
attacks

637
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,080
but apply a small number of steps or

638
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,240
additional actions after the initial web

639
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:22,400
application compromise

640
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,720
for extortion we can expect a continued

641
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,000
emphasis on normal extortion attacks

642
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,440
a cri you know this is a low-cost effort

643
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,320
with moderate high return basically a

644
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:34,960
criminal

645
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,760
sweet spot and it could tie into ddos

646
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,280
could tie into ransomware we could see

647
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,760
it everywhere

648
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,559
third one is dns focused attacks you

649
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:46,320
know even our phone book should be

650
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,840
considered

651
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,640
one example can be dns over https as

652
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,919
attack factor

653
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:53,600
everybody's talking about that for use

654
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,520
and even influencing dns is the thing

655
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,240
for use

656
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,000
and for some reason this is pushed again

657
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,760
and i'm actually curious if this is part

658
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,039
of one of the trends i've been seeing in

659
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:02,000
recent years

660
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,880
that actors move back to the perimeter

661
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,760
because

662
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:10,000
hosts are sufficiently locked down

663
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,279
now in terms of browser injection

664
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:17,200
more code has become more flexible than

665
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,360
ever and is able to reach further into

666
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,480
the attack surface

667
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,480
one malware campaign get a wide focus

668
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,200
across different devices platforms

669
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,600
a specific mower for example and

670
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,960
controlling hundreds of thousands of

671
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,240
domain

672
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,159
and the malware itself performs browser

673
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:33,760
injections in order to seat malicious

674
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,600
search results in the browser once it is

675
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,720
affected

676
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,039
and once you load a minish dll extension

677
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:41,279
this is essentially game over

678
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:42,720
and what people don't realize is that a

679
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,840
lot of edge device is also a browser

680
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,360
right

681
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,840
finally we have wire driving uh yeah you

682
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,000
know the the topic we talked about

683
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,640
five to ten years ago well right now it

684
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,760
never been so easy

685
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,760
and commoditization has spurred

686
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,559
solutions that simplify this process

687
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:02,080
and what is interesting is that you

688
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,919
don't have to build it yourself anymore

689
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:07,679
yes i know this is what everyone does um

690
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:10,159
but it evolved from just wifi to also

691
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:11,120
bluetooth

692
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,360
so traditional skimmers get an upgrade

693
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,480
that allows for more effective

694
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,360
collection of

695
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,919
sensitive information probably see

696
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:20,559
something more on that

697
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:23,919
so next steps on my side

698
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:25,440
first of all i will do this exercise

699
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,960
again by the end of the year

700
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,480
it will be interesting to compare what

701
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,480
people put out there and

702
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,600
if they saw the lessons of this talk

703
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,440
and i will explore more automatic

704
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,799
analysis of reports

705
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:38,400
maybe me and some friends will hold up

706
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,000
the old algorithm

707
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,799
who knows and it would be really cool if

708
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:44,159
we can get to some sort of

709
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:46,400
machine readable format i'm thinking

710
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,840
json sticks

711
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,919
tagging something like that and this

712
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:51,440
would allow for more

713
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,440
comparison and making everyone's

714
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,080
precious time more effective

715
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,840
finally i'm also a big fan of scenario

716
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,919
creation and more importantly testing of

717
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:00,400
that

718
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,760
and to determine the actual risk

719
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,679
and i'm anticipating that the industry

720
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:07,039
can also play its part

721
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:09,840
in enabling this test the scenario

722
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,120
philosophy

723
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,400
and one good example is for verizon dvr

724
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,640
which includes some specific scenarios

725
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,080
which folks can look into

726
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:26,000
so concluding the average of what

727
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,120
everyone thought

728
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,159
was on point hypothesis

729
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:32,880
check and for the in-house teams i have

730
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,080
three main takeaways

731
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,400
one is that basic security hygiene

732
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,600
obviously combats

733
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,320
pre-compromised behavior prepare for the

734
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,159
post-compromise behavior

735
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:44,960
thirdly report on forecasting however

736
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,159
you can

737
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:48,159
more specifically what you expect to

738
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:50,000
happen soon what is happening

739
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,720
right now and what do you think about

740
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,919
the gap between the two

741
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,120
what about the vendors well i want to

742
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,480
challenge all the vendors

743
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,840
to think more in terms of creativity

744
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,720
we will hate you we will not hate you

745
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,279
for trying something new innovative

746
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:12,640
and fail what what people just don't

747
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,120
like

748
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,480
is complementary marketing briefings

749
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:20,399
people will reach out to you either way

750
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:23,120
and finally and most importantly make

751
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,520
actual forecasts instead of the easy

752
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,080
topic x we'll be going trending soon

753
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,120
don't be that

754
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:35,840
dark throwing infosec

755
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,120
well special thanks to the folks who

756
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,799
helped me create this presentation

757
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:43,760
i really enjoyed it it was my pleasure

758
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,679
to speak at the blue team village

759
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:47,840
to wrap it up my contact details are

760
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,440
listed here

761
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,720
and if you're up for custom weather

762
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,720
forecasts or just want to hang out

763
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:56,320
reach out also the reports

764
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,240
reviewed in this research are uploaded

765
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,440
to my github

766
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,240
