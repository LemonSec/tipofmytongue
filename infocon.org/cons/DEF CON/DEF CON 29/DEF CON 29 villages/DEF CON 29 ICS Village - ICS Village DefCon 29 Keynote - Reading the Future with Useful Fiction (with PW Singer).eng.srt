1
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:03,439
all right and you are live

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:05,759
i'm going to drop and the floor is your

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:07,279
circle

4
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:09,599
so i'm utterly delighted to join you all

5
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:11,040
and share with you a

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,280
concept that we call useful fiction or

7
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,719
sometimes called

8
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:16,960
fictional intelligence basically what it

9
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:17,760
is is a

10
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,039
blend of non-fiction research and

11
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:22,640
analysis

12
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,599
with narrative with storytelling and in

13
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:26,560
particular

14
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,480
this is a project that we did with the

15
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,240
cyber solarium commission

16
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,439
uh that many of you are probably

17
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,920
familiar with this is the uh bipartisan

18
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,600
commission that was tasked to

19
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,360
think through both the future of cyber

20
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,680
threats but also u.s government cyber

21
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,000
security strategy how do we handle it

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,920
and we were asked to help

23
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,039
generate out a vision of

24
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:51,520
the key themes from their report but

25
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,120
packaged through scenario

26
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,079
and it actually was the introduction to

27
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,000
the report itself so think of it

28
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,559
as a vignette but also it can do an

29
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:01,920
executive summary

30
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,959
and um it goes as follows

31
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:07,520
a warning from tomorrow by peter singer

32
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,680
and august cole

33
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,680
you spend your whole career on capitol

34
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,960
hill hoping for an

35
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,439
office with a window then when you

36
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:16,799
finally get it

37
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,520
all you want to do is look away they set

38
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,520
up our emergency off site for essential

39
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,680
senate staff and vacant offices once

40
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,600
belonging to one of the contractors that

41
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,560
lobbied us

42
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,520
before they all went badly up last year

43
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,079
the offices are in a high rise in roslyn

44
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:34,720
with a literal million dollar view

45
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,640
looking across the potomac river

46
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,799
you can see past the national mall and

47
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:39,759
the monuments

48
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,799
all the way into downtown dc

49
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,040
and it just breaks your heart the

50
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,040
rainbow of colors in the window paints

51
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,159
how everything went

52
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,360
so wrong so fast the water in the

53
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,079
potomac

54
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,320
still has that red tent from when the

55
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,560
treatment plants upstream were hacked

56
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,560
their automated systems tricked into

57
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,520
flushing out the wrong mix of chemicals

58
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,280
by comparison the water in the lincoln

59
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,880
memorial reflecting pool

60
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,439
has a purple glint to it they've pumped

61
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:08,000
out the flood

62
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,520
waters that covered washington's

63
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,520
low-lying areas after the region's

64
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,879
reservoirs were hit

65
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:15,520
in a cascade of sensor hacks but the

66
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,959
surge left behind an

67
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:19,040
oily sludge that will linger for who

68
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,800
knows how long

69
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,560
that's what you get from deciding in the

70
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,720
18th century to put your capital city in

71
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,400
low-lying swampland

72
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,040
and then in the 21st century wiring up

73
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,640
all its infrastructure to an

74
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,680
insecure network all around the mall you

75
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,200
can see the black smudges of the

76
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,200
delivery drones and the air taxis that

77
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,120
were remotely hijacked to crash into the

78
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,000
crowds of innocents like fiery meteors

79
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,760
and in the opening spaces and parks

80
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,720
beyond tiny dots of bright colors smear

81
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,840
together like some tragic pointless

82
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,319
painting

83
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:51,599
these are the camping tents and

84
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,760
makeshift shelters of the refugees

85
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,680
who fled the toxic railroad accident

86
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,599
caused by the control system failure in

87
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:58,879
baltimore

88
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:01,200
fema says it's safe to go back now that

89
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,360
the chemical cloud is dissipated

90
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,360
but with all the churn and disinfo on

91
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,480
social media

92
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,680
no one knows who or what to trust last

93
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,159
night

94
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,080
the orange of their campfires was like a

95
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,760
vigil of the obstinate

96
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,599
waiting for everything to just return to

97
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:16,879
the way it was

98
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:19,920
but it won't a knock on the door

99
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,239
shakes me out of it it's a legislative

100
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,239
director checking back in

101
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,239
she's anxious because the boss promised

102
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:27,840
that we get a draft of the bill out

103
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,360
tonight to all the other committees that

104
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,519
touch on cyber security

105
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:33,680
no cars are online and nobody wants to

106
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,200
risk the metro after what happened on

107
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,159
the blue line

108
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,159
that will mean hours of walking from

109
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:39,920
office to office

110
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,239
at least the irony of backpacking around

111
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,959
paper printouts of new cyber security

112
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,440
cyber security laws will be lost on no

113
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,400
one

114
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,000
i tell her that i'll get it done and

115
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,319
turn back to wordsmithing the preamble

116
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,239
i mostly mine the language from old

117
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,080
legislation that someone just like me

118
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,480
wrote after the 9 11 attacks

119
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,799
i know some online troll or talking head

120
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:02,879
on the news will end up calling it lazy

121
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,640
but it's the closest anyone can think of

122
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,000
as a parallel

123
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,959
of course with all the servers down our

124
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:09,360
poor

125
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,439
intern had to run a paper copy from the

126
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,280
library of congress

127
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,639
it reads as follows whereas

128
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,238
for as long as the united states has

129
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:19,839
been a nation that invented and then

130
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,600
became dependent on the internet

131
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,199
it has faced online threats and whereas

132
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,120
these threats grew in scale and

133
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,440
frequency we grew too accustomed to

134
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,440
digital interference in our society

135
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,600
economy and even elections and whereas

136
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,000
ai and automation change these networks

137
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,639
from use

138
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,720
not just for communications but to

139
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,759
connect and

140
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,160
operate the things that run our physical

141
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,199
world

142
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,680
and whereas a new type of vulnerability

143
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,800
thus emerged

144
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,280
where software could be not just a means

145
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,160
of theft

146
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,280
but a weapon of mess disruption and even

147
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,120
physical destruction

148
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,600
and whereas our government and industry

149
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,520
failed to keep pace with this change of

150
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,120
technology and threat

151
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,560
being ill-organized and ill-prepared and

152
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,199
whereas these vulnerabilities have just

153
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:10,080
been exploited

154
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,080
in extraordinary acts of treacherous

155
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,440
violence that caused

156
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,840
massive loss of life and effectively

157
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,600
held the nation hostage

158
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,720
and whereas such acts continue to pose a

159
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,800
threat to the national security and very

160
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,919
way of life of the united states now

161
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,400
therefore be it resolved by the senate

162
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,840
and house of representatives of the

163
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,759
united states of america and congress

164
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:32,560
assembled

165
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,639
that the government of the united states

166
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,320
must

167
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,600
must what what can we really do

168
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,320
no matter what legislation we pass now

169
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,240
after everything that's happened

170
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:53,840
we're too late

171
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,800
in 2021 i mean critical infrastructure

172
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,160
is having all these challenges

173
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,840
and somebody still can't hop on without

174
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,680
being on mute um

175
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,840
so i was just joking not to start things

176
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,440
off on a somber note but

177
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,440
of course that was the the fictional

178
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,280
story that you put for the cyberspace

179
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,440
solarium commission as you noted um so

180
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,479
let's let's step back

181
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,800
right you you mentioned this concept of

182
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,400
fictional intelligence

183
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,800
which is using story storytelling

184
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,759
to help educate and bring around

185
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,360
understanding awareness and change

186
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,479
part of what we're trying to do here at

187
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,319
the village how did you first get into

188
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:31,199
that

189
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,880
so the background to it is in many ways

190
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,800
august cole and i stumbled upon it in a

191
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,680
project called

192
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,440
um ghost fleet and uh it was

193
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,720
a combination of a techno thriller novel

194
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,280
it looked at what a war between the us

195
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,479
and china and russia

196
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:50,240
might look like but um we were both

197
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,960
non-fiction guys uh you know i have

198
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,560
written non-fiction books on

199
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,479
on cyber security and more recent

200
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,319
weaponization of social media

201
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,840
teach classes on it at graduate school

202
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,000
level um

203
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,319
in turn august had been the defense beat

204
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,080
reporter for wall street journal

205
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,960
so when we were building this novel we

206
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,160
couldn't help ourselves

207
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,800
and actually conducted years of research

208
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,280
and

209
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,080
showed it in in the book um so it was a

210
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:16,800
novel

211
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,080
but with i think 27 pages of research

212
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,599
endnotes and the rule

213
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,520
in it as we built it was you couldn't

214
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,120
just dream it up you couldn't do like

215
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:25,680
you know

216
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,360
related to cyber security where someone

217
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,960
goes you know click and clap

218
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,680
we're in no you had to have the citation

219
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,319
of

220
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,080
here's the threat intelligence report

221
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,240
here's where this type of attack

222
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,680
actually happened out in the wild

223
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,919
often um the u.s conducted against

224
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:40,880
someone else

225
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,479
and then hey maybe someone might do it

226
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,319
back against us and

227
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:47,520
um the combination of the two of this

228
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,000
non-fiction and narrative fused together

229
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,400
really took off uh it obviously sold

230
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,520
really well

231
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,400
um but that package and it's sometimes

232
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,280
called thicken

233
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,599
or also you might think of it as useful

234
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:01,599
fiction is what we also call it

235
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:03,840
um it proved to be the most influential

236
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,039
work of our careers

237
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:08,080
i testified to congress i think four

238
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,280
times on it

239
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,960
um three different government

240
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,960
investigations were launched

241
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,599
to essentially fix things that we had

242
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:16,479
identified

243
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:20,080
inside our novel um gave briefings on

244
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,840
its real world lessons everywhere from

245
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,000
the white house situation room

246
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,360
to the nobel institute to cyber command

247
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,639
in nsa

248
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,960
um to the deck of an aircraft carrier

249
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,240
name it and so

250
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,159
it just struck us that uh this

251
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,799
combination had had great power

252
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:40,719
and it again it's it's the fusion

253
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,839
that matters um a techno thriller

254
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:46,480
science fiction you know i love them but

255
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,839
they're like a milkshake

256
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:50,560
they're entertaining um they're not

257
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,600
designed to be

258
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,120
good for you in turn um a

259
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,240
a powerpoint briefing a white paper

260
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,399
a trend report that's like handing

261
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:01,440
someone you know

262
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,320
uh a fistful of vitamins and say take it

263
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:04,959
um

264
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:07,120
and you know most people will be like i

265
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,040
don't want it or i'll ignore it

266
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,399
um useful fiction it's what i did to my

267
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:13,920
kids this morning

268
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,160
it's a breakfast smoothie so you're

269
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,920
sneaking the good stuff

270
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,279
into that package of a story

271
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:24,480
um so the the value cell of it

272
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,320
is um one they're more likely to read it

273
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,120
um two the science not to get wonky with

274
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,480
you but the science shows

275
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,720
that um they're more likely to it's more

276
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,320
likely to stick with them

277
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,440
uh when you read a white paper

278
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,360
when you you listen to a powerpoint

279
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,200
whatever two parts of your brain

280
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,720
light up when you get that same

281
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,560
information package and story

282
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,800
four parts of your brain light up and

283
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,000
then one of the other really

284
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,680
cool things about it is um good story

285
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,880
hits with emotion and as everyone from a

286
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,440
you know

287
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,040
sales person to a politician know

288
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,160
emotion is what drives the sale

289
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,600
and so that example that we did for um

290
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,440
the cyber salary permission it was

291
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,360
targeted not just to capture the key

292
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,560
themes you know what critical

293
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,000
infrastructure threats might look like

294
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,120
in the future

295
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,880
but it was also trying to connect to an

296
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,800
emotion of their target audience which

297
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,120
was

298
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,079
you don't want to experience this

299
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,160
simulated this synthetic experience as

300
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,440
character like you

301
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,279
a congressional staffer was their target

302
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:30,480
audience they

303
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:35,920
feel regret do you want to feel that too

304
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,360
oh read this report put this legislation

305
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,160
into action

306
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,720
you won't have that negative experience

307
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,360
so

308
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,040
those are some of the value propositions

309
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,200
of the idea and it's been awesome since

310
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:47,519
then

311
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,760
um you know we've done it with congress

312
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,600
we've done them for corporations um

313
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,519
we're doing a project right now

314
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,519
for um the british government and the

315
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:56,800
u.s marine corps

316
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,720
it the concept has really taken off it's

317
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,440
been a lot of fun

318
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,360
so how did you get tied into the

319
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,040
cyberspace solarium commission is that

320
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,959
something where they recognize the value

321
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,000
of this based on

322
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,839
what you and august had done previously

323
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,320
and said we want that to help

324
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,160
get more impact with when this report

325
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,680
comes out yeah they

326
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,560
they um actually approached uh on that

327
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,120
and

328
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,240
uh you know it was it was it was awesome

329
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,279
it was um it really

330
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:27,120
how to put it um the best kind of

331
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,880
projects are the ones

332
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,920
that are important and

333
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,600
intrinsically interesting which is a

334
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,360
nice way of saying fun

335
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,079
um and so you know the slam commission

336
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:39,519
obviously hugely

337
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:42,320
critical but also to try and pull back

338
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,440
and go okay

339
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,200
this is i mean i have to go what was it

340
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,560
it was a um i'm looking real quickly 182

341
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,680
page report

342
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,560
okay how do you take the goodness within

343
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,959
that 182 page report

344
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:58,000
boil down its key themes

345
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,240
some of its key recommendations or even

346
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,000
buried within that story

347
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,760
uh for example there's a little off in

348
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,839
reference to um

349
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:07,519
public private there's another often

350
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:08,880
reference to

351
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,720
too many committees touching on cyber

352
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,720
security and sort of the frustration

353
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,720
that staffer feels so basically

354
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,800
it's it's like a riddle how do we take

355
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,800
those themes and boil it down into a

356
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,880
story and so you know we pull it down in

357
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,680
this story of

358
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,639
a of a staffer you know trying to figure

359
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,639
out how to write legislation the day

360
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:27,120
after

361
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,399
the the equivalent of a massive

362
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,320
um level of a critical infrastructure

363
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,920
attack like we haven't yet experienced

364
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:34,800
but

365
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,880
people like you and i um you know who

366
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,040
work on the also the research i go look

367
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,639
these are real world threats whether

368
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,560
it's water systems hacks

369
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,920
you'll notice there's no part of it

370
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,600
that's the the lazy

371
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,680
um oh the power grid might go down i

372
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,519
mean that is a real threat but we go

373
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,200
beyond that because that's one of the

374
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:51,839
key

375
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,480
issues that we see looming is um it lays

376
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,000
out again you know it might be water

377
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,600
systems it might be transportation

378
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,880
networks it might be

379
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,480
when we say water systems there's

380
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,160
different types there is

381
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,959
the chemical levels there's the the um

382
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:06,399
reservoir systems that

383
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,720
that control the water level and rivers

384
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,079
um you know we can go

385
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:13,279
there's uh gps hacks against um aerial

386
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:14,160
systems

387
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,360
all of that's going to get a lot more

388
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,360
interesting when it comes to greater use

389
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:17,600
of

390
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,480
um drones and delivery or the like so it

391
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,519
was basically this

392
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:24,800
riddle of how do we capture that tell

393
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,200
that

394
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,000
story in a way that also links to

395
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,200
emotion

396
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,120
i'll give you another fun example of one

397
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,639
that we did um

398
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:36,800
that i was with a um a corporation

399
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,920
um we were trying to figure out um for

400
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,279
c-suite leaders uh how do you convey

401
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:46,320
you know the experience of um why they

402
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,320
ought to act uh

403
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,480
to protect networks you know as everyone

404
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,519
knows it's it's

405
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:52,959
not everyone is as people in the

406
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:54,560
industry know

407
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,040
um you know it's often not how are we

408
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,079
convinced to see so

409
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:00,079
the risk it's how do i convince the ceo

410
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:02,079
and the board and the chief financial

411
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:04,560
officer and it can't just be well the

412
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,000
network might get hacked that

413
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
they're aware of that and so we we

414
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,240
created a scenario which was their

415
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,680
nightmare scenario and it's um the day

416
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,519
it's a couple of days after a breach a

417
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,120
ransomware incident going back to

418
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,560
predicting the future and we've seen a

419
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,000
lot more of these recently

420
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
um but it's not you know the nightmare

421
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,399
scenario for the ceo is not oh

422
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:28,000
my company might get hacked um the story

423
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,440
is set um as a

424
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,880
ceo is sitting in row 27

425
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,519
of a commercial flight so they're in the

426
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:39,600
the worst of coach class

427
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,240
as they have to fly to washington to

428
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,079
testify to congress about

429
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:46,720
the breach so for them it's then you'll

430
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,440
remember the

431
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,720
the um executives a couple years back

432
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,320
who got caught you know in their private

433
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,240
jet so now they have to fly commercial

434
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,079
and so it's this experience of what is

435
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:57,279
my the

436
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:00,160
it's not network getting hacked it's how

437
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,000
will i personally have to deal with it

438
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,920
and i'm gonna have to fly coach

439
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,399
and my board's angry at me and i'm gonna

440
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,160
be yelled at by a bunch of members of

441
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,760
congress that i just have to sit and

442
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,480
take it

443
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,720
and so it's again setting up that this

444
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,560
is why you need to act

445
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,720
um not just oh the network might get

446
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,600
breached how do we connect it to a scene

447
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,720
and emotion that they care about

448
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,120
so i'm guessing that you you didn't have

449
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,240
a background

450
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,800
deep in industrial control systems prior

451
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,240
to a lot of this research

452
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,199
and i think that's kind of an

453
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:32,880
interesting thing because there's such a

454
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,320
depth of technology

455
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,759
um and when we talk about critical

456
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:37,199
infrastructure wow that sounds like a

457
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,199
simple two words put together

458
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:41,920
the fact that that's 16 different ssas

459
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,720
and the

460
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,560
various technologies it gets a lot more

461
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,639
complex so how do you approach the

462
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:48,480
research process to get

463
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,560
technically smart enough so as you said

464
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,240
you are well you're not

465
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,000
pedaling the vitamins that you're at

466
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,519
least staying true to

467
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:58,079
the nutritional formula yeah that's

468
00:15:58,079 --> 00:15:59,279
that's a great question

469
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:02,720
and it it you know it's it's how to put

470
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,240
it um

471
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,199
to continue that uh there's a recipe

472
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,279
right you know so making a good smoothie

473
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:11,040
there's an actual recipe to it to get

474
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,959
the nutrients and the taste side

475
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:16,320
um so a lot of this was uh

476
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,240
drawn from the work that we did for a

477
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,320
more recent product called burn-in

478
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,560
uh which uh you and i actually got to

479
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,360
chat um

480
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,800
a a while back um burn in was

481
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,000
a it's a book um that's a package of

482
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,120
useful fiction

483
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,920
um it's a story that that follows a hunt

484
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,440
for a terrorist who's

485
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,959
going after uh iot um

486
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:42,160
about ten years out and

487
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,440
um so we get to see uh

488
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,040
what are the different ways that we're

489
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,240
going to be using iot and more broadly

490
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,079
as we weave in greater amounts of

491
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:53,759
automation and ai because

492
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,079
to me that there's a common it's not

493
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:58,079
just that we're moving to an internet of

494
00:16:58,079 --> 00:16:58,639
things

495
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:02,160
it's it's an intelligent uh network

496
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,480
um but we are seeing all sorts of

497
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,640
vulnerabilities baked into it

498
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,160
and we it opens up new um both threat

499
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,839
actors and types of attack and that's

500
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,520
what burn in was capturing

501
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:18,799
um now uh the research for it

502
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:22,000
took about three years and it involved

503
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,199
everything from um you know pulling up

504
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,919
uh threat intelligence reports and and

505
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:28,640
actually

506
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,640
you know presentations that are you know

507
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,480
at places like a defcon

508
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,880
of folks showing off what they've been

509
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,600
able

510
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,799
to to to do uh showing some of the

511
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:40,720
vulnerabilities that are out there

512
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,919
in addition um interviews interviews

513
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:46,480
with experts from across you know

514
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,280
everything you know

515
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,919
so if you want to know about um water

516
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:51,840
systems vulnerabilities

517
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,039
there are extensive threat reports on it

518
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:58,400
but i also did interviews with both

519
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,360
um uh analyst at cyber security

520
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,080
companies

521
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,080
all the way up to um executives and one

522
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,440
of the interesting things

523
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,360
about that was and it hit when you were

524
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,120
talking about multiple different sectors

525
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,559
it's basically got into um talking about

526
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:15,840
why the cyber security industry was

527
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,160
drawn to market and provide more

528
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:18,880
services

529
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,799
to some parts of critical infrastructure

530
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:21,919
than others

531
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:23,520
there is to put it bluntly sort of a

532
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,200
market structure

533
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,400
that makes some types of markets more

534
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,120
profitable

535
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:33,120
than others um water is an area

536
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,280
where um if you look at the structure of

537
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,640
the industry

538
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,440
it's a lot of um mom and pop size

539
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,559
companies

540
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,960
they're not large regional companies

541
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,799
it's either mom and pop size

542
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,880
private companies for the most part and

543
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:47,840
or

544
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,760
a local county city or even

545
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:55,039
town water authority and the structure

546
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:56,400
of that means that

547
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,960
oh and on top of that the regulatory

548
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,559
agency for it

549
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:02,880
up until recently not interested in

550
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,280
cyber security its focus is on pollution

551
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,039
so there wasn't a lot of kind of

552
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:09,280
attention steering the way if you look

553
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,080
at for example

554
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,480
a parallel like um you know set aside

555
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,160
banking where all the incentives are

556
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,919
aligned to cyber security

557
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:18,400
um in terms of you know there's the the

558
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,320
monetary value is very clear

559
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,880
um power industry you know there you've

560
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,240
got everything from there's been more

561
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,840
attention paid to it to

562
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,840
larger companies that have larger

563
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,280
budgets and the like

564
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,919
and so you get that from interviewing

565
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:33,520
the cyber security companies why are

566
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,200
they not spending much on it why are you

567
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,799
not marketing as much to them

568
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:38,960
to the other side of it um i interviewed

569
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,960
water systems engineers

570
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,080
the people that literally designed the

571
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,840
water networks for major cities

572
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,880
like washington dc which is where um the

573
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,160
story is set

574
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,240
so you know and you get when you talk to

575
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,440
people and

576
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,960
you know you'll have a lot of this and

577
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,679
and um you know networking and

578
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:01,840
conferences like you get you know sort

579
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,039
of the formal answer and then you get

580
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:05,039
the stories that people tell over drinks

581
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:05,600
right

582
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,200
you'll never believe what we did or

583
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,120
you'll never believe what we saw

584
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,240
and so that's where you know we get the

585
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,600
the goodness that's where we get the

586
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,600
real world ideas is from

587
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,960
either real world experts or real

588
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,080
world reports um a different way of

589
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,679
putting it is we we call it the no

590
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:26,640
vaporware rule there there can't be

591
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,919
anything that's sort of just

592
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:30,480
drawn out of vaporware either you know a

593
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,159
technology that doesn't exist or

594
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:34,000
something that's purely imagination

595
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,120
safe you know again i love my sci-fi

596
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,720
um but if it's so far out in the future

597
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,880
so vaporware it's not as useful

598
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,640
and that's also i think the frustration

599
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,880
a lot of people in the cyber security

600
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,400
field have towards um depictions and pop

601
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,360
culture

602
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,440
is you know like i said it's either you

603
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,799
know it um

604
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:57,200
it's like clicking clock i'm in you know

605
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:57,840
or

606
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,720
it's um the people in it are not

607
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,559
realistic right you know i mean

608
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:05,600
i i like mr robot but you know

609
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:09,678
everybody in the field is not like that

610
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,400
uh yeah so uh where you were talking

611
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,000
about where it comes to money this is

612
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,520
something that we've talked about a lot

613
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,080
here

614
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,679
is that um in a regulated industry

615
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:20,720
of which a lot of critical

616
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,400
infrastructure has different forms of

617
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,280
regulation which

618
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,720
when we're talking about regulation it

619
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,880
doesn't just mean security it also means

620
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,240
that rate basis

621
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,400
i can charge more for electricity than i

622
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,520
can for water

623
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,559
my ability to spend that money back in

624
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:36,559
increasing a you know pushing a rate

625
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:37,760
cost to customers

626
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,679
has to go through a public utilities

627
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:41,120
commission for approval

628
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,440
and so that restricts drives a lot of

629
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,200
those kinds of changes

630
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,760
to what can be done uh and with of

631
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,240
course

632
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,880
2021 was like the year of industrial

633
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,320
control system hacks

634
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,760
um you don't have to predict the future

635
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,280
when the future keeps happening every

636
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,159
other week

637
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:57,919
we started with you know with solar

638
00:21:57,919 --> 00:21:59,440
winds which had a

639
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,320
large impact we had the florida water

640
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,159
hack around the the super bowl

641
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:06,320
um the irony of that one is that exact

642
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,440
same hack is what we've been

643
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,360
demonstrating here physically in the ics

644
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:09,840
village

645
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:13,280
for several years and there's the and

646
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,200
thank you very much is one of the key

647
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,720
scenarios we don't want to plot spoil

648
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,880
burn in but was one of the key scenarios

649
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,440
in it

650
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,360
and again you had the florida one but

651
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,640
the florida one

652
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,679
um you had earlier the attempted

653
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:27,919
one on the israeli water networks and so

654
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:28,880
you know when people like

655
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,400
how did you predict this how did you

656
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,960
depict this like the information is

657
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,000
out there um it's more about putting it

658
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,120
together

659
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,679
uh it's you know connecting the dots and

660
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:40,799
then you have you know what we were

661
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,080
talking about earlier

662
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:45,360
which is that so much um

663
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,080
particularly in the cyber security field

664
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:48,480
is

665
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,919
not how do i explain

666
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:55,520
this new thing it's how do i

667
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,480
explain it in a way that my target

668
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,200
audience

669
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,480
will take it in will understand it

670
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,320
how do i get and hold their attention

671
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,240
how do i put it in manners that they're

672
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,039
more likely to act upon so it's it's

673
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:13,600
it's the communication piece of it

674
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,280
that's often more of the challenge i

675
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:15,840
mean it's

676
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,880
very rare to think of um

677
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,080
any you know major cyber security

678
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,880
incident that we had not had a series of

679
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,200
them beforehand that were smaller

680
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,240
or they were demoed at a conference or

681
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,039
whatever

682
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:32,880
the information was out there we just

683
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,159
weren't weren't willing or able to act

684
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:38,240
on and that might be true for a nation

685
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,080
definitely the case for corporations

686
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,159
right

687
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:44,400
so if you could give us any insights or

688
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,279
share um

689
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:47,760
what's kind of the next project or um

690
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,360
anything around that you're allowed to

691
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,240
talk about

692
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,760
yeah so um august and i august cole and

693
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,120
i turned it into a business

694
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,559
uh we were having so much fun

695
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:00,640
doing these you know kind of one-off

696
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,600
stories

697
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:05,360
um and we realized that the demand

698
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,919
was there you know so if there's one

699
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:08,960
group that's like we've got this

700
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,960
strategy report but we can't get people

701
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:11,279
to

702
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:14,640
read the key ideas of it um they're not

703
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,200
the only

704
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,720
group in the world that has that

705
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,640
challenge um we also

706
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:22,080
have been doing uh training courses with

707
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,080
um different groups on how do you do

708
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,279
forecasting

709
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:26,799
how do you do communication and that

710
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,320
came out of the air force approach

711
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,600
justin said

712
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,679
it was the air force blue horizons their

713
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:32,960
futures team

714
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,039
they um they said you know don't don't

715
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:36,880
create the scenarios and and we just

716
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,279
want to

717
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:40,480
we you all have predicted well teach us

718
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,480
how and so we put today a two day course

719
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,240
for them and so basically you know

720
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,799
um essentially what happened is we

721
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:48,480
looked around and said

722
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,919
hold it clearly this group is not the

723
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:53,919
only one that has strategy reports that

724
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:55,600
people won't read or trend reports that

725
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,159
they need to

726
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,559
hold attention or the air force is

727
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,000
clearly not the only group in the world

728
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,679
that's wrestling with how do we do

729
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:03,120
forecasting well

730
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,960
and so after we had a couple of these

731
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,720
one-offs we're like let's turn it into a

732
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,400
business and um we've been doing more

733
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,279
and more of them

734
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:11,440
we've done with everyone from um as i

735
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,360
mentioned private corporations to

736
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,080
to nato we're in the middle of um one

737
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:16,880
right now

738
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,279
with uh the marine corps and a different

739
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:20,559
one the british government

740
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:21,760
and they've been you know going back to

741
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,600
what we're talking about before uh

742
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,840
they've been fun um they hopefully have

743
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,760
a great deal of impact actually we know

744
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,039
they have a great deal of impact we've

745
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:29,360
got

746
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,919
the numbers to prove it but um more

747
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:32,960
important they're just

748
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,480
it's been it's been intrinsically

749
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,039
interesting uh it's also been fun for me

750
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:38,799
to sort of learn how to be a small

751
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:39,520
businessman

752
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,720
on the side uh so that that's been an

753
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,279
interesting experience

754
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:47,440
so with all of the stories that you've

755
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,039
written what's the one thing that still

756
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:52,000
keeps you up at night

757
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:54,480
um

758
00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:01,200
uh oh my kids um but no i

759
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:05,039
the bio side um you know we fear

760
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:08,240
what we don't understand

761
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,600
and i'm able to you know kind of wrap my

762
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,640
head around

763
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,679
um you know

764
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:19,440
the iot infrastructure

765
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,480
um the

766
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,720
the bio side as we've put it um

767
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,039
we've lived when i say bio i mean bio

768
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:31,039
threats um

769
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:33,679
engineered diseases you know it's been

770
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:35,360
the last year and a half has been bad

771
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,159
enough

772
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:38,000
um and we've and it's been bad enough

773
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,520
because we've seen

774
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,880
the um kind of deliberate uh

775
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,880
spread of disinformation around it um

776
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,799
of you know everything from you know

777
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:50,880
what can you do in masking the vaccines

778
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,240
to um the willful

779
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,400
kind of ignorance of it so i i how to

780
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,279
put it

781
00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:01,360
i guess i'm not expressing this well the

782
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:05,039
bio terrorism side keeps me up at night

783
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:08,400
even both because i'm i'm i don't

784
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,880
well understand the biologic side as

785
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,640
much as i do the physics

786
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,039
etc but the second is the experience

787
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:16,799
that we've had and the pandemic

788
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:19,200
um makes me you know kind of more

789
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,080
worried about

790
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,799
it because you know it goes to like the

791
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:24,640
reason why none of the zombie movies

792
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,399
would work anymore because you know

793
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:27,279
essentially

794
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:28,799
you'd have a bunch of people walking up

795
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:30,240
to the zombies saying i don't think

796
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,679
you're real

797
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:34,000
or what or like you know i'm not gonna

798
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,520
run away from the zombie

799
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,840
it's my choice you know whatever like

800
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:38,559
that's what we

801
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:40,240
we're living right now with corona and

802
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,000
so this is a disease

803
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,960
that is awful it has been has not been

804
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,720
the type that might be engineered when

805
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,000
you think about you know

806
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,840
what might be in the hands of a bio

807
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,279
terrorist five ten years out

808
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:52,080
particularly

809
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,480
as it moves into um the dna to the

810
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,919
genomic side of things so

811
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:59,440
that's what spooks me um uh

812
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,640
yeah um i hope i you know

813
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,320
hope hopefully that part stays in the

814
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,760
realm of fiction

815
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,200
let's hope it stays in the realm of

816
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,799
fiction and clearly george romero's

817
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:10,240
career would have gone a different way

818
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,240
in the alternate universe you just

819
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,600
described yeah

820
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,880
the internet really um ruined you know

821
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,360
whether it was the the you know the day

822
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,120
of the dead or dawn of the dead i mean

823
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,960
you know i i love those movies but

824
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,279
um i just don't think the the plot would

825
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:28,559
survive the world of

826
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:30,880
um facebook and twitter and instagram

827
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,080
you know think how it would warp

828
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,760
everything in those stories

829
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:37,679
um uh any final words

830
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:40,240
uh as we kick off defcon 29 here with

831
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,360
the ics village

832
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,679
no it's just i really appreciate the

833
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:44,880
opportunity to join you

834
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,840
um and i also appreciate the incredible

835
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,520
work that people have done over the

836
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,480
years

837
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,520
um in the village and the like i mean

838
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,720
it's it's

839
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,159
it's helped me individually as someone

840
00:28:58,159 --> 00:28:59,360
as a researcher as an

841
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,640
analyst as a professor but it's also

842
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,520
served the wider world i mean it has had

843
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:05,840
a

844
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,399
