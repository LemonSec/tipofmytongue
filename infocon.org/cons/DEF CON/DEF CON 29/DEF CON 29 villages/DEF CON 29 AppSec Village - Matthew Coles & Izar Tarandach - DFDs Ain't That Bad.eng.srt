1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,080
hi everyone and welcome to our

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,240
presentation for the absec village

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,359
at defcon 29 uh it's

4
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:11,840
both uh uh an honor and uh a very uh

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,080
nice thing for both of us to be able to

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,800
be here talking to you guys about this

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,640
uh we are matt and i am izar

8
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,480
something about us and why are we

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,720
talking about this stuff here

10
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,519
uh i'm a security principal security

11
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:30,080
engineer

12
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,920
at squarespace security thing for a long

13
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,120
time

14
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,800
mostly on the defense side on the

15
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,160
builder side

16
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,360
and i am currently focusing on modern

17
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,239
sdlcs

18
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:42,800
and how we get security into them and

19
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,480
how we get developers to actually

20
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,920
do security and i'm matt coles

21
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,360
i'm a security engineer over at at dell

22
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,960
technologies and i work on protecting

23
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,719
physical devices primarily and

24
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,520
ecosystems making them secure for the

25
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,280
products that we sell and the ways that

26
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,840
we build them

27
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,760
we have been collaborating since 2010

28
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,560
when we both

29
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,960
worked at what was at the time the uh

30
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,280
the broad security office had to tell

31
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,400
that sorry

32
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,479
at the time it was emc then it became

33
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,000
delvmc

34
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,200
we have uh recently co-authored an

35
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,080
o'reilly book

36
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,840
called threat modeling a practical guide

37
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,360
for development teams

38
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,840
or as we internally call it the ugly

39
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,439
fishbook

40
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,280
and we are proud members of the 15

41
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,000
experts that came together last year to

42
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,880
write the threat modeling manifesto

43
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,880
which actually we are going to be citing

44
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,119
throughout this presentation

45
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,920
now the standard disclaimer is in there

46
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,920
we are speaking for ourselves we are not

47
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,040
speaking for our

48
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,799
uh respective employers and

49
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,159
let's take it on the road so what do we

50
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,719
have for you today

51
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,280
we are going to talk mostly about the

52
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,159
modeling part

53
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:08,399
of threat modeling we in our experience

54
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,479
working with developers in doing threat

55
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,760
models we

56
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,480
have seen that many times they are not

57
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,200
exactly

58
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,040
very happy

59
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,920
to be asked to do diagrams in some cases

60
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,440
hey they have been

61
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,080
what can even be called referentary to

62
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:26,879
the uh

63
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:30,239
idea of sitting down and doing a

64
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,120
a model we are going to talk a bit about

65
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,879
the many ways that you can

66
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:37,440
model a system uh we are going to

67
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,040
discuss briefly the role of actually

68
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,120
diagramming creating diagrams

69
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,760
in system modeling and then we are going

70
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,360
to ask ourselves what can we do

71
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,319
differently

72
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,879
what can mitigate those small problems

73
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:49,680
that we have

74
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,800
with the developer community in uh doing

75
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,720
the uh the models for their threat

76
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,680
models

77
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,280
and then we're going to show what we

78
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,680
think is a very developer friendly

79
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,239
uh distributed way to actually create a

80
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:02,959
model

81
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,879
and take things a bit further

82
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,640
so the big question here is why is this

83
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,280
important

84
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,080
why do we even need to model our systems

85
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,440
developers know what they're writing

86
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,560
right they know what they're building

87
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,680
yeah sure they do so

88
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,799
basically a threat model is a function

89
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:26,799
of whatever representation of the system

90
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:28,319
we put together

91
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,080
and then the second part which is the

92
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,760
threat elicitation

93
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,319
now we as security experts we're very

94
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:35,920
good at second part we're very good at

95
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:36,720
the threat

96
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,120
dissertation we know how to figure out

97
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,519
what could possibly go wrong

98
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,680
where we and the developers many times

99
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,319
are a bit not so good is

100
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:49,440
on the system representation which

101
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,159
you could say is the set of all the

102
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:52,799
elements

103
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,799
in the system plus the way that they

104
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:56,959
interact with each other

105
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,040
plus the attributes that they have and

106
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,000
we're going to talk a bit

107
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,680
a bit more about what these attributes

108
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,280
are later in the

109
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,280
talk now

110
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,959
who is this person that can create

111
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:10,799
models uh

112
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,599
how can we create a representation that

113
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:14,480
is

114
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,478
more clear and more representative than

115
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:18,560
the sum of their parts

116
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,639
how can we codify the way that they talk

117
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,560
to each other in a way that somebody can

118
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,840
look at it and be able to infer security

119
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,639
value

120
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,240
from what's represented in there so

121
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,960
developers engineers they they many

122
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:33,680
times they see

123
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,479
very different angles from an architect

124
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,639
or from people from qa

125
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,040
or anybody else that works with that

126
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,160
system

127
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,040
so when you give developers the task the

128
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,880
engineers the the task to

129
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,160
uh to represent that that model many

130
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,840
times would come out of it is what we

131
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,160
call

132
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,040
eureka moments you have the the room and

133
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,560
everybody's discussing the model and the

134
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,479
big architect is saying hey

135
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:00,320
the way that we do this is part a talks

136
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,240
to part b and then they

137
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,280
both get whatever was uh was uh

138
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,720
processed in there and they dumped it

139
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,800
into part c and then you have to join

140
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,479
your developer there in the end of the

141
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:11,199
room

142
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,320
slowly raises their hand and says hey

143
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,120
you know what

144
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,720
yeah that's the way that it was designed

145
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,320
but unfortunately because of the

146
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,720
constraints of the framework that we use

147
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,479
because of the language because of the

148
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,720
deployment we have to slightly

149
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,800
change things and now you have this part

150
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,759
d between

151
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,039
b and c that actually translates things

152
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,880
and that's when people start noticing

153
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,240
that the system

154
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,600
actually as it exists is not exactly

155
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,880
what they had in their minds

156
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,360
now many times you have to get into that

157
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,720
um

158
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,680
explain lycom5 thing meaning

159
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,000
you know if you can't model your system

160
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,080
then let's be very honest

161
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,680
you you have bigger problems than threat

162
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,520
modeling if you can't

163
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,240
construct a representation of whatever

164
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,080
it is that you are building in your mind

165
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,720
and be able to translate it into a way

166
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,440
that you can explain to somebody else

167
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,800
which is basically creating a model

168
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,720
you have bigger problems and it's time

169
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,319
to step back from threat modeling

170
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:18,479
and reconsider the whole enterprise

171
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:21,199
and yeah to tell you the truth uh it's

172
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:21,520
good

173
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,759
documentation it's useful later on not

174
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,280
only for threat modeling but for other

175
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,720
things as well

176
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,759
so it's an after effect but actually it

177
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:30,800
proves to be a very

178
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,840
uh uh valuable one

179
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,440
now why is it that developers

180
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,440
come and say that they don't like to try

181
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,960
to model their systems

182
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,240
sometimes they say it sometimes they

183
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,880
actually do but mostly they just say it

184
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,840
so first of all many times they they

185
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,360
don't even know that they already know

186
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,000
how to do it

187
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,520
i mean how many times completely

188
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,919
detached from threat modeling have you

189
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:58,960
seen a team

190
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,759
get together in a room and start

191
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:02,960
discussing what is it that they're

192
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,960
building and somebody immediately jumps

193
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,520
up

194
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,759
and starts drawing circles and arrows on

195
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:08,720
the whiteboard

196
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,560
and then somebody gets another caller

197
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,880
and starts erasing the first arrows and

198
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,240
putting arrows to different

199
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,240
blobs and whatnot they don't know that

200
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,840
they already know how to do it but when

201
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,599
you put it in the framework of hey this

202
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:21,759
is part of start modeling

203
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:24,479
we'll see later things can get a bit

204
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,960
scary people become a bit reluctant of

205
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,720
what's going to happen

206
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,400
again it is considered the documentation

207
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,479
of effort and sometimes developers say

208
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:33,280
you know what

209
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,880
it was hard to write it should be hard

210
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,199
to read so we're not going to

211
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,479
document it more than it should

212
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,560
then we have the phenomenon of passing

213
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,879
the ball passing the ball hallway you

214
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,560
know what the guy that actually knows

215
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,319
the system enough to create a model of

216
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:48,800
it

217
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,560
it just happens to not be around this

218
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,160
week so yeah

219
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,360
no or hey you're the security guy can't

220
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,800
you do it yourself

221
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,599
they forget that as security people we

222
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:00,960
are probably never going to understand

223
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,319
the system as well as the people who

224
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:03,759
actually wrote it

225
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:05,520
they also seem to forget is our sorry

226
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,280
interrupt that

227
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,759
you know this is not something that a

228
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:10,639
security person

229
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,520
should be doing on in a vacuum right

230
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,479
this is

231
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:17,759
a team sport by design i'll use that

232
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:18,720
phrase

233
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,199
uh and and you know so passing the ball

234
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,280
here they want to

235
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,199
keep themselves out of loop because it's

236
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,520
hard or it's work

237
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,080
and not necessarily and and try to get

238
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,919
others to do their work for them but

239
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,320
it's more than that right so you know

240
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,679
keep in mind that

241
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,039
this is a collaborative effort and

242
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,719
should be a collaborative effort

243
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,440
yeah and then we have you know that that

244
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,440
part that is really really really not

245
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,880
nice to reach but unfortunately

246
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,560
sometimes happens which is winding it

247
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,600
away

248
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,519
oh you're going to drop our velocity

249
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,040
because you're stopping us from actually

250
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,240
writing lines of code

251
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,399
to draw a model oh it's not going to

252
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,160
work it's not going to add anything to

253
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,360
the effort

254
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,160
so there is that little myopia is not

255
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,240
not being able to see that

256
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,760
small effort in the beginning actually

257
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,560
is going to to bear fruit later on

258
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,760
and bring advantages to the

259
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,600
understanding of the whole system

260
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,519
people actually get out of a modeling

261
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:12,959
exercise i'm not even

262
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,959
reaching the threat part of it of a

263
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:16,480
modeling exercise

264
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,959
the team itself as matt said it's a team

265
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:19,680
sport

266
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,720
take them out with a better

267
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,160
understanding of what is it that they

268
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,279
are building

269
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,480
so however it is that at the end of the

270
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,080
day we express that

271
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,440
that model people will get a benefit

272
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,120
from understanding better what is it

273
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,000
that they are doing together

274
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,480
at the end of the day one of the big

275
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,200
things

276
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,360
that stops people from that modeling

277
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,040
effort is the fact that

278
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,800
there isn't an agreed way of doing that

279
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,560
that model there isn't an agreed

280
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,000
language you don't go

281
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,440
forward and you say hey guys we're going

282
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,760
to use blah blah blah and we're going to

283
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,600
have this amazing model that everybody

284
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,720
understands because

285
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,640
everybody speaks blah blah blah and all

286
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,240
of a sudden i feel like i'm in a disney

287
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:04,640
movie

288
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,839
anyways yeah yeah

289
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:10,240
so so speaking of agreed upon language

290
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,120
even if we

291
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,519
agree on a language uh or somebody

292
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,040
agrees on a language there

293
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,600
it's not necessarily understandable to

294
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,160
everybody

295
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,320
right so so why do we why do we rely on

296
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,720
diagrams in particular for for modeling

297
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,360
right so

298
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,480
when we do a model we're we're building

299
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,519
this representation

300
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,519
right and we want to understand what the

301
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,240
system looks like but we don't need

302
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,320
all the details right and so

303
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,920
we so that we need to model but

304
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,839
we rely on diagrams because well

305
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:47,519
you're different different people in

306
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,120
your organization will have

307
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,720
different understandings of things but

308
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,560
also potentially be i mean literally

309
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,320
speaking different languages

310
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,480
or won't completely understand the

311
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,440
terminology

312
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,720
or the context of things and so we

313
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,120
as engineers especially and architects

314
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,880
uh systems designers

315
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,760
uh and security people you know qa any

316
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,240
type of role that you're doing

317
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,519
you tend to be very visual right and so

318
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:15,680
you could describe a system and in fact

319
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,040
we're we're big fans of

320
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,800
of describing a system verbally

321
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,560
but you can loot that can there's a lot

322
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,480
that can be lost in translation

323
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,680
uh and so we really want to

324
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,680
look at you know or or as as

325
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,839
professionals as experts and not only

326
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:35,440
and as developers we turn to models to

327
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,279
diagrams in particular

328
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,200
to give us a better understanding about

329
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,600
a system with uh with as minimal

330
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,800
translation as possible

331
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,720
so if we look at the language uh on the

332
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,000
left right

333
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,160
that actually describes this model but

334
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,120
obviously

335
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,360
it's a lot easier to read that in that

336
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,800
model than it is to

337
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,000
to read that text right uh and so

338
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,399
in a nutshell in a in a few symbols on a

339
00:11:58,399 --> 00:11:59,200
page

340
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,480
you can quickly understand what the

341
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,040
system is doing uh whereas

342
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,880
you know you'd have to go out to google

343
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,959
translate or something and and

344
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,560
and hopefully you get back the right

345
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,320
information right and so

346
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,680
it's not perfect but that's okay

347
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,200
right we ex you're able to uh express

348
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,760
to your your your team especially and

349
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,800
and actually that's

350
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,160
that's really important we probably

351
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,160
should touch upon that for a sec

352
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,120
uh that models need to be valuable and

353
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,160
meaningful to the

354
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,920
to the people or the or the

355
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,120
organizations that are going to be

356
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,800
consuming the model and not really

357
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,680
anybody else

358
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,880
right uh and so if you're a developer

359
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:41,200
a designer a qa a security lead

360
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,600
you know the model has to has to make

361
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,120
sense because obviously we're going to

362
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,399
take it to the next level and do that

363
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,399
threat elicitation

364
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:50,000
so it has to have enough information

365
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,600
encoded in it

366
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,079
but but beyond that that's really all

367
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:55,360
you need right and

368
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,040
here we have a model that has a

369
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,720
small number of number of elements in

370
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,880
them with some basic interactions

371
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,680
and some some attributes that we can

372
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,079
then

373
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:08,959
leverage and that gets a point across

374
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:10,720
and that's the important part here

375
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,440
and i apologize to the scott scottish

376
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,320
people for

377
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,480
for butchering this i'm sure using uh

378
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,040
using automatic translation software

379
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,639
but actually matt there is one more

380
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,079
important thing here that

381
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,959
the mention of gaelic just reminded me

382
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,200
we work in distributed teams

383
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,519
and many times we have people from many

384
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,279
countries working together

385
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:34,959
and english is the lingua franca of

386
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:38,000
development but not everybody speaks

387
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,920
english at the same level or with the

388
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:40,639
same

389
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:44,240
fluency and i

390
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,279
i've seen in the past that somebody

391
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:48,800
who's in that

392
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,040
role where they can't they don't really

393
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,480
speak clear english

394
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,399
they were able to point at the diagram

395
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,000
and say it's not like this

396
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,720
so you you break down barriers of

397
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,519
language

398
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:04,480
and sometimes even of culture by giving

399
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,800
people another different way of

400
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,120
looking at that system and agreeing that

401
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,639
that's actually what we are building

402
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,639
right that's a really that's really good

403
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,720
pointers are

404
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,720
um and so there are really a lot of ways

405
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,600
you could express

406
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,240
a system model uh we've touched upon a

407
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,519
couple of them already but

408
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:27,360
but just to just sort of flesh out the

409
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,880
list here

410
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,920
in the in the creative process a lot of

411
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,880
people talk about

412
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,320
you know drawing a little you know

413
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,920
something on a back of a paper napkin

414
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,920
and that's the big vision that they have

415
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,839
and by the way that's perfectly

416
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,760
reasonable right you can pre you can

417
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,839
you can reasonably construct a model of

418
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,720
a system a representation of a system

419
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,959
on a piece of paper or on the back of a

420
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:52,880
napkin just as a doodle

421
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,079
right or in you know paint or whatever

422
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:56,480
like

423
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,279
whatever you want and then but there's

424
00:14:59,279 --> 00:14:59,680
more

425
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,680
structured ways of of doing doing

426
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,440
diagramming uh as a

427
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,839
as a team an organization gets more

428
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:06,880
mature and

429
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,920
and capable right uh so back in napkin

430
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:10,399
drawing

431
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:13,120
perfectly reasonable i don't think i've

432
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,160
seen it too often

433
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,000
myself i don't always are if you've ever

434
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,160
ever seen this in a business since but

435
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,360
i'm sure i'm sure it happens

436
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:24,000
it can get kind of confusing you have to

437
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,480
put multiple pieces of napkin together

438
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,720
uh so not recommended for big systems

439
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,240
but certainly it could be done

440
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,000
uh but it's a concept actually more so

441
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,600
than anything else right so as opposed

442
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,160
to

443
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,480
a structured thing where it's you know a

444
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,680
big event and

445
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,199
and you know that documentation

446
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:44,000
on a quick meeting in somebody's office

447
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,199
right where you grab that little side

448
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:47,440
whiteboard on your on your cube or

449
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,959
uh you grab a piece of paper off the

450
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:50,639
printer and just start drawing drawing

451
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:51,440
something on that

452
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,839
to express an idea again that graphical

453
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:55,279
nature comes through

454
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:58,720
and you can use that to express some

455
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,639
basic information which you can then use

456
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,000
to do some of that basic threat

457
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,120
elicitation that we've

458
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,480
we're again we're not going to talk

459
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,560
about today but that's the next step in

460
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,320
the process

461
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,079
now as you move up the sort of the

462
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:13,440
maturity and the

463
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,839
structured scale right you'll have some

464
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,519
block diagrams

465
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,759
now we talked earlier about how

466
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:21,120
developers

467
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,720
uh you know sometimes have a hard time

468
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,880
doing modeling because they think it's

469
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,639
it's hard or it's different or it's not

470
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:29,440
their job

471
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,839
but in fact they already do as is our as

472
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:32,959
mentioned because

473
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:35,360
they build block diagrams right of an

474
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,560
architecture

475
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,160
right when you if you have a software

476
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,759
stack or you have a system stack in

477
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:40,480
general

478
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,839
you know you may have a block diagram

479
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:43,759
that shows the different building blocks

480
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:44,800
and how they sort of

481
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,360
sit on each other or next to each other

482
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,560
or how they potentially have

483
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,759
interactions

484
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,240
and so you know somebody should be able

485
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,759
to use that

486
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,759
to start at least start the conversation

487
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:57,040
around around

488
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,920
a a system an understanding of a system

489
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,720
that you can use to do threat modeling

490
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,079
but it also could be used directly right

491
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:09,520
um now traditional threat modeling uses

492
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,760
something called data flow diagrams

493
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,319
or i should say the most more common

494
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,119
methods of

495
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,720
doing threat modeling use data flow

496
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,799
diagrams where we basically describe

497
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:20,319
the elements of a system and their

498
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,720
interactions but specifically how data

499
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,599
flows through a system it ignores

500
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,679
architectural information to a grand

501
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:28,480
extent

502
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,960
but really does highlight how data flows

503
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,080
throughout the system

504
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,760
and it's usually along data flows where

505
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,840
you get security concerns

506
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,120
right but again

507
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,440
and so far we've talked about three ways

508
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,520
of doing modeling they all express

509
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,160
similar things they provide information

510
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,440
in a graphical form

511
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,600
usually in a graphical form to to the

512
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,360
attendees or the stakeholders

513
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,440
and they're all valid for purposes of

514
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,600
doing a system model

515
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,280
moving up the scale might look at

516
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,440
something like a sequence diagram

517
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,240
uh where now instead of looking at an

518
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,640
object in the interaction how data flows

519
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,080
we may look at those objects

520
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,160
interactions in terms of order

521
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,480
and time dependence right so not only

522
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,360
does something

523
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,160
does a talk to b but does a talk to b

524
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:14,720
and then b

525
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,280
talks to c and and what order do those

526
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,320
messages occur

527
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,200
because that can be very important uh

528
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,200
other diagrams as we move up the scale

529
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,440
process diagrams is a good one so how to

530
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,400
not only to have

531
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,720
how to system objects talk to each other

532
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,400
but how do

533
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,960
uh how do maybe systems and processes

534
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,480
work right so this happens a lot in

535
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,240
process engineering especially for

536
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,679
like chemical plants and things like

537
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,320
that but you could use it for

538
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,120
really for any type of system analysis

539
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,960
um

540
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,880
and i just realized we left something

541
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,320
off this slide um

542
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,720
which is attack trees right so we have

543
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,720
this notion of of attack trees that are

544
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,799
another form of model

545
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:56,960
it's another another graphical system

546
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,400
but it really connects a

547
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,000
cut it's sort of a cause and effect

548
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,600
diagram right and so

549
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,440
we look at what does an attacker what's

550
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,440
an attacker's goal

551
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,760
and how are they going to meet get to

552
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,799
that goal by

553
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:10,400
what are the things necessary in order

554
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,160
to meet that and build you build up this

555
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,120
hierarchy

556
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,360
and it's an attack tree it's effectively

557
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,240
a sequence

558
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,880
of attack of attack and defense

559
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,160
mechanisms

560
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,080
um when it's fully constructed and it

561
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,240
expresses information in a different way

562
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,320
but still useful for that that threat

563
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,678
analysis side of things

564
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,520
the last three on this are a little bit

565
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,520
different so dfd3

566
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:38,000
is dfd version 3 being championed by uh

567
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,280
adam shostak uh who is uh as anybody who

568
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,720
does security for a living probably

569
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,120
knows

570
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:47,280
knows of him uh and uh

571
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,720
and especially threat mulling well

572
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,559
specifically threat modeling

573
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:54,080
uh and that uh you know dfd3

574
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:57,200
is is a more simplified version of the

575
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,559
traditional data flow

576
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,720
uh diagram so data flow diagrams have

577
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,120
these free esoteric shapes

578
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,159
that are hard to draw in certain drawing

579
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:07,280
packages

580
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,880
easy to draw on a whiteboard but hard to

581
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,400
really draw electronically

582
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,640
dfg3 makes it easy because it uses basic

583
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,840
flowchart shapes

584
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,520
in order to do this so it becomes a

585
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:19,120
little bit more accessible

586
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,679
you can also describe systems in a

587
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,520
descriptive language

588
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,240
such as aadl which is an architecture

589
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,760
description language which

590
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,320
you can use to talk about a system and

591
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,360
its components and its interactions

592
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,520
and then lastly we can also build the

593
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,400
model in

594
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,679
code now here's where it gets

595
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:40,880
interesting and we're going to talk

596
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,600
about this

597
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,039
you know sort of towards the back end of

598
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:44,880
the presentation uh

599
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,000
where instead of building a model by

600
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,919
drawing so we're going to break out of

601
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:51,440
this we're going to do a diagram right

602
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,320
away

603
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,320
we're going to describe the system in

604
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,760
code and let the code build us a model

605
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,720
and this is a great way for for people

606
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,880
who don't like the draw

607
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,200
or who are not very artistic or just

608
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,559
don't want to

609
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:08,960
i don't spend the time or whatever it

610
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,480
breaks down those barriers because now

611
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,200
they can talk

612
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,360
in the language they in a language they

613
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,400
speak

614
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,600
which is code and have the code

615
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:21,120
generate the model for us so effectively

616
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:21,600
you get

617
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,840
the diagram as an after effect of the

618
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,120
discussion around

619
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,200
the architecture of the system yes how

620
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,799
many how many times how many side

621
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:30,480
effects do we get in this uh

622
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,880
in this conversation as many as you can

623
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,760
like

624
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,750
i don't know a headache but

625
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,480
[Laughter]

626
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,679
it's important to to say too that before

627
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:43,840
we said hey there's no standard language

628
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,360
of doing this thing

629
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,880
but the fd dfd3

630
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:53,280
appears to be making strides

631
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:57,200
into in that direction

632
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,840
and uh eventually we actually would be

633
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,360
glad to see it being used

634
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,240
more uh extensively okay it's very

635
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:04,720
simple

636
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,559
and yet it manages to be very uh uh

637
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:11,200
expressed and and and i i guess i'll

638
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,000
just add to that

639
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,159
uh one additional thing so in our

640
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:16,000
travels of course we've

641
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,120
uh uh looked you know at various

642
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,720
uh modeling techniques obviously we have

643
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,559
we have a few up here and and there's

644
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:23,840
certainly more i'm sure that we've

645
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,799
missed uh and

646
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:28,960
these are by and large extensible

647
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,080
because

648
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,080
you're going to potentially find things

649
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,919
that work for you right

650
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:36,799
so as an example i i have a personal

651
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:37,760
extension to

652
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,880
to dfds where

653
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,120
dfd is because you lose architectural

654
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,960
information

655
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,320
it's useful to know which end point in

656
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,000
the in an interaction

657
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,919
initiates a communication so i've added

658
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:53,360
a little tick mark

659
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,159
to that to that data flow and in dfd3

660
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:57,360
it's easy because you just take an arrow

661
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,640
and you make it really short and you

662
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,159
attach it to one end of a

663
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:02,080
of a data flow and and the coming out

664
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,360
bound from from the

665
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,720
endpoint that actually initiates the

666
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,799
communication and it adds a lot of value

667
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:07,679
for

668
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:10,960
for me and for the teams i work with

669
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,240
um because they get to see that that ext

670
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,000
you know they see that representation

671
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,360
say oh

672
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,919
that you know a is talking to b not the

673
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:20,880
other way around

674
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,400
and and you don't always get that

675
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,080
information from the data flow alone

676
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,080
now i should also mention that data

677
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,760
flows in particular

678
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,640
require other information so the the

679
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,919
diagram itself

680
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:34,559
has information in it but in order to

681
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:36,000
make this really work

682
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,919
you also have to have well you know

683
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:39,200
annotations

684
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,679
descriptions about the objects um and

685
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:42,480
those and those

686
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:46,080
those attributes and whatnot um sort of

687
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,840
on the side right you have to have that

688
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,440
available in order to really interpret

689
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,640
the the model

690
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,360
it's not to say it's bad it's just it's

691
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,720
two pieces of information that have to

692
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,919
go together

693
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:58,799
yeah and actually uh matt just reminded

694
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:00,080
me and this is probably going to be a

695
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,320
good segue for the next slides

696
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,640
uh looking here at my poster of the

697
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,559
threat modeling manifesto

698
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:08,480
one of the anti-patterns that gets

699
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,320
called in there is the

700
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:13,520
perfect representation one specifying

701
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,480
that there is no

702
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,080
perfect representation

703
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:21,360
go ahead sometimes different views of uh

704
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,799
system different representations

705
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:24,960
different models of the same system

706
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,799
are going to reveal different uh kinds

707
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,760
of information that are

708
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,240
valuable in doing the threat elicitation

709
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,360
you were going to say man

710
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,520
i was going to say interesting you you

711
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,480
called that out

712
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,520
if we go to the next slide so as

713
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,760
ours as azar was saying uh an

714
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,559
anti-pattern

715
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:47,120
is perfect representation meaning it's

716
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,000
there is no perfect way to represent

717
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,279
represent a system

718
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:54,960
from a model right models by design

719
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,240
are going to be flawed but

720
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,919
they can bring out and there's useful

721
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:01,200
information you can still get out of

722
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,480
these things as long as you don't try to

723
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,679
be perfect

724
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:05,279
and here's a good here are some good

725
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:07,120
examples right so this in the next few

726
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,559
slides you'll see

727
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:10,880
all describe the same system they all

728
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,799
describe them in different ways

729
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:15,760
yet they're all valuable from the

730
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,720
modeling and

731
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,520
the elicitation standpoint so here we

732
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,320
have

733
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,919
a system right and this is the dfd model

734
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:26,000
right so this is a data flow diagram

735
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,919
describing a system where a user talks

736
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:28,320
to

737
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:32,080
a server a server a talks to server b

738
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,279
server b talks to a data store and it

739
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:37,520
does this over https jdbc

740
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,960
and then local file access and right off

741
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,080
the bat you probably are

742
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,600
noticing a few things that would be

743
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,120
valuable if you're going to be looking

744
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,000
for threats

745
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,760
because we've encoded enough information

746
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,039
into the model

747
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:50,960
that it's easy to get that point across

748
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,720
with really nothing else

749
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,559
right no no other information there is

750
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:56,080
other information available for this

751
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,440
model but you don't really need it

752
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,360
because you know that you have

753
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,600
two processes a data store and a user

754
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,039
and some communication in

755
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:05,520
channels and that's great if we go to

756
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,039
the next slide

757
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:09,760
you'll see we have the exact same model

758
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,200
exact same system sorry

759
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,520
now using a different representation

760
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,799
right so now we have

761
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:17,760
dfd3 version of this there's again a

762
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,600
need to have annotations so it describes

763
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,240
what a b

764
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,279
and c are but you still know and we

765
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:24,400
should have actually probably should

766
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,640
have started with this one as opposed to

767
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,279
the previous slide because you have a

768
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:30,720
and b that talk to each other and they

769
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,400
talk to c which is a data store and you

770
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,480
have a user that talks to a

771
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,640
right and we know that there's this

772
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,679
relationship and

773
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,039
just from looking at the model you can

774
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:41,120
make certain judgment calls about

775
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,360
what the system is what it does and how

776
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,559
it operates

777
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:46,640
and that's the important part about

778
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,000
about having a model a good

779
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,600
representation

780
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,200
and you also have the trust boundaries

781
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,760
in here so it stores that a

782
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,760
lives in a separate level of trust than

783
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,120
b and c

784
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,640
which we also saw in the previous one

785
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,520
but represented in a different way yep

786
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,799
absolutely

787
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:06,559
yeah and so you can make you can

788
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:08,480
eventually you'll make judgment calls

789
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,080
you'll you'll do that elicitation part

790
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,120
to say uh there's a bad pattern here

791
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,120
right but but right now you can have

792
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,559
this you can have a conversation with

793
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:17,679
your development team

794
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:18,640
as a developer you can have a

795
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,399
conversation with your stakeholders and

796
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:21,919
say this is what we're building

797
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:23,440
does this make sense to you is this

798
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,370
actually what we built

799
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:25,919
[Music]

800
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:28,799
which is the fun part

801
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,919
uh all right and then the next slide is

802
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:32,799
yet again

803
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:34,320
another implementation another

804
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,000
representation of the same system now

805
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,960
this obviously is

806
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,039
is a sequence diagram and we left a lot

807
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:40,159
of the specific

808
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:42,559
you know details of the messages out but

809
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:43,679
really we have

810
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:47,120
again a user a b and c and there's a

811
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,600
flow to that data and there's an order

812
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,200
of operations now that we get

813
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,720
out of this and if you were to take this

814
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,399
and and and match it to

815
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:57,360
the previous slide or two two slides ago

816
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,640
you would then have a really good

817
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,240
understanding of how the system

818
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,559
actually operates uh and how it's

819
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:04,159
designed to work

820
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:06,399
and from that you can then take that

821
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:08,080
model and do things with it

822
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,720
such as finding finding threats and

823
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,159
that's the key part right so

824
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:16,000
we document uh we document a system

825
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,520
and as a side effect well we document

826
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,480
the system

827
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,919
which may be the side effect in the

828
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:24,880
first place but we document the system

829
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,799
and that allows us to then do things

830
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:28,080
with that to get

831
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,080
value and meaning out of it which

832
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,440
includes

833
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,640
threats um but you know this is

834
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,679
this is important right so we we finally

835
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:39,120
have a way of representing a system it

836
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,960
doesn't have to be perfect it just has

837
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,520
to be meaningful

838
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,760
and just for completeness here in the uh

839
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,720
the sequence uh

840
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,000
diagram if uh you all are not familiar

841
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:50,640
with it

842
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,480
you have the component of time edited

843
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,000
that's what makes it a sequence

844
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,120
so time flows from the top to the bottom

845
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:01,120
meaning that that that message between

846
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:04,720
the user the actor and a happens before

847
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,279
the one

848
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:07,919
that goes from a to the user so this way

849
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:09,520
we can also look at different

850
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:12,880
uh ways that the protocol happens

851
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,440
when we can even analyze a full protocol

852
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,240
and look for

853
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,600
issues that would be more difficult

854
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,240
to figure out from representation for

855
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,240
example as a bfd

856
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,760
right so actually sorry go ahead

857
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,240
just finish your thought uh you're going

858
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,000
where where i think uh i wanted to go

859
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,919
well yeah so so before we go into the

860
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:37,600
next slide i was just gonna say we

861
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,320
we we haven't really talked about threat

862
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,159
elicitation really what it means because

863
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:43,120
we don't really want to

864
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,760
focus on that but but we do need to

865
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,200
focus on a little bit then

866
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,039
in that well how do you make thread

867
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:50,480
elicitation how do you make those

868
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,279
decisions

869
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:52,640
and it really comes down to the

870
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,559
information that's encoded and there's a

871
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:57,440
certain set of threats

872
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:01,840
that um that can be identified

873
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,000
that rely on this timing information

874
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,240
right you can only know

875
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,559
if you know this information right and

876
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:09,360
so just

877
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,799
knowing that you have process a and

878
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:12,480
process b and they talk to each other

879
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,880
isn't sufficient to find those things

880
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,240
but knowing you have process a and

881
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:16,880
process b

882
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,559
and they they operate in a certain way

883
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:20,880
and and order of operations

884
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,279
matter now you can start making those

885
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:24,399
judgment calls about whether you

886
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:25,760
actually have a particular class of

887
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:26,960
threat or not

888
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,080
exactly next slide so

889
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,120
here yet again similar

890
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,520
right we have another another diagram

891
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,159
same system

892
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:40,480
modeled in a completely different way

893
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,080
right so this is a network architecture

894
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,600
diagram right so we have a user talking

895
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,960
to a browser a browser

896
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,799
goes over the internet nice cloud that

897
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:48,240
we got there

898
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:51,360
goes to a load balancer hits a front end

899
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,120
and then eventually makes its way to a

900
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,559
back-end server and there's data that

901
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:55,760
passes between them

902
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,320
now keep in mind this load balancer here

903
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:58,880
in the middle

904
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,440
we we didn't have that in those other

905
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,720
diagrams

906
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,320
right and because we weren't looking at

907
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,240
architecture we're only caring about the

908
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,519
data flowed in

909
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:10,399
you know between components and so we

910
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:11,120
don't necessarily

911
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,799
get all of the information from those

912
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:14,480
models again the models are not meant to

913
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:14,960
be

914
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,279
perfect the models are meant to be

915
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:19,039
representative

916
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:22,000
right and so that's why not only can

917
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,399
there be no perfect representation

918
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:27,039
but if you know that there can't be

919
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:27,679
perfect

920
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:29,360
representation then having multiple

921
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,720
representations

922
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,760
gives you better information uh and it

923
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,679
also may be that you have this diagram

924
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:36,880
already because

925
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,399
this is i mean this is how you build

926
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:40,640
market marketing slides out of

927
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,799
or you know how your use cases are just

928
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:44,559
developed or whatever right and

929
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:46,240
and so you may already have this

930
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,600
information

931
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,880
maybe you have a deployment guide and

932
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,120
you have and you have this um

933
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:54,240
as opposed to a dfd which you know you

934
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,120
may not have

935
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,678
naturally

936
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:02,559
so switching gears just a little bit

937
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:06,880
so we've talked a little bit about how

938
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,840
developers may be reticent to build

939
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,440
diagrams to build models

940
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,080
and and do diagramming because it's

941
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:14,799
confusing

942
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:18,000
or not my job i don't have time or a

943
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,360
various number of reasons but

944
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,559
one of those other reasons that

945
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:23,519
developers uh sometimes or and not just

946
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:24,960
developers but but others

947
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,480
uh stakeholders in the process and the

948
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,159
security process may

949
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:30,880
um have a hard time

950
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,000
[Music]

951
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,039
doing the action of building a model

952
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:38,159
especially for security is

953
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:41,279
it can be scary sometimes right uh and

954
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:42,559
we don't want to scare anybody except

955
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:44,960
for on halloween and defcon and

956
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,880
you know don't want to show up on the

957
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,279
wall of sheep and all that sort of stuff

958
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:52,320
so so

959
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:55,519
we want to we want to be careful

960
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:57,600
that we don't scare people for the wrong

961
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,200
reason right

962
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,679
and we can help as security

963
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:02,880
professionals especially so

964
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,159
really this slide is talking to the

965
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:06,159
security professional professionals out

966
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:08,240
there who are who are watching

967
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,640
that we can help sort of smooth over and

968
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,360
help with this activity by

969
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:16,960
not using the big words right

970
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,039
so you know when you're talking about i

971
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:20,720
have process and process b and the user

972
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,039
is

973
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:23,840
you know talking over http and and

974
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,360
they're going to send their

975
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,960
username and password they're basically

976
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:30,159
authenticated right well

977
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,600
you could use that word or you could say

978
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,039
the web server is going to prove the

979
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:37,120
identity of the

980
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:40,320
of the user or even further down

981
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,880
uh you know uh sort of not not dumbing

982
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,080
it down but making it you know more

983
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,519
understandable to the more common

984
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:46,640
stakeholder

985
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,760
um you know the the the server is going

986
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:50,880
to identify

987
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:55,919
the server is going to identify the user

988
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:57,039
right they do that through

989
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:59,279
authentication but that's okay right you

990
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:00,960
don't necessarily need to say

991
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:04,000
that cryptography another big word

992
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,440
right what does that mean right there's

993
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,120
a lot of stuff that fits in that in that

994
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:07,840
bucket

995
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,520
it's confusing it's math some people

996
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,599
don't like math it's math

997
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:15,199
uh and so you know we're going to

998
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:18,480
protect data right by we're going to

999
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,239
obfuscate that data that might be a big

1000
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:22,079
word we're going to change that data

1001
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:22,719
from for

1002
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:24,639
one form to another through some

1003
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:26,879
mathematical process

1004
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:28,159
we don't need to know what that process

1005
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:30,239
is it happens to be cryptography

1006
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:32,399
but you know we can we can sort of

1007
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:33,520
minimize the angst

1008
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:36,639
right and so some of these

1009
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:38,320
of course we can't do that and in fact

1010
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,159
one of these words as called out here

1011
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:40,879
really

1012
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:43,520
always is scary and there's really no

1013
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:44,879
nothing you can do about it

1014
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:48,480
um but uh you know so we can help

1015
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,399
we can help developers and other

1016
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:51,760
stakeholders

1017
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,359
reveal their secrets right what

1018
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:55,040
information we need to get out of this

1019
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,079
exercise and and

1020
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:58,320
when i say we i i sort of mean security

1021
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,000
professional if you're

1022
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,680
if you're moderating one of these

1023
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,680
exercises or you're leading a threat

1024
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,200
modeling exercise

1025
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,920
uh or if you're a stakeholder in an

1026
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,040
exercise with a

1027
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,640
with the development team especially if

1028
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,240
this is you know say this is an agile

1029
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,839
scrum team or

1030
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:16,960
uh or or you're part of a a project

1031
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,680
to to do security analysis you can help

1032
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,079
by facilitating the conversation

1033
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:24,480
by doing some basic translation right

1034
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,880
make this accessible to stakeholders

1035
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,040
right so that they can be more involved

1036
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,720
in the process and then from that you

1037
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,160
get better information that can give you

1038
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,920
a better representation

1039
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:37,119
and therefore a better model is or do

1040
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:38,800
you have any thoughts you want to add on

1041
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,160
that

1042
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:44,320
no i think products are scary

1043
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,839
no the the only thing that i would add

1044
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:47,440
here probably is that uh

1045
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:50,240
eventually when you talk about risk

1046
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,599
developers

1047
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:56,000
then many times the uh

1048
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,720
the conversation goes towards but why

1049
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:01,200
would someone do that

1050
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,480
and i find that in those cases it's very

1051
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,040
helpful

1052
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:08,880
to translate risk to

1053
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,560
this is gonna happen and it's bad right

1054
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,160
we can all agree that it's bad

1055
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,680
that that's not something that should be

1056
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:16,400
happening right and that takes away

1057
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,800
the why would somebody do that and

1058
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,560
translates it into something bad

1059
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,160
happening to the system

1060
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,320
which usually is something that

1061
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,160
developers care more about

1062
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,079
than whomever is coming in and doing bad

1063
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:29,920
things

1064
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,480
yeah yeah and this um actually this uh

1065
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,000
the notion of translation

1066
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,160
um you know i've seen this myself with

1067
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,040
uh working with

1068
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,119
with engineers who are you know

1069
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:41,040
brilliant people understand

1070
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,320
their systems that they're working

1071
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,160
inside and out but don't understand the

1072
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,280
security terms right

1073
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:48,320
and so there's a sense of you know

1074
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:51,599
potential of failure right which is very

1075
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:54,000
a bad place for a lot of people to be

1076
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,280
and we don't want to

1077
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,200
we don't want them to fail it's hard to

1078
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,800
actually fail in this right but we don't

1079
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,079
want them to fail or think they're going

1080
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:00,800
to fail

1081
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,760
because this stuff is confusing or new

1082
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,599
or it's special

1083
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:08,079
and and so that's really that's really

1084
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:09,839
key right and and again

1085
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:13,280
this just comes down to giving a

1086
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:16,079
helping them understand the concept and

1087
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:17,920
the principles involved

1088
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,640
uh and and maybe glossing over the

1089
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,320
specific terminology unless it's

1090
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,520
important or

1091
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,040
eventually you get to okay that means

1092
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,560
it's authenticated we put that label in

1093
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,760
there and that means a whole bunch of

1094
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,640
things

1095
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:29,839
and we get that one word as a

1096
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:32,240
placeholder as opposed to

1097
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,520
starting with that and having people

1098
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,920
wonder okay what do you mean by that and

1099
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,599
then you have confusion

1100
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:40,240
and actually madame i'm going to hijack

1101
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,520
for a minute

1102
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,200
the conversation because i think that we

1103
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,640
forgot to talk about something very

1104
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:45,839
important

1105
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:47,520
now that we're talking about things that

1106
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,880
are scary uh

1107
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,440
it occurred to me we haven't talked

1108
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,119
about

1109
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:55,040
basically the the stopping problem of

1110
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,640
threat modeling and

1111
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:59,040
there are two parts to it the first one

1112
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,160
is during the modeling

1113
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,839
how do we know that we have modeled the

1114
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:03,520
system enough

1115
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:06,800
and that is

1116
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,760
once you got to a point and this is my

1117
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,320
personal

1118
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,320
personal experience and it works for me

1119
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,000
and others will have

1120
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,839
other views on the issue but i think

1121
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:17,520
that once you get to a presentation that

1122
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,000
lets you

1123
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,960
actually make all those assumptions and

1124
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,760
inferences that matt was relating to

1125
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,200
i think that that's the good enough and

1126
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,560
we're going to address the good enough

1127
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,440
soon

1128
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,599
but the other one is when do i know that

1129
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:32,320
i have listed enough threats

1130
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,800
and that's another thing that makes

1131
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,240
things like this scary

1132
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,680
you wake up in the morning in three in

1133
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,920
the morning asking yourself just forget

1134
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,920
something and you know what you probably

1135
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,160
did yes

1136
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,640
because this whole thing first of all we

1137
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:47,520
have to keep in mind

1138
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,599
it's evolutionary the fact that you

1139
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:51,200
didn't have a threat model yesterday

1140
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,359
is bad you have one today that's much

1141
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:55,040
better and the one that you're going to

1142
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,240
have tomorrow it's going to be much

1143
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:56,960
better because

1144
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:00,320
you're going to have learned more so

1145
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:03,599
don't let that stopping problem stop you

1146
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:05,440
from threat modeling

1147
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,920
okay the important thing is to start do

1148
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:08,480
it

1149
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:11,040
and then move forward with the process

1150
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,839
that was my parenthesis sorry for the

1151
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:15,280
hijacking that works

1152
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,760
so how else do we get developers to

1153
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,240
reveal their secrets

1154
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:23,280
uh so the way that i like to work with

1155
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,000
teams

1156
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,240
uh that i found very useful is as

1157
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,119
somebody who's

1158
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:31,200
both facilitating a conversation or

1159
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,560
being asked to be the

1160
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,640
the sme the subject matter expert on

1161
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:37,599
security for the project

1162
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:40,079
it's very useful if we start with you

1163
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:40,640
know

1164
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,960
what is it that we do here right not

1165
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,000
necessarily what do

1166
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,560
you as the engineer do on the project

1167
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,000
but what does the system that you're

1168
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,040
building do

1169
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,880
right what is it what is it meant to do

1170
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,800
how is it meant to operate

1171
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,920
not necessarily from a security

1172
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,560
standpoint let's start basic right

1173
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,720
get the conversation started with what

1174
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,000
is this thing

1175
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,720
and how does it work and what does it do

1176
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,240
and what does it operate on right

1177
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,480
and basically this has a this has a

1178
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,000
systems engineering term right

1179
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,160
concept of operations if you build out

1180
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:13,280
the concept of operations of the conops

1181
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,280
you get you get first off you get a lot

1182
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,400
of information

1183
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,480
but also you start to establish that

1184
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,240
rapport part of

1185
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,000
facilitating a threat modeling exercise

1186
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,240
and part of even just having

1187
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,920
a team come together and do the

1188
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,760
collaboration is really

1189
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:30,240
an exchange of ideas because it's not

1190
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:33,280
one person talking to another

1191
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,760
it is in part in practice but really

1192
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,680
it's a team getting together

1193
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,839
and discussing what they've been

1194
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:41,839
building and how it

1195
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:44,480
was designed versus implemented uh and

1196
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,599
then from that

1197
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:47,680
what could somebody do to break it

1198
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:48,720
horribly

1199
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:51,280
uh and so with the concept of a concept

1200
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,720
of operations

1201
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,800
uh you get some basic information about

1202
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,800
okay we have this thing it has a web

1203
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,000
server and a text

1204
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,599
and a user bring you know use their

1205
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:01,280
browser from their home and they're on

1206
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,560
this network and then

1207
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,560
our web server talks to database and

1208
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,720
passes information

1209
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,400
and in that you can start doing things

1210
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,480
like building a model

1211
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,640
right you get information that allows

1212
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,319
you to say i have object a and object b

1213
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:15,599
and they have communications and there's

1214
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:17,440
a data store and there's a user

1215
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,720
that has a browser and now we have a

1216
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:21,280
network flow and you get that from

1217
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,359
just having the concept of operations

1218
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:24,800
don't have anything else right but at

1219
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,240
least you have that conversation and you

1220
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,599
can ask questions

1221
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:28,800
right and then you can now you can

1222
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,040
launch into okay what else

1223
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:33,359
right which brings us to the next point

1224
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:34,720
keep on the eye keep your eye on the

1225
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,160
prize what are we actually trying to get

1226
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,680
out of this exercise we're trying to get

1227
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,839
elements interactions and attributes

1228
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:41,359
we're looking for the what

1229
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:44,079
the when and the how right so the what

1230
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:45,920
and the how really is the

1231
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,480
what do we have what exists how do these

1232
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,119
objects

1233
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:51,920
you know interact how do they store data

1234
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:52,800
how do they

1235
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,160
how do they communicate with other

1236
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:56,160
things and then sort of

1237
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,319
the when if especially if we're looking

1238
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:00,079
at sequence data especially

1239
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:02,560
um you know so how order of operations

1240
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,720
but you could also find out things like

1241
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:06,560
okay are there times in this in the

1242
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,480
systems life cycle

1243
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,800
when we maybe don't have the database

1244
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:11,520
protected

1245
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,920
right or maybe the network is wide open

1246
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,119
during setup or

1247
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:17,040
oh that key that you wanted to protect

1248
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,960
yeah it's it's it's in the clear until

1249
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,079
we encrypt it

1250
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:22,960
at some point later right and so we

1251
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:26,160
really get the what the how and the when

1252
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,240
based on what the system is and then we

1253
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,000
can start asking the questions okay oh

1254
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,520
so you have this database okay how do

1255
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,440
you talk to the database oh okay

1256
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:37,040
do you use uh do you do you do you prove

1257
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,640
that the server is the server talk into

1258
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:39,440
the database

1259
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,599
aka do you authenticate the data the web

1260
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:42,640
server

1261
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,640
oh yeah we do that with a password that

1262
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:45,680
we store on disk

1263
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,599
oh how do we store that oh it's in the

1264
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:49,280
clear until the first pass and then it

1265
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,960
gets encrypted

1266
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:53,520
okay so now we can we can move on to do

1267
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,440
some thread elicitation from that

1268
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,960
we can build out some attack trees about

1269
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,040
how an attacker might want to

1270
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:01,119
influence the system to steal that key

1271
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:02,079
for instance

1272
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:03,680
and so that's really the the

1273
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,760
conversation starter and into

1274
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:09,119
the exercise and you see that's why you

1275
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:09,599
are

1276
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:12,000
a much better modeler than than i am

1277
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,520
because i just try to have those

1278
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,520
meetings like at lunchtime i bring pizza

1279
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,200
and i say nobody gets pizza until i get

1280
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:19,759
all the secrets

1281
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,480
it probably works better than than how i

1282
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:24,000
approach it but

1283
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,520
i think that you get better results than

1284
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,520
i do i think

1285
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:30,800
well it in and actually it it is funny

1286
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,800
uh you know that you can take different

1287
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,560
approaches

1288
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,079
some people do the good cop bad cop

1289
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:40,560
arrangement um

1290
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,319
it's hard when you're the good cop and

1291
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:44,000
the bad cop at the same time

1292
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,800
um unless you're dr jekyll and mr hyde

1293
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:47,520
uh

1294
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:50,640
and uh you know or or

1295
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,079
you're you know friends with the

1296
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:54,000
developers right meaning you get

1297
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,920
friendly you get be part of the team i

1298
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,119
like to get integrated with the team

1299
00:43:57,119 --> 00:43:57,520
when i

1300
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,839
when i talk to them right and really be

1301
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:01,359
a part of the

1302
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:03,440
part of the group not because i want

1303
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,200
them to like me

1304
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:08,480
but that helps but but because i want

1305
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:08,960
them

1306
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:10,480
to know that i'm there as a trusted

1307
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,480
partner right i'm there

1308
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,640
to facilitate i'm there to provide my

1309
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:15,760
expertise to them

1310
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:17,119
if they don't have it or to provide

1311
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:19,280
another pair of eyes if they do

1312
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:21,760
right and that's important and you

1313
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,359
actually just reminded me of a

1314
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:24,800
conversation that i had with

1315
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:28,240
brooke jones who's another amazing

1316
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:30,560
threat modeling expert and we were

1317
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,960
discussing uh talking to two teams

1318
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:35,440
and especially that barrier between

1319
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:36,560
being the guy

1320
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:39,119
coming to help do the trust model

1321
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:41,200
another guy coming to threat model

1322
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:43,040
the guy coming to help do the threat

1323
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,560
model there's a

1324
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:47,200
big distinction in there and how

1325
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:48,720
sometimes

1326
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,880
even when you're modeling you you hit

1327
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:51,760
that barrier

1328
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,839
where the team feels that you are

1329
00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:56,319
basically criticizing their design

1330
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:58,000
so it's important to let them know that

1331
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,800
no you you're not there to tell them

1332
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:03,280
you wrote this thing badly you're there

1333
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:05,359
to help them make whatever it is that

1334
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:06,880
they built whatever it is that they're

1335
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:07,760
building

1336
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:10,960
more robust more secure okay so when

1337
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,160
you're having this dialogue with the

1338
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:12,480
team

1339
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,079
it's really important for them to

1340
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:16,079
understand that you are on their side

1341
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:17,599
you're not the big bad auditor or

1342
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:19,520
whatever the big security guy

1343
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:20,880
that came to say that's wrong that's

1344
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,560
wrong that's wrong fix that

1345
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,319
you the guy that's working with them to

1346
00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:25,599
make the thing that they are already

1347
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:26,319
doing

1348
00:45:26,319 --> 00:45:30,960
better absolutely yeah definitely

1349
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:35,280
all right so some other

1350
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:38,800
tips here um

1351
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:42,000
first one is when you're

1352
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,079
thinking about a system in order to help

1353
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:45,359
facilitate a model

1354
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:48,319
it's helpful to think about this in

1355
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:50,240
terms of

1356
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:53,680
subject action target attributes now let

1357
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:55,119
me explain that a little bit more

1358
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:57,280
when you build out a model a diagram

1359
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:58,880
especially you're going to put

1360
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:00,240
say you're going to put object a and

1361
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:02,160
object b on the on the diagram

1362
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:03,280
and you're going to connect them with a

1363
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:06,400
line well connect them with a line

1364
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:09,520
establishes a subject and a target and

1365
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:11,520
some action

1366
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:13,280
and there's attributes that go along

1367
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:16,319
with those objects and that interaction

1368
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:19,760
such as right whether it's authenticated

1369
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:20,720
or not for instance

1370
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:23,119
so so let's say we have process a

1371
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:24,560
something a

1372
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:26,240
and something b and they communicate so

1373
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:28,160
a communicates with b

1374
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:31,359
now saying a communicates with b means

1375
00:46:31,359 --> 00:46:34,560
a initiates communication meaning sends

1376
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:35,520
a message

1377
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:39,200
or requests information from b

1378
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,200
we can also say as the other example

1379
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:42,720
here we have a process

1380
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:45,200
that listens on port 8080 and it'll take

1381
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:47,119
a username and password from user

1382
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:50,880
aka i have a process it opens a network

1383
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:52,400
communication port and waits for a

1384
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:55,040
connection on port 80 so i would have a

1385
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:58,240
line coming inbound to

1386
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:00,560
this process and i would have have

1387
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:01,920
attributes that says

1388
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:04,000
it's over port 8080 and it's

1389
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,200
authenticated

1390
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:07,760
now of course it's port 8080 so it's in

1391
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:10,000
the clear

1392
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,040
i was counting minor

1393
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:14,880
minor problem right but that's okay

1394
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:17,119
right and so so really the

1395
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:19,040
language that you use to describe the

1396
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:21,359
system when you're communicating

1397
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:24,000
to to stakeholders where as stakeholders

1398
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,079
are communicating amongst themselves

1399
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:28,640
you can build the model from that

1400
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:30,480
language

1401
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:32,160
because you're basically describing the

1402
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:33,680
system as you're talking right and

1403
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:34,720
that's important

1404
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,000
it's important because you're not doing

1405
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,319
that translation of okay well blah blah

1406
00:47:38,319 --> 00:47:39,680
blah blah blah we have

1407
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:41,920
we have this this object and we have

1408
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,520
this object and it makes a function call

1409
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:45,920
to this api and this api then transmits

1410
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:47,119
tcp data over

1411
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:49,119
over a network block okay great but we

1412
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:50,640
don't actually need all of that to make

1413
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:51,280
the

1414
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:54,240
determination of i have port 8080 http

1415
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:55,680
and i'm passing a username and password

1416
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:57,359
over it

1417
00:47:57,359 --> 00:48:00,400
right and so that's that's important

1418
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:03,200
uh as as the tip here is if you keep in

1419
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:04,960
mind that okay what talks to what and

1420
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:06,000
how does it talk to that

1421
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,720
and then what are the attributes on that

1422
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:10,400
now you get the language that allows you

1423
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:11,599
to build a model

1424
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:15,440
easier lastly

1425
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:18,160
uh or at least you know for for this

1426
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:20,400
slide we want to remind developers

1427
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,160
that they already have a lot of

1428
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:24,000
information we've already talked about

1429
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:24,400
this

1430
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:26,720
uh and we'll just hammer this point home

1431
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:27,839
right that

1432
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:29,520
there's probably already a body of

1433
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:31,040
information available

1434
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:33,680
that you can use to to either jump start

1435
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:36,160
the conversation or to bootstrap

1436
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:39,200
the modeling exercise

1437
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:41,040
uh so that you get you know you can pull

1438
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:42,240
good information out

1439
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:44,319
right you may have drawings block

1440
00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:45,839
diagrams especially architecture

1441
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:46,480
diagrams

1442
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:48,800
etc you may have specifications for the

1443
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,960
system or requirements or use cases

1444
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:52,800
right and you can use that information

1445
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:54,319
to then

1446
00:48:54,319 --> 00:48:55,440
you know do the right thing when it

1447
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:57,760
comes to building out a representation

1448
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:01,040
and then doing thread elicitation

1449
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:04,160
so it's recommended or i will make a

1450
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:05,520
recommendation

1451
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:08,160
to use what you have already use the

1452
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:09,520
body of information that you already

1453
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:10,480
have available

1454
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:12,720
to start the conversation right that way

1455
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:14,880
you certainly if you're a stakeholder if

1456
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:16,400
you're a security expert coming in from

1457
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:17,839
the outside

1458
00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:20,160
you get that connection to the team you

1459
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:22,079
can they can feel like you're

1460
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:23,839
you're invested you've invested time to

1461
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:25,760
look at what they've already been doing

1462
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:28,559
and and there's a trust that can be

1463
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:31,119
established there

1464
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:33,040
and then don't be afraid to give out

1465
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:34,559
homework right

1466
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:36,880
to to stakeholders right if there's a if

1467
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:38,880
there's a problem that you hit

1468
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:40,880
during the modeling exercise like oh we

1469
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:42,720
have this process we're not not sure how

1470
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:44,400
it does what it does like

1471
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,319
we know it talks to these things but we

1472
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:48,559
don't really know how that happens

1473
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:50,880
okay fine break for the break for the

1474
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:52,079
evening and

1475
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:55,760
tell you know hey can you uh joe or jim

1476
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:56,319
and

1477
00:49:56,319 --> 00:49:59,280
go off and research that come back to us

1478
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:00,480
at the next meeting

1479
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:02,400
right it's okay to give out homework

1480
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,319
right the information is there somewhere

1481
00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:05,920
if it's not in diagrams or in

1482
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:08,400
specifications it's potentially in code

1483
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:10,079
right and somebody has to just go figure

1484
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:12,559
it out

1485
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:15,280
uh is our next slide thank you so we

1486
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:16,559
talk a little bit about good enough is

1487
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:18,480
good enough

1488
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:21,839
sounds easy right so let's set

1489
00:50:21,839 --> 00:50:25,520
clear expectations about what we mean by

1490
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:28,400
what do we need versus what we want

1491
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,000
right we can never have it be

1492
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,559
perfect because representations of the

1493
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:34,640
real thing are never going to be exact

1494
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:36,160
because if we have exactly the real

1495
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:37,920
thing then we're not building a

1496
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:39,280
representation we're

1497
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:42,160
building the real thing and so we just

1498
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:43,599
need to decide how much information is

1499
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:45,200
going to be sufficient

1500
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:46,880
and then figure out okay are we there

1501
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:48,319
yet can we stop

1502
00:50:48,319 --> 00:50:51,359
and say it's good enough right so

1503
00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:52,400
because there are no perfect

1504
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:54,160
representations there's different ways

1505
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:54,960
that we can express

1506
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:57,520
data and that data can then allow us to

1507
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:58,079
do

1508
00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:01,359
to make judgment calls about what's what

1509
00:51:01,359 --> 00:51:02,240
what

1510
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:03,440
security concerns there might be

1511
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:04,880
especially or what privacy or other

1512
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:07,040
concerns there might be

1513
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:09,839
we just as as a stakeholder or as a team

1514
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:11,760
we decide

1515
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:14,240
are we are we there yet right or have we

1516
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:15,119
met that

1517
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:16,880
good enough state and it's okay to say

1518
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:18,240
we're good enough with having

1519
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:20,319
one of those diagrams we had previously

1520
00:51:20,319 --> 00:51:22,480
if that's if that's a system

1521
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:25,920
maybe that's good enough right so

1522
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:27,599
it's up to you and it's really up to the

1523
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:28,960
stakeholders to know what's meaningful

1524
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:31,839
and valuable to them

1525
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:39,119
all right so a couple things about

1526
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:41,440
barriers and how do we remove those

1527
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:42,559
barriers

1528
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:44,800
so keep in mind that we have uh in this

1529
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:46,559
new work from anywhere

1530
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:49,520
or uh you know posts well or post or

1531
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:50,079
current

1532
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:54,319
uh pandemic uh environment

1533
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:56,000
with people working remotely working

1534
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,760
from home

1535
00:51:57,760 --> 00:51:59,440
you need a way of building a model

1536
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:02,160
collaboratively right and so

1537
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:03,680
there are a number of ways you could do

1538
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:05,839
this uh and and we'll talk about

1539
00:52:05,839 --> 00:52:07,599
we'll talk about a couple of ways a

1540
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:09,040
little later so i don't want to step on

1541
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:10,319
his heart's toes

1542
00:52:10,319 --> 00:52:12,559
uh but you know keep in mind that when

1543
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:13,520
you

1544
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:14,480
you have ways of building

1545
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:16,400
collaboratively right so you can do like

1546
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:17,359
a zoom call

1547
00:52:17,359 --> 00:52:20,800
right and on a virtual whiteboard uh

1548
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:22,480
you know if somebody sets up a webcam

1549
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:24,160
looking at their at their wall with a

1550
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:26,640
with a whiteboard on it and you can draw

1551
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:28,079
it's hard sometimes because sometimes

1552
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:29,440
you don't don't get good camera

1553
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:31,280
resolution or you might have delays in

1554
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:33,200
the video etc

1555
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:35,599
but that's one way of of building a

1556
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:37,040
model collaboratively

1557
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:38,800
but you can also build it by a good

1558
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:40,720
selection of tools one things we

1559
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:42,960
talk about in the threat mining

1560
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:44,079
manifesto

1561
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:47,280
is choosing tools that are useful

1562
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:49,040
and not making them the center of your

1563
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:50,960
world but using them to facilitate the

1564
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:52,079
conversation

1565
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:54,160
right facilitate the construction of

1566
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:55,599
that documentation

1567
00:52:55,599 --> 00:52:59,040
and nothing else uh so that's important

1568
00:52:59,040 --> 00:52:59,920
now once you

1569
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:02,079
have chosen the right method of doing a

1570
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:03,920
collaborative model

1571
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:05,520
you want to make sure that we maintain

1572
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:07,680
that right so as the system changes

1573
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:10,079
we want to keep the diagram up to date

1574
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:11,440
to keep the model up to date more

1575
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:12,319
importantly because

1576
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:15,440
the diagram and its annotations um to

1577
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:16,960
keep that up to date so that as the

1578
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:18,480
system changes we can keep track of

1579
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:19,119
things and

1580
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:21,280
and threats will come and go right so

1581
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:22,720
say you

1582
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:24,880
change that interface on that process

1583
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:26,000
from h to from

1584
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,599
you know http port 8080 to 8443

1585
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:30,880
well now i've closed out a set of

1586
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:33,040
threats i may have introduced new ones

1587
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:35,200
right and so it's important to keep the

1588
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:37,280
diagram up to date west and the model up

1589
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:38,800
to date as changes occur so that the

1590
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:40,960
thread elicitation can follow

1591
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:43,760
and then lastly at least for for me here

1592
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:44,079
the

1593
00:53:44,079 --> 00:53:46,319
the common patterns and diagrams exist

1594
00:53:46,319 --> 00:53:48,240
so as you're looking through a system

1595
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:49,520
and as you're describing the system

1596
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:51,040
you'll notice that patterns appear right

1597
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:51,920
so you have

1598
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:56,000
i have a web server over over a http

1599
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,480
well that means that's a pretty common

1600
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:00,160
pattern actually i mean you could first

1601
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:01,520
off you could build a toolkit

1602
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:04,880
of of objects that you could plug in

1603
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:06,480
like if you had a stencil kit right you

1604
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:08,160
could create those um

1605
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:10,400
but also just interpreting a diagram you

1606
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:12,160
may then match that to

1607
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:13,760
a pattern in your threat modeling

1608
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:16,400
process and and izar can certainly talk

1609
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:18,079
more about something like

1610
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:20,640
uh continuous threat modeling which

1611
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:22,720
looks at these patterns

1612
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:25,040
and and allows you to do that thread

1613
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:26,240
elicitation

1614
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:27,920
easier because you have a common pattern

1615
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:30,960
that appears throughout your models

1616
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:32,800
and i'll turn over you as our for some

1617
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:34,000
other thoughts there and

1618
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,440
these other ideas so uh very very

1619
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,680
quickly and very hand wavy

1620
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:41,440
there is a bunch of other ideas on how

1621
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:43,119
to overcome this

1622
00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:46,400
this uh this type of this uh

1623
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:48,640
obstacles so for example you could say

1624
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:49,920
hey you know what you guys don't want to

1625
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:50,559
draw

1626
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:52,799
to draw don't draw let's get somebody

1627
00:54:52,799 --> 00:54:54,319
who is ready to draw

1628
00:54:54,319 --> 00:54:56,559
put them in the head of the class and as

1629
00:54:56,559 --> 00:54:58,240
people talk he's going to draw

1630
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:00,160
on a whiteboard then we take a picture

1631
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:01,520
of the whiteboard

1632
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:03,680
and we distribute to everybody yay we

1633
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:05,440
have a model and you know what that's

1634
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:06,160
perfectly

1635
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:08,160
fine the important thing is you have a

1636
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:10,240
model the problem is you don't have a

1637
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:11,680
model that you can easily

1638
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:14,079
update keep a version put together with

1639
00:55:14,079 --> 00:55:15,359
your code

1640
00:55:15,359 --> 00:55:18,480
distribute annotate but you know what

1641
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:20,000
you have a model that's already a good

1642
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:24,480
thing another thing is infer diagrams

1643
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:26,400
you have enough stuff you should have

1644
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:28,559
enough stuff lying around

1645
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:31,200
to give you enough to start with some

1646
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:31,760
kind

1647
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:34,160
of diagram and who knows perhaps people

1648
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:35,760
see what you did and they start saying

1649
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:37,200
that's wrong that's wrong that's wrong

1650
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:38,720
and you end up with one that's actually

1651
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:39,440
right

1652
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:42,640
but you could start from requirements

1653
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:44,400
you could start from use cases

1654
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:46,160
you could start from post-its that

1655
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:47,839
people left around saying hey this is

1656
00:55:47,839 --> 00:55:49,440
how i wrote this thing

1657
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:52,000
you could even look if there is a code

1658
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,760
and come up with something that the team

1659
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:55,359
can look at and say yeah you know what

1660
00:55:55,359 --> 00:55:57,119
it's a good start let's let's finish it

1661
00:55:57,119 --> 00:55:58,319
well

1662
00:55:58,319 --> 00:56:00,839
then you have especially to address the

1663
00:56:00,839 --> 00:56:03,359
collabor

1664
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:06,079
a part of the thing diagram's a service

1665
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:06,640
we have

1666
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:09,920
nowadays enough uh

1667
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:12,960
things like lucidcharts and draw io and

1668
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:14,559
i don't know the next one and

1669
00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:16,720
the other one that people can actually

1670
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:17,760
collaborate over

1671
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:19,760
with their mouse in their browsers

1672
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:21,440
everybody together doesn't matter if

1673
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:22,000
it's a mac

1674
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:25,359
linux or pc or anything people are just

1675
00:56:25,359 --> 00:56:27,119
working on the same canvas

1676
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:29,359
and trying at the same time to model

1677
00:56:29,359 --> 00:56:30,400
that system

1678
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:33,760
so that's that's a good one uh

1679
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:37,520
and then we close with model as code

1680
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:40,000
and modulus code for us it's very close

1681
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,200
and dear to our hearts

1682
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:42,720
because it's part of something called

1683
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:44,240
threat modernist code

1684
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:47,280
or threat modeling from code which matt

1685
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:48,720
has already alluded

1686
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:51,920
and now we are sort of going to show you

1687
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:55,119
now i have very fat fingers i uh i am

1688
00:56:55,119 --> 00:56:57,599
terrible when i do

1689
00:56:57,599 --> 00:57:00,000
live demos so instead i'm going to show

1690
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,680
you the whole thing

1691
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:03,440
and point you in the right direction so

1692
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:06,079
that you can try by yourself

1693
00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:08,880
so we are talking about something called

1694
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:10,559
pythia

1695
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:13,680
ptm started about uh two three years ago

1696
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:17,760
wow and uh matt and i started it

1697
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:20,960
with uh uh with the help of some great

1698
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:21,760
people

1699
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:25,040
john vaz uh uh nick

1700
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:27,920
one of the organizers of the the village

1701
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:28,319
and

1702
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:31,440
uh rohit shamboni as well

1703
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:34,720
and what we thought in there was hey

1704
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:38,079
wouldn't it be cool if we have a simple

1705
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:39,599
way

1706
00:57:39,599 --> 00:57:43,359
to express a system

1707
00:57:43,359 --> 00:57:46,640
and once we did that we would get

1708
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:49,680
diagrams and we would get threats

1709
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:52,960
out of it a different way

1710
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:56,960
of threat modeling for developers by

1711
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:58,319
developers

1712
00:57:58,319 --> 00:58:01,359
and that escapes a bit from the tried

1713
00:58:01,359 --> 00:58:02,960
and true method of

1714
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:05,680
i'll give you a gui you drag some shapes

1715
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:06,960
you connect them

1716
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:09,520
and you're going to set attributes and

1717
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:11,599
then you're going to get a report

1718
00:58:11,599 --> 00:58:14,640
uh surprisingly enough some people don't

1719
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:16,400
really like that flow

1720
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:19,599
and as we we alluded to they prefer to

1721
00:58:19,599 --> 00:58:20,079
express

1722
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:22,319
their systems in a way that they already

1723
00:58:22,319 --> 00:58:23,839
know that they're already familiar with

1724
00:58:23,839 --> 00:58:24,880
and that

1725
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:26,480
we could even say is a bit less

1726
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:28,240
threatening for them

1727
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:30,480
so what is by the end the library

1728
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:32,240
written in python

1729
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:33,839
that lets you define the components of

1730
00:58:33,839 --> 00:58:36,000
the model and the relationships

1731
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,880
which now we know are the data flows it

1732
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:40,880
knows how to generate a dfd

1733
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:43,920
or a sequence diagram

1734
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:45,680
it lets you annotate to the components

1735
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:48,000
with their attributes

1736
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,720
and it uses those attributes and the

1737
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:51,920
data flows

1738
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:55,119
to elicit threats that

1739
00:58:55,119 --> 00:58:58,319
derive from a wasp top 10 from

1740
00:58:58,319 --> 00:59:02,839
the top 25 list from kpac

1741
00:59:02,839 --> 00:59:05,680
uh and give you those threads as a

1742
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:07,599
function of the components and the data

1743
00:59:07,599 --> 00:59:09,200
flow attributes

1744
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:12,000
now what does it look like and actually

1745
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:12,720
before you

1746
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:13,920
jump into the what does it look like

1747
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:17,520
just to remind folks it is open source

1748
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:19,440
and it's up on github you can find it

1749
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:22,720
and i think we have a link for it later

1750
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:24,960
so this is the minimal scaffolding that

1751
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:26,319
you need to write

1752
00:59:26,319 --> 00:59:30,079
up itm uh model description

1753
00:59:30,079 --> 00:59:31,440
everybody recognizes by now the

1754
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:33,680
invocation to python 3 we

1755
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:36,960
are not python 2 comparable and

1756
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:40,640
we basically start by importing some uh

1757
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:43,599
classes that represent elements like the

1758
00:59:43,599 --> 00:59:44,160
whole

1759
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:47,359
threat model itself tm an actor a trust

1760
00:59:47,359 --> 00:59:48,400
boundary

1761
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:51,760
uh classification for data you can say

1762
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:53,520
if data is top secret

1763
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:56,880
restricted public uh an object for

1764
00:59:56,880 --> 01:00:00,400
data itself we treat data as an element

1765
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:02,160
which is not something that you see a

1766
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:04,480
lot nowhere else

1767
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:09,119
uh then you have dataflow

1768
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:11,599
to carry that data between elements you

1769
01:00:11,599 --> 01:00:13,920
have a data store to store the data and

1770
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:15,359
then you have a process

1771
01:00:15,359 --> 01:00:18,319
and a higher class element which is a

1772
01:00:18,319 --> 01:00:19,680
server

1773
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:22,160
we start by defining the threat model

1774
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:23,839
object itself it's going to hold

1775
01:00:23,839 --> 01:00:26,559
everything together and where you see

1776
01:00:26,559 --> 01:00:28,400
there in red your

1777
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:30,960
model goes here that's the place where

1778
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:32,160
you actually add

1779
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:34,319
your description of your model and then

1780
01:00:34,319 --> 01:00:37,040
you call tm.process which will take

1781
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:39,119
all the description that you just wrote

1782
01:00:39,119 --> 01:00:40,160
plus the

1783
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:41,520
arguments that you supplied in the

1784
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:44,240
common line and come out with the output

1785
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:45,359
that you

1786
01:00:45,359 --> 01:00:48,319
required now what goes into that your

1787
01:00:48,319 --> 01:00:50,319
model goes here

1788
01:00:50,319 --> 01:00:52,960
we start simple with what would be in a

1789
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:53,760
dvd

1790
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:56,240
the blobs so those are the elements that

1791
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:57,680
we have in this case

1792
01:00:57,680 --> 01:01:00,079
we have a user we have a client we have

1793
01:01:00,079 --> 01:01:02,319
a server we have a database

1794
01:01:02,319 --> 01:01:05,760
things are kept very simple in here we

1795
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:11,280
say what they are and we give them names

1796
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:13,280
then we start with the data flows the

1797
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:14,880
relationships between

1798
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:18,319
those elements that we just uh described

1799
01:01:18,319 --> 01:01:20,720
so in here actually uh these slides are

1800
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:21,839
a bit uh

1801
01:01:21,839 --> 01:01:25,040
dated and where you see data flow

1802
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:28,559
from where to where and then the third

1803
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:29,359
field

1804
01:01:29,359 --> 01:01:31,680
here it is a name for the data flow a

1805
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:33,280
description for the data flow

1806
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:35,280
actually now we require data flow

1807
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:36,559
objects in there

1808
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:39,680
so the data flow is sorry data objects

1809
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:40,400
in there

1810
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:42,559
so the data flow actually is enriched by

1811
01:01:42,559 --> 01:01:44,160
the attributes of the data that it

1812
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:45,599
carries

1813
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:47,920
and we can see here an interaction

1814
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:50,799
between the user and client

1815
01:01:50,799 --> 01:01:52,480
data that comes in from the client to

1816
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:54,960
the server data that gets saved from the

1817
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:57,119
server to the database and so on and so

1818
01:01:57,119 --> 01:01:59,440
forth

1819
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:03,359
with just that in place

1820
01:02:03,359 --> 01:02:07,039
we are able to generate these two

1821
01:02:07,039 --> 01:02:10,559
diagrams the top one is a dfd

1822
01:02:10,559 --> 01:02:13,039
and again the slide is a bit dated we

1823
01:02:13,039 --> 01:02:14,079
have ported

1824
01:02:14,079 --> 01:02:17,119
uh itm to support dfd3

1825
01:02:17,119 --> 01:02:20,000
so now we are moving on with the times

1826
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,839
and supporting that effort

1827
01:02:21,839 --> 01:02:26,720
and the bottom one is a sequence

1828
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:29,599
diagram and now that we see them both

1829
01:02:29,599 --> 01:02:30,400
side to side

1830
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:33,280
we can reinforce what matt had said that

1831
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:34,400
they actually

1832
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:36,240
describe the same system describe the

1833
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:37,599
same relationships

1834
01:02:37,599 --> 01:02:40,559
but in different ways that let you see

1835
01:02:40,559 --> 01:02:41,920
uh

1836
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:45,039
different aspects of the system and

1837
01:02:45,039 --> 01:02:48,319
perhaps infer different threats

1838
01:02:48,319 --> 01:02:51,440
right but then we go

1839
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:55,599
further we now define trust boundaries

1840
01:02:55,599 --> 01:02:57,520
remember when we spoke about it in the

1841
01:02:57,520 --> 01:02:58,720
in the beginning with the

1842
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:01,760
the sample diagrams

1843
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:04,559
we are defining levels of trust in

1844
01:03:04,559 --> 01:03:05,599
between

1845
01:03:05,599 --> 01:03:08,960
the elements and how the data flows

1846
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:09,839
cross

1847
01:03:09,839 --> 01:03:12,400
those levels of trust so we declare a

1848
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:15,119
public boundary and a protected boundary

1849
01:03:15,119 --> 01:03:16,799
and then we start putting elements

1850
01:03:16,799 --> 01:03:19,359
inside the respective boundaries where

1851
01:03:19,359 --> 01:03:20,640
they sit

1852
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:23,680
once we again run the script

1853
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:26,400
we get our dfd with full representation

1854
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:27,920
of the trust boundaries

1855
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:30,960
so we can infer even more security

1856
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:35,119
uh information out of it

1857
01:03:35,119 --> 01:03:37,280
in the end we have a very simple

1858
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:39,039
template language

1859
01:03:39,039 --> 01:03:41,839
that lets you express what can clearly

1860
01:03:41,839 --> 01:03:42,400
be seen

1861
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:46,000
as a full thread model report

1862
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:49,119
so we have the diagram

1863
01:03:49,119 --> 01:03:51,920
we enrich it with information about the

1864
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:52,960
data flows

1865
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:55,440
things that if we put it in the diagram

1866
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:57,119
even though it's possible

1867
01:03:57,119 --> 01:03:59,119
if we put it in there it would make it

1868
01:03:59,119 --> 01:04:00,640
very difficult

1869
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:04,000
to read and to follow the diagram so

1870
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:07,839
we decided to put it on a separate table

1871
01:04:07,839 --> 01:04:09,119
and basically you get the same

1872
01:04:09,119 --> 01:04:13,119
information but enriched with the data

1873
01:04:13,119 --> 01:04:15,280
then we have a data dictionary we want

1874
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:17,119
to know what are the units of data that

1875
01:04:17,119 --> 01:04:18,559
this system works on

1876
01:04:18,559 --> 01:04:20,400
it gives us a better understanding of

1877
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:22,960
how things flow from one part to another

1878
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:26,000
and how they are transformed and then

1879
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,240
we close with a list of the potential

1880
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:29,200
threats

1881
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:32,400
that uh have been found in this

1882
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:35,599
with this representation and and sorry

1883
01:04:35,599 --> 01:04:37,359
before you before you close that out is

1884
01:04:37,359 --> 01:04:38,799
our it's important to note

1885
01:04:38,799 --> 01:04:42,319
you know we basically have 20

1886
01:04:42,319 --> 01:04:45,920
25 lines of code which

1887
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:49,520
generate a model with significant

1888
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:50,799
significant sufficient amount of

1889
01:04:50,799 --> 01:04:53,200
information and the annotations that go

1890
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:54,160
with it

1891
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:57,760
to then do thread elicitation right and

1892
01:04:57,760 --> 01:04:59,839
and that's important as a model then we

1893
01:04:59,839 --> 01:05:01,200
can also keep up to date

1894
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:03,599
as the system changes it can be

1895
01:05:03,599 --> 01:05:05,200
collaborative because we can put that

1896
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:05,680
model

1897
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:08,400
into say you know a source code

1898
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:10,240
repository tool and you can do code

1899
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:11,839
reviews on it

1900
01:05:11,839 --> 01:05:14,880
uh or do you know pull requests

1901
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:17,119
and now we've met all of those goals

1902
01:05:17,119 --> 01:05:17,920
right

1903
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:20,319
and it's a pretty straightforward method

1904
01:05:20,319 --> 01:05:23,599
now obviously we're biased because

1905
01:05:23,599 --> 01:05:25,520
you know this is this is our tool that

1906
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:27,280
we've worked on for a while now

1907
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:30,160
um but this is this demonstrates of a

1908
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:30,880
way of this

1909
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:32,720
that you can do this and and certainly

1910
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:34,319
there are other tools out there

1911
01:05:34,319 --> 01:05:35,920
right we encourage you to find the tool

1912
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:37,760
that works for you

1913
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:40,480
but this does address that challenge of

1914
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:41,359
having

1915
01:05:41,359 --> 01:05:44,240
an easy way of describing a system that

1916
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:44,960
you can pull

1917
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:47,839
from existing material that you can do

1918
01:05:47,839 --> 01:05:48,960
collaboratively

1919
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:50,400
and you don't have to be a fan you don't

1920
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:53,440
have to be an artist to do it

1921
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:56,799
yep and uh we have had cases where

1922
01:05:56,799 --> 01:05:58,000
people have collaborated

1923
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:01,119
long vast distances by uh as

1924
01:06:01,119 --> 01:06:05,039
matt said submitting prs real real time

1925
01:06:05,039 --> 01:06:07,920
or just committing to the same uh to the

1926
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:09,039
same branch

1927
01:06:09,039 --> 01:06:11,440
and it's just a matter of each one

1928
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:13,200
writes their part of the description you

1929
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:13,920
run the thing

1930
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:16,960
you get the diagram right away

1931
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:20,480
now uh one important thing pythm

1932
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:23,200
follows the philosophy of unix tools it

1933
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:24,240
tries to do well

1934
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:26,000
what it's supposed to do and nothing

1935
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,640
beyond that so we use things like plan

1936
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:29,359
to ml

1937
01:06:29,359 --> 01:06:33,200
we use graphviz and uh

1938
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:35,280
for the the creation of the report we

1939
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:36,960
created in a textual manner

1940
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:39,200
that you can use something like uh

1941
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:42,240
sphinx sphinx

1942
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:46,799
or pandork and to translate between

1943
01:06:46,799 --> 01:06:48,400
different formats

1944
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:51,440
so uh it's a very uh low

1945
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:54,400
low weight low barrier of an entry and

1946
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:55,920
even though it's written in python and

1947
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:56,960
even though it

1948
01:06:56,960 --> 01:06:59,920
uh it asks for a python script you can

1949
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:00,720
see from the

1950
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:02,640
the syntax that anybody that has any

1951
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:04,000
kind of experience

1952
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,640
with uh an object-oriented language is

1953
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:08,559
able to to describe that system

1954
01:07:08,559 --> 01:07:10,640
so you can go to a javascript uh

1955
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:12,319
developer you can go to a c plus plus

1956
01:07:12,319 --> 01:07:14,480
developer and they'll be able to

1957
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:16,880
write in jump and describe their systems

1958
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:17,599
there's no

1959
01:07:17,599 --> 01:07:19,359
there's a very low barrier of entry to

1960
01:07:19,359 --> 01:07:20,720
be able to describe your

1961
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:23,839
your system uh

1962
01:07:23,839 --> 01:07:25,839
i guess that that's what we had and we

1963
01:07:25,839 --> 01:07:27,119
are over time actually

1964
01:07:27,119 --> 01:07:29,680
yep so next slide yeah thank you very

1965
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:30,319
much for

1966
01:07:30,319 --> 01:07:31,839
for attending this presentation

1967
01:07:31,839 --> 01:07:33,440
hopefully you'll have a chance to ask

1968
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:35,280
some questions when it's

1969
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:38,720
live and you have some references here

1970
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:40,240
the first one is the threat modeling

1971
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:42,480
manifesto which we heartily

1972
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:45,520
recommend as even a starting point to

1973
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:46,720
threat modeling

1974
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:50,160
then you have the ugly fish book

1975
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:53,280
you have the pointer to uh ptm

1976
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:55,680
which actually is an incubator project

1977
01:07:55,680 --> 01:07:58,160
on owasp

1978
01:07:58,160 --> 01:08:01,359
and the next four are basically

1979
01:08:01,359 --> 01:08:04,880
uh threat modeling information but

1980
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:07,359
to a deeper level the continuous track

1981
01:08:07,359 --> 01:08:09,280
model in the math alluded to

1982
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:12,240
is something that uh we we developed

1983
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:14,160
some time ago in autodesk

1984
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:17,198
open sourced as a way to do threat

1985
01:08:17,198 --> 01:08:17,920
modeling

1986
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:19,439
by developers with developers for

1987
01:08:19,439 --> 01:08:21,920
developers and

1988
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:23,600
the next two books are books that we

1989
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:25,439
personally really like

1990
01:08:25,439 --> 01:08:27,279
adam shostak strat modeling designing

1991
01:08:27,279 --> 01:08:29,679
for security which is already a classic

1992
01:08:29,679 --> 01:08:32,640
on uh threat modeling and talks about

1993
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:33,120
basically

1994
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:36,238
everything and uh brook sanford's

1995
01:08:36,238 --> 01:08:38,399
security systems where he gives

1996
01:08:38,399 --> 01:08:41,679
great examples of architectures and

1997
01:08:41,679 --> 01:08:43,359
threats to those architectures how to

1998
01:08:43,359 --> 01:08:45,359
mitigate them and he simply draws from

1999
01:08:45,359 --> 01:08:46,080
his

2000
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:49,279
very very very vast experience and

2001
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:52,319
for those that need a bit more

2002
01:08:52,319 --> 01:08:55,040
accessible reading there is the safe

2003
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:56,719
code technical threat modeling

2004
01:08:56,719 --> 01:09:01,439
which looks at facets of threat modeling

2005
01:09:01,439 --> 01:09:03,600
just to build that common language and

2006
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:05,120
let people start

2007
01:09:05,120 --> 01:09:09,679
and take something away from it

2008
01:09:12,238 --> 01:09:15,198
so i guess that now we move to questions

2009
01:09:15,198 --> 01:09:16,080
and uh

2010
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:19,198
now we go live so

2011
01:09:19,198 --> 01:09:21,839
see you there
