you will know why

6
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:30,480
we are doing this okay

7
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:33,280
i'm daniel eisler i'm social engineer

8
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:36,160
pentester and security consultant i'm

9
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,640
the team leader of friendly rats

10
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:41,280
the social engineering unit of dreamlab

11
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,200
technologies in chile

12
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,640
let's start this

13
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:49,520
what is a red team or what we know or

14
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,879
what we think about red team

15
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,239
i like

16
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:56,640
this definition of dale pearson

17
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:58,719
i don't know if everyone are occurred

18
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,879
with this but i like

19
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:05,600
this definition

20
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:08,159
what do we expect from our red team

21
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:10,240
we always think in the unit about red

22
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:13,760
team and we always say we want to

23
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:16,880
emulate a real attack we want an mma

24
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:19,680
scenario you know yeah everything counts

25
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:22,799
we want the company to know anything

26
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:26,000
until the end we cannot have prior

27
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:28,080
information or there may only legal

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,280
political restriction that is the

29
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:34,560
perfect scenario for us but

30
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,560
what real happens

31
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,119
it shouldn't

32
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:41,759
not be the same as a real attack

33
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,520
it's not an mms scenario it's not

34
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,399
everything counts

35
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,000
the company asks to know every move that

36
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,000
we make

37
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,960
the company provides

38
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,280
information and aggregates specific

39
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:59,040
goals

40
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,960
and restrictions conditions are added

41
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,439
to the service

42
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:06,240
and it's chosen to leave only some

43
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:12,080
vectors in black box guess

44
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:12,080
what usually those of social engineering

45
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,720
types of company that hires red team

46
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:21,680
services

47
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:23,200
the first one whoever hires the service

48
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,200
has the knowledge

49
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,800
and the maturity but

50
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,120
not the company

51
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:32,400
the person who hires prefers to

52
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:36,319
transform it into an internal pen test

53
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:38,000
with several access granted

54
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:40,400
the third one

55
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,640
instead of looking for threats and

56
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,040
recognizing vulnerabilities their

57
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:47,200
vulnerabilities they prefer to try

58
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:50,959
specific topics

59
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:53,840
and there's a fourth one

60
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:57,519
there is a maturity and experience that

61
00:02:53,840 --> 00:03:00,319
allows an integral exercise of red team

62
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:02,959
to take place so

63
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:05,120
let's forget the three and stay with the

64
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:08,159
last one yes

65
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,360
that company that we all want to work

66
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:12,560
with

67
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:15,599
that one that allows us to live what we

68
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,360
have always heard about in the stories

69
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:20,640
of others

70
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,000
but now we can experience this in first

71
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,440
hand

72
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:29,680
something that invite us to try all our

73
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:31,680
tools creativity and strategies

74
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:35,200
full pandemic

75
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:38,879
tory city mandatory quarantine a client

76
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:41,920
decides to activate a red team service

77
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:45,599
reinforcing the circumstances as a

78
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:48,959
perfect scenario for eventual attack

79
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:52,799
and consequently a perfect opportunity

80
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:55,920
for simulation in red team format

81
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:58,159
the request was received with enthusiasm

82
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,519
but the entire team

83
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:02,080
until

84
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:05,840
they mention it will include

85
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:09,519
physical access tests dumpster diving

86
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:12,640
connection of hid devices access to

87
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:15,439
critical spaces detection and

88
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:18,439
exploitation of vulnerabilities in

89
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,439
workstations

90
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:24,880
the service will start with an intrusion

91
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,919
the entire service is gonna last two

92
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,479
weeks

93
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:32,880
and we need to get in like a worker and

94
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:32,880
the crown jewels are critical spaces

95
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:37,919
no matter which are the crown jewels or

96
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:40,800
the threads to be emulated this stage

97
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:43,840
provides clear directions for process of

98
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:46,960
information gathering and even limits

99
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:49,759
the parameters on places to be searched

100
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:53,400
it even established first indications of

101
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,400
possible threats

102
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,919
day 0

103
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,919
scotch tape

104
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:08,840
the ocean process is initiated with

105
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:11,280
specific focus on specific areas

106
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,880
collaborators and job information

107
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,520
available online

108
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:19,199
it is possible to identify several

109
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:22,400
employees who deliver enough information

110
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:24,880
in order to begin to build a pretext

111
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:27,759
among them it is important to remember

112
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,440
the person whom we will call

113
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:32,560
brian jackson

114
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:35,440
who works on the c-level area and expose

115
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:38,639
corporate critical information on social

116
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,680
media and his accounts profiles are

117
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,800
public

118
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,639
now i'm able to configure a persona and

119
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,360
the pretext to present during the

120
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:50,560
nutrition a collaborator

121
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:52,720
photos of corporate id and access card

122
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,080
to the building are found on social

123
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,160
networks

124
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:59,120
remember that we are in the middle of a

125
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:01,759
pandemic and no non-essential services

126
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:04,560
were available so our provider who

127
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:07,199
prints the cards on lanyard

128
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:10,240
was not a possibility

129
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:12,479
the only viable option was to design a

130
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,319
replica in photoshop

131
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:16,880
but remember we didn't have the

132
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:19,280
equipment to make a replica of

133
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:22,800
acceptable quality so

134
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:24,800
we dust off an old printer and look for

135
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:28,319
possibilities to print

136
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,600
after a couple of tries we managed to

137
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,560
get a

138
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,199
close

139
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:37,199
at a pretty decent level with a

140
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:38,880
transparency mika and scotch tape yes

141
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:41,600
scotch tape

142
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:45,440
to access the offices we had to pass

143
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,880
through two controls with guards

144
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,840

148
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:21,199
hoping to find workers in the

149
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:24,800
proximities of the building to clone at

150
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:30,759
least a couple of access cards

151
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:30,759
we found something that we never expect

152
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:39,039
to make a basic description of what i

153
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,360
got

154
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:43,660
it was more like a scene

155
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:46,240
from i am leather

157
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:51,440
my name is robert neville

158
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:54,440
if anyone is out there

159
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,440
please

160
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:03,280
but

161
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:06,720
not that kind of legend

162
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:08,400
more like a legend in downtown santiago

163
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:12,240
chile okay

164
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:15,360
so the options to clone was immediately

165
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:18,160
immediately discarded without any other

166
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:20,080
option i decided to test the axes by the

167
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,639
main entrance

168
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:26,199
and one of the guards came from inside

169
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,199
and taxed me

170
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,640
foreign

171
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:00,320
just when one person was coming out from

172
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,560
the only door available

173
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,600
where also biometric validation and

174
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,720
request

175
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:09,680
i managed to access by tailgating and

176
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:13,440
have a given half step inside the person

177
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,440
returns and interrogates me

178
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:25,120
i went on my way noticing his bewell

179
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:27,920
reward he was a worry you know

180
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:30,640
he the world the world stayed

181
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:34,120
a few meters later i managed to

182
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:35,839
understand why he was so

183
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:38,720
bewilderment

184
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:42,160
he was the only person on the floor

185
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:45,120
of more than a hundred workers and i had

186
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:48,160
just tailgating the guard and the only

187
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,160
person on the floor

188
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:54,240
being at the workstation

189
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:56,160
chosen for the simulation i begin to sit

190
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,880
down comfortably

191
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,080
and to do what should be done in those

192
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:03,279
cases

193
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:05,920
the most complex and difficult thing

194
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:07,680
when one reached this point

195
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,279
to calm down

196
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:12,000
and be there

197
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:14,480
to be like someone who works there

198
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,760
yes i know it sounds obvious and even

199
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,920
ridiculous

200
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:20,800
but the most current thing in physical

201
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:22,720
penetration testers is that at this

202
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:25,279
point they look like

203
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,200
the tasmanian monster and drugs looking

204
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:28,240
for something to eat

205
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,600
so

206
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,320
just

207
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,320
calm down

208
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,200
yes

209
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,440
he took my bat

210
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,040
are you tired to not have a real

211
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,560
credential

212
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:52,160
get this one

213
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:55,040
yes that was paced with scotch tape and

214
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:59,120
printed on a transparency mika by a

215
00:10:55,040 --> 00:11:00,800
printer of no more than 50 bucks in fact

216
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,680
this one

217
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:09,320
i was doing my best not to look at my

218
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:09,320
momma worthy piece of heart call now

219
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:41,600
he starred the dumpster diving

220
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:43,680
collecting a set of about 28 inches of

221
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:47,200
loose documents

222
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:50,399
and he took them to his workstation

223
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,959
which in about two hours was transformed

224
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,680
into four

225
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:56,399
workstations

226
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:59,760
full of documents in search of possible

227
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:03,279
critical information

228
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:05,680
danny boy phone access credentials

229
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:09,279
printed emails

230
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:11,760
process descriptions on ip

231
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:18,549
addresses

232
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:18,549
[Music]

233
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,839
day 2 monolithic

234
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,839
keys

235
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,399
sorry

236
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:33,279
i started the day with a passive

237
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:35,040
recognition with a coffee in my hand

238
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:38,240
greeting the guard

239
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:40,880
that this day was a new one he asked me

240
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,560
very seriously to send an email from my

241
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:45,680
supposed boss

242
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:48,560
justifying my presence in the office

243
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:51,200
to which i respond positively mentioning

244
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:54,800
that i will request the sending of the

245
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:57,920
email as soon as possible

246
00:12:54,800 --> 00:13:00,079
i detect a set of computers there were

247
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:02,720
next to him

248
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:04,839
they were for a public use

249
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:08,000
and remind

250
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:10,639
unlocked i asked to the guard if i can

251
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,040
use one of the mouses of this computer

252
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:15,839
for a while he says yes

253
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:18,160
so then i bend down to disconnect the

254
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:21,760
cable from the cabinet and take

255
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:24,079
advantage to the justify situation to

256
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:26,480
connect my rubber

257
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:26,480
mouse

258
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,200
so but

259
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:35,120
don't

260
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:37,680
get excited because the computer were on

261
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:40,160
isolated network segment

262
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,600
and does not compromise any critical

263
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:45,040
information

264
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:46,959
it was expected but it's always good to

265
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,399
roll out you know

266
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,839
so

267
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:51,440
always bring your

268
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:53,600
rubber mouse

269
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:56,160
i returned to my workplace

270
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,639
in one of the rounds of the guard i

271
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,760
decided to follow him and realize a

272
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:02,839
possible

273
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:05,839
vulnerability generated by the content

274
00:14:02,839 --> 00:14:10,160
contingency through the operation of

275
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:10,959
remote desktop desktop computers

276
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,600
so

277
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:16,320
let's check it out this

278
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:19,040
if one of the computers was turned off

279
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:21,360
restarted or had some kind of connection

280
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:23,600
error the collaborators called to the

281
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:27,600
reception to request technical support

282
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:30,000
from the same guard how step 1

283
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,680
the worker identified himself by phone

284
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,560
with the guard and indicate the

285
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:37,120
connection problem step 2 indicates the

286
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:39,519
location of the workstation step 3 the

287
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:43,120
worker calls back now straight to their

288
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:46,320
extension at the workstation

289
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:48,560
step 4 the worker dictates his username

290
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:52,079
and password to the guard on the guard

291
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:55,920
enter it bingo we will have access just

292
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:55,920
implement a keylogger and you're

293
00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:05,680
done what was the problem

294
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:07,360
most computers were notebooks or hard or

295
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:11,120
hard wireless

296
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:14,959
keyboards and our device this one or

297
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:19,199
keylogger was exclusive for capturing

298
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:22,000
keystrokes on wired keyboards

299
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:24,480
i managed to find a computer with a

300
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,760
wired keyboard

301
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,959
and there's this one with a large sign

302
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,000
that says

303
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:31,199
please

304
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,199
do not

305
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:34,720
turn off

306
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:37,759
with a respect

307
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:40,480
and only press the reset button

308
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:42,399
after installing our keylogger on the

309
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,759
usb port

310
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:46,480
of the keyboard

311
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:49,759
i quickly made my way to my workstation

312
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:52,399
and i heard in the distance the guard's

313
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:55,680
phone on the start of the protocol that

314
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:57,920
you already know monitoring the key

315
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:00,959
logger

316
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:04,880
in real time with wi-fi i realized that

317
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:04,880
the information was incomplete

318
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,839
i looked for another computer with a

319
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:12,160
similar characteristics but

320
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:14,320
i do not find any

321
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:17,279
nor did i think

322
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:20,000
in that time about moving

323
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:23,519
the keyboard from the previous one to

324
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,639
another compatible one which now that i

325
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:28,320
think

326
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:31,600
about it it was quite logical and will

327
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:35,519
not have raised alerts from that red

328
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:37,120
team onwards we always carry a wired

329
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:38,079
keyword

330
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,560
so

331
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:42,480
back to the first notebook which i

332
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,480
didn't turn off remember it didn't turn

333
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:47,040
off only rested button

334
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:50,160
so i rested again

335
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:52,880
it hasn't shut down which is what they

336
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:55,120
were asking not to do it

337
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:58,160
so this time i need to document the

338
00:16:55,120 --> 00:17:01,680
action as a proof of findings with my

339
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:05,199
hearts beating like you know what sounds

340
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:08,079
russian techno mm-hmm i sneak

341
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:10,400
up to leave a record for the audio

342
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:12,799
recording i managed to record the

343
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:15,360
conversation i start recording the

344
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:16,839
keystrokes on the keyboard with the our

345
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:20,959
keylogger

346
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:23,600
but they're surprisingly stop

347
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:26,240
registering

348
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,240
what happened

349
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,039
the guard

350
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:34,640
start

351
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:36,000
to put the password of the user in the

352
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,640
phone

353
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,760
and suddenly in the middle

354
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,640
of the password he decides to

355
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,280
move

356
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,720
to the keyboard of the notebook

357
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,919
why

358
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,559
i don't know

359
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:52,720
maybe he's a funny guy

360
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:55,280
so at this point

361
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:57,760
don't worry we have a lot of information

362
00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:01,520
so at this point in the test the rest of

363
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:04,480
the team was already remotely performing

364
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:06,880
tests with the ip founds yeah

365
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:09,440
credentials detected and information

366
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:12,720
collected in the dumpster diving

367
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:15,520
stage yeah i decided to begin our

368
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:18,160
recognition of other floors

369
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:20,000
especially the one that was selected as

370
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:22,720
the crown duo

371
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,600
by the client yeah and also the floor

372
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:27,120
where jackson's remember this guy

373
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,039
do you remember him

374
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:32,320
brian jackson yeah the guy from the

375
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:35,280
ocean well keep this made in mind don't

376
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:39,360
forget it please

377
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:41,440
accompany by the classic launch reheated

378
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:43,280
in october where you know tupperware

379
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,280
very typical chilean

380
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:48,480
tupperware

381
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:51,919
so i head to the floor in question that

382
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:53,840
we knew contain a common area to eat

383
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:56,480
again

384
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:58,720
the entrance is by biometric

385
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,559
authentication but

386
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:03,919
in this case

387
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:03,919
there was an intercom

388
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:12,480
i enter as the nephew who arrives at the

389
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:15,120
