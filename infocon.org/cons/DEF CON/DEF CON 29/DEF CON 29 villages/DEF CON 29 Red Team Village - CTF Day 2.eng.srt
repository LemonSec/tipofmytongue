241
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,799
lot of fun uh checking out some of the

uh

243
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,520
teams we've seen before in other other

244
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,480
events we've held

245
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,320
uh this is truly worldwide it's it's

246
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,320
great that we can do this live right now

247
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,919
um you know we can enter interact with

248
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:11,600
some of the students on the floor

249
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,120
but we know these teams are all over

250
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,120
we've got folks from from poland all

251
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,160
over europe

252
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,320
uh we know that there's a uh there's a

253
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,000
couple teams from africa a lot of teams

254
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,200
from south america

255
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,960
and so it's it's really great that even

256
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,640
with the current situation and

257
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,280
international

258
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,200
international travel being stunted that

259
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,600
we can still kind of get together and uh

260
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,120
you know kind of plan an event like this

261
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,039
and meet up with some folks

262
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:34,480
i think it's been i think it's been

263
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,679
fairly challenging some of the

264
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:37,679
challenges that we have we try to do a

265
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:39,440
a wide breadth of different things i

266
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,640
want to make sure there's a lot of a lot

267
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,240
of web content out there

268
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,559
we've got a few ponables um you know

269
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:46,320
some some forensics a couple things from

270
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:46,960
the

271
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,120
blue team perspective going through some

272
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,918
packet captures

273
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,760
and um we will

274
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,679
we'll we'll go on in a little bit with

275
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,039
our with our first interview we'll take

276
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:00,000
a break

277
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,640
we would love some feedback from every

278
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,400
player out there so there is going to be

279
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,679
a survey link

280
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:07,200
uh we can't do a cheesy thing where you

281
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,280
get points for filling out the survey

282
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,960
that is that is an opportunity for us to

283
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,559
always improve what we do

284
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:14,720
so please uh take the time to to go to

285
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,600
that survey

286
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,960
give some really good feedback if

287
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:17,919
there's anything about a certain

288
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:19,039
challenge that

289
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:20,880
that you thought was was confusing that

290
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,559
always helps us revisit the way that

291
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:23,840
we're presenting the questions and

292
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,360
presenting the challenges

293
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,640
um anything you want to see in the

294
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,000
future i had someone reach out and said

295
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,600
hey i'd really like to see more uh

296
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,120
android apps that we can attack

297
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,400
we've done those in the past i don't

298
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,240
think we had any in calls this time

299
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,760
but that's the kind of feed that that

300
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,840
feedback that really guides our next ctf

301
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,520
all right perfect and um throughout the

302
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,880
day we're gonna be making a lot of more

303
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,559
announcements for giveaways

304
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,039
as barrett mentioned before i'm gonna

305
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:51,120
take a quick break but a few things that

306
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,720
i want to highlight

307
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,039
um as danielle mentioned you know all

308
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:56,480
communications is actually happening in

309
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:56,799
the

310
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:00,080
defcon discord server in the bottom of

311
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,760
your screen you actually see the

312
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,240
actual channel that we're congregating

313
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:04,799
on

314
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:06,400
and then the second thing you see this

315
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,159
schedule a link which is

316
00:20:09,159 --> 00:20:11,039
redtinvillage.io

317
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:13,679
schedule and the scoreboard is also very

318
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:14,320
easy

319
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,640
just our website scoreboard so that will

320
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,159
take you to the scoreboard that you will

321
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:20,240
just watch or just watch it a few

322
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,280
minutes ago

323
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,559
so once again the qualifiers part two

324
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:27,440
is actually now live and we see ai

325
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,720
generator still on the top

326
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,440

00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,600
thank optic for being a sponsor for the

338
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,440
red team village ctf this year

339
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,600
your support really helps and it goes a

340
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,480
long way

341
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,559
at uh allowing us to provide a big event

342
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:21,520
both in person

343
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,600
and virtually can you tell me a little

344
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,000
bit more about optiv

345
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,480
yeah absolutely so to put it very simply

346
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,760
optiv is a pure play

347
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,520
cyber security partner and what does

348
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,600
that mean we aim to do

349
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,600
security all security all the time right

350
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,760
we can help in ways of advisory

351
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,000
deployment and even manage operations

352
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,919
right so ultimately our goal is very

353
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:43,279
simply to

354
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:45,279
help organize organizations realize a

355
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:47,279
more effective security program

356
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:49,840
and posture

357
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,520
and uh for for both of you specifically

358
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,159
what what do you do at optiv

359
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,000
so i'm a senior director inside of

360
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,600
threat management which is a larger

361
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,080
umbrella

362
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,679
but i specifically have the privilege of

363
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:04,159
leading our attack and pen team

364
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:05,760
so my focus is on the direction of

365
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,919
success of that team and i achieved this

366
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:09,200
largely by enabling

367
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,039
the great folks around me such as mr

368
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:12,480
eidelberg here

369
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,600
and i'm a technical manager under uh

370
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,360
attacking pen my primary role is leading

371
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,520
the adversarial simulation services

372
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,840
this is our branch that focuses

373
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,440
primarily on red and purple team

374
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,480
operations

375
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,320
my role in there is not only executing

376
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,600
these types of engagements but also

377
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,400
focusing on

378
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,880
helping to innovate the team and grow

379
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,480
more operators to perform these types of

380
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,799
engagements

381
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,960
all right and uh and for the for that uh

382
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:37,919
attack and pen

383
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:40,840
practice uh why do you like working

384
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,960
there yeah so for me

385
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,279
uh first and foremost uh it's it's the

386
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:47,279
close family atmosphere that we have on

387
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:47,840
the team

388
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,440
uh and what i mean by that is i've been

389
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,039
on the team for almost nine years now

390
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:52,640
i've been an attack and pen the entire

391
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,039
time

392
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:54,640
and i'm not alone in that there's

393
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,720
several other individuals on the team

394
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,240
that have been here for a similar amount

395
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,840
of time such a such as matt

396
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,000
himself so what that shield is a really

397
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:02,960
good dynamic

398
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,799
of folks to work well together while we

399
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:06,559
uh simultaneously you know pursue our

400
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:08,320
passion about offensive security

401
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,000
and just add on to that i would say in a

402
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,600
single word the community

403
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,240
uh the team itself uh honestly strives

404
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,600
constantly to push the boundaries to

405
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,480
teach each other

406
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,320
new things whether or not it's a you

407
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,480
know failures from previous engagements

408
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,760
to help educate

409
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,960
for future uh tests or even success

410
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:25,760
stories

411
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,360
it's all about sharing and kind of

412
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,720
bolstering each other and through

413
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,120
knowledge sharing

414
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,200
absolutely and uh you know and a plug

415
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,480
for that that giving back to the

416
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,159
community aspect you know i was on your

417
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:37,200
github the other day

418
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,039
and uh i was looking into scarecrow and

419
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:40,559
i know i've got that on my list to do a

420
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:42,559
deep dive on after after defcon

421
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,400
you know love love the fact that uh you

422
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,679
know a lot of big players in

423
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:47,840
information security share that research

424
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,760
share that tooling that they create

425
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,880
yep that's what we strive to do here

426
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,200
and for your team um you know what types

427
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,159
of people work there

428
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:59,120
what are their backgrounds so it's a

429
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,960
good variety of backgrounds right so we

430
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:01,600
have folks

431
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,919
uh some from being a good part of us

432
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:04,880
being veterans

433
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,799
uh to business-minded folks to

434
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:08,880
engineering folks etc right

435
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,720
but like i mentioned earlier there's the

436
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,159
ultimate uh

437
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:14,799
commonality right of a shared objective

438
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:15,679
of offense

439
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:17,200
and passion for offensive security

440
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,279
testing and then what we qualify that

441
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:20,880
success really is helping leave our

442
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,320
clients better than we found them at the

443
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,279
end of the day

444
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:25,039
and of course you know folks have a very

445
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:27,600
specific or can have a specific subset

446
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,240
of interest

447
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,200
inside the team uh that could be of iot

448
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,159
to embedded to

449
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:34,000
wireless to low-level window stuff to

450
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,159
evasion etc right so

451
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:38,159
there's definitely some sub-pockets for

452
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:41,279
people to really go a mile deep on

453
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:43,520
great and with such a diverse group what

454
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:46,720
makes somebody a success in amp

455
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,360
so aside from a technical acumen which

456
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,640
obviously is held you know it's an

457
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,480
important quality on this specific

458
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,120
role right uh is the ability to show

459
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:55,760
ownership

460
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,679
and leadership and give back to the team

461
00:27:57,679 --> 00:27:59,840
um really you know owning a specific

462
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:00,399
service

463
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:02,399
or an offering uh helping others

464
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:04,159
mentoring et cetera we hold that in

465
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:06,000
incredibly high value

466
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,279
and then as we mentioned earlier with

467
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:09,279
regard to um like source zero and

468
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:10,399
scarecrow right

469
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:12,240
is the the public thought leadership to

470
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,320
help the team immediately and then also

471
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,640
give back to the community as well

472
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,240
yep and just to add on to that i would

473
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,399
say the eagerness to learn and improve

474
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:21,679
your tradecraft

475
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:24,480
um honestly the ones we see that excel

476
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,919
the most are the ones that not only

477
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:27,120
focus on themselves

478
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,159
but also make sure that they help their

479
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:32,240
fellow teammates or co-workers whether

480
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,279
or not they're struggling with something

481
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:34,799
or helping to help them

482
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:37,360
also pursue and grow their talents those

483
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,159
are the ones that i

484
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:41,279
see often have the basic success here

485
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:42,960
that's great uh absolutely i mean this

486
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,799
is this is a team sport uh doing what we

487
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:46,720
do

488
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,159
for the for the red team village one

489
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:50,320
thing that we we uh really love to do

490
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,960
is is offer a lot of uh environments for

491
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,039
training we do workshops we we

492
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:56,640
we participate in a lot of different

493
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,960
cons um and one thing

494
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,480
you know we want to do is bring as many

495
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,640
people into this community as possible

496
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,360
and so

497
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,360
i'd like to ask for both of you you know

498
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,880
what is your advice for people who are

499
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:07,440
interested

500
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,720
in cyber security as a profession

501
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,799
yeah absolutely so i mean i'll speak to

502
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:14,240
you know the path that i took to get

503
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,000
here and i think it holds true to the

504
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,840
to the question right but i think it's

505
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,600
very important or imperative for folks

506
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,480
to have a

507
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,480
a deep foundational understanding as to

508
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,760
how uh

509
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,520
things work right so what i mean by that

510
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,360
is how does active directory work how

511
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,320
does networking

512
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,919
function how can you manipulate these

513
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:32,240
things to maybe work outside the bounds

514
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,840
it was intended to right so that can

515
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,440
apply to even development web

516
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,960
applications etc

517
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,200
um oftentimes i get asked by people that

518
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,559
are a bit younger and stay in college or

519
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:41,679
whatever and they're like hey should i

520
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:43,120
take this security class and become a

521
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,320
pen tester well

522
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,240
i would really encourage folks to get a

523
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,360
lot of those more foundational

524
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,240
understandings

525
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,399
just how things work before they move to

526
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:52,320
the stage of trying to you know

527
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,399
move to that adversarial emulation types

528
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:55,520
part

529
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,600
yeah and i would just add uh to not just

530
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,440
focus when you're learning on red team

531
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,159
tactics

532
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:01,919
it's incredibly valuable in the current

533
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:03,360
landscape to uh

534
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:06,080
focus on both blue and red team having

535
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,039
that ability to

536
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:09,279
speak both can really augment your skill

537
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:10,480
set and

538
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,919
you know this is very much a cat and

539
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:13,600
mouse game based industry

540
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,919
and just knowing both sides their

541
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:17,520
playbooks can really help you understand

542
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,960
the strengths and weaknesses

543
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,640
of both sides so when you're coming up

544
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,000
against a red team or a blue

545
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,240
team you know what they are great at

546
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,760
what their weaknesses are to really help

547
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,200
plan out those attacks

548
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,960
or even your knowledge set to improve on

549
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,360
those that is phenomenal advice uh this

550
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,080
industry

551
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,480
is is a challenge because there's so

552
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,520
much breath

553
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,600
and depth that you can take uh not to

554
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,279
mention that it's evolving every single

555
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:41,760
day

556
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,600
it's impossible to keep up so you've got

557
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,960
to have that thirst for knowledge

558
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,880
and and without that foundation it is

559
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,159
quite difficult i mean you might throw

560
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:49,919
that exploit and get that get that shell

561
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:50,320
back

562
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,679
but then the question is what do you do

563
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:53,360
next right and so

564
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,760
uh great advice i want to thank both of

565
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,360

566

focused on offensive security and

597
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,240
security as a service

598
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:47,119
it's been a wild ride but part of i

599
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:48,560
stick around is because i love

600

that we go out there and break things

603
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,960
build new things

604
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,760
break more things and and always working

605
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,000
with

606
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,680
the latest technologies to keep people

607
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,760

608
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,520
opportunity for us to sponsor the red

609
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,359

virtually

613
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,400
and on site and uh to hopefully find

614
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,680
some new ways to grow our team

615
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:17,359
hi savannah nice to see you i'm barrett

616
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:18,880
darnell managing senior operator at

617
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,800
bishop fox i'm part of the continuous

618
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,720
attack surface testing team also known

619
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,640
as cast

620
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,000
well we're really excited to have you

621
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,240
guys on this call today and

622
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,440
i would say the first question that we

623
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,960
kind of want to start off with is kind

624
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,720
of seeing what you guys would say is the

625
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,880
best part of being a sponsor for an

626
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,720
event like this

627
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,400
well for bishop fox we're avid

628
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,000
participants of the greater infosec

629
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,680
community and we feel that sponsorship

630
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,520
of conferences and efforts like this

631
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,440
provide a real tangible value to the

632
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,440
community this ctf in particular

633
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,720
provides a tremendous amount of

634
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,000
realistic hands-on

635
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,760
experiences for those in the offensive

636
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,960
security particularly red teamers

637
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,359
yeah no that's that's awesome and i mean

638
00:36:57,359 --> 00:36:58,640
i'm sure you know this barrett

639
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,640
uh with so many reasons that resources

640
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,400
out there uh why do you think kind of

641
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,000
sponsoring something like this is so

642
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,680
important

643
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:08,400
well for one uh this resource is free so

644
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,240
that barrier of entry is out of the way

645
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,400
anybody can participate secondly it's

646
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,280
realistic

647
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,520
it mimics real life scenarios that we've

648
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,359
seen on our customer engagements

649
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:19,440
and so it's not very esoteric it's you

650
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,720
know real tools

651
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,960
real uh situations you might be in and

652
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,240
it's also beginner friendly

653
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,000
um it starts off where everybody can

654
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,520
join and get something out of it

655
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:30,079
but the difficulty ramps up so there's a

656
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:32,560
lot for experienced red teamers

657
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:35,839
to hone their skills on awesome uh i

658
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:37,599
know we've kind of just talked about

659
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:39,760
the benefits that people who are joining

660
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,040
the ctf would get out of it

661
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,400
but can you kind of talk about the

662
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,320
benefits bishop fox receives out of

663
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,400
being a sponsor for the red team village

664
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:50,079
ctf event at defcon yeah well you know

665
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:51,599
first and foremost we always want to

666
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:53,680
give back to the security community

667
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:56,480
and uh this is a great way uh for us to

668
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,800
interact with the hundreds maybe even

669
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,400
thousands of attendees

670
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,560
and participants uh whether they're

671
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,000
there in person

672
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,119
or virtually um it's great um from where

673
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:09,359
i sit as a recruiter because it gives us

674
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:10,000
a chance

675
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,880
to um meet new talent and people who we

676
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,960
maybe haven't engaged with before

677
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,560
and that's really important especially

678
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,320
as we continue to grow

679
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,400
our two new service lines the continuing

680
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,240
continuous attack service

681
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:25,280
testing team that barrett is on and our

682
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,960
red team

683
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,119
yeah no i mean everybody knows in the

684
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:31,119
security community who bishop fox is

685
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:32,640
and i'm sure they would love to know

686
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,160
about the recruitment

687
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,400
so i guess what types of people do you

688
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,359
guys typically

689
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:40,400
look for for the team yeah so you know

690
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,440
what we need

691
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,280
and what we're hiring for can kind of

692
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,040
shift month to month so

693
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,640
in the past if you engaged with us and

694
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,480
it wasn't a fit um that might be

695
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,320
changing so you know always stay in

696
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,040
touch

697
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,960
um first and foremost we look for people

698
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,720
who are really passionate about security

699
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,720
because that's definitely who

700
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,720
uh we are and you know we're always

701
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:01,280
looking for um a diversity of thoughts a

702
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,720
diversity of backgrounds

703
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,400
so uh you know we have a lot of people

704
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,880
who came from a pretty like traditional

705
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,720
career paths you know school

706
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,480
work but we definitely have folks who

707
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,880
are self-taught who are coming from

708
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,520
non-traditional backgrounds um you know

709
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,440
we we love our folks from the military

710

as well

711
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:19,760

712
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,760
can lead you to working at bishop fox

713

hello everyone i'm barry darnell from

797
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,960
the red team village and today we are

798
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,560
here with omar santos from the red team

799
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,480
village as well as our guest ipsec from

800
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,280
hack the box

801
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:41,040
hey guys what's going on hello

802
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,040
uh ipsec hack the box has been a long

803
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:44,800
time supporter of the village

804
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,440
can you tell me more about the company

805
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,319
yeah um

806
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:50,640
hack the box is a hands-on security

807
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,240
training platform and our main goal is

808
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,599
to make good training

809
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:55,839
readily available to anyone in the world

810
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:58,079
if you're new to a topic or just the

811
00:42:58,079 --> 00:42:59,440
field in general we have

812
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,760
hack the box academy and it's a guided

813
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,359
learning experience which just means we

814
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:05,760
have written material in hands-on labs

815
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,280
and again when building this

816
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:10,160
accessibility was our number one desire

817
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:12,160
so we created the phone box which allows

818
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:13,760
you to have a

819
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,520
whole operating system in your browser

820
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,200
so the machine you're doing this

821
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,720
learning on doesn't even have to be

822
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:19,920
powerful you can do it on like a

823
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:20,640
chromebook

824
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,400
if for some reason you want to do it on

825
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,240
a phone you can i wouldn't recommend

826
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:25,040
that

827
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:26,880
but everything's done within a web

828
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,880
browser if you want to bring your own os

829
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,720
we also provide a vpn pack for you so

830
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,960
you can join your os to the vpn

831
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:35,520
and go on learning in addition to the

832
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,599
academy we have unguided learning which

833
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:39,200
is what we're most famous for

834
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,960
this is the weekly challenges machines

835
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:43,040
or entire like networks we put out on

836
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:43,920
the platform

837
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,680
and that we ask people not to publicly

838
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:47,280
talk about these challenges until they

839
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:48,079
retire

840
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:50,480
which is typically 20 weeks this is my

841
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:52,079
favorite and what i credit most of my

842
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:53,760
success to because it really enforces

843
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:55,760
building good social relationships

844
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,520
that not only help get you the help when

845
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,040
you need it but also

846
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:01,520
when teaching it often validates your

847
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:03,200
understanding of it and it's proven to

848
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,040
help memory retention

849
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:07,520
so i have a lot of friends from my in my

850
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,760
social network that include barry i met

851
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:10,079
him

852
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:12,400
through another friend who met him at

853
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,440
derby con which is

854
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,920
a similar event of red team village and

855
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,119
the funny thing is

856
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:19,200
both my other friend kyle and barry all

857
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,400
lived within like

858
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:23,599
30 miles of each other but we met like

859
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:25,760
hundreds of miles away so definitely

860
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,599
like

861
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:30,319
important to go view and travel and

862
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:31,760
experience the community because you'll

863
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:32,960
never know who you find

864
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:34,960
and how close people may be it's a small

865
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,720
world

866
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,240
absolutely i think we've all been cooped

867
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,079
up these last few months here i think a

868
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:41,520
lot of people are excited to go in

869
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:43,680
person to las vegas to attend defcon and

870
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:44,160
so

871
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:46,000
we're really excited to see some of our

872
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,240
old friends and make some new ones

873
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,319
speaking of of that community you know

874
00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:52,319
hack the box is a very vibrant community

875
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:53,520
both on their discord

876
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,200
as well as all over twitter can you tell

877
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:56,880
me a little bit more about the people

878
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,720
behind hack the box maybe some projects

879
00:44:58,720 --> 00:44:59,920
that you might be working on

880
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:02,480
yeah we have a innovation team that's

881
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:03,680
designed at like

882
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:06,640
pushing what we think is the limit so

883
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:08,480
typically most of our stuff is either a

884
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:10,240
docker or a vmware image

885
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,880
and the innovation team is looking into

886
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:14,560
google cloud aws

887
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:17,680
and azure to provide a pro lab called

888
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:18,000
black

889
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,319
sky which is just based upon those types

890
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:21,119
of features

891
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:22,960
so if you want to exploit im or do a lot

892
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:24,640
of those unique cloud things black sky

893
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:24,960
lab

894
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:27,440
is going to be that we also have as you

895
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:28,960
said the discord community we have

896
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,560
roadrunner who runs that

897
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,000
and they help provide a lot of good

898
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,319
support and just learning to anyone

899
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:37,040
in addition to a bunch of ctfs i think

900
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:39,040
we run the ctf like every other month or

901
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:41,920
something it's insane

902
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:44,720
well talking about the ctf and talking

903
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:45,839
about all the activities you know

904
00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:47,760
throughout the years you guys have

905
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:49,680
supported the red team village

906
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:52,000
tremendously so first of all thank you

907
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,040
and thank you hack the box so

908
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:57,119
one of i got a couple of questions right

909
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:59,040
so one of the questions is you know

910
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:01,599
what would you say that is the best part

911
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:03,200
about sponsoring

912
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:04,640
community efforts like the red team

913
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:06,560
village ctf this year

914
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:08,240
i mean obviously it helps the community

915
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:10,000
grow and most of my like

916
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
relationships i can credit almost all my

917
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,200
professional success

918
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,599
as to leeching off my friend's knowledge

919
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:17,680
because no one can know everything

920
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:19,440
and i can't speak for anyone i hack the

921
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:20,720
box but i know

922
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:22,640
a bunch of my friends at hack the box

923
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:24,720
are super excited to play a ctf built by

924
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:26,880
other people and we've played the red

925
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:28,000
team village cts for

926
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,560
quite a while um i vaguely remember one

927
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:31,760
i think two years ago

928
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:33,839
that involved exploiting a printer which

929
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:35,200
was new to all of us

930
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:38,400
we were all like big um binary exploit

931
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:39,520
people and then it threw a different

932
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:41,280
architecture at us that we never really

933
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:43,200
experimented with and it was just a lot

934
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:44,480
of fun to play

935
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:47,680
so super excited to sponsor an event

936
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:49,359
that we can participate in

937
00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:51,359
and learn new things to hopefully put

938
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:53,280
out on our platform in the future

939
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,599
thank you appreciate that i think that

940
00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:56,400
you're hitting

941
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,480
my next question which is why do you

942
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:00,400
think sponsoring the

943
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,079
the wrething village this year is so

944
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:04,160
important for the community

945
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:08,839
yeah um number one it's important to

946
00:47:08,839 --> 00:47:12,000
like with covet and all we want to

947
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,359
increase our socialization and

948
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:15,119
everything we've been all cooped up

949
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:17,680
and the red team village incorporates

950
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:18,960
all of hack the boxes

951
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,240
things the main thing was being

952
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:22,559
accessible um if you can't travel you

953
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:24,559
can do it online and form a team

954
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:26,800
and additionally if you want it's

955
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:28,559
available for the high cost of zero

956
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:29,520
dollars which

957
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:31,680
aligns with kind of our methodology and

958
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:32,640
what we want

959
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:34,640
all our machines are available for free

960
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:36,079
for a time and then once they retire

961
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:37,119
then you have to pay

962
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:39,359
a small fee to gain access to it because

963
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:40,880
hosting 150

964
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:43,119
images permanently would just be

965
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:45,680
expensive can't do that for free

966
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:47,440
additionally i believe infosec is a

967
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:49,200
unique profession where team building

968
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,079
activities have

969
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:52,240
immeasurable impact if you look at the

970
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:53,839
non-intersect teams

971
00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:55,520
they still do team building activities

972
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:57,040
like you have that gimmicky trust fall

973
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,800
and escape room etc

974
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:00,800
and they're doing them just to help

975
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:02,160
build that social bond between

976
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:03,760
co-workers so you know it's valuable

977
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:05,359
since that's the only thing they care

978
00:48:05,359 --> 00:48:06,079
about

979
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:08,400
in the infosec world we have ctfs that

980
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,480
is just like that on steroids

981
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:12,319
it has all that same social bonding

982
00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:14,160
benefits like i mentioned earlier

983
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:17,119
i play cts with barry i've played cts

984
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:19,200
with oxdf mr ben

985
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:20,960
john hammond a bunch of people i just

986
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:22,319
have a lot of fun with playing these

987
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:24,800
ctfs along with coworkers

988
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:27,520
and in addition to that social bond that

989
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:28,559
you build

990
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:30,319
it also gives you a lot of techniques

991
00:48:30,319 --> 00:48:31,839
that you may be able to immediately

992
00:48:31,839 --> 00:48:34,000
provide your work value because

993
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,079
you're joining hands with a bunch of

994
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:38,160
other companies to learn things

995
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:40,400
it wouldn't surprise me if you do the

996
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:41,760
ctf and then

997
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:43,119
find something you can immediately turn

998
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:45,040
around to do on your job

999
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:47,200
i remember doing almost any pro lab i'll

1000
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:48,880
use offer as an example where the

1001
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:51,119
foothold involves exploiting splunk

1002
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:53,520
and i had a pen test that i kept missing

1003
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:55,359
this vector on because i just didn't

1004
00:48:55,359 --> 00:48:58,000
know it and mr ben put it in that prolab

1005
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,440
so when i did that it was just like an

1006
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:01,520
eye-opening thing of oh god what have i

1007
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:02,559
been missing

1008
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:05,440
so definitely the big social aspect is

1009
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:06,640
huge here

1010
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:09,839
awesome and and i couldn't agree more

1011
00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:11,520
and once again you know thank you i have

1012
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:12,880
one more last question

1013
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:15,119
when it's around the benefits that your

1014
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:17,280
team actually will receive

1015
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:19,200
by participating at the you know that

1016
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:22,000
con red team village ctf this year

1017
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,760
yeah um hack the box and red team

1018
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:26,000
village are almost anonymous and what we

1019
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:26,640
provide

1020
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:29,839
and our methodologies so the only

1021
00:49:29,839 --> 00:49:31,119
unfortunate thing is the red team

1022
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:33,440
village ctf is a yearly thing while hack

1023
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:35,359
the box produces new things on a weekly

1024
00:49:35,359 --> 00:49:36,240
basis

1025
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,000
it's probably not to the scale that red

1026
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,440
team village will be doing just because

1027
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:40,559
it's constant

1028
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:42,640
but if you're itching to do more after

1029
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:44,319
doing the ctf definitely check out the

1030
00:49:44,319 --> 00:49:46,000
platform if you haven't

1031
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,680
and go over to hack the box because i'm

1032
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:48,960

1033
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:50,240

1059
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:39,440
the question to give some background

1060
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:41,040
but i guess how did you get started in

1061
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:42,559
your career matt

1062
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:45,839
so i was a help desk analyst that was

1063
00:50:45,839 --> 00:50:46,800
slowly trying to move

1064
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,640
up towards i.t and everything like that

1065
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:50,640
i had a bit of a background in security

1066
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:54,880
based from college and ironically

1067
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:57,839
at the time when i was transitioning uh

1068
00:50:57,839 --> 00:50:58,559
the company

1069
00:50:58,559 --> 00:50:59,680
was working for got hit with some

1070
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:01,920
ransomware and because you know

1071
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:03,119
very few people had a bit of a

1072
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:04,720
background in that i was kind of tasked

1073
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:06,240
and realized you know things are going

1074
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:07,040
on

1075
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:08,960
and just started doing mitigation and

1076
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:10,640
everything like that and then

1077
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:12,800
it was like this layer effect of as we

1078
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:14,079
were pulling things apart like we didn't

1079
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:14,880
have an ir

1080
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:16,800
procedure anything like that basic

1081
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:17,839
things and i started having these

1082
00:51:17,839 --> 00:51:18,960
conversations with

1083
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:20,800
people way way above my pay grade that

1084
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:22,319
we need to have this stuff

1085
00:51:22,319 --> 00:51:25,359
and the kind of a thing was like oh you

1086
00:51:25,359 --> 00:51:26,720
you sound smart like you sound like you

1087
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:28,240
know what you're doing with this so i

1088
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:29,920
started getting some support there

1089
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,960
and then eventually as i was learning

1090
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:34,000
more and more

1091
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,359
um i felt like you know the you know the

1092
00:51:37,359 --> 00:51:39,520
policy-based earth sort of things that i

1093
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:41,359
was used to reading out of a textbook in

1094
00:51:41,359 --> 00:51:42,160
college

1095
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:43,520
wasn't really the thing i really liked

1096
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:45,200
like you know the ctfs that we used to

1097
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:46,160
do and all

1098
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:48,079
the hands-on stuff so i really started

1099
00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:49,200
getting into looking at

1100
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:50,960
pen testing now there was no there was

1101
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:52,559
no like free service back then

1102
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:54,400
everything was vuln images or anything

1103
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:54,960
like that

1104
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:57,440
it's really practice so in my evenings

1105
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:59,280
and stuff i was teaching myself real

1106
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:00,960
life practical cases using

1107
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:04,480
those vulnerable isos sql injection or

1108
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:06,000
anything like that

1109
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,079
and then eventually i got my off an

1110
00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:09,040
offer to go

1111
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:10,880
work from a first pen testing firm a

1112
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:12,240
consulting firm up here

1113
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:14,640
in canada and at that point i just you

1114
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:16,319
know kind of went from there to meeting

1115
00:52:16,319 --> 00:52:17,440
a bunch of people

1116
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:20,000
local people where uh we were all kind

1117
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,119
of focused on

1118
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:23,040
you know growing our skill trade and you

1119
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:24,720
know we all studied together

1120
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:26,559
we eventually did the oscp and at that

1121
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:29,280
point we just kept on going and going

1122
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:30,559
that's how i got started is a very

1123
00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:33,680
long-winded way of going

1124
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:35,440
that's awesome i'll go ahead and pass it

1125
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:38,160
over to milas now

1126
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:40,160
sure thanks so much and uh hopefully

1127
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:41,920
folks can hear me okay i'll apologize

1128
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:43,839
for uh for having to take this call

1129
00:52:43,839 --> 00:52:47,520
uh on on the road uh unfortunately so

1130
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:49,680
um security for me was always kind of a

1131
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:51,359
passion um i almost

1132
00:52:51,359 --> 00:52:53,599
went into physics and then i met with

1133
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:55,119
the head professor of physics at my

1134
00:52:55,119 --> 00:52:56,800
local university

1135
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:59,200
um who steered me into another another

1136
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:00,000
career direction

1137
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,359
if i kind of wanted to look at something

1138
00:53:01,359 --> 00:53:03,119
that was relatively profitable but

1139
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:04,160
i really was kind of interested in

1140
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:06,319
security in my early teens

1141
00:53:06,319 --> 00:53:08,079
kind of a lot of people you know i just

1142
00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:10,160
missed the bbs era so it was a lot of

1143
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:11,920
kind of like finding like websites

1144
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:13,520
finding irc servers hanging out with

1145
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:14,480
people

1146
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:15,599
and i just kind of started building on

1147
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:17,440
my knowledge set that way i ended up

1148
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:17,920
doing

1149
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:19,839
in undergrad and information security as

1150
00:53:19,839 --> 00:53:21,040
well which

1151
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:23,599
i did here locally in canada which was

1152
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:25,119
really good to reinforce

1153
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:27,359
skill set capabilities and to kind of

1154
00:53:27,359 --> 00:53:28,640
put myself on the map and

1155
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:30,000
started working kind of full-time in the

1156
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,480
industry as uh

1157
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:34,079
as i was still finishing my undergrad

1158
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:35,680
and the rest is history just kind of

1159
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:37,119
getting more and more into the security

1160
00:53:37,119 --> 00:53:39,280
space always had a passion for offense

1161
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:43,040
um here we are today

1162
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:46,319
gene do you want to go ahead and uh

1163
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:49,119
sure so uh it all started for me

1164
00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:49,760
basically

1165
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:52,960
when i was uh leaving school i got hired

1166
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:55,280
in a belgian service provider and i

1167
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:56,960
started out as a system engineer

1168
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:59,599
so yeah basically i i did networking

1169
00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:00,400
stuff

1170
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:04,400
but uh my my primary duty basically was

1171
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:06,079
was accepting tickets so it was also

1172
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:08,240
like kind of a service desk role

1173
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:10,559
but i got quite tedious for me and it

1174
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:12,000
was a lot of repetition as well

1175
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,040
which i um started noticing as time went

1176
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:15,520
on

1177
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:17,359
so i started automating a lot of stuff

1178
00:54:17,359 --> 00:54:19,280
in my job because well

1179
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:20,960
it's you see the same things coming over

1180
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:22,559
and over again and you start

1181
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:24,880
making them automatically so you do save

1182
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:26,000
a lot of time

1183
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,119
which gave me two options either uh

1184
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:31,520
do nothing all day get paid and and be

1185
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:33,440
happy and just move on with my life

1186
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:35,839
or level up my own skills and that's

1187
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:36,559
what i did

1188
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:39,119
so i already had that system engineering

1189
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:39,920
background

1190
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:42,240
and i started learning about pen testing

1191
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:43,200
and network

1192
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:46,079
attacks and then basically i got hired

1193
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:47,680
by a consulting firm here in belgium

1194
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:49,440
called inviso

1195
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:50,960
and because i was already a system

1196
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:52,160
engineer and had that networking

1197
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:53,119
experience

1198
00:54:53,119 --> 00:54:55,040
it kind of makes sense for me to to do

1199
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:57,359
the network infrastructure engagements

1200
00:54:57,359 --> 00:55:00,640
um based on my experience so i started

1201
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:03,040
as a network fan tester basically so

1202
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:04,960
i could blouse bloodhound and just scan

1203
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:06,880
networks for for exploits and

1204
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:08,880
start pruning stuff but then as time

1205
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:10,400
went on and customers got more and more

1206
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:11,440
mature i started

1207
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:13,119
going and transitioning into red teaming

1208
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:14,720
and purple teaming as well so that's

1209
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:18,000
how it went for me that's awesome

1210
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,520
uh and then i guess it would be awful

1211
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:20,880
helpful to have each of you guys

1212
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:22,319
introduce yourself so i'm sorry for

1213
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:23,680
skipping that question

1214
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:25,359
um i'll have matt go ahead and injure

1215
00:55:25,359 --> 00:55:26,799
yourself and then milos and then g

1216
00:55:26,799 --> 00:55:28,640
next to kind of give everyone an idea of

1217
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:30,319
where you guys are at now versus how you

1218
00:55:30,319 --> 00:55:31,680
kind of got started

1219
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:34,880

big part of

1230
00:55:51,359 --> 00:55:53,440

our cyber analytics team which is

1246
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:30,240
largely grounded in machine learning and

1247
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:31,440
data science as well as our threat

1248
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:32,000

builds kind of thing to

1258
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,920
to figure out whether or not we should

1259
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:54,240
buy tools or build tours ourselves

1260
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:56,880
uh so yeah i i lead red teams from a

1261
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:58,720
technical point of view

1262
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:00,720
and i'm also a sans instructor so i also

1263

teach a sans course

1264
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:05,440
699 which is the purple theming one so

1265
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:08,640
yeah that's a bit about me

1266
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:12,400
yeah those are awesome jobs uh the next

1267
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:14,000
question that i have for you guys

1268
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,319
is to kind of see what kind of tools you

1269
00:57:16,319 --> 00:57:17,200
guys like the most

1270
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:18,880
in your tool set so what are your goals

1271
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:20,960
go-to tools on any engagements you guys

1272
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:21,760
are doing

1273
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:26,640
or anything along those lines

1274
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:30,319
oh thank you uh so i as much as i like

1275
00:57:30,319 --> 00:57:31,680
to say i have a tool set and stuff i

1276
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:32,799
really do try to keep

1277
00:57:32,799 --> 00:57:34,960
the mindset of you know there's no such

1278
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:36,720
thing as a one tool that fits every you

1279
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:37,200
know

1280
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:39,839
solution uh every time you go up against

1281
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:42,079
any type of environment or situation

1282
00:57:42,079 --> 00:57:43,119
you're always gonna have to be very

1283
00:57:43,119 --> 00:57:44,000
fluid

1284
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,799
uh so the ones that with that in that

1285
00:57:46,799 --> 00:57:48,400
mind the ones that i normally go to you

1286
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:49,440
know obviously

1287
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:51,280
i mean for command and control i'm a

1288
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:52,480
huge uh

1289
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:57,520
cobalt strike um user as well as

1290
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:59,040
you know a lot of the open source tools

1291
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:01,200
i've developed such as scarecrow

1292
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:03,599
um and a few others from that type of

1293
00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:05,520
perspective of going back around

1294
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:08,480
the ones i say i commonly use uh

1295
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:10,559
anything where between something like uh

1296
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:12,000
say a version of safety cats or

1297
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,400
something that dumps uh lsas like sharp

1298
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,319
dump

1299
00:58:16,319 --> 00:58:18,079
ranging towards some more stuff about

1300
00:58:18,079 --> 00:58:20,160
you know uh recon

1301
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:21,839
such as tools like you know bloodhound

1302
00:58:21,839 --> 00:58:23,599
is great uh vibe

1303
00:58:23,599 --> 00:58:26,319
if you're not familiar with that one um

1304
00:58:26,319 --> 00:58:27,599
personally my favorite when it comes

1305
00:58:27,599 --> 00:58:29,680
down to domain reconnaissance

1306
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:32,079
um but once again like i said i really

1307
00:58:32,079 --> 00:58:33,200
am someone that

1308
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:35,599
believes that customization is the best

1309
00:58:35,599 --> 00:58:37,119
thing to do it so i'll often take some

1310
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:38,880
tools down and kind of

1311
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:40,960
re-modify them and change them up so

1312
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:42,960
they're very different

1313
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:44,720
just for a high level success and

1314
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:46,559
everything like that so i you know i

1315
00:58:46,559 --> 00:58:48,079
might take some standard tools or you

1316
00:58:48,079 --> 00:58:50,319
know the latest

1317
00:58:50,319 --> 00:58:52,400
techniques or ttps that have come out

1318
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:54,160
i'll try to modify them so they really

1319
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:55,839
are different than what everyone else is

1320
00:58:55,839 --> 00:58:56,559
using

1321
00:58:56,559 --> 00:58:58,000
i hope i mean and that didn't really

1322
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,440
answer the question but that's just my

1323
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:02,640
personal belief around tooling

1324
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:05,440
yeah i got i'm going to echo a lot of

1325
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:06,799
the same of what matthew's saying

1326
00:59:06,799 --> 00:59:09,119
uh there's definitely like stable tools

1327
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:10,319
that i think any kind of

1328
00:59:10,319 --> 00:59:12,720
offensive team will probably leverage

1329
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:14,160
but the tools that you leverage and the

1330
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:15,599
tactics and the techniques and

1331
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:18,319
procedures are informed by um

1332
00:59:18,319 --> 00:59:19,839
the situation that you're in right so

1333
00:59:19,839 --> 00:59:20,880
what's the environment that you're

1334
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:22,400
targeting what kind of trade craft does

1335
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:24,400
it warrant for utilization so

1336
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:26,319
i mean yeah from a c2 perspective on

1337
00:59:26,319 --> 00:59:28,400
windows side uh cobalt strike is

1338
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:30,160
is a pretty standard stable for for a

1339
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:31,440
lot of folks

1340
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:33,040
over on mac and linux you've got kind of

1341
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:34,480
some other open source options that you

1342
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:36,480
can do custom development on top of

1343
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:38,720
um outside of that it is a lot of really

1344
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:40,240
kind of adapting to

1345
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:41,839
to the environment that you're targeting

1346
00:59:41,839 --> 00:59:43,520
and developing custom tooling

1347
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:45,599
to evade modern tech stacks or modern

1348
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:47,200
security controls

1349
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:49,119
depending upon what crosses your path

1350
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:50,480
right so if you're navigating an

1351
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:52,079
organization that uses one or multiple

1352
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:53,200
edr's

1353
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:54,640
maybe you're looking at techniques to

1354
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:56,079
get into kernel mode load your own

1355
00:59:56,079 --> 00:59:58,000
drivers you know kill some kernel

1356
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,760
callbacks that are happening

1357
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:01,280
it really just kind of depends on what

1358
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:02,880
you see ahead of you and of course

1359
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:04,079
there's always the notion of kind of

1360
01:00:04,079 --> 01:00:06,079
tempering tradecraft to the defensive

1361
01:00:06,079 --> 01:00:06,799
team

1362
01:00:06,799 --> 01:00:08,640
um that you were going up against as

1363
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:10,079
well

1364
01:00:10,079 --> 01:00:11,839
ideally red teaming should be a process

1365
01:00:11,839 --> 01:00:13,680
of kind of sparring between offensive

1366
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:15,440
and defense and not necessarily

1367
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:17,440
um just a process of sort of red team

1368
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:18,400
kind of coming through like a

1369
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:19,280
steamroller

1370
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:22,480
um and targeting targeting objectives

1371
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:23,920
with kind of leaving the blue team

1372
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:25,040
entirely behind so i would say

1373
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:26,400
tradecraft depends on

1374
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:28,559
what you're trying to do and also the

1375
01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:30,559
the level of capability for the existing

1376
01:00:30,559 --> 01:00:32,319
blue team in the organization that

1377
01:00:32,319 --> 01:00:33,210
you're working within

1378
01:00:33,210 --> 01:00:35,440
[Music]

1379
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:37,839
yeah i think from my side i very much

1380
01:00:37,839 --> 01:00:39,119
resonate with what

1381
01:00:39,119 --> 01:00:40,960
what has already been said right it all

1382
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:42,640
depends on the organization you're

1383
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:43,520
facing

1384
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:45,760
uh if you're facing a mature client

1385
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:46,720
you're probably

1386
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:49,680
not wanting to blast bloodhounds all

1387
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:50,480
over the place

1388
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:51,839
because that will probably get you

1389
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:54,400
caught so it really all depends

1390
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:56,400
on on your maturity level and what

1391
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:57,520
you're facing

1392
01:00:57,520 --> 01:01:00,799
uh i do hear cobalt strikes

1393
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:02,400
being mentioned a lot it's exactly the

1394
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:04,799
same for me we use global strike as well

1395
01:01:04,799 --> 01:01:05,839
just because a lot of

1396
01:01:05,839 --> 01:01:07,760
adversaries like real life adversaries

1397
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:10,240
use it so it makes sense that we kind of

1398
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:11,520
emulate that

1399
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:14,640
but we also look into some more uh quote

1400
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:16,160
unquote obscure

1401
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:18,720
c2 frameworks that are not that well

1402
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:20,880
known yet such as for example a brute

1403
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:22,559
rato from paranoid ninja

1404
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:25,520
and i heard that mdsec is probably on

1405
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:27,280
the verge of launching their uh

1406
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:29,839
their own c2 implant as well so we're

1407
01:01:29,839 --> 01:01:30,640
probably going to

1408
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:32,480
start looking into that when that

1409
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:33,920
releases just to see

1410
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:36,480
what it's all about uh and yeah it's

1411
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:37,680
very much as

1412
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:39,839
has already been mentioned it's about

1413
01:01:39,839 --> 01:01:41,760
modifying the already existing tooling

1414
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:42,319
out there

1415
01:01:42,319 --> 01:01:43,920
you don't necessarily have to reinvent

1416
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:45,839
the wheel if you just know your way a

1417
01:01:45,839 --> 01:01:46,559
bit around

1418
01:01:46,559 --> 01:01:48,559
obfuscation and just replacing certain

1419
01:01:48,559 --> 01:01:50,079
strings you can break a lot of

1420
01:01:50,079 --> 01:01:51,280
detections already

1421
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:53,920
so yeah it comes down to what you're

1422
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:55,359
facing and it comes down to your own

1423
01:01:55,359 --> 01:01:56,160
skills as well

1424
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:58,079
whether or not you're able to create

1425
01:01:58,079 --> 01:01:59,359
your own tooling uh

1426
01:01:59,359 --> 01:02:01,280
how much time you have and yeah whether

1427
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:02,880
or not you can obfuscate or

1428
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:05,119
just stringly place basically uh stuff

1429
01:02:05,119 --> 01:02:08,400
to to just break signatures

1430
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:09,920
that's awesome and i know jean that you

1431
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:12,240
said that you have a workshop coming up

1432
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:13,440
in just a few minutes so i know you have

1433
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:14,640
to drop earlier

1434
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:15,760
so do you want to go ahead and kind of

1435
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:17,200
tell everyone about the workshop before

1436
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:18,079
you do have to drop

1437
01:02:18,079 --> 01:02:21,520
and speak yeah sure so uh i'll be i'll

1438
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:22,400
be doing

1439
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:24,559
a live workshop at the the adversary

1440
01:02:24,559 --> 01:02:25,920
emulation village so

1441
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:27,680
it's uh like the the friend the friendly

1442
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:29,760
village that is just uh nearby

1443
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:31,680
so i'll be doing a live workshop there

1444
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:33,599
about c sharp basically

1445
01:02:33,599 --> 01:02:36,480
it's a very accessible workshop so i

1446
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:38,160
tried to make it as accessible as

1447
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:39,520
possible so even if you

1448
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:41,359
have never played around with c sharp

1449
01:02:41,359 --> 01:02:43,760
before you should probably be able to

1450
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,839
at least understand what the what's

1451
01:02:45,839 --> 01:02:47,119
going on there

1452
01:02:47,119 --> 01:02:49,280
and it's also it also has its own

1453
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:51,200
workbook where you can do some exercises

1454
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:51,920
as well

1455
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:53,920
and it's about reflection basically so

1456
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:55,440
we're leveraging the uh

1457
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:57,760
dc sharp or the net frameworks built-in

1458
01:02:57,760 --> 01:02:59,280
reflection capabilities

1459
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:01,280
to create some loaders and basically

1460
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:02,799
expand upon them

1461
01:03:02,799 --> 01:03:04,720
so we start with a very very simple one

1462
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:06,319
that is just loading another

1463
01:03:06,319 --> 01:03:08,559
c-sharp assembly from disk and then we

1464
01:03:08,559 --> 01:03:10,880
expand that to also be able to fetch it

1465
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:13,520
from the internet do some amsean etw

1466
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:16,559
bypasses and all that good stuff

1467
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:18,400
wow that's that's awesome i'd recommend

1468
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:19,680
anyone who's watching right now

1469
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:21,280
definitely go to that workshop

1470
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:22,480
definitely get some good information out

1471
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:24,240
of that obviously sharp

1472
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:27,280
uh with c-sharp sorry um

1473
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:29,520
gene if you need to drop you're welcome

1474
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:31,200
to drop it i will be uh i will be

1475
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:32,559
dropping now so uh

1476
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:34,160
thanks for having me so much for coming

1477
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:35,680
on today as well see you around

1478
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:39,839
bye bye uh so uh milos and matt the next

1479
01:03:39,839 --> 01:03:40,319
question

1480
01:03:40,319 --> 01:03:41,920
i have for you guys is kind of what do

1481
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:43,280
you recommend for anyone who's

1482
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:44,319
interested

1483
01:03:44,319 --> 01:03:46,240
and i know obviously like you can't just

1484
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:47,680
like jump into red teaming but if

1485
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:48,160
somebody

1486
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:50,240
wanted to kind of go towards that path

1487
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:51,200
what would you recommend

1488
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:53,039
for them to kind of get started and what

1489
01:03:53,039 --> 01:03:54,559
should they do to kind of work towards

1490
01:03:54,559 --> 01:03:58,160
up to that path so pass it to matt first

1491
01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:01,599
sure so um i would say um

1492
01:04:01,599 --> 01:04:03,920
and i i think it's pretty much the best

1493
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:05,599
way to describe the difference first

1494
01:04:05,599 --> 01:04:08,319
uh between pen testing and red teaming

1495
01:04:08,319 --> 01:04:09,839
you know pen testing is you're pulling

1496
01:04:09,839 --> 01:04:11,359
every trick out of trade and kind of

1497
01:04:11,359 --> 01:04:12,480
throwing it at the wall and seeing what

1498
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:14,559
sticks whereas with red teaming it's

1499
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:15,680
more of a surgical

1500
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:18,559
knife cutting through and it's very

1501
01:04:18,559 --> 01:04:19,680
focused on stealth

1502
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:22,240
so um trying to get into pen testing i

1503
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:23,440
would say the first thing you got to

1504
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:24,720
learn is the core found

1505
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:27,119
foundations understanding having a good

1506
01:04:27,119 --> 01:04:28,640
solid background into you know

1507
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:32,000
active directory windows environments um

1508
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,160
is pretty much a critical i would say

1509
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:36,000
scripting next

1510
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,319
um different languages can be very

1511
01:04:38,319 --> 01:04:39,599
useful

1512
01:04:39,599 --> 01:04:41,599
but really having those is a big

1513
01:04:41,599 --> 01:04:43,440
foundation and as you transition

1514
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:44,799
as you kind of mention from you know

1515
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:46,640
it's not just you know a direct

1516
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:48,720
bee line to read to me but as you go

1517
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:49,920
down that path

1518
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:51,359
you'll start to get really passionate

1519
01:04:51,359 --> 01:04:53,039
about things and also

1520
01:04:53,039 --> 01:04:55,200
trying to improve your trade craft uh

1521
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:56,319
one of the best and the biggest things

1522
01:04:56,319 --> 01:04:57,839
when people ask me about red teaming is

1523
01:04:57,839 --> 01:04:59,359
is that you know if you're a solid pen

1524
01:04:59,359 --> 01:05:01,440
tester for x amount of years

1525
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:03,520
the next step is challenge yourself take

1526
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:04,720
your same techniques

1527
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:06,640
the same way you're executing things but

1528
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:08,160
see how you can improve upon them

1529
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:09,760
we kind of mentioned a lot here about

1530
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:11,520
customization and you know

1531
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:13,680
removing strings and stuff but taking

1532
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:15,359
the challenge to say that

1533
01:05:15,359 --> 01:05:17,599
i want to rebuild you know if i rely on

1534
01:05:17,599 --> 01:05:18,400
say tool

1535
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:21,039
x a lot and it does something well what

1536
01:05:21,039 --> 01:05:22,000
are the artifacts

1537
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,079
or something like that how can i improve

1538
01:05:24,079 --> 01:05:25,920
on it so that way i'm more invasive

1539
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:27,359
that i'm not i'm being more i'm still

1540
01:05:27,359 --> 01:05:28,960
having that same high level of success

1541
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:29,920
but now

1542
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:31,680
i'm focusing not just on that success

1543
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:33,920
vector but on that invisibility vector

1544
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:34,559
when we start

1545
01:05:34,559 --> 01:05:36,079
adding those two it's almost a blended

1546
01:05:36,079 --> 01:05:38,480
approach you get this very very

1547
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:40,400
strong background and you start to learn

1548
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:42,240
and it just kind of opens up doors

1549
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:45,280
and knowledge um that kind of just

1550
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:46,559
springboards you once you start down

1551
01:05:46,559 --> 01:05:47,280
that path

1552
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:48,960
you kind of go into a different whole

1553
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:51,599
other gear the best way i can describe

1554
01:05:51,599 --> 01:05:53,119
what to recommend is just constantly

1555
01:05:53,119 --> 01:05:54,559
learn and try to improve on your trade

1556
01:05:54,559 --> 01:05:55,680
craft

1557
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:57,039
starting with the fundamentals and then

1558
01:05:57,039 --> 01:06:00,880
adding on complexity

1559
01:06:03,119 --> 01:06:04,799
yeah so i think i think from my

1560
01:06:04,799 --> 01:06:06,480
perspective a lot of the same

1561
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:09,280
i mean there's a couple of factors right

1562
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:10,880
so if you're kind of already

1563
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:14,000
in security um then maybe maybe your

1564
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,760
road to moving towards red team or

1565
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:17,200
towards the offensive space would be a

1566
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:19,280
little bit different

1567
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:20,640
i would say if you're someone who isn't

1568
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:22,319
in security at all and you're looking to

1569
01:06:22,319 --> 01:06:23,599
kind of reach into

1570
01:06:23,599 --> 01:06:25,440
that environment i think defcon has a

1571
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:27,680
lot of really good local communities

1572
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:29,039
where you can start bridging connections

1573
01:06:29,039 --> 01:06:30,720
with people who are in the industry a

1574
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:33,520
lot of fairly large cities have their

1575
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:35,119
own sort of user groups or interest

1576
01:06:35,119 --> 01:06:36,880
groups that are focused on security

1577
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:38,079
you can kind of start getting your feet

1578
01:06:38,079 --> 01:06:40,880
wet outside of that there's plenty of

1579
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:42,799
free online material that you can learn

1580
01:06:42,799 --> 01:06:44,960
from to give you some sort of basis and

1581
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:46,480
understanding like

1582
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:49,680
um to really just calibrate your compass

1583
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:51,280
and set your bearings in terms of what

1584
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:53,440
direction you want to go in or to learn

1585
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:54,720
for cyber security

1586
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:56,400
um if you're if you're already in

1587
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:58,240
offense and or you're in cyber security

1588
01:06:58,240 --> 01:06:59,359
you want to kind of move into the

1589
01:06:59,359 --> 01:07:01,760
direction of red teaming

1590
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:03,039
it's kind of an interesting question i

1591
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:05,440
mean i think certain certain skill sets

1592
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:07,039
within red teaming are conducive to

1593
01:07:07,039 --> 01:07:08,240
bringing someone in who

1594
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:09,920
who doesn't necessarily have an

1595
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:11,440
offensive background and kind of

1596
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:12,880
allowing them to work with it and they

1597
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:14,960
can

1598
01:07:27,119 --> 01:07:28,960
custom implants loaders malware or

1599
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:30,319
whatever it may be

1600
01:07:30,319 --> 01:07:32,079
and then at the same time upskilling

1601
01:07:32,079 --> 01:07:34,240
them with red team skill sets and better

1602
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:35,760
understanding of target environments

1603
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:37,599
that people come across invariably

1604
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:40,240
that you need to intersect i think most

1605
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:41,200
people

1606
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:43,200
who are in red keeping and kind of been

1607
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:44,240
in this field or

1608
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:45,680
doing this type of offensive security

1609
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:47,119
for some time have done your typical

1610
01:07:47,119 --> 01:07:47,680
kind of

1611
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:49,440
you know vulnerability assessment to

1612
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:51,280
penetration testing to penetration

1613
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:52,720
testing with social engineering

1614
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:54,160
so then eventually doing something

1615
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:56,000
called called red teaming

1616
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,599
you know while the trade craft may be

1617
01:07:57,599 --> 01:07:59,520
similar the goals objectives

1618
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:01,760
and purpose of those two exercises are

1619
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:02,960
entirely different and they don't

1620
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:04,319
necessarily intersect

1621
01:08:04,319 --> 01:08:06,720
um as much as people might think but i i

1622
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:08,240
think that the past really kind of

1623
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:11,119
depends on where someone's starting from

1624
01:08:11,119 --> 01:08:13,599
um in terms of bettering yourself and

1625
01:08:13,599 --> 01:08:15,440
preparing yourselves to become

1626
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:17,279
a more effective red team it is really

1627
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:19,279
about this this ability to

1628
01:08:19,279 --> 01:08:22,158
assimilate information quickly and then

1629
01:08:22,158 --> 01:08:23,040
adapt to

1630
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:24,799
unexpected obstacles right so matthew

1631
01:08:24,799 --> 01:08:26,319
talks about this notion of like

1632
01:08:26,319 --> 01:08:28,640
upscaling your tradecraft like there are

1633
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:30,319
stable tools that we use but you know

1634
01:08:30,319 --> 01:08:31,759
peel those covers back start to

1635
01:08:31,759 --> 01:08:33,120
understand how they operate

1636
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:35,120
um when you begin to understand the

1637
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:36,238
fundamentals of

1638
01:08:36,238 --> 01:08:38,238
you know operating systems that most

1639
01:08:38,238 --> 01:08:39,839
retainers are targeting these days it

1640
01:08:39,839 --> 01:08:41,279
really starts to level

1641
01:08:41,279 --> 01:08:42,880
your horizon and allows you to better

1642
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:44,560
understand where is the current trade

1643
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:45,839
craft developed where are things

1644
01:08:45,839 --> 01:08:47,439
focusing why are they focusing in that

1645
01:08:47,439 --> 01:08:48,799
direction

1646
01:08:48,799 --> 01:08:50,238
and that really kind of allows you to

1647
01:08:50,238 --> 01:08:52,158
get a better idea of where things may go

1648
01:08:52,158 --> 01:08:52,960
in the future

1649
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:55,120
and also to better understand you know

1650
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:56,640
what kind of ioc's

1651
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:59,279
um or indicators does your tradecraft

1652
01:08:59,279 --> 01:09:00,319
leave behind

1653
01:09:00,319 --> 01:09:01,520
really allowing you to be more

1654
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:03,679
comprehensive from both offensive and

1655
01:09:03,679 --> 01:09:05,839
independent detection or detective

1656
01:09:05,839 --> 01:09:07,198
perspective so

1657
01:09:07,198 --> 01:09:08,479
i know it's not really an answer to the

1658
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:09,679
question because it's a difficult

1659
01:09:09,679 --> 01:09:10,719
question to answer i would say it

1660
01:09:10,719 --> 01:09:12,319
depends where you're starting from

1661
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:13,679
um but if you're starting from ground

1662
01:09:13,679 --> 01:09:15,198
zero you don't have you're not in this

1663
01:09:15,198 --> 01:09:16,158
industry at all

1664
01:09:16,158 --> 01:09:17,759
um you want to kind of start to meet

1665
01:09:17,759 --> 01:09:20,880
some people almost

1666
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:27,359
um twitter is another good place to

1667
01:09:27,359 --> 01:09:29,920
start getting some decent information

1668
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:32,238
through a little bit of unnecessary data

1669
01:09:32,238 --> 01:09:34,319
but it is a good place to get some good

1670
01:09:34,319 --> 01:09:35,520
information and then if you're in the

1671
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:37,679
industry it's really just about

1672
01:09:37,679 --> 01:09:39,439
you know constantly pushing and learning

1673
01:09:39,439 --> 01:09:41,520
and going deeper and understanding

1674
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:42,960
more fundamentals around the operating

1675
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:44,560
systems that you're targeting how they

1676
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:47,040
function why do they function that

1677
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:49,359
and way and that in and of itself will

1678
01:09:49,359 --> 01:09:50,880
bring ideas to you in terms of future

1679
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:52,158
tradecraft development

1680
01:09:52,158 --> 01:10:02,400
better understanding tradecraft um so

1681
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:03,440
both of you guys what you just kind of

1682
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:04,880
went through i think that was honestly

1683
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:06,320
like really good information for anyone

1684
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:08,239
who's watching to kind of like take away

1685
01:10:08,239 --> 01:10:09,920
uh because you can't stress enough that

1686
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:11,520
you can't just kind of like jump into

1687
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:13,280
red teaming or pen testing

1688
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:14,880
you kind of have to build and have a

1689
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:16,640
foundation and

1690
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:17,920
kind of build your way up to that kind

1691
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:20,400
of path uh it's not just something that

1692
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:23,520
you just jump right into so both milos

1693
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:24,400
and matt's advice

1694
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:25,679
is definitely a good advice to kind of

1695
01:10:25,679 --> 01:10:28,080
take from um so we're kind of wrapping

1696
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:29,679
up with the questions now and i just

1697
01:10:29,679 --> 01:10:31,120
kind of wanted to ask milos and matt if

1698
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:32,080
there's anything else

1699
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:33,520
that you guys kind of wanted to bring up

1700
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:36,239
before we end the interview

1701
01:10:36,239 --> 01:10:38,159
um we do appreciate having you guys on

1702
01:10:38,159 --> 01:10:39,520
so i'll kind of pass it back to see if

1703
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:40,560
you guys have anything else that you

1704
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:44,960
want to mention

1705
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:47,840
i mean you want to go first

1706
01:10:52,719 --> 01:10:56,000
if you're new to this industry

1707
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:12,080
cyber security 24 hours a day

1708
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:13,280
you know you can't succeed in this

1709
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:14,960
industry and i don't think that's true i

1710
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:16,320
made that mistake actually

1711
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:19,199
i you know did the whole level cyber

1712
01:11:19,199 --> 01:11:21,120
security you know 24 hours a day

1713
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:23,280
go to work do research for eight hours a

1714
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:27,840
day passed out do it again

1715
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:38,400
don't let kind of this industry sort of

1716
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:41,840
ease

1717
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:54,880
um i know that's not really kind of

1718
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:56,320
maybe in the same vein but i think it's

1719
01:11:56,320 --> 01:11:57,760
an important topic to mention

1720
01:11:57,760 --> 01:11:59,520
for people that are coming into this

1721
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:01,120
industry because it

1722
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:05,040
can be a little bit daunting

1723
01:12:06,159 --> 01:12:09,760
yeah and just to echo that um i will say

1724
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:11,040
definitely i'm a big believer in

1725
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:12,159
research and as i've

1726
01:12:12,159 --> 01:12:13,760
you know been mentioning a lot about is

1727
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:15,600
tradecraft but you have to keep that in

1728
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:16,239
a bubble

1729
01:12:16,239 --> 01:12:18,000
and keep your life in that equal bubble

1730
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,280
as you're moving forward don't

1731
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:20,960
look over and see oh my god look at what

1732
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:22,400
everyone else is publishing all this

1733
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:23,920
crazy stuff i gotta better myself i

1734
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:25,760
gotta push myself three times harder

1735
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:28,239
no don't don't look at it like that you

1736
01:12:28,239 --> 01:12:29,679
should look at it as like look at what's

1737
01:12:29,679 --> 01:12:30,880
the great stuff coming out of this

1738
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:31,679
community

1739
01:12:31,679 --> 01:12:34,080
and i'm contributing uh i see a lot of

1740
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:35,360
people who are starting out who are

1741
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:37,840
great honestly brilliant researchers

1742
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:39,920
who do amazing stuff but they get so

1743
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:40,960
burnt out or they get

1744
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:42,880
so upset that they don't even ever

1745
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:44,560
publish their own content because

1746
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:46,159
they're afraid of what happens when it

1747
01:12:46,159 --> 01:12:47,280
comes out

1748
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:49,040
just do it for yourself like this

1749
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:51,040
industry is hugely about

1750
01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:52,719
sharing open source in the community you

1751
01:12:52,719 --> 01:12:54,080
know anything like as milo's going to

1752
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:54,560
mention

1753
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:56,800
discord twitter everything like that uh

1754
01:12:56,800 --> 01:12:58,400
i know that there has been some kind of

1755
01:12:58,400 --> 01:12:59,520
things that you know has you kind of

1756
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:00,320
mentioned but

1757
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:02,320
where i would say that is do it for

1758
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:03,600
yourself

1759
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:05,280
and at the end of the day make sure you

1760
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:07,520
know that okay i'm stepping away

1761
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:09,679
i'm gonna go do something else work life

1762
01:13:09,679 --> 01:13:11,440
balance is very important

1763
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:14,719
um and i mean i even myself you know

1764
01:13:14,719 --> 01:13:16,960
18 hour work days where i finish work

1765
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:18,560
and i just start researching

1766
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:20,320
i'm very passionate about developing and

1767
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:22,239
research a lot of people who know me

1768
01:13:22,239 --> 01:13:23,600
know that's pretty much true i

1769
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:25,600
you know live and breathe the monitor of

1770
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:26,960
security and stuff but like

1771
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:30,080
recently if i can say one bit of advice

1772
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:32,080
you know more than technological advice

1773
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:33,360
if you walk out of here is

1774
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:35,120
balance your life there's always gonna

1775
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:36,239
be a new expert there's always me

1776
01:13:36,239 --> 01:13:38,000
something new

1777
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,480
but your family is the one thing that

1778
01:13:40,480 --> 01:13:41,760
should be always in the forefront is the

1779
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:42,800
most important thing

1780
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:45,360
or your personal health so i mean i

1781
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:46,239
guess that wasn't

1782
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:47,520
probably the answer you were expecting

1783
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:49,280
from both of us but i think that's the

1784
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:50,640
most important thing i can

1785
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:52,400
pass on to anyone that's new starting

1786
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:53,520
out in this industry or anything like

1787
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:54,400
that is don't

1788
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:56,480
don't look at everyone else's work focus

1789
01:13:56,480 --> 01:13:57,920
on yourself and know when

1790
01:13:57,920 --> 01:13:59,120
it's time to go walk away from the

1791
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:00,880
computer and you know have other things

1792
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:03,520
important in your life

1793
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:06,159
can i add one more thing that i think is

1794
01:14:06,159 --> 01:14:07,600
worth mentioning as well

1795
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:11,280
um you may find that like

1796
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:12,719
if you're coming into this industry it's

1797
01:14:12,719 --> 01:14:14,080
certainly valuable to have someone that

1798
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:16,080
can mentor you if you kind of have the

1799
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:16,640
ability

1800
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:18,880
to have someone that can do that you may

1801
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:20,880
also find that this industry is very

1802
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:22,320
much so like well you need to learn

1803
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:23,360
things on your own and

1804
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:24,960
no one helps each other right especially

1805
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:26,560
in the offensive space i noticed this to

1806
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:28,000
be like a consistent trend

1807
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:29,600
there is help but there isn't kind of

1808
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:31,600
like as much typical mentorship as you

1809
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:32,960
might see in other areas so i would just

1810
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:33,920
say like look

1811
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:35,840
if you want help right shout out to

1812
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:37,520
people and if and if a couple people

1813
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:38,480
snub you don't

1814
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:40,080
don't don't beat yourself up about it

1815
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:41,760
like some people are going to be jerks

1816
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:42,480
in any industry

1817
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:43,920
right they don't want to help people

1818
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:45,040
they want to put themselves on a

1819
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:45,600
pedestal

1820
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:47,120
just we wanted the next person right

1821
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:48,719
like the world is big enough there's

1822
01:14:48,719 --> 01:14:50,159
enough people working in this industry

1823
01:14:50,159 --> 01:14:51,600
now that you're you'll eventually come

1824
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:53,040
across someone who's a decent human

1825
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:53,840
being who's

1826
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:55,280
willing to help you out who's willing to

1827
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:56,960
give you some pointers and lead you in a

1828
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:57,600
direction

1829
01:14:57,600 --> 01:14:59,440
everyone was always there right no one

1830
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:00,880
was born knowing all of the stuff

1831
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:02,640
that he wants so everyone's kind of gone

1832
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:06,239
down at least a very similar topic

1833
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:10,159
couldn't agree more yeah i mean i'm

1834
01:15:10,159 --> 01:15:11,360
gonna say like that was

1835
01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:12,640
awesome advice i don't think that that

1836
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:14,400
was bad advice at all because matt

1837
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:15,600
stresses to me all the time like

1838
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:17,440
savannah like don't burn yourself out

1839
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:20,320
i'm like okay matt but like the advice

1840
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:20,800
is

1841
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:22,400
truly really important because once you

1842
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:24,080
burn yourself out it's really hard to

1843
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:25,600
kind of like bounce back

1844
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:27,440
um so i mean i just want to thank both

1845
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:28,960
you matt and uh

1846
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:30,480
milos for coming on today and kind of

1847
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:32,080
giving some advice to people that are

1848
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:32,960
watching

1849
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:34,239
and we look forward to having you guys

1850
01:15:34,239 --> 01:15:35,760

1852
01:15:37,679 --> 01:15:38,719

feel free to do that now but we're going

1854
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:42,400
to go ahead and kind of wrap things up

1855
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:44,960
sure so um my handle is right now right

1856
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:46,640
beside my message but the one thing i'll

1857
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:47,040

to be the human equivalent of cars with

01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:49,840
will you don't

1927
01:23:50,639 --> 01:23:53,280

1929
01:23:54,239 --> 01:23:57,840
art ctf quals scoreboard in first place

01:23:57,840 --> 01:23:58,639
we still have a

1931
01:23:58,639 --> 01:24:01,760
generated a second ept and actually

1932
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:03,679
neutrino cannon just went down to fourth

1933
01:24:03,679 --> 01:24:06,000
so hackstreet's boys just took the lead

1934
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:07,360
but not by much

1935
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:09,280
now with that said what i'm going to do

to pack in

1969
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:13,600
for our stream especially with a lot of

1970
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:14,880
our viewers people are part of the

1971
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:15,679
village

1972
01:25:15,679 --> 01:25:18,239
we love to provide a lot of advice for

1973
01:25:18,239 --> 01:25:18,960
folks

1974
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:20,800
that are building their offensive

1975
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:22,239
security skills

1976
01:25:22,239 --> 01:25:23,600
and especially as they're kind of

1977
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:25,520
elevating through that a lot of folks

1978
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:28,080
have aspirations of being on a red team

1979
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:29,600
and so i'd like to start off just just

1980
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:31,280
by asking each of you uh how did you get

1981
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:34,159
started in this career

1982
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:36,560
yeah so i guess my start was definitely

1983
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:37,760
um probably

1984
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:39,440
i mean the start to start was probably

1985
01:25:39,440 --> 01:25:40,639
just me you know taking a lot of my

1986
01:25:40,639 --> 01:25:42,080
personal time to sort of read about like

1987
01:25:42,080 --> 01:25:43,600
all the security stuff online

1988
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:45,840
lots and lots of like blog posts and you

1989
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:47,520
know random books that i could find

1990
01:25:47,520 --> 01:25:49,120
um but i think you're probably one of

1991
01:25:49,120 --> 01:25:50,719
the biggest um in terms of knowledge

1992
01:25:50,719 --> 01:25:51,920
shift it was like probably being a

1993
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:53,199
consultant actually

1994
01:25:53,199 --> 01:25:56,400
fox just and just taking every time

1995
01:25:56,400 --> 01:25:57,679
anybody said anything i didn't know i'd

1996
01:25:57,679 --> 01:25:59,760
like write it down and go and cram it um

1997
01:25:59,760 --> 01:26:01,360
and so that really really ups the amount

1998
01:26:01,360 --> 01:26:03,520
i was able to know and understand

1999
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:05,920
um and then you know after that ended up

2000
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:07,520
doing like private security stuff and

2001
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:08,719
sort of moved more into like the red

2002
01:26:08,719 --> 01:26:10,080
teaming side of things so

2003
01:26:10,080 --> 01:26:12,239
we hired him off of reddit like yeah

2004
01:26:12,239 --> 01:26:13,840
yeah

2005
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:16,159
real transition yeah you want to go to

2006
01:26:16,159 --> 01:26:17,199
next year

2007
01:26:17,199 --> 01:26:19,120
yeah um i've always so i've always been

2008
01:26:19,120 --> 01:26:20,719
into computers in general

2009
01:26:20,719 --> 01:26:23,280
uh i grew up like going to lan parties

2010
01:26:23,280 --> 01:26:23,920
um

2011
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:25,920
and my parents like never allowed me to

2012
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:27,360
have an internet connection at home so i

2013
01:26:27,360 --> 01:26:29,040
actually got into security

2014
01:26:29,040 --> 01:26:31,199
uh through like building wi-fi antennas

2015
01:26:31,199 --> 01:26:32,800
to steal my neighbors like internet

2016
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:34,400
connection so i could play video games

2017
01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:35,199
online

2018
01:26:35,199 --> 01:26:37,199
uh at home and then it kind of it really

2019
01:26:37,199 --> 01:26:38,639
snowballed from there

2020
01:26:38,639 --> 01:26:40,639
um i started getting into programming

2021
01:26:40,639 --> 01:26:43,679
and uh yeah the rest is kind of history

2022
01:26:43,679 --> 01:26:47,280
so um i guess i kind of stumbled into

2023
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:47,920
security

2024
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:49,920
and like both of them they kind of

2025
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:51,600
started security early for me was more

2026
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:53,199
like i just stumbled into it

2027
01:26:53,199 --> 01:26:56,000
um i graduated from undergrad doing

2028
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:57,600
computer science and i was hired into a

2029
01:26:57,600 --> 01:26:58,239
role to do

2030
01:26:58,239 --> 01:27:00,080
testing and then on the first day of my

2031
01:27:00,080 --> 01:27:01,440
internship i find out that it's more

2032
01:27:01,440 --> 01:27:02,239
security

2033
01:27:02,239 --> 01:27:04,719
than testing um so just like start from

2034
01:27:04,719 --> 01:27:06,960
there did web application fan testing

2035
01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:10,000
really enjoyed it uh back then the term

2036
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:11,679
red team was new to me and i wanted to

2037
01:27:11,679 --> 01:27:12,880
get into it but i didn't really

2038
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:14,159
understand what it was

2039
01:27:14,159 --> 01:27:16,800
i did my master's in security i tried

2040
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:18,159
consulting for a vet

2041
01:27:18,159 --> 01:27:20,320
and then entered into google did a lot

2042
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:22,159
of like assessment oriented reviews like

2043
01:27:22,159 --> 01:27:24,159
design reviews code reviews and stuff

2044
01:27:24,159 --> 01:27:26,560
and then um started working on red team

2045
01:27:26,560 --> 01:27:28,480
exercises alongside really smart people

2046
01:27:28,480 --> 01:27:30,239
and just picked it up from there

2047
01:27:30,239 --> 01:27:32,480
uh but yeah kind of stumbled into it and

2048
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:34,159
things worked out as i started like

2049
01:27:34,159 --> 01:27:35,520
working towards it

2050
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:36,719
i think that's that's one of the cool

2051
01:27:36,719 --> 01:27:39,280
things about uh like the security

2052
01:27:39,280 --> 01:27:40,000
infosec

2053
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:41,920
as it exists today is there's a very

2054
01:27:41,920 --> 01:27:43,840
wide variety of backgrounds like

2055
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:46,320
you have a master's degree uh matt and i

2056
01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:48,239
dropped out of college

2057
01:27:48,239 --> 01:27:50,639
so uh but it's you know you know there's

2058
01:27:50,639 --> 01:27:52,480
no like one background that people

2059
01:27:52,480 --> 01:27:53,600
really come from uh

2060
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:56,080
into the industry it's it's really open

2061
01:27:56,080 --> 01:27:56,639
to

2062
01:27:56,639 --> 01:27:59,920
and anybody's background like uh at our

2063
01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:01,920
firm like we had somebody who's like a

2064
01:28:01,920 --> 01:28:03,760
medical doctor and just like got bored

2065
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:05,760
with medicine and came and became

2066
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:08,639
like a hacker uh for a little while so

2067
01:28:08,639 --> 01:28:09,199
um

2068
01:28:09,199 --> 01:28:11,520
yeah it's it's one of the very unique

2069
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:14,400
things i think about security right now

2070
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:15,280
absolutely you don't have to have a

2071
01:28:15,280 --> 01:28:17,120
pedigree to to get here yeah that's

2072
01:28:17,120 --> 01:28:18,400
great just a passion

2073
01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:20,560
speaking of much great segue uh you know

2074
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:21,840
what makes you really passionate about

2075
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:24,800
what you're doing right now

2076
01:28:25,199 --> 01:28:27,600
yeah so i i mean i think the biggest

2077
01:28:27,600 --> 01:28:29,679
thing is just like it's always like

2078
01:28:29,679 --> 01:28:31,840
completely new challenges and like the

2079
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:33,440
problem space is like never like

2080
01:28:33,440 --> 01:28:35,040
um like you always come in with like

2081
01:28:35,040 --> 01:28:36,400
previous experiences of just like in the

2082
01:28:36,400 --> 01:28:37,679
sense that you've had a bunch of stuff

2083
01:28:37,679 --> 01:28:39,199
before but like oftentimes you'll just

2084
01:28:39,199 --> 01:28:41,440
be handed a completely new system that

2085
01:28:41,440 --> 01:28:42,800
may be written completely in-house you

2086
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:44,239
know don't know anything about it you

2087
01:28:44,239 --> 01:28:45,440
have to like just be like all right

2088
01:28:45,440 --> 01:28:46,800
today i'm going to like learn this thing

2089
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:47,679
and like figure it out

2090
01:28:47,679 --> 01:28:49,520
so it's like never boring and like

2091
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:51,120
boring is always what i've disliked

2092
01:28:51,120 --> 01:28:52,639
the most so i think it's probably my

2093
01:28:52,639 --> 01:28:54,400
favorite part about it yeah

2094
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:56,560
it's like solving puzzles like every day

2095
01:28:56,560 --> 01:28:58,159
someone gives you something new

2096
01:28:58,159 --> 01:29:00,719
um it's also one thing that people don't

2097
01:29:00,719 --> 01:29:02,239
talk about often is like you bang your

2098
01:29:02,239 --> 01:29:03,840
head against the problem for a long

2099
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:06,639
long time and then finally it it like

2100
01:29:06,639 --> 01:29:07,840
gives way

2101
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:10,960
um it's both the most satisfying feeling

2102
01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:12,880
when it gives way but it's also like

2103
01:29:12,880 --> 01:29:15,360
frustrating to get there but uh the

2104
01:29:15,360 --> 01:29:16,159
journey of like

2105
01:29:16,159 --> 01:29:17,760
figuring out how something works taking

2106
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:19,760
it apart uh finding the fastest way to

2107
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:21,040
get to what you need

2108
01:29:21,040 --> 01:29:22,960
i think that keeps things new every

2109
01:29:22,960 --> 01:29:24,560
single time

2110
01:29:24,560 --> 01:29:27,040
yeah i think the i'm i'm in a similar

2111
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:27,840
boat so

2112
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:29,040
and i think there's there's a slight

2113
01:29:29,040 --> 01:29:31,520
difference between uh

2114
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:32,960
like being on an internal red team

2115
01:29:32,960 --> 01:29:34,800
versus a consulting red team

2116
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:37,760
um you know we being a consultancy we

2117
01:29:37,760 --> 01:29:39,280
work for a variety of different clients

2118
01:29:39,280 --> 01:29:41,199
in different industries there's always a

2119
01:29:41,199 --> 01:29:42,639
different tech stack

2120
01:29:42,639 --> 01:29:44,800
uh you know you might be hacking you

2121
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:45,760
know uh

2122
01:29:45,760 --> 01:29:48,159
some type of manufacturing facility one

2123
01:29:48,159 --> 01:29:50,159
week and a couple weeks later you'll be

2124
01:29:50,159 --> 01:29:52,960
uh you know going after something you

2125
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:54,159
know some tech company

2126
01:29:54,159 --> 01:29:56,480
or something and so you know one and one

2127
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:57,760
will have like a windows domain and the

2128
01:29:57,760 --> 01:29:58,320
other

2129
01:29:58,320 --> 01:29:59,520
there's no windows machines it's all

2130
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:01,600
macbooks uh or like chromebooks or

2131
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:02,320
something

2132
01:30:02,320 --> 01:30:04,320
and so just the in consulting you just

2133
01:30:04,320 --> 01:30:07,120
get this like really fun variety

2134
01:30:07,120 --> 01:30:08,960
um and you kind of you kind of get

2135
01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:10,800
exposed to just just everything

2136
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:12,880
from you know systems that have been

2137
01:30:12,880 --> 01:30:14,560
laying around for 10 years to things

2138
01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:15,280
that are

2139
01:30:15,280 --> 01:30:16,800
sort of in the hit you know serverless

2140
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:19,120
like application stacks and

2141
01:30:19,120 --> 01:30:21,679
uh more sort of hipster tech as i like

2142
01:30:21,679 --> 01:30:22,320
to call it

2143
01:30:22,320 --> 01:30:24,639
uh so i think there's also the

2144
01:30:24,639 --> 01:30:26,080
capabilities of the blue teams will

2145
01:30:26,080 --> 01:30:27,520
probably vary a lot

2146
01:30:27,520 --> 01:30:29,600
yeah as well as like how you approach

2147
01:30:29,600 --> 01:30:30,560
like detection

2148
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:33,280
in in environments and from a red team

2149
01:30:33,280 --> 01:30:34,719
perspective the way you approach you

2150
01:30:34,719 --> 01:30:36,080
know persistence very

2151
01:30:36,080 --> 01:30:38,159
significantly as well in sort of the

2152
01:30:38,159 --> 01:30:39,920
beyond corp zero core

2153
01:30:39,920 --> 01:30:41,600
uh environments you don't even

2154
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:43,280
necessarily need like code running on

2155
01:30:43,280 --> 01:30:44,480
machines like when people think about

2156
01:30:44,480 --> 01:30:45,360
persistence

2157
01:30:45,360 --> 01:30:46,800
they think about code running on

2158
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:48,639
machines somewhere but

2159
01:30:48,639 --> 01:30:51,520
in in the sort of beyond corp world it's

2160
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:53,120
more about like credentials

2161
01:30:53,120 --> 01:30:54,880
because you the attacker you as the

2162
01:30:54,880 --> 01:30:56,159
attacker always have access to like the

2163
01:30:56,159 --> 01:30:57,679
authentication plane

2164
01:30:57,679 --> 01:30:59,600
um and it can be oftentimes much more

2165
01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:01,360
difficult to revoke credentials versus

2166
01:31:01,360 --> 01:31:03,360
like killing a process on a machine

2167
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:05,760
so one of the things we try to do in is

2168
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:06,880
you know try to

2169
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:09,920
vary our approaches to different um you

2170
01:31:09,920 --> 01:31:11,440
know ttps depending on

2171
01:31:11,440 --> 01:31:13,360
the target environment we always try to

2172
01:31:13,360 --> 01:31:14,960
sort of uh

2173
01:31:14,960 --> 01:31:16,560
push the boundaries in in those

2174
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:18,320
different environments so that's a good

2175
01:31:18,320 --> 01:31:19,600
example of just like the fact that

2176
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:21,040
nothing's ever the same

2177
01:31:21,040 --> 01:31:23,360
like different stuff like even something

2178
01:31:23,360 --> 01:31:24,480
that you would always take for granted

2179
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:25,920
where it's just like okay well at least

2180
01:31:25,920 --> 01:31:27,360
in every engagement like i'm gonna have

2181
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:27,920
like you know

2182
01:31:27,920 --> 01:31:29,360
implant or something it's to be like a

2183
01:31:29,360 --> 01:31:31,199
first compromise and then some network

2184
01:31:31,199 --> 01:31:32,480
but then there's like yeah there's stuff

2185
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:33,760
like this where it's like oh actually

2186
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:35,600
none of that is you know applies in this

2187
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:36,800
one you have to completely rethink how

2188
01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:37,679
you do it

2189
01:31:37,679 --> 01:31:40,239
so i think and mass presentation which

2190
01:31:40,239 --> 01:31:41,600
she's giving later today

2191
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:43,120
i think is a really good example of some

2192
01:31:43,120 --> 01:31:44,320
of this stuff i don't know if you want

2193
01:31:44,320 --> 01:31:45,280
to

2194
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:46,960
yeah yeah just give a quick pitch for

2195
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:48,719
that but uh please do

2196
01:31:48,719 --> 01:31:50,239
yeah yeah so i'm doing a talk later

2197
01:31:50,239 --> 01:31:52,080
today at def con um these the the

2198
01:31:52,080 --> 01:31:53,199
pre-recorded video actually is already

2199
01:31:53,199 --> 01:31:54,719
online the slides are but it's you know

2200
01:31:54,719 --> 01:31:56,320
about you know g suite uh

2201
01:31:56,320 --> 01:31:58,560
google workspace and apps script and

2202
01:31:58,560 --> 01:31:59,920
sort of the security model behind these

2203
01:31:59,920 --> 01:32:00,719
things and

2204
01:32:00,719 --> 01:32:02,719
you know it talks about some really

2205
01:32:02,719 --> 01:32:04,320
interesting topics like you can make an

2206
01:32:04,320 --> 01:32:05,760
implant in apps script and have it be

2207
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:07,520
completely you know separate from your

2208
01:32:07,520 --> 01:32:08,960
device you know you can have an implant

2209
01:32:08,960 --> 01:32:10,639
that persists past wiping your laptop

2210
01:32:10,639 --> 01:32:12,239
all sorts of stuff like this so really

2211
01:32:12,239 --> 01:32:13,679
delves into this sort of weirder world

2212
01:32:13,679 --> 01:32:15,280
where it's like okay well

2213
01:32:15,280 --> 01:32:17,199
you know we have a a company that really

2214
01:32:17,199 --> 01:32:18,560
takes this to heart the zero trust sort

2215
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:20,159
of thing how can we still survive and

2216
01:32:20,159 --> 01:32:20,480
like

2217
01:32:20,480 --> 01:32:22,400
you know get access and you know do

2218
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:24,080
lateral movement stuff like that

2219
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:25,199
one of the other things i really liked

2220
01:32:25,199 --> 01:32:27,760
was like it's not necessarily about

2221
01:32:27,760 --> 01:32:29,440
exploiting vulnerabilities so much as

2222
01:32:29,440 --> 01:32:29,760
like

2223
01:32:29,760 --> 01:32:31,920
design flaws and like misconceptions

2224
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:33,840
about how things are kind of supposed to

2225
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:34,639
work

2226
01:32:34,639 --> 01:32:36,560
um and that's one thing that i think i

2227
01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:37,840
find often on

2228
01:32:37,840 --> 01:32:40,400
on red teams is like not necessarily

2229
01:32:40,400 --> 01:32:42,000
exploiting vulnerabilities but

2230
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
misconceptions about how certain pieces

2231
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:45,840
of technology work often

2232
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:48,080
uh bears very good fruit uh for the red

2233
01:32:48,080 --> 01:32:49,280
team so

2234
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:51,280
yeah that's very good yeah i think

2235
01:32:51,280 --> 01:32:53,120
that's kind of a distinction that the

2236
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:54,080
team has between

2237
01:32:54,080 --> 01:32:55,600
fantastic and red teaming is like you're

2238
01:32:55,600 --> 01:32:56,800
not trying to find all the bugs you're

2239
01:32:56,800 --> 01:32:58,239
trying to find the fastest way to get to

2240
01:32:58,239 --> 01:32:59,199
something

2241
01:32:59,199 --> 01:33:01,440
and you don't actually just look at the

2242
01:33:01,440 --> 01:33:02,639
systems you look at the people and

2243
01:33:02,639 --> 01:33:04,080
processes that support the systems as

2244
01:33:04,080 --> 01:33:04,800
well

2245
01:33:04,800 --> 01:33:06,719
and a lot of times the processes or the

2246
01:33:06,719 --> 01:33:08,320
people kind of give way before the

2247
01:33:08,320 --> 01:33:10,320
systems themselves

2248
01:33:10,320 --> 01:33:14,560
yeah so with such a dynamic environment

2249
01:33:14,560 --> 01:33:16,239
um you know i think there's no end to

2250
01:33:16,239 --> 01:33:18,080
the amount of tools and the amount of

2251
01:33:18,080 --> 01:33:19,360
platforms you can study the different

2252
01:33:19,360 --> 01:33:21,040
technologies what are some of the tool

2253
01:33:21,040 --> 01:33:22,800
sets that that the three of you uh

2254
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:25,360
uh like to use um i can probably give a

2255
01:33:25,360 --> 01:33:26,639
plug to theirs

2256
01:33:26,639 --> 01:33:28,880
because like we use a bunch of open

2257
01:33:28,880 --> 01:33:30,080
source tools as well and

2258
01:33:30,080 --> 01:33:33,360
we've used sliver uh joe's c2 implant

2259
01:33:33,360 --> 01:33:34,880
stuff as well as curse chrome which is

2260
01:33:34,880 --> 01:33:36,960
like the chrome extension plan so

2261
01:33:36,960 --> 01:33:39,600
we use yeah so uh i'm i'm the co-author

2262
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:40,000
of

2263
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,639
open source c2 framework called sliver

2264
01:33:42,639 --> 01:33:44,239
uh we use that pretty extensively

2265
01:33:44,239 --> 01:33:45,679
internally we have some internal

2266
01:33:45,679 --> 01:33:48,000
sort of extensions on top of it but i

2267
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:49,679
also am a

2268
01:33:49,679 --> 01:33:51,440
user of the cursed chrome extension that

2269
01:33:51,440 --> 01:33:53,600
matt wrote we use that pretty

2270
01:33:53,600 --> 01:33:55,520
extensively again in sort of like these

2271
01:33:55,520 --> 01:33:57,199
beyond corp situations

2272
01:33:57,199 --> 01:33:58,560
it's particularly good for getting

2273
01:33:58,560 --> 01:34:00,719
around u2f which is becoming

2274
01:34:00,719 --> 01:34:02,239
which is a really difficult security

2275
01:34:02,239 --> 01:34:04,000
control to get around and i see it

2276
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:05,840
becoming more and more popular

2277
01:34:05,840 --> 01:34:07,120
because it kind of takes like credential

2278
01:34:07,120 --> 01:34:08,960
phishing off the table in password

2279
01:34:08,960 --> 01:34:10,400
spraying and some of these

2280
01:34:10,400 --> 01:34:13,600
like very effective sort of low risk

2281
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:17,199
from detection early on in engagement uh

2282
01:34:17,199 --> 01:34:18,000
approaches to getting

2283
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,239
initial access so but yeah we used curse

2284
01:34:20,239 --> 01:34:21,120
chrome quite a bit

2285
01:34:21,120 --> 01:34:22,639
um as well as like some of the

2286
01:34:22,639 --> 01:34:24,239
techniques you developed for

2287
01:34:24,239 --> 01:34:25,600
injecting it into the runtime of

2288
01:34:25,600 --> 01:34:28,000
existing extensions uh we wrote some

2289
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,080
some stuff around that as well uh but

2290
01:34:30,080 --> 01:34:31,600
yeah sliver is sort of our go-to if we

2291
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:32,960
want native code

2292
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:34,480
running on a machine uh it's

2293
01:34:34,480 --> 01:34:36,719
cross-platform runs on mac os windows

2294
01:34:36,719 --> 01:34:40,320
uh linux as well as like freebsd

2295
01:34:40,320 --> 01:34:42,080
uh and basically anything go can

2296
01:34:42,080 --> 01:34:44,080
cross-compile to sliver can probably run

2297
01:34:44,080 --> 01:34:44,480
on

2298
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:46,159
in some capacity you know there's

2299
01:34:46,159 --> 01:34:47,679
certain features that are platform

2300
01:34:47,679 --> 01:34:48,480
specific

2301
01:34:48,480 --> 01:34:51,440
uh but uh yeah we use it quite a bit so

2302
01:34:51,440 --> 01:34:52,639
yeah we use sliver as well

2303
01:34:52,639 --> 01:34:54,159
super super useful especially for the

2304
01:34:54,159 --> 01:34:55,360
crosscompile thing it's very useful

2305
01:34:55,360 --> 01:34:56,239
because trying to find something that

2306
01:34:56,239 --> 01:34:57,280
works on like you know

2307
01:34:57,280 --> 01:34:59,440
osx and like has like reasonable

2308
01:34:59,440 --> 01:35:01,119
functionality it's like nazis it sounds

2309
01:35:01,119 --> 01:35:03,119
so

2310
01:35:03,119 --> 01:35:05,679
um yeah actually in addition to like all

2311
01:35:05,679 --> 01:35:06,400
the open source

2312
01:35:06,400 --> 01:35:08,080
projects a lot of things that i find i

2313
01:35:08,080 --> 01:35:09,760
use is um actually just like when people

2314
01:35:09,760 --> 01:35:10,239
do

2315
01:35:10,239 --> 01:35:11,840
research or they write a blog post and

2316
01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:13,040
they kind of describe like different

2317
01:35:13,040 --> 01:35:14,960
attacks um like that actually something

2318
01:35:14,960 --> 01:35:16,719
that i use quite a bit like there's um

2319
01:35:16,719 --> 01:35:18,000
like i remember doing some you know

2320
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:19,920
research into like okay well like how

2321
01:35:19,920 --> 01:35:21,760
can we exploit the osx platform what

2322
01:35:21,760 --> 01:35:22,800
does that look like

2323
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:24,239
and just reading like blog posts that

2324
01:35:24,239 --> 01:35:25,920
even just broke down existing malware

2325
01:35:25,920 --> 01:35:27,440
and like tricks that they used and like

2326
01:35:27,440 --> 01:35:28,639
stuff like new attacks that people

2327
01:35:28,639 --> 01:35:29,679
discussed um

2328
01:35:29,679 --> 01:35:32,159
that uh while not directly like code it

2329
01:35:32,159 --> 01:35:33,600
was like taking those snippets and like

2330
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:34,800
working those and using them as a

2331
01:35:34,800 --> 01:35:36,239
starting point to build you know our own

2332
01:35:36,239 --> 01:35:37,280
payload that's something that i use

2333
01:35:37,280 --> 01:35:38,560
quite a bit as well

2334
01:35:38,560 --> 01:35:40,719
so yeah yeah i think that's uh in my

2335
01:35:40,719 --> 01:35:42,480
experience uh training sort of junior

2336
01:35:42,480 --> 01:35:43,760
red teamers that's often like the

2337
01:35:43,760 --> 01:35:45,280
steepest learning curve

2338
01:35:45,280 --> 01:35:46,880
is sort of being able you know in pen

2339
01:35:46,880 --> 01:35:48,480
testing you deal a lot with like

2340
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:50,400
proofs of concept and i i was in

2341
01:35:50,400 --> 01:35:52,080
application security before

2342
01:35:52,080 --> 01:35:54,239
sort of switching to red teaming um in

2343
01:35:54,239 --> 01:35:55,679
there you know it's it's generally

2344
01:35:55,679 --> 01:35:57,760
enough to kind of just do a poc

2345
01:35:57,760 --> 01:35:59,199
sometimes you'll you know you'll add

2346
01:35:59,199 --> 01:36:01,119
some flavor and and like

2347
01:36:01,119 --> 01:36:04,159
uh you know to just show impact but i

2348
01:36:04,159 --> 01:36:05,040
think one of the

2349
01:36:05,040 --> 01:36:07,280
uh learning curves that people

2350
01:36:07,280 --> 01:36:08,639
experience when coming over to red

2351
01:36:08,639 --> 01:36:09,199
teaming

2352
01:36:09,199 --> 01:36:10,639
is you actually have to like weaponize

2353
01:36:10,639 --> 01:36:12,400
the stuff and deploy it and actually get

2354
01:36:12,400 --> 01:36:14,480
it all to work and you need it to work

2355
01:36:14,480 --> 01:36:15,280
like

2356
01:36:15,280 --> 01:36:17,679
fairly reliably in an environment that

2357
01:36:17,679 --> 01:36:19,360
you don't necessarily have

2358
01:36:19,360 --> 01:36:21,040
like it's it it's generally not

2359
01:36:21,040 --> 01:36:22,400
realistic to have a perfect lab

2360
01:36:22,400 --> 01:36:24,000
environment that you're uh

2361
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:25,840
for your target so you have to do like a

2362
01:36:25,840 --> 01:36:28,000
lot of guesswork uh you have to have a

2363
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:29,679
lot of contingencies

2364
01:36:29,679 --> 01:36:31,360
uh and you have to bake that into your

2365
01:36:31,360 --> 01:36:32,960
code into your payloads

2366
01:36:32,960 --> 01:36:35,119
uh into your operating procedures like

2367
01:36:35,119 --> 01:36:37,280
into everything so

2368
01:36:37,280 --> 01:36:39,199
as well as just being able to take those

2369
01:36:39,199 --> 01:36:40,560
because oftentimes you'll you'll just

2370
01:36:40,560 --> 01:36:42,320
research on a target you'll find like

2371
01:36:42,320 --> 01:36:45,040
a poc that was published but you know it

2372
01:36:45,040 --> 01:36:46,560
won't work in the it's you know it's a

2373
01:36:46,560 --> 01:36:48,000
little broken or it doesn't work in the

2374
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:48,639
way that you

2375
01:36:48,639 --> 01:36:50,239
need it to and so you'll have to take

2376
01:36:50,239 --> 01:36:52,000
that and modify and integrate

2377
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,320
into your existing tools and so that's

2378
01:36:54,320 --> 01:36:56,159
that's an extremely valuable skill set

2379
01:36:56,159 --> 01:36:56,880
and i think it's

2380
01:36:56,880 --> 01:36:58,560
uh it's one that juniors have a hard

2381
01:36:58,560 --> 01:37:00,239
time acquiring sometimes

2382
01:37:00,239 --> 01:37:02,159
yeah i will say that i think that um one

2383
01:37:02,159 --> 01:37:03,280
of the one things that

2384
01:37:03,280 --> 01:37:05,040
i really encourage people to get in the

2385
01:37:05,040 --> 01:37:06,480
habit of is even if you're in apps and

2386
01:37:06,480 --> 01:37:07,840
you're not doing red teaming like taking

2387
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:09,520
the time to write proof of concepts like

2388
01:37:09,520 --> 01:37:10,560
the full thing

2389
01:37:10,560 --> 01:37:12,400
uh it's not just like even if it's yeah

2390
01:37:12,400 --> 01:37:13,520
it's proof of concept it's not actually

2391
01:37:13,520 --> 01:37:14,239
gonna get used

2392
01:37:14,239 --> 01:37:15,920
um just like weaponize a cross-site

2393
01:37:15,920 --> 01:37:17,840
scripting vulnerability uh it'll take

2394
01:37:17,840 --> 01:37:19,520
your understanding of what's going on

2395
01:37:19,520 --> 01:37:21,040
from like oh cool i mean alert box

2396
01:37:21,040 --> 01:37:22,400
happened

2397
01:37:22,400 --> 01:37:24,560
something uh to like oh i like i

2398
01:37:24,560 --> 01:37:25,840
understand all the things i can actually

2399
01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:27,119
do with this and like the real danger

2400
01:37:27,119 --> 01:37:28,400
and so when people ask you things like

2401
01:37:28,400 --> 01:37:29,440
what's the impact you

2402
01:37:29,440 --> 01:37:31,040
are like because there are terribly

2403
01:37:31,040 --> 01:37:32,639
speak right so

2404
01:37:32,639 --> 01:37:35,040
yeah i banned alert boxes for cross-site

2405
01:37:35,040 --> 01:37:36,400
scripting examples of

2406
01:37:36,400 --> 01:37:39,520
bishop boxes you have to write a real

2407
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:42,000
payload

2408
01:37:42,320 --> 01:37:44,639
this uh this is a question that i think

2409
01:37:44,639 --> 01:37:45,440
a lot of folks

2410
01:37:45,440 --> 01:37:47,040
interpret differently in terms of like

2411
01:37:47,040 --> 01:37:48,960
their answer but uh there's a lot of

2412
01:37:48,960 --> 01:37:50,960
misnomers out there and in our industry

2413
01:37:50,960 --> 01:37:52,320
we're always trying to get to a common

2414
01:37:52,320 --> 01:37:52,960
language

2415
01:37:52,960 --> 01:37:54,639
how would you define you know like what

2416
01:37:54,639 --> 01:37:56,480
is a red team or a red team or what

2417
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:58,320
what makes that you unique from other

2418
01:37:58,320 --> 01:37:59,600
types of uh

2419
01:37:59,600 --> 01:38:03,199
of uh titles so we would say like red

2420
01:38:03,199 --> 01:38:03,760
teaming

2421
01:38:03,760 --> 01:38:06,400
is where you're simulating an adversary

2422
01:38:06,400 --> 01:38:08,400
uh so you're trying to copy their actual

2423
01:38:08,400 --> 01:38:10,239
tdps you're trying to work towards an

2424
01:38:10,239 --> 01:38:12,080
objective and you're trying to show

2425
01:38:12,080 --> 01:38:13,520
how they would get to that objective and

2426
01:38:13,520 --> 01:38:15,199
how they would achieve their goals so

2427
01:38:15,199 --> 01:38:17,040
it's very carried around

2428
01:38:17,040 --> 01:38:18,800
one who are you simulating what is the

2429
01:38:18,800 --> 01:38:20,080
attack of a failure picked

2430
01:38:20,080 --> 01:38:21,119
what are the objectives you're trying to

2431
01:38:21,119 --> 01:38:22,960
achieve and how do you get there so it's

2432
01:38:22,960 --> 01:38:24,719
not so much as like find every issue in

2433
01:38:24,719 --> 01:38:25,280
a system

2434
01:38:25,280 --> 01:38:27,280
it's like get to that point the fastest

2435
01:38:27,280 --> 01:38:28,719
way possible in a way that it makes

2436
01:38:28,719 --> 01:38:30,000
sense for that attacker profile

2437
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,800
that you picked um so that is the main

2438
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:34,400
distinction i would say between a red

2439
01:38:34,400 --> 01:38:35,040
team and

2440
01:38:35,040 --> 01:38:37,520
between like a pen test or an assessment

2441
01:38:37,520 --> 01:38:38,239
that's great

2442
01:38:38,239 --> 01:38:39,920
yeah the way i think about it is you

2443
01:38:39,920 --> 01:38:41,760
know it's all offensive security testing

2444
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:43,760
so like there's a lot of overlap but

2445
01:38:43,760 --> 01:38:45,760
to me the primary distinctions are you

2446
01:38:45,760 --> 01:38:47,920
know a pen test is really is

2447
01:38:47,920 --> 01:38:49,760
generally you're trying to find as many

2448
01:38:49,760 --> 01:38:51,119
vulnerabilities as possible

2449
01:38:51,119 --> 01:38:53,199
in the in a target with it within a

2450
01:38:53,199 --> 01:38:54,320
certain time frame

2451
01:38:54,320 --> 01:38:56,560
stealth is usually not a concern and the

2452
01:38:56,560 --> 01:38:58,880
primary objective of a pen test is to

2453
01:38:58,880 --> 01:39:00,800
uh reduce the attack surface of the

2454
01:39:00,800 --> 01:39:02,239
target whether that's a network or an

2455
01:39:02,239 --> 01:39:03,199
application

2456
01:39:03,199 --> 01:39:05,360
a red team is more goal oriented and

2457
01:39:05,360 --> 01:39:06,880
you're generally actually trying to use

2458
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:08,560
the fewest number of vulnerabilities to

2459
01:39:08,560 --> 01:39:09,600
achieve a goal

2460
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:11,360
because that will more or less translate

2461
01:39:11,360 --> 01:39:13,040
into your exposure to detection

2462
01:39:13,040 --> 01:39:14,560
like if you find one way to get domain

2463
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:16,159
admin on a red team you're probably not

2464
01:39:16,159 --> 01:39:17,600
going to go back and try to find another

2465
01:39:17,600 --> 01:39:18,800
path to domain admin

2466
01:39:18,800 --> 01:39:20,560
but you probably would do that in a pen

2467
01:39:20,560 --> 01:39:22,080
test right because in a pen test again

2468
01:39:22,080 --> 01:39:23,440
you're trying to reduce attack surface

2469
01:39:23,440 --> 01:39:24,880
you want to find as much stuff as

2470
01:39:24,880 --> 01:39:25,679
possible

2471
01:39:25,679 --> 01:39:27,520
red team is just like can a goal be

2472
01:39:27,520 --> 01:39:29,040
achieved and often you're trying to

2473
01:39:29,040 --> 01:39:31,119
emulate specific adversaries

2474
01:39:31,119 --> 01:39:32,480
because the outcome that you want from a

2475
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:34,400
red team is to sort of increase the

2476
01:39:34,400 --> 01:39:36,320
organization's detection and response

2477
01:39:36,320 --> 01:39:37,119
capabilities

2478
01:39:37,119 --> 01:39:39,600
or to exercise them you know a lot of

2479
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:40,880
organizations

2480
01:39:40,880 --> 01:39:43,119
uh have you know procedures and stuff

2481
01:39:43,119 --> 01:39:44,239
written down on paper

2482
01:39:44,239 --> 01:39:47,119
but if you never exercise those you know

2483
01:39:47,119 --> 01:39:47,679
you may

2484
01:39:47,679 --> 01:39:51,360
you may run into problems uh so um

2485
01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:53,679
for you know you really want uh muscle

2486
01:39:53,679 --> 01:39:55,600
memory when it comes to responding to

2487
01:39:55,600 --> 01:39:56,480
incidences

2488
01:39:56,480 --> 01:39:58,000
and the red team can sort of help build

2489
01:39:58,000 --> 01:39:59,199
that muscle memory within an

2490
01:39:59,199 --> 01:40:00,239
organization

2491
01:40:00,239 --> 01:40:03,199
uh versus again like and red teams sort

2492
01:40:03,199 --> 01:40:03,840
of are

2493
01:40:03,840 --> 01:40:05,520
generally more broadly scoped it's about

2494
01:40:05,520 --> 01:40:07,679
people uh you know social engineering is

2495
01:40:07,679 --> 01:40:09,280
often involved it's not necessarily just

2496
01:40:09,280 --> 01:40:10,880
about technical vulnerabilities

2497
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:12,639
and a pen test is generally always

2498
01:40:12,639 --> 01:40:15,040
focused on uh technical vulnerabilities

2499
01:40:15,040 --> 01:40:17,040
so yeah i think they describe like the

2500
01:40:17,040 --> 01:40:18,159
meat of it um i

2501
01:40:18,159 --> 01:40:19,920
think the one thing that for people who

2502
01:40:19,920 --> 01:40:21,920
are you know very very good on the just

2503
01:40:21,920 --> 01:40:23,199
like the hacking side of things that

2504
01:40:23,199 --> 01:40:24,639
people are like whip and explode really

2505
01:40:24,639 --> 01:40:26,080
easily you know they know all that

2506
01:40:26,080 --> 01:40:27,920
the biggest thing that i think for them

2507
01:40:27,920 --> 01:40:29,679
that for me to like basically convey to

2508
01:40:29,679 --> 01:40:30,639
them is like you know

2509
01:40:30,639 --> 01:40:32,480
i'm always spraying stuff as in like

2510
01:40:32,480 --> 01:40:34,159
okay i am the person we're emulating

2511
01:40:34,159 --> 01:40:35,360
i thought you know my bosses don't care

2512
01:40:35,360 --> 01:40:37,199
if i find 10 exploits in this thing they

2513
01:40:37,199 --> 01:40:38,800
only care if i get the data i'm looking

2514
01:40:38,800 --> 01:40:40,000
for when i give it back right

2515
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:41,520
like um or if it's like i'm a

2516
01:40:41,520 --> 01:40:43,040
disgruntled employee or whatever the you

2517
01:40:43,040 --> 01:40:44,320
know whatever i'm simulating

2518
01:40:44,320 --> 01:40:45,520
it's like i'm trying to i'm trying to

2519
01:40:45,520 --> 01:40:47,280
put myself in that person's shoes and

2520
01:40:47,280 --> 01:40:48,800
say what do what would i actually do

2521
01:40:48,800 --> 01:40:50,480
here right like not like when i do

2522
01:40:50,480 --> 01:40:51,679
something as crazy as like what we're

2523
01:40:51,679 --> 01:40:53,440
pulling off does that make sense like

2524
01:40:53,440 --> 01:40:53,840
because

2525
01:40:53,840 --> 01:40:55,840
you know you can always do crazy attacks

2526
01:40:55,840 --> 01:40:56,960
but when you're you're really trying to

2527
01:40:56,960 --> 01:40:58,560
emulate like what you know what joe

2528
01:40:58,560 --> 01:40:59,600
mentioned like the detection

2529
01:40:59,600 --> 01:41:00,800
response side of things you wanna make

2530
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:02,239
sure you're actually doing a real

2531
01:41:02,239 --> 01:41:04,159
simulation that's helpful there

2532
01:41:04,159 --> 01:41:05,840
and to add to that like it's about

2533
01:41:05,840 --> 01:41:07,679
adding value is it like you're actually

2534
01:41:07,679 --> 01:41:09,040
testing the controls in place you're

2535
01:41:09,040 --> 01:41:10,639
testing the detection and response

2536
01:41:10,639 --> 01:41:11,920
capabilities be it

2537
01:41:11,920 --> 01:41:13,600
what can they actually see in terms of

2538
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:15,760
like detection signals but also what do

2539
01:41:15,760 --> 01:41:18,159
they do once they see it to joe's point

2540
01:41:18,159 --> 01:41:20,320
so the value added is more for the

2541
01:41:20,320 --> 01:41:21,280
organization

2542
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:23,040
that kind of has some security

2543
01:41:23,040 --> 01:41:24,320
capabilities already

2544
01:41:24,320 --> 01:41:26,400
so if it is an organization that's newer

2545
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:27,600
in terms of security building on

2546
01:41:27,600 --> 01:41:28,239
security

2547
01:41:28,239 --> 01:41:30,000
red teaming is a little bit like jumping

2548
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,080
the gun in it's always yeah we

2549
01:41:32,080 --> 01:41:33,199
certainly see a lot of that in

2550
01:41:33,199 --> 01:41:35,040
consulting and usually what i'll tell

2551
01:41:35,040 --> 01:41:36,080
clients is like

2552
01:41:36,080 --> 01:41:38,080
if you haven't done a lot of pen tests

2553
01:41:38,080 --> 01:41:39,520
you definitely don't want a red team

2554
01:41:39,520 --> 01:41:40,880
like you kind of want to start with pen

2555
01:41:40,880 --> 01:41:43,280
tests and work your way up towards

2556
01:41:43,280 --> 01:41:45,199
red team as you mature your security

2557
01:41:45,199 --> 01:41:47,040
program uh within

2558
01:41:47,040 --> 01:41:49,520
the organization so yeah you could have

2559
01:41:49,520 --> 01:41:50,960
i especially find that you could run

2560
01:41:50,960 --> 01:41:52,320
into situations where like

2561
01:41:52,320 --> 01:41:53,760
you know if you have a bunch of issues

2562
01:41:53,760 --> 01:41:55,280
that you know are broken you're like oh

2563
01:41:55,280 --> 01:41:56,800
this is broken this is broken if you go

2564
01:41:56,800 --> 01:41:58,080
to my team a lot of times you're just

2565
01:41:58,080 --> 01:41:59,119
gonna

2566
01:41:59,119 --> 01:42:00,320
it's the longest taking fruit right

2567
01:42:00,320 --> 01:42:01,360
you're gonna go for what's easiest

2568
01:42:01,360 --> 01:42:02,320
you're not gonna waste time

2569
01:42:02,320 --> 01:42:03,840
uh so you might end up with something

2570
01:42:03,840 --> 01:42:05,360
that's just like here's the problems you

2571
01:42:05,360 --> 01:42:06,239
already knew about

2572
01:42:06,239 --> 01:42:08,159
like go fix them so what about a nice

2573
01:42:08,159 --> 01:42:10,159
story and like clearly articulating the

2574
01:42:10,159 --> 01:42:11,440
risk as well yeah

2575
01:42:11,440 --> 01:42:14,159
yeah but there'd be better roi with you

2576
01:42:14,159 --> 01:42:16,159
know attack surface reduction versus

2577
01:42:16,159 --> 01:42:17,760
yeah versus that exactly

2578
01:42:17,760 --> 01:42:20,639
so yeah um pen tests are very useful

2579
01:42:20,639 --> 01:42:21,520
tool within

2580
01:42:21,520 --> 01:42:23,199
you know these are all components within

2581
01:42:23,199 --> 01:42:24,880
a mature security program

2582
01:42:24,880 --> 01:42:26,960
at an organization it's not a you don't

2583
01:42:26,960 --> 01:42:28,239
want to do just red teams you don't want

2584
01:42:28,239 --> 01:42:31,678
to do just pen tests you know

2585
01:42:31,840 --> 01:42:34,320
that's great advice and that i think

2586
01:42:34,320 --> 01:42:36,239
that the definitions you provided that

2587
01:42:36,239 --> 01:42:37,920
should be the standard because i think

2588
01:42:37,920 --> 01:42:39,679
you hit on all those important points

2589
01:42:39,679 --> 01:42:41,040
and and i think there is a strong

2590
01:42:41,040 --> 01:42:42,800
distinction uh when you look at the

2591
01:42:42,800 --> 01:42:43,520
different

2592
01:42:43,520 --> 01:42:45,679
uh you know areas of offensive security

2593
01:42:45,679 --> 01:42:46,880
and so thank you for

2594
01:42:46,880 --> 01:42:49,360
providing that um you know as we're

2595
01:42:49,360 --> 01:42:50,800
nearing the end here you know i'd like

2596
01:42:50,800 --> 01:42:51,119
to

2597
01:42:51,119 --> 01:42:53,440
again i mentioned that we have a lot of

2598
01:42:53,440 --> 01:42:54,800
folks who are either getting into

2599
01:42:54,800 --> 01:42:56,000
offensive security or

2600
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:57,760
they're kind of leveling up their skills

2601
01:42:57,760 --> 01:42:59,600
uh what what you know personal advice or

2602
01:42:59,600 --> 01:43:00,960
recommendations would you have for those

2603
01:43:00,960 --> 01:43:02,000
folks that uh

2604
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:05,040
that are learning um a couple of things

2605
01:43:05,040 --> 01:43:05,840
actually like

2606
01:43:05,840 --> 01:43:07,760
this is true for anything in security

2607
01:43:07,760 --> 01:43:09,360
understand the what what

2608
01:43:09,360 --> 01:43:12,960
uh what why how like don't just try to

2609
01:43:12,960 --> 01:43:14,800
see that things break and and go with it

2610
01:43:14,800 --> 01:43:16,239
like understand how the tool works

2611
01:43:16,239 --> 01:43:17,760
understand why something broke

2612
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:19,840
understand how to fix it i think that

2613
01:43:19,840 --> 01:43:21,600
will be valuable in any phase of

2614
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:23,520
security but especially in red teaming

2615
01:43:23,520 --> 01:43:24,159
because

2616
01:43:24,159 --> 01:43:25,679
it's not just about breaking something

2617
01:43:25,679 --> 01:43:28,320
it's about like weaponizing it like what

2618
01:43:28,320 --> 01:43:30,880
uh joe and man if you said uh the other

2619
01:43:30,880 --> 01:43:32,719
aspect i would say is like learn to code

2620
01:43:32,719 --> 01:43:34,320
i think this is like a super underrated

2621
01:43:34,320 --> 01:43:35,920
scale in our industry scripting and

2622
01:43:35,920 --> 01:43:37,360
coding super essential

2623
01:43:37,360 --> 01:43:38,880
so understanding how the system works

2624
01:43:38,880 --> 01:43:40,560
and then augmenting your skill set to

2625
01:43:40,560 --> 01:43:41,679
actually write tools

2626
01:43:41,679 --> 01:43:43,360
for the use case you're in is very

2627
01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:44,800
valuable

2628
01:43:44,800 --> 01:43:46,639
yeah i i generally learn things by

2629
01:43:46,639 --> 01:43:47,840
writing a tool to do it

2630
01:43:47,840 --> 01:43:49,920
like that's even if it's i think there's

2631
01:43:49,920 --> 01:43:51,360
there can be a lot of value in

2632
01:43:51,360 --> 01:43:52,000
reinventing

2633
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,080
wheels uh if it's like an educational

2634
01:43:54,080 --> 01:43:55,520
thing um so

2635
01:43:55,520 --> 01:43:58,719
definitely i i agree wholeheartedly with

2636
01:43:58,719 --> 01:43:59,920
everything you said

2637
01:43:59,920 --> 01:44:02,960
um i also read a lot like i uh i'm a

2638
01:44:02,960 --> 01:44:04,159
prolific reader

2639
01:44:04,159 --> 01:44:06,719
i have a lot i read almost every

2640
01:44:06,719 --> 01:44:08,239
security book that comes out

2641
01:44:08,239 --> 01:44:10,800
um and so i think that's a lot about

2642
01:44:10,800 --> 01:44:11,600
like i've

2643
01:44:11,600 --> 01:44:13,119
at least i find a lot of value in that i

2644
01:44:13,119 --> 01:44:14,400
know every everyone like learns

2645
01:44:14,400 --> 01:44:15,040
differently

2646
01:44:15,040 --> 01:44:16,719
so you also kind of have to learn you

2647
01:44:16,719 --> 01:44:18,239
kind of have to understand how you you

2648
01:44:18,239 --> 01:44:19,280
learn but

2649
01:44:19,280 --> 01:44:22,400
uh for me like uh reading is is a huge

2650
01:44:22,400 --> 01:44:23,360
part of how i

2651
01:44:23,360 --> 01:44:25,679
uh learn things so i definitely

2652
01:44:25,679 --> 01:44:26,560
recommend

2653
01:44:26,560 --> 01:44:30,000
reading as much as possible so yeah um

2654
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,719
so some of this is it's i think the

2655
01:44:32,719 --> 01:44:33,840
security environment today is a little

2656
01:44:33,840 --> 01:44:35,040
different from when like i was sort of

2657
01:44:35,040 --> 01:44:36,080
learning stuff because like there's more

2658
01:44:36,080 --> 01:44:37,600
information more readily accessible

2659
01:44:37,600 --> 01:44:39,840
um one of the things i've i've always

2660
01:44:39,840 --> 01:44:41,280
learned is like especially when you sort

2661
01:44:41,280 --> 01:44:42,560
of get your first you know job in the

2662
01:44:42,560 --> 01:44:44,400
space you work with people it's like

2663
01:44:44,400 --> 01:44:46,239
uh don't be afraid to like as much as

2664
01:44:46,239 --> 01:44:47,440
possible when somebody sees something

2665
01:44:47,440 --> 01:44:48,239
new where they

2666
01:44:48,239 --> 01:44:49,840
present something like really learn from

2667
01:44:49,840 --> 01:44:51,520
it and like extract that technique and

2668
01:44:51,520 --> 01:44:52,480
use it yourself

2669
01:44:52,480 --> 01:44:54,080
um because a lot of times you know

2670
01:44:54,080 --> 01:44:55,520
security at least in my experience

2671
01:44:55,520 --> 01:44:56,639
there's like a lot of like hidden

2672
01:44:56,639 --> 01:44:57,920
knowledge that's just like oh some

2673
01:44:57,920 --> 01:44:59,440
random person does some trick and you

2674
01:44:59,440 --> 01:45:00,719
you may you could easily just like not

2675
01:45:00,719 --> 01:45:02,719
notice it and not pay attention but

2676
01:45:02,719 --> 01:45:03,760
this could be something really useful

2677
01:45:03,760 --> 01:45:05,920
later on so like i always try to like

2678
01:45:05,920 --> 01:45:07,840
especially like the more you know it can

2679
01:45:07,840 --> 01:45:09,679
be easier to say like i know all the

2680
01:45:09,679 --> 01:45:10,719
stuff i won't listen

2681
01:45:10,719 --> 01:45:12,880
for new stuff but really always keep an

2682
01:45:12,880 --> 01:45:14,000
open mind and be like

2683
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:15,600
okay so that actually this person was

2684
01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:17,040
able to get this working so what did

2685
01:45:17,040 --> 01:45:18,560
what are you doing that i didn't do that

2686
01:45:18,560 --> 01:45:20,719
like i can absorb and like learn from

2687
01:45:20,719 --> 01:45:22,560
and the other thing i'll say is like you

2688
01:45:22,560 --> 01:45:24,320
don't have to be born a genius to do

2689
01:45:24,320 --> 01:45:27,119
this job uh i definitely am not like a

2690
01:45:27,119 --> 01:45:28,719
um i wasn't born an extremely smart

2691
01:45:28,719 --> 01:45:30,239
person it's like i said it took a lot of

2692
01:45:30,239 --> 01:45:31,840
like me banging my head against the same

2693
01:45:31,840 --> 01:45:33,199
things before i'm like

2694
01:45:33,199 --> 01:45:35,520
i get it now so if you're you know if

2695
01:45:35,520 --> 01:45:36,560
you're running into stuff and you don't

2696
01:45:36,560 --> 01:45:37,360
get it

2697
01:45:37,360 --> 01:45:39,679
that's 100 exactly what i ran into and

2698
01:45:39,679 --> 01:45:41,040
it's completely fine like

2699
01:45:41,040 --> 01:45:43,119
you know there's no there's no magical

2700
01:45:43,119 --> 01:45:44,400
like only these people can do it

2701
01:45:44,400 --> 01:45:45,520
everybody just takes time

2702
01:45:45,520 --> 01:45:47,199
you know learn learn your own pace like

2703
01:45:47,199 --> 01:45:48,800
keep trying so

2704
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:50,400
but yeah definitely understanding like

2705
01:45:50,400 --> 01:45:52,000
how like one of my favorite security

2706
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:53,360
books in matt knows this

2707
01:45:53,360 --> 01:45:55,600
is the the tangled web which is it's a

2708
01:45:55,600 --> 01:45:57,199
little dated at this point

2709
01:45:57,199 --> 01:46:00,880
but um it's it's it's it's uh the title

2710
01:46:00,880 --> 01:46:02,239
is like you know how to secure modern

2711
01:46:02,239 --> 01:46:03,199
web applications

2712
01:46:03,199 --> 01:46:04,880
but the book is actually just about like

2713
01:46:04,880 --> 01:46:06,400
how browsers work

2714
01:46:06,400 --> 01:46:08,000
it doesn't teach you like there's

2715
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:09,520
nothing in there about like burp

2716
01:46:09,520 --> 01:46:11,679
or you know sql injection or anything

2717
01:46:11,679 --> 01:46:12,560
like that

2718
01:46:12,560 --> 01:46:14,719
um that's often you know there's other

2719
01:46:14,719 --> 01:46:16,719
great books on those topics like uh the

2720
01:46:16,719 --> 01:46:17,920
web hackers handbook

2721
01:46:17,920 --> 01:46:19,760
but tangled web is just about like how

2722
01:46:19,760 --> 01:46:21,440
browsers work and like the different

2723
01:46:21,440 --> 01:46:23,440
quirks and like the different rfcs and

2724
01:46:23,440 --> 01:46:23,920
like

2725
01:46:23,920 --> 01:46:25,679
how different urls are parsed between

2726
01:46:25,679 --> 01:46:27,920
different browsers and all the nuances

2727
01:46:27,920 --> 01:46:28,639
with that

2728
01:46:28,639 --> 01:46:30,000
and i found that to be like one of the

2729
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,239
best like security books i've ever read

2730
01:46:32,239 --> 01:46:32,639
because

2731
01:46:32,639 --> 01:46:34,800
even though it's not about

2732
01:46:34,800 --> 01:46:36,080
vulnerabilities and stuff

2733
01:46:36,080 --> 01:46:39,360
necessarily so yeah i think one last

2734
01:46:39,360 --> 01:46:40,560
thing to wrap that up is

2735
01:46:40,560 --> 01:46:43,360
um actually to measure yourself against

2736
01:46:43,360 --> 01:46:44,960
your own progress don't measure yourself

2737
01:46:44,960 --> 01:46:45,760
against like

2738
01:46:45,760 --> 01:46:47,520
if i measured myself against these two i

2739
01:46:47,520 --> 01:46:49,440
would have a big conflicts

2740
01:46:49,440 --> 01:46:52,080
um and then the other one i would say is

2741
01:46:52,080 --> 01:46:52,960
um

2742
01:46:52,960 --> 01:46:54,719
learn to write well i think red teaming

2743
01:46:54,719 --> 01:46:55,760
that's one skill that people don't

2744
01:46:55,760 --> 01:46:56,960
highlight now

2745
01:46:56,960 --> 01:46:59,040
a lot of reports you need to articulate

2746
01:46:59,040 --> 01:47:00,320
why something broke and how

2747
01:47:00,320 --> 01:47:01,679
and when you start doing that you

2748
01:47:01,679 --> 01:47:03,199
understand the concepts behind it

2749
01:47:03,199 --> 01:47:04,560
because if you can't explain it

2750
01:47:04,560 --> 01:47:06,800
that means you go back read understand

2751
01:47:06,800 --> 01:47:08,239
come back and do it better

2752
01:47:08,239 --> 01:47:11,440
so writing is a super valuable scheme

2753
01:47:11,440 --> 01:47:14,639
that's the fine technique but yeah

2754
01:47:14,639 --> 01:47:16,800
uh yeah i can certainly say it from uh

2755
01:47:16,800 --> 01:47:17,840
from a consultancy

2756
01:47:17,840 --> 01:47:19,920
bishop fox is uh pretty heavy on the

2757
01:47:19,920 --> 01:47:22,000
writing skills um

2758
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,239
to the point where like we often or i

2759
01:47:24,239 --> 01:47:25,520
think we still do this we give like

2760
01:47:25,520 --> 01:47:27,040
writing challenges to applicants while

2761
01:47:27,040 --> 01:47:28,159
they're going through the application

2762
01:47:28,159 --> 01:47:29,520
process to see

2763
01:47:29,520 --> 01:47:30,960
because we want to gauge how good they

2764
01:47:30,960 --> 01:47:33,760
are at writing um and like that's that's

2765
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:35,280
definitely an underrated skill i

2766
01:47:35,280 --> 01:47:36,880
definitely created so yeah i've even

2767
01:47:36,880 --> 01:47:37,440
taken like

2768
01:47:37,440 --> 01:47:39,119
going out like leaving consulting going

2769
01:47:39,119 --> 01:47:40,239
to the private security world like it

2770
01:47:40,239 --> 01:47:41,840
still is super useful just in the fact

2771
01:47:41,840 --> 01:47:42,880
that you like if you're going to write

2772
01:47:42,880 --> 01:47:44,400
it for a report like

2773
01:47:44,400 --> 01:47:46,480
it it looks so much better and like such

2774
01:47:46,480 --> 01:47:47,679
a better quality of work when you can

2775
01:47:47,679 --> 01:47:48,239
like you know

2776
01:47:48,239 --> 01:47:49,600
send an email that like looks really

2777
01:47:49,600 --> 01:47:50,880
good and you can like write a report

2778
01:47:50,880 --> 01:47:52,480
that looks like very formal and like

2779
01:47:52,480 --> 01:47:54,480
easy to navigate like that skill is like

2780
01:47:54,480 --> 01:47:55,520
super transferable

2781
01:47:55,520 --> 01:47:59,360
so absolutely thank you again so much

2782
01:47:59,360 --> 01:48:00,880
for uh taking some time out of this

2783
01:48:00,880 --> 01:48:02,159
short period where we get to all get

2784
01:48:02,159 --> 01:48:04,400
together and see our old friends

2785

01:48:12,320 --> 01:48:13,440

and we'll go on break awesome and i like

2791
01:48:16,880 --> 01:48:18,000

part so thank you again guys i really

2793
01:48:20,560 --> 01:48:21,679
appreciate your your help and

2794
01:48:21,679 --> 01:48:23,360
collaboration here

2795
01:48:23,360 --> 01:48:27,520
amazing thoughts in there now i want to

2796
01:48:27,520 --> 01:48:29,360
announce something that i'm going to put

2797
01:48:29,360 --> 01:48:30,560
barrett on the spot

2798
01:48:30,560 --> 01:48:33,360
but we stay tuned for some upcoming

2799
01:48:33,360 --> 01:48:34,320
giveaways

2800
01:48:34,320 --> 01:48:36,080
we're going to be announcing a few

2801
01:48:36,080 --> 01:48:37,679
throughout the days yesterday we

2802
01:48:37,679 --> 01:48:41,119
gave three awa courses

2803
01:48:41,119 --> 01:48:44,719
with 60 day labs from offensive security

2804
01:48:44,719 --> 01:48:46,320
today stay tuned we're going to be

2805
01:48:46,320 --> 01:48:48,320
announcing several forms where you can

2806
01:48:48,320 --> 01:48:49,520
participate

2807
01:48:49,520 --> 01:48:51,840
and basically you will just provide your

2808
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:52,560
ctf

2809
01:48:52,560 --> 01:48:55,600
handle and your discord handle and we'll

2810
01:48:55,600 --> 01:48:58,000
we'll of course you know look for you

2811
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,239
but yesterday we actually had three

hello everyone i'm barry darnell from

2871
02:02:12,719 --> 02:02:14,480
the red team village and today we are

2872
02:02:14,480 --> 02:02:16,080
here with omar santos from the red team

2873
02:02:16,080 --> 02:02:17,920
village as well as our guest ipsec from

2874
02:02:17,920 --> 02:02:18,719
hack the box

2875
02:02:18,719 --> 02:02:22,480
hey guys what's going on hello

2876
02:02:22,480 --> 02:02:24,480
uh ipsec hack the box has been a long

2877
02:02:24,480 --> 02:02:26,239
time supporter of the village

2878
02:02:26,239 --> 02:02:28,880
can you tell me more about the company

2879
02:02:28,880 --> 02:02:29,760
yeah um

2880
02:02:29,760 --> 02:02:32,080
hack the box is a hands-on security

2881
02:02:32,080 --> 02:02:33,679
training platform and our main goal is

2882
02:02:33,679 --> 02:02:35,040
to make good training

2883
02:02:35,040 --> 02:02:37,280
readily available to anyone in the world

2884
02:02:37,280 --> 02:02:39,199
if you're new to a topic or

2885
02:02:39,199 --> 02:02:41,119
just the field in general we have hack

2886
02:02:41,119 --> 02:02:42,400
the box academy

2887
02:02:42,400 --> 02:02:44,000
and it's a guided learning experience

2888
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:45,280
which just means we have written

2889
02:02:45,280 --> 02:02:47,199
material in hands-on labs

2890
02:02:47,199 --> 02:02:48,719
and again when building this

2891
02:02:48,719 --> 02:02:51,599
accessibility was our number one desire

2892
02:02:51,599 --> 02:02:53,599
so we created the prone box which allows

2893
02:02:53,599 --> 02:02:55,199
you to have a

2894
02:02:55,199 --> 02:02:56,960
whole operating system in your browser

2895
02:02:56,960 --> 02:02:58,639
so the machine you're doing this

2896
02:02:58,639 --> 02:03:00,239
learning on doesn't even have to be

2897
02:03:00,239 --> 02:03:01,440
powerful you can do it on like a

2898
02:03:01,440 --> 02:03:02,080
chromebook

2899
02:03:02,080 --> 02:03:03,840
if for some reason you want to do it on

2900
02:03:03,840 --> 02:03:05,679
a phone you can i wouldn't recommend

2901
02:03:05,679 --> 02:03:06,480
that

2902
02:03:06,480 --> 02:03:08,320
but everything's done within a web

2903
02:03:08,320 --> 02:03:10,320
browser if you want to bring your own os

2904
02:03:10,320 --> 02:03:12,159
we also provide a vpn pack for you so

2905
02:03:12,159 --> 02:03:14,400
you can join your os to the vpn

2906
02:03:14,400 --> 02:03:16,960
and go on learning in addition to the

2907
02:03:16,960 --> 02:03:19,119
academy we have unguided learning which

2908
02:03:19,119 --> 02:03:20,639
is what we're most famous for

2909
02:03:20,639 --> 02:03:22,400
this is the weekly challenges machines

2910
02:03:22,400 --> 02:03:24,480
or entire like networks we put out on

2911
02:03:24,480 --> 02:03:25,440
the platform

2912
02:03:25,440 --> 02:03:27,119
and that we ask people not to publicly

2913
02:03:27,119 --> 02:03:28,719
talk about these challenges until they

2914
02:03:28,719 --> 02:03:29,520
retire

2915
02:03:29,520 --> 02:03:31,920
which is typically 20 weeks this is my

2916
02:03:31,920 --> 02:03:33,520
favorite and what i credit most of my

2917
02:03:33,520 --> 02:03:35,199
success to because it really enforces

2918
02:03:35,199 --> 02:03:37,199
building good social relationships

2919
02:03:37,199 --> 02:03:38,960
that not only help get you the help when

2920
02:03:38,960 --> 02:03:40,480
you need it but also

2921
02:03:40,480 --> 02:03:42,960
when teaching it often validates your

2922
02:03:42,960 --> 02:03:44,639
understanding of it and it's proven to

2923
02:03:44,639 --> 02:03:46,480
help memory retention

2924
02:03:46,480 --> 02:03:48,960
so i have a lot of friends from my in my

2925
02:03:48,960 --> 02:03:51,199
social network that include barry i met

2926
02:03:51,199 --> 02:03:51,520
him

2927
02:03:51,520 --> 02:03:53,840
through another friend who met him at

2928
02:03:53,840 --> 02:03:54,880
derbycon which is

2929
02:03:54,880 --> 02:03:57,360
a similar event of red team village and

2930
02:03:57,360 --> 02:03:58,560
the funny thing is

2931
02:03:58,560 --> 02:04:00,639
both my other friend kyle and barry all

2932
02:04:00,639 --> 02:04:01,840
lived within like

2933
02:04:01,840 --> 02:04:05,040
30 miles of each other but we met like

2934
02:04:05,040 --> 02:04:07,199
hundreds of miles away so definitely

2935
02:04:07,199 --> 02:04:09,040
like

2936
02:04:09,040 --> 02:04:11,760
important to go view and travel and

2937
02:04:11,760 --> 02:04:13,199
experience the community because you'll

2938
02:04:13,199 --> 02:04:14,400
never know who you find

2939
02:04:14,400 --> 02:04:16,400
and how close people may be it's a small

2940
02:04:16,400 --> 02:04:18,159
world

2941
02:04:18,159 --> 02:04:19,679
absolutely i think we've all been cooped

2942
02:04:19,679 --> 02:04:21,520
up these last few months here i think a

2943
02:04:21,520 --> 02:04:22,960
lot of people are excited to go in

2944
02:04:22,960 --> 02:04:24,159
person to las vegas

2945
02:04:24,159 --> 02:04:26,239
to attend def con and so we're really

2946
02:04:26,239 --> 02:04:27,920
excited to see some of our old friends

2947
02:04:27,920 --> 02:04:29,280
and make some new ones

2948
02:04:29,280 --> 02:04:31,599
um speaking of of that community you

2949
02:04:31,599 --> 02:04:32,960
know hack the box is a very

2950
02:04:32,960 --> 02:04:34,960
vibrant community both on their discord

2951
02:04:34,960 --> 02:04:36,639
as well as all over twitter can you tell

2952
02:04:36,639 --> 02:04:37,679
me a little bit more

2953
02:04:37,679 --> 02:04:39,360
about the people behind hack the box

2954
02:04:39,360 --> 02:04:40,639
maybe some projects that you might be

2955
02:04:40,639 --> 02:04:41,360
working on

2956
02:04:41,360 --> 02:04:43,920
yeah we have a innovation team that's

2957
02:04:43,920 --> 02:04:44,560
designed

2958
02:04:44,560 --> 02:04:46,639
at like pushing what we think is the

2959
02:04:46,639 --> 02:04:47,679
limit

2960
02:04:47,679 --> 02:04:49,840
so typically most of our stuff is either

2961
02:04:49,840 --> 02:04:51,760
a docker or a vmware image

2962
02:04:51,760 --> 02:04:54,320
and the innovation team is looking into

2963
02:04:54,320 --> 02:04:56,000
google cloud aws

2964
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:59,119
and azure to provide a pro lab called

2965
02:04:59,119 --> 02:05:01,199
black sky which is just based upon

2966
02:05:01,199 --> 02:05:03,040
those types of features so if you want

2967
02:05:03,040 --> 02:05:04,719
to exploit im or do a lot of those

2968
02:05:04,719 --> 02:05:06,079
unique cloud things black sky

2969
02:05:06,079 --> 02:05:08,800
lab is going to be that we also have as

2970
02:05:08,800 --> 02:05:10,400
you said the discord community we have

2971
02:05:10,400 --> 02:05:12,000
roadrunner who runs that

2972
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:13,520
and they help provide a lot of good

2973
02:05:13,520 --> 02:05:15,760
support and just learning to anyone

2974
02:05:15,760 --> 02:05:18,480
in addition to a bunch of ctfs i think

2975
02:05:18,480 --> 02:05:20,480
we run the ctf like every other month or

2976
02:05:20,480 --> 02:05:23,360
something it's insane

2977
02:05:23,360 --> 02:05:26,159
well talking about the ctf and talking

2978
02:05:26,159 --> 02:05:27,360
about all the activities you know

2979
02:05:27,360 --> 02:05:28,800
throughout the years you guys

2980
02:05:28,800 --> 02:05:31,119
have supported the red team village

2981
02:05:31,119 --> 02:05:32,000
tremendously

2982
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:34,320
so first of all thank you and thank you

2983
02:05:34,320 --> 02:05:35,679
hack the box

2984
02:05:35,679 --> 02:05:38,400
so one of i got a couple of questions

2985
02:05:38,400 --> 02:05:40,000
right so one of the questions is you

2986
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:40,480
know

2987
02:05:40,480 --> 02:05:43,040
what would you say that is the best part

2988
02:05:43,040 --> 02:05:44,639
about sponsoring

2989
02:05:44,639 --> 02:05:46,079
community efforts like the red team

2990
02:05:46,079 --> 02:05:48,000
village ctf this year

2991
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:49,760
i mean obviously it helps the community

2992
02:05:49,760 --> 02:05:51,440
grow and most of my like

2993
02:05:51,440 --> 02:05:53,440
relationships i can credit almost all my

2994
02:05:53,440 --> 02:05:54,639
professional success

2995
02:05:54,639 --> 02:05:57,040
as to leeching off my friends knowledge

2996
02:05:57,040 --> 02:05:59,119
because no one can know everything

2997
02:05:59,119 --> 02:06:00,880
and i can't speak for anyone i hack the

2998
02:06:00,880 --> 02:06:02,159
box but i know

2999
02:06:02,159 --> 02:06:04,079
a bunch of my friends at hack the box

3000
02:06:04,079 --> 02:06:06,159
are super excited to play a ctf built by

3001
02:06:06,159 --> 02:06:07,280
other people

3002
02:06:07,280 --> 02:06:08,800
and we've played the red team village

3003
02:06:08,800 --> 02:06:10,800
cts for quite a while um

3004
02:06:10,800 --> 02:06:12,800
i vaguely remember one i think two years

3005
02:06:12,800 --> 02:06:15,040
ago that involved exploiting a printer

3006
02:06:15,040 --> 02:06:16,639
which was new to all of us

3007
02:06:16,639 --> 02:06:19,840
we were all like big binary exploit

3008
02:06:19,840 --> 02:06:20,960
people and then threw a different

3009
02:06:20,960 --> 02:06:22,800
architecture at us that we never really

3010
02:06:22,800 --> 02:06:24,639
experimented with and it was just a lot

3011
02:06:24,639 --> 02:06:25,920
of fun to play

3012
02:06:25,920 --> 02:06:29,119
so super excited to sponsor an event

3013
02:06:29,119 --> 02:06:30,800
that we can participate in

3014
02:06:30,800 --> 02:06:32,800
and learn new things to hopefully put

3015
02:06:32,800 --> 02:06:34,719
out on our platform in the future

3016
02:06:34,719 --> 02:06:36,880
thank you appreciate that and i think

3017
02:06:36,880 --> 02:06:37,840
that you're hitting

3018
02:06:37,840 --> 02:06:39,920
my next question which is why do you

3019
02:06:39,920 --> 02:06:41,840
think sponsoring the

3020
02:06:41,840 --> 02:06:43,520
the retin village this year is so

3021
02:06:43,520 --> 02:06:45,599
important for the community

3022
02:06:45,599 --> 02:06:50,000
yeah um number one it's important to

3023
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:53,440
like with covet and all we want to

3024
02:06:53,440 --> 02:06:54,800
increase the socialization and

3025
02:06:54,800 --> 02:06:56,560
everything we've been all cooped up

3026
02:06:56,560 --> 02:06:59,119
and the red team village incorporates

3027
02:06:59,119 --> 02:07:00,400
all of hack the boxes

3028
02:07:00,400 --> 02:07:01,679
things the main thing was being

3029
02:07:01,679 --> 02:07:04,000
accessible um if you can't travel you

3030
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:06,079
can do it online and form a team

3031
02:07:06,079 --> 02:07:08,239
and additionally if you want it's

3032
02:07:08,239 --> 02:07:10,000
available for the high cost of zero

3033
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:11,040
dollars which

3034
02:07:11,040 --> 02:07:13,119
aligns with kind of our methodology and

3035
02:07:13,119 --> 02:07:14,079
what we want

3036
02:07:14,079 --> 02:07:16,079
all our machines are available for free

3037
02:07:16,079 --> 02:07:17,520
for a time and then once they retire

3038
02:07:17,520 --> 02:07:18,560
then you have to pay

3039
02:07:18,560 --> 02:07:20,800
a small fee to gain access to it because

3040
02:07:20,800 --> 02:07:22,320
hosting 150

3041
02:07:22,320 --> 02:07:24,560
images permanently would just be

3042
02:07:24,560 --> 02:07:26,000
expensive can't do that for

3043
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:28,719
free um additionally i believe infosec

3044
02:07:28,719 --> 02:07:29,840
is a unique profession

3045
02:07:29,840 --> 02:07:31,520
where team building activities have

3046
02:07:31,520 --> 02:07:32,880
immeasurable impact

3047
02:07:32,880 --> 02:07:35,280
if you look at the non-infrastruct teams

3048
02:07:35,280 --> 02:07:36,960
they still do team building activities

3049
02:07:36,960 --> 02:07:38,480
like you have that gimmicky trust fall

3050
02:07:38,480 --> 02:07:40,239
and escape room etc

3051
02:07:40,239 --> 02:07:42,239
and they're doing them just to help

3052
02:07:42,239 --> 02:07:43,599
build that social bond between

3053
02:07:43,599 --> 02:07:45,199
co-workers so you know it's valuable

3054
02:07:45,199 --> 02:07:46,800
since that's the only thing they care

3055
02:07:46,800 --> 02:07:47,520
about

3056
02:07:47,520 --> 02:07:49,920
in the infosec world we have ctfs that

3057
02:07:49,920 --> 02:07:51,920
is just like that on steroids

3058
02:07:51,920 --> 02:07:53,760
it has all that same social bonding

3059
02:07:53,760 --> 02:07:55,599
benefits like i mentioned earlier

3060
02:07:55,599 --> 02:07:58,560
i play cts with barry i've played cts

3061
02:07:58,560 --> 02:08:00,639
with oxdf mr ben

3062
02:08:00,639 --> 02:08:02,400
john hammond a bunch of people i just

3063
02:08:02,400 --> 02:08:03,760
have a lot of fun with playing these

3064
02:08:03,760 --> 02:08:06,239
ctfs along with coworkers

3065
02:08:06,239 --> 02:08:08,960
and in addition to that social bond that

3066
02:08:08,960 --> 02:08:10,000
you build

3067
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:11,760
it also gives you a lot of techniques

3068
02:08:11,760 --> 02:08:13,280
that you may be able to immediately

3069
02:08:13,280 --> 02:08:15,440
provide your work value because

3070
02:08:15,440 --> 02:08:17,520
you're joining hands with a bunch of

3071
02:08:17,520 --> 02:08:19,599
other companies to learn things

3072
02:08:19,599 --> 02:08:21,840
it wouldn't surprise me if you do the

3073
02:08:21,840 --> 02:08:23,199
ctf and then

3074
02:08:23,199 --> 02:08:24,639
find something you can immediately turn

3075
02:08:24,639 --> 02:08:26,480
around to do on your job

3076
02:08:26,480 --> 02:08:28,719
i remember doing almost any pro lab i'll

3077
02:08:28,719 --> 02:08:30,560
use offer as an example where the fret

3078
02:08:30,560 --> 02:08:32,560
hold involves exploiting splunk

3079
02:08:32,560 --> 02:08:34,960
and i had a pen test that i kept missing

3080
02:08:34,960 --> 02:08:36,000
this vector on

3081
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:37,840
because i just didn't know it and mr ben

3082
02:08:37,840 --> 02:08:39,440
put it in that pro lab

3083
02:08:39,440 --> 02:08:40,960
so when i did that it was just like an

3084
02:08:40,960 --> 02:08:42,960
eye-opening thing of oh god what have i

3085
02:08:42,960 --> 02:08:44,000
been missing

3086
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:46,880
so definitely the big social aspect is

3087
02:08:46,880 --> 02:08:48,079
huge here

3088
02:08:48,079 --> 02:08:51,119
awesome and and uh i couldn't agree more

3089
02:08:51,119 --> 02:08:51,520
and

3090
02:08:51,520 --> 02:08:52,960
and once again you know thank you i have

3091
02:08:52,960 --> 02:08:55,119
one more last question when

3092
02:08:55,119 --> 02:08:56,880
it's around the benefits that your team

3093
02:08:56,880 --> 02:08:58,719
actually will receive

3094
02:08:58,719 --> 02:09:00,639
by participating at the you know that

3095
02:09:00,639 --> 02:09:03,440
con written village ctf this year

3096
02:09:03,440 --> 02:09:05,199
yeah um hack the box and red team

3097
02:09:05,199 --> 02:09:07,440
village are almost anonymous and what we

3098
02:09:07,440 --> 02:09:08,079
provide

3099
02:09:08,079 --> 02:09:11,280
and our methodologies so the only

3100
02:09:11,280 --> 02:09:12,560
unfortunate thing is the red team

3101
02:09:12,560 --> 02:09:14,880
village ctf is a yearly thing while hack

3102
02:09:14,880 --> 02:09:16,800
the box produces new things on a weekly

3103
02:09:16,800 --> 02:09:17,679
basis

3104
02:09:17,679 --> 02:09:19,440
it's probably not to the scale that red

3105
02:09:19,440 --> 02:09:20,880
team village will be doing just because

3106
02:09:20,880 --> 02:09:22,000
it's constant

3107
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:24,159
but if you're itching to do more after

3108
02:09:24,159 --> 02:09:25,840
doing the ctf definitely check out the

3109
02:09:25,840 --> 02:09:27,440
platform if you haven't

3110
02:09:27,440 --> 02:09:29,119
and go over to hack the box because i'm

3111
02:09:29,119 --> 02:09:30,400
sure you'll love the challenges we put

3112
02:09:30,400 --> 02:09:31,679
on the site

3113

02:09:53,920 --> 02:09:57,520

3245
02:14:02,159 --> 02:14:05,599
different players our overall like our

3246
02:14:05,599 --> 02:14:06,800
capped out score

3247

3249
02:14:13,840 --> 02:14:14,719
challenges

3250
02:14:14,719 --> 02:14:16,719

3252
02:14:18,560 --> 02:14:19,360

3253
02:14:19,360 --> 02:14:21,360

3254
02:14:21,360 --> 02:14:23,119

and 10 000 incorrect black submissions

3258
02:14:28,880 --> 02:14:30,560

02:16:13,360 --> 02:16:14,719
of that so let's start

3307
02:16:14,719 --> 02:16:19,050
30 seconds do a 30 second countdown from

3308
02:16:19,050 --> 02:16:29,710
[Music]

3309
02:16:30,840 --> 02:16:33,840
now

3310
02:16:34,218 --> 02:16:39,489
[Music]

3311
02:16:47,599 --> 02:16:49,359
all right those 30 seconds going pretty

3312
02:16:49,359 --> 02:16:50,718
fast

3313
02:16:50,718 --> 02:16:53,840
all right so we are closed out

3314
02:16:53,840 --> 02:16:56,959
oh nope i was just going to pass it over

3315
02:16:56,959 --> 02:16:58,318
hey scroll down a little bit omar let's

3316
02:16:58,318 --> 02:16:59,679
see let's see where we're on the cut

3317
02:16:59,679 --> 02:17:00,080
here

3318
02:17:00,080 --> 02:17:03,920
um right there so unfortunately

3319
02:17:03,920 --> 02:17:06,799
uh dark wolf solutions it looks like you

3320
02:17:06,799 --> 02:17:08,638
you were just shy of the points to make

3321
02:17:08,638 --> 02:17:09,840
it into finals

3322
02:17:09,840 --> 02:17:12,478
we've got cia and above all of those

3323
02:17:12,478 --> 02:17:14,478
teams are now in the finals

3324
02:17:14,478 --> 02:17:16,478
what i'm asking is for just the team

3325
02:17:16,478 --> 02:17:18,000
lead the team captain

3326
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:21,120
please dm nop researcher on discord

3327
02:17:21,120 --> 02:17:23,519
uh let them know uh what team you're on

3328
02:17:23,519 --> 02:17:25,120
as well as what email was used to

3329
02:17:25,120 --> 02:17:26,160
register that team

3330
02:17:26,160 --> 02:17:27,920
so we can validate that information

3331
02:17:27,920 --> 02:17:29,200
we've got an hour now where we're going

3332
02:17:29,200 --> 02:17:30,638
to transition we're going to get you a

3333
02:17:30,638 --> 02:17:32,558
package that has your vpn

3334
02:17:32,558 --> 02:17:35,679
uh your vpn configuration for your own

3335
02:17:35,679 --> 02:17:36,638
private network

3336
02:17:36,638 --> 02:17:38,398
so for everyone who's watching so uh

3337
02:17:38,398 --> 02:17:39,920
what the finalists get to do now

3338
02:17:39,920 --> 02:17:42,000
is we're going to move into our scenario

3339
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:43,040
where we have

3340
02:17:43,040 --> 02:17:46,080
two uh windows networks that will be uh

3341
02:17:46,080 --> 02:17:46,879
will be stood up

3342
02:17:46,879 --> 02:17:49,359
in a cloud environment uh for safety

3343
02:17:49,359 --> 02:17:50,558
we're gonna keep everything contained

3344
02:17:50,558 --> 02:17:52,240
within a vpn so it's a little bit

3345
02:17:52,240 --> 02:17:54,000
gamified just keep that in mind

3346
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:55,120
but you'll be able to have your whole

3347
02:17:55,120 --> 02:17:56,959
team connect to that vpn one thing that

3348
02:17:56,959 --> 02:17:58,478
we always recommend is especially if you

3349
02:17:58,478 --> 02:17:59,679
have a big team because we know those

3350
02:17:59,679 --> 02:18:00,160
top

3351
02:18:00,160 --> 02:18:02,718
five ten uh those those top five ten

3352
02:18:02,718 --> 02:18:04,558
teams are really huge teams

3353
02:18:04,558 --> 02:18:06,638
we try to do things to kind of slow down

3354
02:18:06,638 --> 02:18:08,398
a huge team the uh the infrastructure

3355
02:18:08,398 --> 02:18:08,959
itself

3356
02:18:08,959 --> 02:18:10,718
the instances that we're using you can't

3357
02:18:10,718 --> 02:18:12,558
have you know 45 shells on so you're

3358
02:18:12,558 --> 02:18:13,840
going to have to work together

3359
02:18:13,840 --> 02:18:15,120
there's going to be little pieces of

3360
02:18:15,120 --> 02:18:16,478
intel here and there that you want to

3361
02:18:16,478 --> 02:18:17,679
share across

3362
02:18:17,679 --> 02:18:19,599
and and just in general you you want to

3363
02:18:19,599 --> 02:18:21,120
work together as a team on this next

3364
02:18:21,120 --> 02:18:21,519
part

3365
02:18:21,519 --> 02:18:22,718
it's going to be it's going to be fairly

3366
02:18:22,718 --> 02:18:24,638
immersive the scenario that we talked

3367
02:18:24,638 --> 02:18:26,799
about uh we called this thing lunar fire

3368
02:18:26,799 --> 02:18:28,240
kind of a play on words for the for the

3369
02:18:28,240 --> 02:18:30,478
solar winds uh when we started designing

3370
02:18:30,478 --> 02:18:31,920
this that was that was one of the top

3371
02:18:31,920 --> 02:18:33,359
stories we thought that uh

3372
02:18:33,359 --> 02:18:34,558
we thought that that would be the

3373
02:18:34,558 --> 02:18:35,920
sensational thing that would still be

3374
02:18:35,920 --> 02:18:37,040
holding true today

3375
02:18:37,040 --> 02:18:39,120
little did we know that 400 other things

3376
02:18:39,120 --> 02:18:40,879
were just just huge news

3377
02:18:40,879 --> 02:18:42,398
uh in this industry with all the

3378
02:18:42,398 --> 02:18:44,240
ransomware especially the things that

3379
02:18:44,240 --> 02:18:44,799
have

3380
02:18:44,799 --> 02:18:47,599
affected a lot in the physical realm so

3381
02:18:47,599 --> 02:18:49,519
so lunar fire is our theme

3382
02:18:49,519 --> 02:18:51,439
um that should key you in that there's a

3383
02:18:51,439 --> 02:18:53,599
there's a supply chain attack involved

3384
02:18:53,599 --> 02:18:54,638
in our scenario

3385
02:18:54,638 --> 02:18:56,799
you've got two networks one of them has

3386
02:18:56,799 --> 02:18:58,959
a very small attack surface well another

3387
02:18:58,959 --> 02:19:00,718
one has something that you can go after

3388
02:19:00,718 --> 02:19:03,439
and your your whole point is to get

3389
02:19:03,439 --> 02:19:04,799
through that first network

3390
02:19:04,799 --> 02:19:07,519
and pivot into the next one by hijacking

3391
02:19:07,519 --> 02:19:08,879
that supply chain

3392
02:19:08,879 --> 02:19:11,200
and um and uh and getting you know and

3393
02:19:11,200 --> 02:19:13,040
and getting into the next one

3394
02:19:13,040 --> 02:19:14,959
i think i want to stop talking so i

3395
02:19:14,959 --> 02:19:16,879
don't give any more hints

3396
02:19:16,879 --> 02:19:20,080
um good luck everyone take a break uh

3397
02:19:20,080 --> 02:19:21,840
yeah no good luck everyone like uh

3398
02:19:21,840 --> 02:19:23,040
barrett said

3399
02:19:23,040 --> 02:19:24,638
and there's there's anything else you

3400
02:19:24,638 --> 02:19:26,558
want to mention omar feel free to add it

3401
02:19:26,558 --> 02:19:27,439
i'm just gonna

3402
02:19:27,439 --> 02:19:29,519
drop a little hint for one of my boxes

3403
02:19:29,519 --> 02:19:31,040
i'm just gonna say i like notes

3404
02:19:31,040 --> 02:19:34,478
that's the the hint for mine uh so good

3405
02:19:34,478 --> 02:19:36,080
luck and i'll pass it back to omar

3406
02:19:36,080 --> 02:19:37,920
i've got i've got one more thing to say

3407
02:19:37,920 --> 02:19:39,599
so for folks because a lot of these

3408
02:19:39,599 --> 02:19:41,120
teams we saw last year

3409
02:19:41,120 --> 02:19:43,760
so um one thing i will say is that the

3410
02:19:43,760 --> 02:19:44,478
os

3411
02:19:44,478 --> 02:19:46,799
intelligence aspect of this is not as

3412
02:19:46,799 --> 02:19:48,720
heavy as it was last year i know that we

3413
02:19:48,720 --> 02:19:50,000
had a lot of flags

3414
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:51,359
with that i just don't want you to spend

3415
02:19:51,359 --> 02:19:52,800
a whole lot of cycles there we had a

3416
02:19:52,800 --> 02:19:54,160
whole 24-hour period

3417
02:19:54,160 --> 02:19:55,680
where we had flags everywhere we had

3418
02:19:55,680 --> 02:19:58,080
them on myspace linkedin

3419
02:19:58,080 --> 02:19:59,680
i think i think like we made a fake

3420
02:19:59,680 --> 02:20:01,760
geocities website and put it up there

3421
02:20:01,760 --> 02:20:03,439
so this one it's fairly light but there

3422
02:20:03,439 --> 02:20:05,439
is some um it's going to be spawned off

3423
02:20:05,439 --> 02:20:05,840
of

3424
02:20:05,840 --> 02:20:07,600
that one website that we shared earlier

3425
02:20:07,600 --> 02:20:09,680
the lunarfire dot dev

3426
02:20:09,680 --> 02:20:12,000
um keep in touch on dm with knob

3427
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:13,120
research we want to make sure we get

3428
02:20:13,120 --> 02:20:14,880
contact with all the teams

3429
02:20:14,880 --> 02:20:17,120
and uh and what we've tried to do is put

3430
02:20:17,120 --> 02:20:18,479
some minor hints

3431
02:20:18,479 --> 02:20:20,720
in those personas we created that'll

3432
02:20:20,720 --> 02:20:22,399
help you out in the finals

3433
02:20:22,399 --> 02:20:24,399
so uh you know if you have a big team go

3434
02:20:24,399 --> 02:20:25,760
ahead and set some people

3435
02:20:25,760 --> 02:20:27,200
focused on that to make sure you grab

3436
02:20:27,200 --> 02:20:29,280
those hints

3437
02:20:29,280 --> 02:20:31,520
awesome and once again congratulations

focused on offensive security and

3510
02:30:22,080 --> 02:30:23,520
security as a service

3511
02:30:23,520 --> 02:30:26,479
it's been a wild ride but part of i

3512
02:30:26,479 --> 02:30:27,840

that we go out there and break things

keep people safe

3520
02:30:39,760 --> 02:30:41,680
so it was a really exciting opportunity

3521
02:30:41,680 --> 02:30:43,520
for us to sponsor the red team village

3522

02:30:51,920 --> 02:30:55,040
new ways to grow our team

guys on this call today and

3534
02:31:07,600 --> 02:31:08,800
i would say the first question that we

3535
02:31:08,800 --> 02:31:10,319
kind of want to start off with is kind

3536
02:31:10,319 --> 02:31:12,080
of seeing what you guys would say is the

3537
02:31:12,080 --> 02:31:14,080
best part of being a sponsor for

3538
02:31:14,080 --> 02:31:17,120
an event like this well for bishop fox

3539
02:31:17,120 --> 02:31:18,800
we're avid participants of the greater

3540
02:31:18,800 --> 02:31:20,399
infosec community and we feel that

3541
02:31:20,399 --> 02:31:22,160
sponsorship of conferences and efforts

3542
02:31:22,160 --> 02:31:22,880
like this

3543
02:31:22,880 --> 02:31:24,800
provide a real tangible value to the

3544
02:31:24,800 --> 02:31:26,800
community this ctf in particular

3545
02:31:26,800 --> 02:31:28,080
provides a tremendous amount of

3546
02:31:28,080 --> 02:31:29,359
realistic hands-on

3547
02:31:29,359 --> 02:31:31,120
experiences for those in the offensive

3548
02:31:31,120 --> 02:31:34,240
security particularly red teamers

3549
02:31:34,240 --> 02:31:36,720
yeah no that's that's awesome and i mean

3550
02:31:36,720 --> 02:31:38,160
i'm sure you know this barrett

3551
02:31:38,160 --> 02:31:40,080
with so many reasons that resources out

3552
02:31:40,080 --> 02:31:41,439
there why do you think

3553
02:31:41,439 --> 02:31:43,120
kind of sponsoring something like this

3554
02:31:43,120 --> 02:31:45,040
is so important

3555
02:31:45,040 --> 02:31:47,760
well for one uh this resource is free so

3556
02:31:47,760 --> 02:31:49,600
that barrier of entry is out of the way

3557
02:31:49,600 --> 02:31:51,680
anybody can participate secondly it's

3558
02:31:51,680 --> 02:31:53,840
realistic it mimics real life

3559
02:31:53,840 --> 02:31:55,520
scenarios that we've seen on our

3560
02:31:55,520 --> 02:31:57,280
customer engagements and so it's not

3561
02:31:57,280 --> 02:31:58,479
very esoteric

3562
02:31:58,479 --> 02:32:00,640
it's you know real tools real uh

3563
02:32:00,640 --> 02:32:02,160
situations you might be in

3564
02:32:02,160 --> 02:32:04,000
and it's also beginner friendly it

3565
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:05,680
starts off where everybody can join and

3566
02:32:05,680 --> 02:32:06,880
get something out of it

3567
02:32:06,880 --> 02:32:09,439
but the difficulty ramps up so there's a

3568
02:32:09,439 --> 02:32:10,000
lot for

3569
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:12,399
experienced red teamers to hone their

3570
02:32:12,399 --> 02:32:14,160
skills on

3571
02:32:14,160 --> 02:32:16,240
awesome i know we've kind of just talked

3572
02:32:16,240 --> 02:32:18,319
about the benefits that

3573
02:32:18,319 --> 02:32:20,000
people who are joining the ctf get out

3574
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:21,760
of it but can you kind of talk about the

3575
02:32:21,760 --> 02:32:23,680
benefits bishop fox receives out of

3576
02:32:23,680 --> 02:32:25,680
being a sponsor for the red team village

3577
02:32:25,680 --> 02:32:29,120
ctf event at defcon yeah well

3578
02:32:29,120 --> 02:32:30,720
you know first and foremost we always

3579
02:32:30,720 --> 02:32:32,080
want to give back to the security

3580
02:32:32,080 --> 02:32:33,040
community

3581
02:32:33,040 --> 02:32:35,840
and this is a great way for us to

3582
02:32:35,840 --> 02:32:38,160
interact with the hundreds maybe even

3583
02:32:38,160 --> 02:32:38,880
thousands of

3584
02:32:38,880 --> 02:32:41,439
attendees and participants whether

3585
02:32:41,439 --> 02:32:41,920
they're

3586
02:32:41,920 --> 02:32:45,040
there in person or virtually um it's

3587
02:32:45,040 --> 02:32:45,520
great

3588
02:32:45,520 --> 02:32:47,760
um from where i sit as a recruiter

3589
02:32:47,760 --> 02:32:50,399
because it gives us a chance to

3590
02:32:50,399 --> 02:32:52,479
meet new talent and people who we maybe

3591
02:32:52,479 --> 02:32:54,319
haven't engaged with before

3592
02:32:54,319 --> 02:32:55,920
and that's really important especially

3593
02:32:55,920 --> 02:32:57,680
as we continue to grow

3594
02:32:57,680 --> 02:32:59,760
our two new service lines the continuing

3595
02:32:59,760 --> 02:33:01,600
continuous attack service

3596
02:33:01,600 --> 02:33:04,399
testing team uh that barrett is on and

3597
02:33:04,399 --> 02:33:06,240
our red team

3598
02:33:06,240 --> 02:33:08,479
yeah no i mean everybody knows in the

3599
02:33:08,479 --> 02:33:10,399
security community who bishop fox is

3600
02:33:10,399 --> 02:33:12,000
and i'm sure they would love to know

3601
02:33:12,000 --> 02:33:13,520
about the recruitment

3602
02:33:13,520 --> 02:33:15,680
so i guess what types of people do you

3603
02:33:15,680 --> 02:33:16,720
guys typically

3604
02:33:16,720 --> 02:33:19,680
look for for the team yeah so you know

3605
02:33:19,680 --> 02:33:20,720
what we need

3606
02:33:20,720 --> 02:33:22,640
and what we're hiring for can kind of

3607
02:33:22,640 --> 02:33:24,399
shift month to month so

3608
02:33:24,399 --> 02:33:26,000
in the past if you engage with us and it

3609
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:28,319
wasn't a fit um that might be changing

3610
02:33:28,319 --> 02:33:30,880
so you know always stay in touch um

3611
02:33:30,880 --> 02:33:32,240
first and foremost we look for people

3612
02:33:32,240 --> 02:33:34,080
who are really passionate about security

3613
02:33:34,080 --> 02:33:37,359
because that's definitely who we are and

3614
02:33:37,359 --> 02:33:38,800
you know we're always looking for

3615
02:33:38,800 --> 02:33:41,200
um a diversity of thoughts a diversity

3616
02:33:41,200 --> 02:33:42,640
of backgrounds so

3617
02:33:42,640 --> 02:33:44,000
uh you know we have a lot of people who

3618
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:46,240
came from a pretty like traditional

3619
02:33:46,240 --> 02:33:47,040
career paths

3620
02:33:47,040 --> 02:33:49,040
you know school work but we definitely

3621
02:33:49,040 --> 02:33:50,960
have folks who are self-taught

3622
02:33:50,960 --> 02:33:53,040
who are coming from non-traditional

3623
02:33:53,040 --> 02:33:54,080

02:39:50,640 --> 02:39:52,720
your support really helps uh and it goes

3702
02:39:52,720 --> 02:39:53,760
a long way

3703
02:39:53,760 --> 02:39:55,840
at uh allowing us to provide a big event

3704
02:39:55,840 --> 02:39:58,080
both in person and virtually

3705
02:39:58,080 --> 02:39:59,359
can you tell me a little bit more about

3706
02:39:59,359 --> 02:40:01,200
optiv

3707
02:40:01,200 --> 02:40:03,680
yeah absolutely so to put it very simply

3708
02:40:03,680 --> 02:40:05,680
optiv is a pure play cyber security

3709
02:40:05,680 --> 02:40:06,240
partner

3710
02:40:06,240 --> 02:40:08,800
and what does that mean we aim to do

3711
02:40:08,800 --> 02:40:09,359
secure

3712
02:40:09,359 --> 02:40:11,280
all security all the time right we can

3713
02:40:11,280 --> 02:40:12,960
help in ways of advisory

3714
02:40:12,960 --> 02:40:15,200
deployment and even manage operations

3715
02:40:15,200 --> 02:40:17,120
right so ultimately our goal is very

3716
02:40:17,120 --> 02:40:18,479
simply to

3717
02:40:18,479 --> 02:40:20,479
help organize organizations realize a

3718
02:40:20,479 --> 02:40:22,479
more effective security program

3719
02:40:22,479 --> 02:40:25,039
and posture

3720
02:40:26,319 --> 02:40:28,960
and uh for for both of you specifically

3721
02:40:28,960 --> 02:40:31,359
what do you do at optiv

3722
02:40:31,359 --> 02:40:33,200
so i'm a senior director inside of

3723
02:40:33,200 --> 02:40:34,880
threat management which is a larger

3724
02:40:34,880 --> 02:40:36,399
umbrella but i specifically have the

3725
02:40:36,399 --> 02:40:38,160
privilege of leading our attack and pen

3726
02:40:38,160 --> 02:40:40,960
team so my focus is on the direction of

3727
02:40:40,960 --> 02:40:42,240
success of that team

3728
02:40:42,240 --> 02:40:44,479
and i achieved this largely by enabling

3729
02:40:44,479 --> 02:40:45,920
the great folks around me such as

3730
02:40:45,920 --> 02:40:48,479
mr eidelberg here and i'm a technical

3731
02:40:48,479 --> 02:40:49,439
manager

3732
02:40:49,439 --> 02:40:52,240
under uh attacking pen my primary role

3733
02:40:52,240 --> 02:40:54,080
is leading the adversarial simulation

3734
02:40:54,080 --> 02:40:54,800
services

3735
02:40:54,800 --> 02:40:57,040
this is our branch that focuses

3736
02:40:57,040 --> 02:40:58,000
primarily on red

3737
02:40:58,000 --> 02:41:00,160
and purple team operations my role in

3738
02:41:00,160 --> 02:41:01,120
there is not only

3739
02:41:01,120 --> 02:41:02,560
executing these types of engagements but

3740
02:41:02,560 --> 02:41:04,560
also focusing on helping to innovate the

3741
02:41:04,560 --> 02:41:05,200
team and

3742
02:41:05,200 --> 02:41:07,359
grow more operators to perform these

3743
02:41:07,359 --> 02:41:10,000
types of engagements

3744
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:12,160
all right and uh and for the for that uh

3745
02:41:12,160 --> 02:41:13,120
attack and pen

3746
02:41:13,120 --> 02:41:14,880
practice uh why do you like working

3747
02:41:14,880 --> 02:41:17,120
there

3748
02:41:17,120 --> 02:41:19,920
yeah so for me uh first and foremost uh

3749
02:41:19,920 --> 02:41:21,840
it's it's the close family atmosphere

3750
02:41:21,840 --> 02:41:23,359
that we have on the team

3751
02:41:23,359 --> 02:41:24,720
and what i mean by that is i've been on

3752
02:41:24,720 --> 02:41:26,479
the team for almost nine years now been

3753
02:41:26,479 --> 02:41:27,279
an attack and pen

3754
02:41:27,279 --> 02:41:29,520
the entire time and i'm not alone in

3755
02:41:29,520 --> 02:41:31,040
that there are several other individuals

3756
02:41:31,040 --> 02:41:32,000
on the team

3757
02:41:32,000 --> 02:41:33,439
that have been here for a similar amount

3758
02:41:33,439 --> 02:41:35,040
of time such a such as matt

3759
02:41:35,040 --> 02:41:37,200
himself so what that yield is a really

3760
02:41:37,200 --> 02:41:38,160
good dynamic

3761
02:41:38,160 --> 02:41:40,240
of folks to work well together while we

3762
02:41:40,240 --> 02:41:41,760
simultaneously you know pursue our

3763
02:41:41,760 --> 02:41:43,520
passion about offensive security

3764
02:41:43,520 --> 02:41:44,960
and just to add on to that i would say

3765
02:41:44,960 --> 02:41:46,880
in a single word the community

3766
02:41:46,880 --> 02:41:49,439
uh the team itself honestly strives

3767
02:41:49,439 --> 02:41:50,800
constantly to push the boundaries to

3768
02:41:50,800 --> 02:41:51,680
teach each other

3769
02:41:51,680 --> 02:41:53,600
new things whether or not it's a you

3770
02:41:53,600 --> 02:41:55,680
know failures from previous engagements

3771
02:41:55,680 --> 02:41:56,960
to help educate

3772
02:41:56,960 --> 02:42:00,960
for future tests or even success stories

3773
02:42:00,960 --> 02:42:02,560
it's all about sharing and kind of

3774
02:42:02,560 --> 02:42:03,920
bolstering each other and through

3775
02:42:03,920 --> 02:42:06,319
knowledge sharing

3776
02:42:06,319 --> 02:42:08,399
absolutely and uh you know and the plug

3777
02:42:08,399 --> 02:42:09,760
for that that giving back to the

3778
02:42:09,760 --> 02:42:11,359
community aspect you know i was on your

3779
02:42:11,359 --> 02:42:12,000
github the other

3780
02:42:12,000 --> 02:42:14,160
day and uh i was looking into scarecrow

3781
02:42:14,160 --> 02:42:15,520
and i know i've got that on my list to

3782
02:42:15,520 --> 02:42:16,800
do a deep dive on after

3783
02:42:16,800 --> 02:42:19,120
after defcon you know love love the fact

3784
02:42:19,120 --> 02:42:20,880
that uh you know a lot of big players in

3785
02:42:20,880 --> 02:42:23,040
information security share that research

3786
02:42:23,040 --> 02:42:24,960
share that tooling that they create

3787
02:42:24,960 --> 02:42:28,160
yep that's what we strive to do here

3788
02:42:28,160 --> 02:42:30,399
and for your team um you know what types

3789
02:42:30,399 --> 02:42:31,359
of people work there

3790
02:42:31,359 --> 02:42:34,319
what are their backgrounds so it's a

3791
02:42:34,319 --> 02:42:36,160
good variety of backgrounds right so we

3792
02:42:36,160 --> 02:42:37,279
have folks uh

3793
02:42:37,279 --> 02:42:39,359
some from being a good part of us being

3794
02:42:39,359 --> 02:42:40,479
veterans uh

3795
02:42:40,479 --> 02:42:42,560
to business-minded folks to engineering

3796
02:42:42,560 --> 02:42:44,080
folks et cetera right

3797
02:42:44,080 --> 02:42:45,920
but like i mentioned earlier there's the

3798
02:42:45,920 --> 02:42:47,359
ultimate uh

3799
02:42:47,359 --> 02:42:50,000
commonality right of a shared objective

3800
02:42:50,000 --> 02:42:50,880
of offense

3801
02:42:50,880 --> 02:42:52,399
and passion for offensive security

3802
02:42:52,399 --> 02:42:54,560
testing and then what we qualify that

3803
02:42:54,560 --> 02:42:56,160
success really is helping leave our

3804
02:42:56,160 --> 02:42:57,520
clients better than we found them at the

3805
02:42:57,520 --> 02:42:58,479
end of the day

3806
02:42:58,479 --> 02:43:00,240
and of course you know folks have a very

3807
02:43:00,240 --> 02:43:02,800
specific or can have a specific subset

3808
02:43:02,800 --> 02:43:03,439
of interest

3809
02:43:03,439 --> 02:43:06,640
inside the team that could be of iot to

3810
02:43:06,640 --> 02:43:08,880
embedded to wireless to low level window

3811
02:43:08,880 --> 02:43:10,160
stuff to evasion

3812
02:43:10,160 --> 02:43:11,920
et cetera right so there's definitely

3813
02:43:11,920 --> 02:43:14,000
some sub pockets for people to really go

3814
02:43:14,000 --> 02:43:16,479
a mile deep on

3815
02:43:16,479 --> 02:43:18,720
great and with such a diverse group what

3816
02:43:18,720 --> 02:43:19,920
makes somebody a success

3817
02:43:19,920 --> 02:43:23,279
in amp so aside from

3818
02:43:23,279 --> 02:43:25,279
technical acumen which obviously is held

3819
02:43:25,279 --> 02:43:26,720
you know it's an important quality on

3820
02:43:26,720 --> 02:43:27,680
this specific

3821
02:43:27,680 --> 02:43:30,319
role right uh is the ability to show

3822
02:43:30,319 --> 02:43:30,960
ownership

3823
02:43:30,960 --> 02:43:32,880
in leadership and give back to the team

3824
02:43:32,880 --> 02:43:35,040
um really you know owning a specific

3825
02:43:35,040 --> 02:43:35,600
service

3826
02:43:35,600 --> 02:43:38,160
or an offering helping others mentoring

3827
02:43:38,160 --> 02:43:39,439
et cetera we hold that in

3828
02:43:39,439 --> 02:43:41,760
incredibly high value and then as we

3829
02:43:41,760 --> 02:43:43,680
mentioned earlier with regard to

3830
02:43:43,680 --> 02:43:46,160
like source zero scarecrow right is the

3831
02:43:46,160 --> 02:43:48,000
the public thought leadership to help

3832
02:43:48,000 --> 02:43:49,840
the team immediately and then also give

3833
02:43:49,840 --> 02:43:51,840
back to the community as well

3834
02:43:51,840 --> 02:43:53,439
yep and just to add on to that i would

3835
02:43:53,439 --> 02:43:55,600
say the eagerness to learn and improve

3836
02:43:55,600 --> 02:43:56,880
your tradecraft

3837
02:43:56,880 --> 02:43:59,760
um honestly the ones we see that excel

3838
02:43:59,760 --> 02:44:01,120
the most are the ones that not only

3839
02:44:01,120 --> 02:44:02,319
focus on themselves

3840
02:44:02,319 --> 02:44:05,359
but also make sure that they help their

3841
02:44:05,359 --> 02:44:07,520
fellow teammates or co-workers whether

3842
02:44:07,520 --> 02:44:08,479
or not they're struggling with something

3843
02:44:08,479 --> 02:44:10,000
or helping to help them

3844
02:44:10,000 --> 02:44:12,560
also pursue and grow their talents those

3845
02:44:12,560 --> 02:44:13,439
are the ones that i

3846
02:44:13,439 --> 02:44:16,479
see often have the basic success here

3847
02:44:16,479 --> 02:44:18,160
that's great uh absolutely i mean this

3848
02:44:18,160 --> 02:44:20,000
is this is a team sport uh doing what we

3849
02:44:20,000 --> 02:44:20,720
do

3850
02:44:20,720 --> 02:44:23,279
yep uh for the for the red team village

3851
02:44:23,279 --> 02:44:24,560
one thing that we we uh

3852
02:44:24,560 --> 02:44:27,120
really love to do is is offer a lot of

3853
02:44:27,120 --> 02:44:28,960
uh environments for training we do

3854
02:44:28,960 --> 02:44:30,240
workshops we

3855
02:44:30,240 --> 02:44:31,920
we uh participate in a lot of different

3856
02:44:31,920 --> 02:44:34,160
cons um and one thing

3857
02:44:34,160 --> 02:44:35,760
you know we want to do is bring as many

3858
02:44:35,760 --> 02:44:37,840
people into this community as possible

3859
02:44:37,840 --> 02:44:38,560
and so

3860
02:44:38,560 --> 02:44:40,479
i'd i'd like to ask for both of you you

3861
02:44:40,479 --> 02:44:41,920
know what is your advice for people who

3862
02:44:41,920 --> 02:44:44,840
are interested in cyber security as a

3863
02:44:44,840 --> 02:44:47,120
profession yeah absolutely so i mean

3864
02:44:47,120 --> 02:44:48,000
i'll speak to

3865
02:44:48,000 --> 02:44:49,439
you know the path that i took to get

3866
02:44:49,439 --> 02:44:51,200
here and i think it holds true to the

3867
02:44:51,200 --> 02:44:53,040
to the question right but i think it's

3868
02:44:53,040 --> 02:44:54,880
very important or imperative for folks

3869
02:44:54,880 --> 02:44:55,760
to have a

3870
02:44:55,760 --> 02:44:57,680
a deep foundational understanding as to

3871
02:44:57,680 --> 02:44:59,040
how uh

3872
02:44:59,040 --> 02:45:00,720
things work right so what i mean by that

3873
02:45:00,720 --> 02:45:02,560
is how does active directory work how

3874
02:45:02,560 --> 02:45:03,520
does networking

3875
02:45:03,520 --> 02:45:05,120
function how can you manipulate these

3876
02:45:05,120 --> 02:45:07,439
things to maybe work outside the bounds

3877
02:45:07,439 --> 02:45:09,040
it was intended to right so that can

3878
02:45:09,040 --> 02:45:10,640
apply to even development web

3879
02:45:10,640 --> 02:45:12,640
applications etc

3880
02:45:12,640 --> 02:45:14,399
oftentimes i get asked by people that

3881
02:45:14,399 --> 02:45:15,840
are a bit younger and stay in college or

3882
02:45:15,840 --> 02:45:16,960
whatever and they're like hey should i

3883
02:45:16,960 --> 02:45:18,319
take this security class and become a

3884
02:45:18,319 --> 02:45:19,520
pen tester well

3885
02:45:19,520 --> 02:45:21,520
i would really encourage folks to get a

3886
02:45:21,520 --> 02:45:22,560
lot of those more foundational

3887
02:45:22,560 --> 02:45:23,439
understandings

3888
02:45:23,439 --> 02:45:25,600
just how things work before they move to

3889
02:45:25,600 --> 02:45:27,520
the stage of trying to you know

3890
02:45:27,520 --> 02:45:29,600
move to the adversarial emulation types

3891
02:45:29,600 --> 02:45:30,800
part

3892
02:45:30,800 --> 02:45:32,800
yeah and i would just add to not just

3893
02:45:32,800 --> 02:45:34,640
focus when you're learning on red team

3894
02:45:34,640 --> 02:45:35,359
tactics

3895
02:45:35,359 --> 02:45:37,200
it's incredibly valuable in the current

3896
02:45:37,200 --> 02:45:38,560
landscape to

3897
02:45:38,560 --> 02:45:41,279
focus on both blue and red team having

3898
02:45:41,279 --> 02:45:42,240
that ability to

3899
02:45:42,240 --> 02:45:44,479
speak both can really augment your skill

3900
02:45:44,479 --> 02:45:45,760
set and

3901
02:45:45,760 --> 02:45:47,120
you know this is very much a cat and

3902
02:45:47,120 --> 02:45:48,800
mouse game based industry

3903
02:45:48,800 --> 02:45:51,120
and just knowing both sides their

3904
02:45:51,120 --> 02:45:52,800
playbooks can really help you understand

3905
02:45:52,800 --> 02:45:54,160
the strengths and weaknesses

3906
02:45:54,160 --> 02:45:55,840
of both sides so when you're coming up

3907
02:45:55,840 --> 02:45:57,600
against a red team or a blue team you

3908
02:45:57,600 --> 02:45:58,080
know

3909
02:45:58,080 --> 02:45:59,840
what they are great at what their

3910
02:45:59,840 --> 02:46:01,439
weaknesses are to really help plan out

3911
02:46:01,439 --> 02:46:02,479
those attacks

3912
02:46:02,479 --> 02:46:06,160
or even your knowledge set to improve on

3913
02:46:06,160 --> 02:46:08,560
those that is phenomenal advice uh this

3914
02:46:08,560 --> 02:46:09,279
industry

3915
02:46:09,279 --> 02:46:11,760
is is a challenge because there's so

3916
02:46:11,760 --> 02:46:12,720
much breadth

3917
02:46:12,720 --> 02:46:14,800
and depth that you can take uh not to

3918
02:46:14,800 --> 02:46:16,560
mention that it's evolving every single

3919
02:46:16,560 --> 02:46:16,960
day

3920
02:46:16,960 --> 02:46:18,800
it's impossible to keep up so you've got

3921
02:46:18,800 --> 02:46:20,160
to have that thirst for knowledge

3922
02:46:20,160 --> 02:46:22,080
and and without that foundation it is

3923
02:46:22,080 --> 02:46:23,359
quite difficult i mean you might throw

3924
02:46:23,359 --> 02:46:24,000
that exploit

3925
02:46:24,000 --> 02:46:25,680
and get that get that shell back but

3926
02:46:25,680 --> 02:46:27,439
then the question is what do you do next

3927
02:46:27,439 --> 02:46:30,399
right and so uh great advice i want to

3928
02:46:30,399 --> 02:46:32,160
thank both of you for being here today

3929

02:58:53,520 --> 02:58:55,439
virtually can you tell me a little bit

3967
02:58:55,439 --> 02:58:57,680
more about optiv

3968
02:58:57,680 --> 02:59:00,160
yeah absolutely so to put it very simply

3969
02:59:00,160 --> 02:59:02,240
optiv is a pure play cyber security

3970
02:59:02,240 --> 02:59:02,720
partner

3971
02:59:02,720 --> 02:59:05,359
and what does that mean uh we aim to do

3972
02:59:05,359 --> 02:59:05,920
security

3973
02:59:05,920 --> 02:59:07,760
all security all the time right we can

3974
02:59:07,760 --> 02:59:09,520
help in ways of advisory

3975
02:59:09,520 --> 02:59:11,680
deployment and even manage operations

3976
02:59:11,680 --> 02:59:13,600
right so ultimately our goal is very

3977
02:59:13,600 --> 02:59:14,000
simply

3978
02:59:14,000 --> 02:59:16,960
to help organize organizations realize a

3979
02:59:16,960 --> 02:59:18,000
more effective

3980
02:59:18,000 --> 02:59:21,600
security program and posture

3981
02:59:22,800 --> 02:59:25,279
and uh for for both of you specifically

3982
02:59:25,279 --> 02:59:27,840
what what do you do at

3983
02:59:27,840 --> 02:59:29,760
so i am a senior director inside of

3984
02:59:29,760 --> 02:59:31,359
threat management which is a larger

3985
02:59:31,359 --> 02:59:32,960
umbrella but i specifically have the

3986
02:59:32,960 --> 02:59:34,640
privilege of leading our attack and pen

3987
02:59:34,640 --> 02:59:37,520
team so my focus is on the direction of

3988
02:59:37,520 --> 02:59:38,720
success of that team

3989
02:59:38,720 --> 02:59:40,960
and i achieve this largely by enabling

3990
02:59:40,960 --> 02:59:42,720
the great folks around me such as uh mr

3991
02:59:42,720 --> 02:59:44,240
reidelberg here

3992
02:59:44,240 --> 02:59:47,359
and i'm a technical manager under uh

3993
02:59:47,359 --> 02:59:49,120
attacking pen my primary role is leading

3994
02:59:49,120 --> 02:59:51,279
the adversarial simulation services

3995
02:59:51,279 --> 02:59:53,520
this is our branch that focuses

3996
02:59:53,520 --> 02:59:55,120
primarily on red and purple team

3997
02:59:55,120 --> 02:59:56,160
operations

3998
02:59:56,160 --> 02:59:58,080
my role in there is not only executing

3999
02:59:58,080 --> 02:59:59,359
these types of engagements but also

4000
02:59:59,359 --> 03:00:00,160
focusing on

4001
03:00:00,160 --> 03:00:02,640
helping to innovate the team and grow

4002
03:00:02,640 --> 03:00:04,160
more operators to perform these types of

4003
03:00:04,160 --> 03:00:06,560
engagements

4004
03:00:06,560 --> 03:00:08,720
all right and uh and for the for that uh

4005
03:00:08,720 --> 03:00:09,600
attack and pen

4006
03:00:09,600 --> 03:00:11,359
practice uh why do you like working

4007
03:00:11,359 --> 03:00:13,600
there

4008
03:00:13,600 --> 03:00:16,399
yeah so for me uh first and foremost uh

4009
03:00:16,399 --> 03:00:18,319
it's it's the close family atmosphere

4010
03:00:18,319 --> 03:00:19,600
that we have on the team

4011
03:00:19,600 --> 03:00:21,120
uh and what i mean by that is i've been

4012
03:00:21,120 --> 03:00:22,720
on the team for almost nine years now

4013
03:00:22,720 --> 03:00:24,319
i've been an attack and pen the entire

4014
03:00:24,319 --> 03:00:24,800
time

4015
03:00:24,800 --> 03:00:26,399
and i'm not alone in that there's

4016
03:00:26,399 --> 03:00:28,479
several other individuals on the team

4017
03:00:28,479 --> 03:00:29,920
that have been here for a simple amount

4018
03:00:29,920 --> 03:00:31,520
of time such a such as matt

4019
03:00:31,520 --> 03:00:33,680
himself so what that yield is a really

4020
03:00:33,680 --> 03:00:34,640
good dynamic

4021
03:00:34,640 --> 03:00:36,800
of folks to work well together while we

4022
03:00:36,800 --> 03:00:38,240
simultaneously you know pursue our

4023
03:00:38,240 --> 03:00:40,000
passion about offensive security

4024
03:00:40,000 --> 03:00:41,680
and just add on to that i would say in a

4025
03:00:41,680 --> 03:00:43,359
single word the community

4026
03:00:43,359 --> 03:00:45,920
uh the team itself honestly strives

4027
03:00:45,920 --> 03:00:47,279
constantly to push the boundaries to

4028
03:00:47,279 --> 03:00:48,160
teach each other

4029
03:00:48,160 --> 03:00:50,080
new things whether or not it's a you

4030
03:00:50,080 --> 03:00:52,240
know failures from previous engagements

4031
03:00:52,240 --> 03:00:53,520
to help educate

4032
03:00:53,520 --> 03:00:56,720
for future uh tests or even success

4033
03:00:56,720 --> 03:00:57,439
stories

4034
03:00:57,439 --> 03:00:59,120
it's all about sharing and kind of

4035
03:00:59,120 --> 03:01:00,479
bolstering each other and through

4036
03:01:00,479 --> 03:01:02,880
knowledge sharing

4037
03:01:02,880 --> 03:01:04,960
absolutely and uh you know and a plug

4038
03:01:04,960 --> 03:01:06,240
for that that giving back to the

4039
03:01:06,240 --> 03:01:07,840
community aspect you know i was on your

4040
03:01:07,840 --> 03:01:08,960
github the other day

4041
03:01:08,960 --> 03:01:10,800
and uh i was looking into scarecrow and

4042
03:01:10,800 --> 03:01:12,240
i know i've got that on my list to do a

4043
03:01:12,240 --> 03:01:13,279
deep dive on after

4044
03:01:13,279 --> 03:01:15,600
after defcon you know love love the fact

4045
03:01:15,600 --> 03:01:17,439
that uh you know a lot of big players in

4046
03:01:17,439 --> 03:01:19,520
information security share that research

4047
03:01:19,520 --> 03:01:21,439
share that tooling that they create

4048
03:01:21,439 --> 03:01:24,640
yep that's what we strive to do here

4049
03:01:24,640 --> 03:01:26,880
and for your team um you know what types

4050
03:01:26,880 --> 03:01:27,840
of people work there

4051
03:01:27,840 --> 03:01:30,880
what are their backgrounds so it's a

4052
03:01:30,880 --> 03:01:32,399
good variety of backgrounds right

4053
03:01:32,399 --> 03:01:34,880
so we have folks uh some from being a

4054
03:01:34,880 --> 03:01:36,560
good part of us being veterans

4055
03:01:36,560 --> 03:01:38,479
uh to business-minded folks to

4056
03:01:38,479 --> 03:01:40,399
engineering folks et cetera right

4057
03:01:40,399 --> 03:01:42,240
uh but like i mentioned earlier there's

4058
03:01:42,240 --> 03:01:43,920
the ultimate uh

4059
03:01:43,920 --> 03:01:46,479
commonality right of a shared objective

4060
03:01:46,479 --> 03:01:48,399
of offensive and passion for offensive

4061
03:01:48,399 --> 03:01:49,680
security testing

4062
03:01:49,680 --> 03:01:51,520
and then what we qualify that success

4063
03:01:51,520 --> 03:01:52,960
really is helping leave our clients

4064
03:01:52,960 --> 03:01:54,240
better than we found them at the end of

4065
03:01:54,240 --> 03:01:54,960
the day

4066
03:01:54,960 --> 03:01:56,800
and of course you know folks have a very

4067
03:01:56,800 --> 03:01:58,880
specific uh or can have a specific

4068
03:01:58,880 --> 03:01:59,920
subset of interest

4069
03:01:59,920 --> 03:02:03,120
inside the team that could be of iot to

4070
03:02:03,120 --> 03:02:05,040
embedded to wireless to low-level

4071
03:02:05,040 --> 03:02:06,720
windows stuff to evasion

4072
03:02:06,720 --> 03:02:08,479
et cetera right so there's definitely

4073
03:02:08,479 --> 03:02:10,640
some sub-pockets for people to really go

4074
03:02:10,640 --> 03:02:12,960
mile deep on

4075
03:02:12,960 --> 03:02:15,200
great and with such a diverse group what

4076
03:02:15,200 --> 03:02:16,399
makes somebody a success

4077
03:02:16,399 --> 03:02:19,520
in a p so aside from

4078
03:02:19,520 --> 03:02:21,520
a technical acumen which obviously is

4079
03:02:21,520 --> 03:02:23,120
held you know it's an important quality

4080
03:02:23,120 --> 03:02:24,240
on this specific

4081
03:02:24,240 --> 03:02:26,880
role right is the ability to show

4082
03:02:26,880 --> 03:02:27,439
ownership

4083
03:02:27,439 --> 03:02:29,439
in leadership and give back to the team

4084
03:02:29,439 --> 03:02:31,600
um really you know owning a specific

4085
03:02:31,600 --> 03:02:33,200
service or an offering

4086
03:02:33,200 --> 03:02:35,520
uh helping others mentoring etc we hold

4087
03:02:35,520 --> 03:02:37,520
that in incredibly high value

4088
03:02:37,520 --> 03:02:39,040
um and then as we mentioned earlier with

4089
03:02:39,040 --> 03:02:41,040
regard to um like source zero and

4090
03:02:41,040 --> 03:02:42,080
scarecrow right

4091
03:02:42,080 --> 03:02:43,920
is the the public thought leadership to

4092
03:02:43,920 --> 03:02:46,080
help the team immediately and then also

4093
03:02:46,080 --> 03:02:48,319
give back to the community as well

4094
03:02:48,319 --> 03:02:49,920
yep and just to add on to that i would

4095
03:02:49,920 --> 03:02:52,160
say the eagerness to learn and improve

4096
03:02:52,160 --> 03:02:53,439
your tradecraft

4097
03:02:53,439 --> 03:02:56,240
um honestly the ones we see that excel

4098
03:02:56,240 --> 03:02:57,600
the most are the ones that not only

4099
03:02:57,600 --> 03:02:58,000
focus

4100
03:02:58,000 --> 03:03:00,160
on themselves but also make sure that

4101
03:03:00,160 --> 03:03:01,840
they help their

4102
03:03:01,840 --> 03:03:04,000
fellow teammates or co-workers whether

4103
03:03:04,000 --> 03:03:05,040
or not they're struggling with something

4104
03:03:05,040 --> 03:03:06,479
or helping to help them

4105
03:03:06,479 --> 03:03:09,120
also pursue and grow their talents those

4106
03:03:09,120 --> 03:03:09,920
are the ones that i

4107
03:03:09,920 --> 03:03:12,960
see often have the base success here

4108
03:03:12,960 --> 03:03:14,640
that's great uh absolutely i mean this

4109
03:03:14,640 --> 03:03:18,479
is this is a team sport doing what we do

4110
03:03:18,479 --> 03:03:19,920
for the for the red team village one

4111
03:03:19,920 --> 03:03:22,080
thing that we we really love to do

4112
03:03:22,080 --> 03:03:24,720
is is offer a lot of environments for

4113
03:03:24,720 --> 03:03:26,160
training we do workshops

4114
03:03:26,160 --> 03:03:28,399
we we participate in a lot of different

4115
03:03:28,399 --> 03:03:29,279
cons

4116
03:03:29,279 --> 03:03:31,439
um and one thing you know we want to do

4117
03:03:31,439 --> 03:03:33,279
is bring as many people into this

4118
03:03:33,279 --> 03:03:35,040
community as possible and so

4119
03:03:35,040 --> 03:03:36,960
i'd i'd like to ask for both of you you

4120
03:03:36,960 --> 03:03:38,399
know what is your advice for people who

4121
03:03:38,399 --> 03:03:40,080
are interested in cyber security

4122
03:03:40,080 --> 03:03:43,439
as a profession yeah absolutely so i

4123
03:03:43,439 --> 03:03:44,560
mean i'll speak to

4124
03:03:44,560 --> 03:03:45,920
you know the path that i took to get

4125
03:03:45,920 --> 03:03:47,760
here and i think it holds true to the

4126
03:03:47,760 --> 03:03:49,520
to the question right but i think it's

4127
03:03:49,520 --> 03:03:51,359
very important or imperative for folks

4128
03:03:51,359 --> 03:03:52,399
to have a

4129
03:03:52,399 --> 03:03:54,240
deep foundational understanding as to

4130
03:03:54,240 --> 03:03:55,520
how uh

4131
03:03:55,520 --> 03:03:57,279
things work right so what i mean by that

4132
03:03:57,279 --> 03:03:59,120
is how does active directory work how

4133
03:03:59,120 --> 03:04:00,000
does networking

4134
03:04:00,000 --> 03:04:01,600
function how can you manipulate these

4135
03:04:01,600 --> 03:04:03,920
things to maybe work outside the bounds

4136
03:04:03,920 --> 03:04:05,600
it was intended to right so that can

4137
03:04:05,600 --> 03:04:07,200
apply to even development web

4138
03:04:07,200 --> 03:04:08,640
applications etc

4139
03:04:08,640 --> 03:04:10,880
um oftentimes i get asked by people that

4140
03:04:10,880 --> 03:04:12,319
are a bit younger and stay in college or

4141
03:04:12,319 --> 03:04:13,439
whatever and they're like hey should i

4142
03:04:13,439 --> 03:04:14,800
take this security class and become a

4143
03:04:14,800 --> 03:04:16,000
pen tester well

4144
03:04:16,000 --> 03:04:18,000
i would really encourage folks to get a

4145
03:04:18,000 --> 03:04:19,040
lot of those more foundational

4146
03:04:19,040 --> 03:04:20,000
understandings

4147
03:04:20,000 --> 03:04:22,080
just how things work before they move to

4148
03:04:22,080 --> 03:04:24,080
the stage of trying to you know

4149
03:04:24,080 --> 03:04:26,080
move to the adversarial emulation types

4150
03:04:26,080 --> 03:04:27,279
part

4151
03:04:27,279 --> 03:04:29,279
yeah and i would just add uh to not just

4152
03:04:29,279 --> 03:04:31,120
focus when you're learning on red team

4153
03:04:31,120 --> 03:04:31,840
tactics

4154
03:04:31,840 --> 03:04:33,680
it's incredibly valuable in the current

4155
03:04:33,680 --> 03:04:35,040
landscape to uh

4156
03:04:35,040 --> 03:04:37,840
focus on both blue and red team having

4157
03:04:37,840 --> 03:04:38,720
that ability to

4158
03:04:38,720 --> 03:04:41,040
speak both can really augment your skill

4159
03:04:41,040 --> 03:04:42,240
set and

4160
03:04:42,240 --> 03:04:43,600
you know this is very much a cat and

4161
03:04:43,600 --> 03:04:45,279
mouse game based industry

4162
03:04:45,279 --> 03:04:47,680
and just knowing both sides their

4163
03:04:47,680 --> 03:04:49,279
playbooks can really help you understand

4164
03:04:49,279 --> 03:04:50,720
the strengths and weaknesses

4165
03:04:50,720 --> 03:04:52,319
of both sides so when you're coming up

4166
03:04:52,319 --> 03:04:54,080
against a red team or a blue team you

4167
03:04:54,080 --> 03:04:54,640
know

4168
03:04:54,640 --> 03:04:56,319
what they are great at what their

4169
03:04:56,319 --> 03:04:58,000
weaknesses are to really help plan out

4170
03:04:58,000 --> 03:04:58,960
those attacks

4171
03:04:58,960 --> 03:05:02,640
or even your knowledge set to improve on

4172
03:05:02,640 --> 03:05:05,040
those that is phenomenal advice uh this

4173
03:05:05,040 --> 03:05:05,760
industry

4174
03:05:05,760 --> 03:05:08,240
is is a challenge because there's so

4175
03:05:08,240 --> 03:05:09,279
much breadth

4176
03:05:09,279 --> 03:05:11,359
and depth that you can take uh not to

4177
03:05:11,359 --> 03:05:13,040
mention that it's evolving every single

4178
03:05:13,040 --> 03:05:13,439
day

4179
03:05:13,439 --> 03:05:15,279
it's impossible to keep up so you've got

4180
03:05:15,279 --> 03:05:16,640
to have that thirst for knowledge

4181
03:05:16,640 --> 03:05:18,640
and and without that foundation it is

4182
03:05:18,640 --> 03:05:19,840
quite difficult i mean you might throw

4183
03:05:19,840 --> 03:05:21,600
that exploit and get that get that shell

4184
03:05:21,600 --> 03:05:22,080
back

4185
03:05:22,080 --> 03:05:23,359
but then the question is what do you do

4186
03:05:23,359 --> 03:05:25,120
next right and so

4187
03:05:25,120 --> 03:05:27,439
uh great advice i want to thank both of

4188

all the way up you know until last you

4228

pre-recorded

4325
03:19:48,160 --> 03:19:50,000
interviews with some of the sponsors in

4326
03:19:50,000 --> 03:19:52,640

definitely here in a couple minutes

4331
03:20:07,520 --> 03:20:09,760
you'll get that it'll actually be

4332
03:20:09,760 --> 03:20:12,960
you sense it all right so right now you

4333
03:20:12,960 --> 03:20:14,239
should be receiving an email

4334
03:20:14,239 --> 03:20:17,600
with the open vpn configs we have 10

4335
03:20:17,600 --> 03:20:20,640
or sorry 18 teams registered so far so

4336
03:20:20,640 --> 03:20:21,920
definitely hit me up in a dm

4337
03:20:21,920 --> 03:20:23,439
after this make sure that i'll get you

4338
03:20:23,439 --> 03:20:25,680
registered uh but all the teams

4339
03:20:25,680 --> 03:20:27,680
that at least we have emails for we'll

4340
03:20:27,680 --> 03:20:31,120
get a connection pack at this time

4341
03:20:31,920 --> 03:20:33,840
and all the challenges should be visible

4342
03:20:33,840 --> 03:20:35,279
at this time

4343
03:20:35,279 --> 03:20:38,399
so with that for the challenges uh the

4344
03:20:38,399 --> 03:20:40,840
flag submission will be based on

4345
03:20:40,840 --> 03:20:42,000
hostname

4346
03:20:42,000 --> 03:20:44,239
so hostname and then the flag and then

4347
03:20:44,239 --> 03:20:45,200
you'll be able to kind of go through

4348
03:20:45,200 --> 03:20:46,640
there

4349
03:20:46,640 --> 03:20:50,000
and hopefully find each one so it's more

4350
03:20:50,000 --> 03:20:51,840
of a scenario so it's not very you know

4351
03:20:51,840 --> 03:20:54,080
necessarily as like linear you know

4352
03:20:54,080 --> 03:20:54,960
challenge a

4353
03:20:54,960 --> 03:20:56,800
or whatever as you go through the

4354
03:20:56,800 --> 03:20:58,479
environment you'll come across the

4355
03:20:58,479 --> 03:20:59,760
different flags and you'll be able to

4356
03:20:59,760 --> 03:21:00,880
kind of correlate each one of those

4357
03:21:00,880 --> 03:21:02,319
flags with the host name

4358
03:21:02,319 --> 03:21:03,680
as well as you know whether it's a file

4359
03:21:03,680 --> 03:21:05,680
name or something else it'll be

4360
03:21:05,680 --> 03:21:07,439
indicative of which flag it is

4361
03:21:07,439 --> 03:21:09,760
uh you know there's no no issues

4362
03:21:09,760 --> 03:21:11,840
submitting that flag multiple times

4363
03:21:11,840 --> 03:21:13,600
uh just to ensure you know you're on the

4364
03:21:13,600 --> 03:21:14,880
right uh

4365
03:21:14,880 --> 03:21:16,880
the right challenge so with that

4366
03:21:16,880 --> 03:21:17,920
everyone should have

4367
03:21:17,920 --> 03:21:21,359
an email at this time as well as

4368
03:21:21,359 --> 03:21:23,120
logged in on the scoreboard everything

4369
03:21:23,120 --> 03:21:24,560
is visible so

4370
03:21:24,560 --> 03:21:26,479
good luck to all contestants out there

4371
03:21:26,479 --> 03:21:28,960
good luck

4372
03:21:30,479 --> 03:21:33,438
omar do you wanna

4373
03:21:33,600 --> 03:21:37,200
oh i think you're muted omar i am muted

4374
03:21:37,200 --> 03:21:38,720
i am not trying to all right

4375
03:21:38,720 --> 03:21:42,399
so they don't hear me typing

4376
03:21:42,399 --> 03:21:44,880
so the third thing is of course go ahead

4377
03:21:44,880 --> 03:21:46,479
omar we'll get you the uh the

4378
03:21:46,479 --> 03:21:48,319
updated scoreboard for the new teams uh

4379
03:21:48,319 --> 03:21:49,760
everyone's just getting logged in right

4380
03:21:49,760 --> 03:21:50,239
now

4381
03:21:50,239 --> 03:21:52,319
but that is their top 20 teams so each

4382
03:21:52,319 --> 03:21:53,840
one of those are you know

4383
03:21:53,840 --> 03:21:54,960
getting their connection they're getting

4384
03:21:54,960 --> 03:21:57,040
connected right now uh starting to log

4385
03:21:57,040 --> 03:21:58,640
into the environment and obviously it'll

4386
03:21:58,640 --> 03:22:00,479
be a kind of a slow start as they figure

4387
03:22:00,479 --> 03:22:01,359
out exactly

4388
03:22:01,359 --> 03:22:02,399
you know what the scenario that

4389
03:22:02,399 --> 03:22:03,359
beginning of the scenario and what it

4390
03:22:03,359 --> 03:22:04,560
kind of looks like so

4391
03:22:04,560 --> 03:22:06,239
a lot of clues that are out there uh

4392

03:35:30,800 --> 03:35:32,560
red team village ctf this year

4471
03:35:32,560 --> 03:35:34,720
your support really helps uh and it goes

4472
03:35:34,720 --> 03:35:35,680
a long way

4473
03:35:35,680 --> 03:35:37,760
at uh allowing us to provide a big event

4474
03:35:37,760 --> 03:35:38,720
both in person

4475
03:35:38,720 --> 03:35:40,800
and virtually can you tell me a little

4476
03:35:40,800 --> 03:35:43,200
bit more about optiv

4477
03:35:43,200 --> 03:35:45,680
yeah absolutely so to put it very simply

4478
03:35:45,680 --> 03:35:46,960
optiv is a pure play

4479
03:35:46,960 --> 03:35:48,720
cyber security partner and what does

4480
03:35:48,720 --> 03:35:50,800
that mean we aim to do

4481
03:35:50,800 --> 03:35:52,720
secure all security all the time right

4482
03:35:52,720 --> 03:35:53,840
we can help in

4483
03:35:53,840 --> 03:35:56,160
ways of advisory deployment and even

4484
03:35:56,160 --> 03:35:58,160
manage operations right so ultimately

4485
03:35:58,160 --> 03:36:00,479
our goal is very simply to

4486
03:36:00,479 --> 03:36:02,479
help organize organizations realize a

4487
03:36:02,479 --> 03:36:04,479
more effective security program

4488
03:36:04,479 --> 03:36:07,840
and posture

4489
03:36:08,319 --> 03:36:10,720
and uh for for both of you specifically

4490
03:36:10,720 --> 03:36:13,359
what what do you do at optiv

4491
03:36:13,359 --> 03:36:15,200
so i'm a senior director inside of

4492
03:36:15,200 --> 03:36:16,880
threat management which is a larger

4493
03:36:16,880 --> 03:36:18,399
umbrella but i specifically have the

4494
03:36:18,399 --> 03:36:20,160
privilege of leading our attack and pen

4495
03:36:20,160 --> 03:36:22,960
team so my focus is on the direction of

4496
03:36:22,960 --> 03:36:24,160
success of that team

4497
03:36:24,160 --> 03:36:26,239
and i achieved this largely by enabling

4498
03:36:26,239 --> 03:36:27,920
uh the great folks around me such as

4499
03:36:27,920 --> 03:36:30,479
mr eidelberg here and i'm a technical

4500
03:36:30,479 --> 03:36:31,359
manager

4501
03:36:31,359 --> 03:36:34,319
under attacking pen my primary role is

4502
03:36:34,319 --> 03:36:36,080
leading the adversarial simulation

4503
03:36:36,080 --> 03:36:36,720
services

4504
03:36:36,720 --> 03:36:39,040
this is our branch that focuses

4505
03:36:39,040 --> 03:36:40,640
primarily on red and purple team

4506
03:36:40,640 --> 03:36:41,680
operations

4507
03:36:41,680 --> 03:36:43,520
my role in there is not only executing

4508
03:36:43,520 --> 03:36:44,800
these types of engagements but also

4509
03:36:44,800 --> 03:36:45,600
focusing on

4510
03:36:45,600 --> 03:36:48,080
helping to innovate the team and grow

4511
03:36:48,080 --> 03:36:49,680
more operators to perform these types of

4512
03:36:49,680 --> 03:36:52,000
engagements

4513
03:36:52,000 --> 03:36:54,160
all right and uh and for the for that uh

4514
03:36:54,160 --> 03:36:55,120
attack and pen

4515
03:36:55,120 --> 03:36:56,880
practice uh why do you like working

4516
03:36:56,880 --> 03:36:59,120
there

4517
03:36:59,120 --> 03:37:01,840
yeah so for me uh first and foremost uh

4518
03:37:01,840 --> 03:37:03,760
it's it's the close family atmosphere

4519
03:37:03,760 --> 03:37:05,040
that we have on the team

4520
03:37:05,040 --> 03:37:06,640
uh and what i mean by that is i've been

4521
03:37:06,640 --> 03:37:08,239
on the team for almost nine years now

4522
03:37:08,239 --> 03:37:09,840
i've been an attack and pen the entire

4523
03:37:09,840 --> 03:37:10,239
time

4524
03:37:10,239 --> 03:37:11,840
and i'm not alone in that there are

4525
03:37:11,840 --> 03:37:13,920
several other individuals on the team

4526
03:37:13,920 --> 03:37:15,439
that have been here for a certain amount

4527
03:37:15,439 --> 03:37:17,040
of time such a such as matt

4528
03:37:17,040 --> 03:37:19,200
himself so what that shield is a really

4529
03:37:19,200 --> 03:37:20,160
good dynamic

4530
03:37:20,160 --> 03:37:22,000
of folks to work well together while we

4531
03:37:22,000 --> 03:37:23,760
uh simultaneously you know pursue our

4532
03:37:23,760 --> 03:37:25,520
passion about offensive security

4533
03:37:25,520 --> 03:37:26,960
and just to add on to that i would say

4534
03:37:26,960 --> 03:37:28,800
in a single word the community

4535
03:37:28,800 --> 03:37:31,439
uh the team itself honestly strives

4536
03:37:31,439 --> 03:37:32,720
constantly to push the boundaries to

4537
03:37:32,720 --> 03:37:33,680
teach each other

4538
03:37:33,680 --> 03:37:35,520
new things whether or not it's a you

4539
03:37:35,520 --> 03:37:37,680
know failures from previous engagements

4540
03:37:37,680 --> 03:37:38,960
to help educate

4541
03:37:38,960 --> 03:37:42,960
for future tests or even success stories

4542
03:37:42,960 --> 03:37:44,560
it's all about sharing and kind of

4543
03:37:44,560 --> 03:37:46,239
bolstering each other through knowledge

4544
03:37:46,239 --> 03:37:48,319
sharing

4545
03:37:48,319 --> 03:37:50,399
absolutely and uh you know and a plug

4546
03:37:50,399 --> 03:37:51,680
for that that giving back to the

4547
03:37:51,680 --> 03:37:53,359
community aspect you know i was on your

4548
03:37:53,359 --> 03:37:54,399
github the other day

4549
03:37:54,399 --> 03:37:56,239
and uh i was looking into scarecrow and

4550
03:37:56,239 --> 03:37:57,760
i know i've got that on my list to do a

4551
03:37:57,760 --> 03:37:59,760
deep dive on after after defcon

4552
03:37:59,760 --> 03:38:01,600
you know love love the fact that uh you

4553
03:38:01,600 --> 03:38:02,880
know a lot of big players in

4554
03:38:02,880 --> 03:38:05,040
information security share that research

4555
03:38:05,040 --> 03:38:06,960
share that tooling that they create

4556
03:38:06,960 --> 03:38:10,080
yep that's what we strive to do here

4557
03:38:10,080 --> 03:38:12,399
and for your team um you know what types

4558
03:38:12,399 --> 03:38:13,359
of people work there

4559
03:38:13,359 --> 03:38:16,319
what are their backgrounds so it's a

4560
03:38:16,319 --> 03:38:18,080
good variety of backgrounds right so we

4561
03:38:18,080 --> 03:38:18,800
have folks

4562
03:38:18,800 --> 03:38:21,120
uh some from being a good part of us

4563
03:38:21,120 --> 03:38:22,000
being veterans

4564
03:38:22,000 --> 03:38:24,000
uh to business-minded folks to

4565
03:38:24,000 --> 03:38:26,080
engineering folks et cetera right

4566
03:38:26,080 --> 03:38:27,920
but like i mentioned earlier there's the

4567
03:38:27,920 --> 03:38:29,359
ultimate uh

4568
03:38:29,359 --> 03:38:31,920
commonality right of a shared objective

4569
03:38:31,920 --> 03:38:32,880
of offense

4570
03:38:32,880 --> 03:38:34,399
and passion for offensive security

4571
03:38:34,399 --> 03:38:36,479
testing and then what we qualify that

4572
03:38:36,479 --> 03:38:38,080
success really is helping leave our

4573
03:38:38,080 --> 03:38:39,520
clients better than we found them at the

4574
03:38:39,520 --> 03:38:40,479
end of the day

4575
03:38:40,479 --> 03:38:42,239
and of course you know folks have a very

4576
03:38:42,239 --> 03:38:44,800
specific or can have a specific subset

4577
03:38:44,800 --> 03:38:45,439
of interest

4578
03:38:45,439 --> 03:38:48,560
inside the team that could be of iot to

4579
03:38:48,560 --> 03:38:49,359
embedded to

4580
03:38:49,359 --> 03:38:51,199
wireless to low level window stuff to

4581
03:38:51,199 --> 03:38:53,359
evasion etc right so

4582
03:38:53,359 --> 03:38:55,120
there's definitely some some sub pockets

4583
03:38:55,120 --> 03:38:58,479
for people to really go a mile deep on

4584
03:38:58,479 --> 03:39:00,560
great and with such a diverse group uh

4585
03:39:00,560 --> 03:39:03,840
what makes somebody a success in amp

4586
03:39:03,840 --> 03:39:06,560
so aside from a technical acumen which

4587
03:39:06,560 --> 03:39:07,840
obviously is held you know it's an

4588
03:39:07,840 --> 03:39:09,680
important quality on this specific

4589
03:39:09,680 --> 03:39:12,319
role right uh is the ability to show

4590
03:39:12,319 --> 03:39:12,960
ownership

4591
03:39:12,960 --> 03:39:14,880
and leadership and give back to the team

4592
03:39:14,880 --> 03:39:17,040
um really you know owning a specific

4593
03:39:17,040 --> 03:39:18,720
service or an offering

4594
03:39:18,720 --> 03:39:20,800
uh helping others mentoring et cetera we

4595
03:39:20,800 --> 03:39:23,199
hold that in incredibly high value

4596
03:39:23,199 --> 03:39:24,479
and then as we mentioned earlier with

4597
03:39:24,479 --> 03:39:26,479
regard to um like source zero and

4598
03:39:26,479 --> 03:39:27,600
scarecrow right

4599
03:39:27,600 --> 03:39:29,439
is the the public thought leadership to

4600
03:39:29,439 --> 03:39:31,520
help the team immediately and then also

4601
03:39:31,520 --> 03:39:33,840
give back to the community as well

4602
03:39:33,840 --> 03:39:35,439
yep and just to add on to that i would

4603
03:39:35,439 --> 03:39:37,600
say the eagerness to learn and improve

4604
03:39:37,600 --> 03:39:38,880
your tradecraft

4605
03:39:38,880 --> 03:39:41,680
um honestly the ones we see that excel

4606
03:39:41,680 --> 03:39:43,120
the most are the ones that not only

4607
03:39:43,120 --> 03:39:44,319
focus on themselves

4608
03:39:44,319 --> 03:39:47,359
but also make sure that they help their

4609
03:39:47,359 --> 03:39:49,439
fellow teammates or co-workers whether

4610
03:39:49,439 --> 03:39:50,479
or not they're struggling with something

4611
03:39:50,479 --> 03:39:52,000
or helping to help them

4612
03:39:52,000 --> 03:39:54,560
also pursue and grow their talents those

4613
03:39:54,560 --> 03:39:55,439
are the ones that i

4614
03:39:55,439 --> 03:39:58,479
see often have the basic success here

4615
03:39:58,479 --> 03:40:00,160
that's great uh absolutely i mean this

4616
03:40:00,160 --> 03:40:02,840
is this is a team sport doing what we do

4617
03:40:02,840 --> 03:40:05,439
yep for the red team village one thing

4618
03:40:05,439 --> 03:40:06,080
that we we

4619
03:40:06,080 --> 03:40:08,640
uh really love to do is is offer a lot

4620
03:40:08,640 --> 03:40:10,800
of it uh environments for training we do

4621
03:40:10,800 --> 03:40:12,160
workshops we

4622
03:40:12,160 --> 03:40:13,760
we uh participate in a lot of different

4623
03:40:13,760 --> 03:40:16,000
cons um and one thing

4624
03:40:16,000 --> 03:40:17,600
you know we want to do is bring as many

4625
03:40:17,600 --> 03:40:19,760
people into this community as possible

4626
03:40:19,760 --> 03:40:20,399
and so

4627
03:40:20,399 --> 03:40:22,319
i'd i'd like to ask for both of you you

4628
03:40:22,319 --> 03:40:23,760
know what is your advice for people who

4629
03:40:23,760 --> 03:40:24,560
are interested

4630
03:40:24,560 --> 03:40:27,840
in cyber security as a profession

4631
03:40:27,840 --> 03:40:29,920
yeah absolutely so i mean i'll speak to

4632
03:40:29,920 --> 03:40:31,279
you know the path that i took to get

4633
03:40:31,279 --> 03:40:33,120
here and i think it holds true to the

4634
03:40:33,120 --> 03:40:34,960
to the question right but i think it's

4635
03:40:34,960 --> 03:40:36,720
very important or imperative for folks

4636
03:40:36,720 --> 03:40:37,600
to have a

4637
03:40:37,600 --> 03:40:39,600
a deep foundational understanding as to

4638
03:40:39,600 --> 03:40:40,880
how uh

4639
03:40:40,880 --> 03:40:42,640
things work right so what i mean by that

4640
03:40:42,640 --> 03:40:44,479
is how does active directory work how

4641
03:40:44,479 --> 03:40:45,359
does networking

4642
03:40:45,359 --> 03:40:47,040
function how can you manipulate these

4643
03:40:47,040 --> 03:40:49,279
things to maybe work outside the bounds

4644
03:40:49,279 --> 03:40:50,960
it was intended to right so that can

4645
03:40:50,960 --> 03:40:51,359
apply

4646
03:40:51,359 --> 03:40:54,080
to even development web applications etc

4647
03:40:54,080 --> 03:40:54,560
um

4648
03:40:54,560 --> 03:40:56,239
often times i get asked by people that

4649
03:40:56,239 --> 03:40:57,680
are a bit younger and stay in college or

4650
03:40:57,680 --> 03:40:58,319
whatever and they're

4651
03:40:58,319 --> 03:40:59,520
like hey should i take this security

4652
03:40:59,520 --> 03:41:01,439
class and become a pen tester well

4653
03:41:01,439 --> 03:41:03,359
i would really encourage folks to get a

4654
03:41:03,359 --> 03:41:04,399
lot of those more foundational

4655
03:41:04,399 --> 03:41:05,359
understandings

4656
03:41:05,359 --> 03:41:07,439
just how things work before they move to

4657
03:41:07,439 --> 03:41:09,439
the stage of trying to you know

4658
03:41:09,439 --> 03:41:11,520
move to the adversarial emulation types

4659
03:41:11,520 --> 03:41:12,640
part

4660
03:41:12,640 --> 03:41:14,640
yep and i would just add uh to not just

4661
03:41:14,640 --> 03:41:16,560
focus when you're learning on red team

4662
03:41:16,560 --> 03:41:17,199
tactics

4663
03:41:17,199 --> 03:41:19,040
it's incredibly valuable in the current

4664
03:41:19,040 --> 03:41:20,479
landscape to uh

4665
03:41:20,479 --> 03:41:23,199
focus on both blue and red team having

4666
03:41:23,199 --> 03:41:24,160
that ability to

4667
03:41:24,160 --> 03:41:26,399
speak both can really augment your skill

4668
03:41:26,399 --> 03:41:27,600
set and

4669
03:41:27,600 --> 03:41:29,040
you know this is very much a cat and

4670
03:41:29,040 --> 03:41:30,720
mouse game based industry

4671
03:41:30,720 --> 03:41:33,040
and just knowing both sides their

4672
03:41:33,040 --> 03:41:34,640
playbooks can really help you understand

4673
03:41:34,640 --> 03:41:36,080
the strengths and weaknesses

4674
03:41:36,080 --> 03:41:37,760
of both sides so when you're coming up

4675
03:41:37,760 --> 03:41:39,279
against say a red team or a blue team

4676
03:41:39,279 --> 03:41:40,000
you know

4677
03:41:40,000 --> 03:41:41,760
what they are great at what their

4678
03:41:41,760 --> 03:41:43,359
weaknesses are to really help plan out

4679
03:41:43,359 --> 03:41:44,319
those attacks

4680
03:41:44,319 --> 03:41:48,000
or even your knowledge set to improve on

4681
03:41:48,000 --> 03:41:50,479
those that is phenomenal advice uh this

4682
03:41:50,479 --> 03:41:51,439
industry is

4683
03:41:51,439 --> 03:41:54,080
is a challenge because there's so much

4684
03:41:54,080 --> 03:41:54,640
breath

4685
03:41:54,640 --> 03:41:56,720
and depth that you can take not to

4686
03:41:56,720 --> 03:41:58,399
mention that it's evolving every single

4687
03:41:58,399 --> 03:41:58,880
day

4688
03:41:58,880 --> 03:42:00,640
it's impossible to keep up so you've got

4689
03:42:00,640 --> 03:42:02,080
to have that thirst for knowledge

4690
03:42:02,080 --> 03:42:04,000
and and without that foundation it is

4691
03:42:04,000 --> 03:42:05,279
quite difficult i mean you might throw

4692
03:42:05,279 --> 03:42:07,040
that exploit and get that get that shell

4693
03:42:07,040 --> 03:42:07,439
back

4694
03:42:07,439 --> 03:42:08,800
but then the question is what do you do

4695
03:42:08,800 --> 03:42:10,960
next right and so

4696
03:42:10,960 --> 03:42:13,040
great advice i want to thank both of you

4697

04:01:42,800 --> 04:01:43,680
yeah um

4797
04:01:43,680 --> 04:01:46,000
hack the box is a hands-on security

4798
04:01:46,000 --> 04:01:47,680
training platform and our main goal is

4799
04:01:47,680 --> 04:01:48,960
to make good training

4800
04:01:48,960 --> 04:01:51,199
readily available to anyone in the world

4801
04:01:51,199 --> 04:01:53,199
if you're new to a topic or

4802
04:01:53,199 --> 04:01:55,040
just the field in general we have hack

4803
04:01:55,040 --> 04:01:56,319
the box academy

4804
04:01:56,319 --> 04:01:57,920
and it's a guided learning experience

4805
04:01:57,920 --> 04:01:59,279
which just means we have written

4806
04:01:59,279 --> 04:02:01,120
material in hands-on labs

4807
04:02:01,120 --> 04:02:02,640
and again when building this

4808
04:02:02,640 --> 04:02:04,640
accessibility was our number one

4809
04:02:04,640 --> 04:02:07,279
desire so we created the prone box which

4810
04:02:07,279 --> 04:02:08,319
allows you to have

4811
04:02:08,319 --> 04:02:10,960
a whole operating system in your browser

4812
04:02:10,960 --> 04:02:12,640
so the machine you're doing this

4813
04:02:12,640 --> 04:02:14,160
learning on doesn't even have to be

4814
04:02:14,160 --> 04:02:15,359
powerful you can do it on like a

4815
04:02:15,359 --> 04:02:16,000
chromebook

4816
04:02:16,000 --> 04:02:17,760
if for some reason you want to do it on

4817
04:02:17,760 --> 04:02:19,600
a phone you can i wouldn't recommend

4818
04:02:19,600 --> 04:02:20,399
that

4819
04:02:20,399 --> 04:02:22,239
but everything's done within a web

4820
04:02:22,239 --> 04:02:24,239
browser if you want to bring your own os

4821
04:02:24,239 --> 04:02:26,160
we also provide a vpn pack for you so

4822
04:02:26,160 --> 04:02:28,800
you can join your os to the vpn and

4823
04:02:28,800 --> 04:02:30,960
go on learning in addition to the

4824
04:02:30,960 --> 04:02:32,000
academy we have

4825
04:02:32,000 --> 04:02:33,439
unguided learning which is what we're

4826
04:02:33,439 --> 04:02:35,439
most famous for this is the weekly

4827
04:02:35,439 --> 04:02:37,359
challenges machines or entire like

4828
04:02:37,359 --> 04:02:39,520
networks we put out on the platform and

4829
04:02:39,520 --> 04:02:41,359
that we ask people not to publicly talk

4830
04:02:41,359 --> 04:02:42,239
about these challenges

4831
04:02:42,239 --> 04:02:44,720
until they retire which is typically 20

4832
04:02:44,720 --> 04:02:45,359
weeks

4833
04:02:45,359 --> 04:02:46,960
this is my favorite and what i credit

4834
04:02:46,960 --> 04:02:48,720
most of my success to because it really

4835
04:02:48,720 --> 04:02:50,080
enforces building good social

4836
04:02:50,080 --> 04:02:51,120
relationships

4837
04:02:51,120 --> 04:02:52,880
that not only help get you the help when

4838
04:02:52,880 --> 04:02:54,479
you need it but also

4839
04:02:54,479 --> 04:02:56,960
when teaching it often validates your

4840
04:02:56,960 --> 04:02:58,560
understanding of it and is proven to

4841
04:02:58,560 --> 04:03:00,399
help memory retention

4842
04:03:00,399 --> 04:03:02,960
so i have a lot of friends from my in my

4843
04:03:02,960 --> 04:03:05,120
social network that include barry i met

4844
04:03:05,120 --> 04:03:06,080
him through

4845
04:03:06,080 --> 04:03:08,399
another friend who met him at derby con

4846
04:03:08,399 --> 04:03:10,319
which is a similar event of red team

4847
04:03:10,319 --> 04:03:11,199
village

4848
04:03:11,199 --> 04:03:13,199
and the funny thing is both my other

4849
04:03:13,199 --> 04:03:15,199
friend kyle and barry all lived within

4850
04:03:15,199 --> 04:03:15,760
like

4851
04:03:15,760 --> 04:03:18,960
30 miles of each other but we met like

4852
04:03:18,960 --> 04:03:21,199
hundreds of miles away so definitely

4853
04:03:21,199 --> 04:03:22,960
like

4854
04:03:22,960 --> 04:03:25,680
important to go view and travel and

4855
04:03:25,680 --> 04:03:27,040
experience the community because

4856
04:03:27,040 --> 04:03:28,880
you'll never know who you find and how

4857
04:03:28,880 --> 04:03:32,080
close people may be it's a small world

4858
04:03:32,080 --> 04:03:33,680
absolutely i think we've all been cooped

4859
04:03:33,680 --> 04:03:35,520
up these last few months here i think a

4860
04:03:35,520 --> 04:03:36,880
lot of people are excited to go in

4861
04:03:36,880 --> 04:03:38,960
person to las vegas to attend def con

4862
04:03:38,960 --> 04:03:39,520
and so

4863
04:03:39,520 --> 04:03:41,359
we're really excited to see some of our

4864
04:03:41,359 --> 04:03:43,199
old friends and make some new ones

4865
04:03:43,199 --> 04:03:45,520
um speaking of of that community you

4866
04:03:45,520 --> 04:03:47,279
know hack the box is a very vibrant

4867
04:03:47,279 --> 04:03:48,880
community both on their discord

4868
04:03:48,880 --> 04:03:50,640
as well as all over twitter can you tell

4869
04:03:50,640 --> 04:03:52,319
me a little bit more about the people

4870
04:03:52,319 --> 04:03:54,080
behind hack the box maybe some projects

4871
04:03:54,080 --> 04:03:55,279
that you might be working on

4872
04:03:55,279 --> 04:03:57,920
yeah we have a innovation team that's

4873
04:03:57,920 --> 04:03:59,040
designed at like

4874
04:03:59,040 --> 04:04:02,080
pushing what we think is the limit so

4875
04:04:02,080 --> 04:04:03,840
typically most of our stuff is either a

4876
04:04:03,840 --> 04:04:05,680
docker or a vmware image

4877
04:04:05,680 --> 04:04:08,239
and the innovation team is looking into

4878
04:04:08,239 --> 04:04:10,000
google cloud aws

4879
04:04:10,000 --> 04:04:13,040
and azure to provide a pro lab called

4880
04:04:13,040 --> 04:04:15,199
black sky which is just based upon

4881
04:04:15,199 --> 04:04:16,960
those types of features so if you want

4882
04:04:16,960 --> 04:04:18,640
to exploit im or do a lot of those

4883
04:04:18,640 --> 04:04:20,000
unique cloud things black sky

4884
04:04:20,000 --> 04:04:22,720
lab is going to be that we also have as

4885
04:04:22,720 --> 04:04:24,319
you said the discord community we have

4886
04:04:24,319 --> 04:04:25,920
roadrunner who runs that

4887
04:04:25,920 --> 04:04:27,439
and they help provide a lot of good

4888
04:04:27,439 --> 04:04:29,680
support and just learning to anyone

4889
04:04:29,680 --> 04:04:32,399
in addition to a bunch of ctfs i think

4890
04:04:32,399 --> 04:04:34,479
we run the ctf like every other month or

4891
04:04:34,479 --> 04:04:35,040
something it's

4892
04:04:35,040 --> 04:04:38,319
insane well

4893
04:04:38,319 --> 04:04:40,239
talking about the ctf and talking about

4894
04:04:40,239 --> 04:04:41,600
all the activities you know throughout

4895
04:04:41,600 --> 04:04:42,720
the years you guys

4896
04:04:42,720 --> 04:04:45,120
have supported the red team village

4897
04:04:45,120 --> 04:04:45,920
tremendously

4898
04:04:45,920 --> 04:04:48,319
so first of all thank you and thank you

4899
04:04:48,319 --> 04:04:49,600
hack the box

4900
04:04:49,600 --> 04:04:52,319
so one of i got a couple of questions

4901
04:04:52,319 --> 04:04:53,279
right so one of the

4902
04:04:53,279 --> 04:04:55,120
questions is you know what would you say

4903
04:04:55,120 --> 04:04:56,960
that is the best part

4904
04:04:56,960 --> 04:04:59,520
about sponsoring community efforts like

4905
04:04:59,520 --> 04:05:02,399
the retin village ctf this year i mean

4906
04:05:02,399 --> 04:05:04,000
obviously it helps the community grow

4907
04:05:04,000 --> 04:05:06,319
and most of my like relationships i can

4908
04:05:06,319 --> 04:05:07,840
credit almost all my professional

4909
04:05:07,840 --> 04:05:08,640
success

4910
04:05:08,640 --> 04:05:10,960
as to leeching off my friends knowledge

4911
04:05:10,960 --> 04:05:13,040
because no one can know everything

4912
04:05:13,040 --> 04:05:14,800
and i can't speak for anyone i hack the

4913
04:05:14,800 --> 04:05:16,160
box but i know

4914
04:05:16,160 --> 04:05:18,080
a bunch of my friends at hack the box

4915
04:05:18,080 --> 04:05:20,080
are super excited to play a ctf built by

4916
04:05:20,080 --> 04:05:21,199
other people

4917
04:05:21,199 --> 04:05:22,720
and we've played the red team village

4918
04:05:22,720 --> 04:05:24,720
cts for quite a while

4919
04:05:24,720 --> 04:05:26,800
i vaguely remember one i think two years

4920
04:05:26,800 --> 04:05:29,040
ago that involved exploiting a printer

4921
04:05:29,040 --> 04:05:30,000
which was new to all

4922
04:05:30,000 --> 04:05:33,359
of us we were all like big binary

4923
04:05:33,359 --> 04:05:34,560
exploit people and then threw a

4924
04:05:34,560 --> 04:05:35,920
different architecture at us that we

4925
04:05:35,920 --> 04:05:36,720
never really

4926
04:05:36,720 --> 04:05:38,640
experimented with and it was just a lot

4927
04:05:38,640 --> 04:05:39,920
of fun to play

4928
04:05:39,920 --> 04:05:43,040
so super excited to sponsor an event

4929
04:05:43,040 --> 04:05:44,720
that we can participate in

4930
04:05:44,720 --> 04:05:46,800
and learn new things to hopefully put

4931
04:05:46,800 --> 04:05:48,640
out on our platform in the future

4932
04:05:48,640 --> 04:05:50,960
thank you appreciate that i think that

4933
04:05:50,960 --> 04:05:51,840
you're hitting

4934
04:05:51,840 --> 04:05:53,840
my next question which is why do you

4935
04:05:53,840 --> 04:05:55,840
think sponsoring the

4936
04:05:55,840 --> 04:05:57,439
the retin village this year is so

4937
04:05:57,439 --> 04:05:59,600
important for the community

4938
04:05:59,600 --> 04:06:03,920
yeah um number one it's important to

4939
04:06:03,920 --> 04:06:07,359
like with covet and all we want to

4940
04:06:07,359 --> 04:06:08,800
increase our socialization and

4941
04:06:08,800 --> 04:06:10,560
everything we've been all cooped up

4942
04:06:10,560 --> 04:06:13,040
and the red team village incorporates

4943
04:06:13,040 --> 04:06:14,399
all of hack the boxes

4944
04:06:14,399 --> 04:06:15,680
things the main thing was being

4945
04:06:15,680 --> 04:06:18,000
accessible um if you can't travel you

4946
04:06:18,000 --> 04:06:20,000
can do it online and form a team

4947
04:06:20,000 --> 04:06:22,160
and additionally if you want it's

4948
04:06:22,160 --> 04:06:23,920
available for the high cost of zero

4949
04:06:23,920 --> 04:06:24,880
dollars which

4950
04:06:24,880 --> 04:06:26,880
it aligns with kind of our methodology

4951
04:06:26,880 --> 04:06:28,080
and what we want

4952
04:06:28,080 --> 04:06:30,000
all our machines are available for free

4953
04:06:30,000 --> 04:06:31,520
for a time and then once they retire

4954
04:06:31,520 --> 04:06:32,560
then you have to pay

4955
04:06:32,560 --> 04:06:34,720
a small fee to gain access to it because

4956
04:06:34,720 --> 04:06:36,239
hosting 150

4957
04:06:36,239 --> 04:06:38,560
images permanently would just be

4958
04:06:38,560 --> 04:06:40,720
expensive can't do that for free

4959
04:06:40,720 --> 04:06:42,880
um additionally i believe infosec is a

4960
04:06:42,880 --> 04:06:44,560
unique profession where team building

4961
04:06:44,560 --> 04:06:45,439
activities have

4962
04:06:45,439 --> 04:06:47,600
immeasurable impact if you look at the

4963
04:06:47,600 --> 04:06:49,199
non-infrastruct teams

4964
04:06:49,199 --> 04:06:50,960
they still do team building activities

4965
04:06:50,960 --> 04:06:52,399
like you have that gimmicky trust fall

4966
04:06:52,399 --> 04:06:54,160
and escape room etc

4967
04:06:54,160 --> 04:06:56,160
and they're doing them just to help

4968
04:06:56,160 --> 04:06:57,600
build that social bond between

4969
04:06:57,600 --> 04:06:59,199
co-workers so you know it's valuable

4970
04:06:59,199 --> 04:07:00,720
since that's the only thing they care

4971
04:07:00,720 --> 04:07:01,439
about

4972
04:07:01,439 --> 04:07:03,840
in the infosec world we have ctfs that

4973
04:07:03,840 --> 04:07:05,920
is just like that on steroids

4974
04:07:05,920 --> 04:07:07,680
it has all that same social bonding

4975
04:07:07,680 --> 04:07:10,080
benefits like i mentioned earlier i play

4976
04:07:10,080 --> 04:07:11,600
cts with barry

4977
04:07:11,600 --> 04:07:14,880
i've played cts with oxdf mr ben john

4978
04:07:14,880 --> 04:07:16,640
hammond a bunch of people i just have a

4979
04:07:16,640 --> 04:07:18,560
lot of fun with playing these ctfs along

4980
04:07:18,560 --> 04:07:20,239
with coworkers

4981
04:07:20,239 --> 04:07:22,880
and in addition to that social bond that

4982
04:07:22,880 --> 04:07:23,920
you build

4983
04:07:23,920 --> 04:07:25,680
it also gives you a lot of techniques

4984
04:07:25,680 --> 04:07:27,199
that you may be able to immediately

4985
04:07:27,199 --> 04:07:29,359
provide your work value because

4986
04:07:29,359 --> 04:07:31,439
you're joining hands with a bunch of

4987
04:07:31,439 --> 04:07:33,520
other companies to learn things

4988
04:07:33,520 --> 04:07:35,840
it wouldn't surprise me if you do the

4989
04:07:35,840 --> 04:07:37,199
ctf and then

4990
04:07:37,199 --> 04:07:38,560
find something you can immediately turn

4991
04:07:38,560 --> 04:07:40,399
around to do on your job

4992
04:07:40,399 --> 04:07:42,640
i remember doing almost any pro lab i'll

4993
04:07:42,640 --> 04:07:44,479
use offer as an example where the fret

4994
04:07:44,479 --> 04:07:46,560
hold involves exploiting splunk

4995
04:07:46,560 --> 04:07:48,960
and i had a pen test that i kept missing

4996
04:07:48,960 --> 04:07:50,720
this vector on because i just didn't

4997
04:07:50,720 --> 04:07:52,720
know it and mr ben put it in that pro

4998
04:07:52,720 --> 04:07:53,359
lab

4999
04:07:53,359 --> 04:07:54,880
so when i did that it was just like an

5000
04:07:54,880 --> 04:07:56,960
eye-opening thing of oh god what have i

5001
04:07:56,960 --> 04:07:57,920
been missing

5002
04:07:57,920 --> 04:08:00,800
so definitely the big social aspect is

5003
04:08:00,800 --> 04:08:02,000
huge here

5004
04:08:02,000 --> 04:08:05,040
awesome and and uh i couldn't agree more

5005
04:08:05,040 --> 04:08:06,720
and and once again you know thank you i

5006
04:08:06,720 --> 04:08:08,239
have one more last question

5007
04:08:08,239 --> 04:08:10,479
when it's around the benefits that your

5008
04:08:10,479 --> 04:08:12,640
team actually will receive

5009
04:08:12,640 --> 04:08:14,560
by participating at the you know that

5010
04:08:14,560 --> 04:08:17,359
con writing village ctf this year

5011
04:08:17,359 --> 04:08:19,199
yeah um hack the box and red team

5012
04:08:19,199 --> 04:08:21,439
village are almost anonymous and what we

5013
04:08:21,439 --> 04:08:22,000
provide

5014
04:08:22,000 --> 04:08:25,199
and our methodologies so the only

5015
04:08:25,199 --> 04:08:26,479
unfortunate thing is the red team

5016
04:08:26,479 --> 04:08:28,800
village ctf is a yearly thing while hack

5017
04:08:28,800 --> 04:08:30,800
the box produces new things on a weekly

5018
04:08:30,800 --> 04:08:31,600
basis

5019
04:08:31,600 --> 04:08:33,439
it's probably not to the scale that red

5020
04:08:33,439 --> 04:08:34,800
team village will be doing just because

5021
04:08:34,800 --> 04:08:35,920
it's constant

5022
04:08:35,920 --> 04:08:38,080
but if you're itching to do more after

5023
04:08:38,080 --> 04:08:38,960
doing the ctf

5024
04:08:38,960 --> 04:08:40,560
definitely check out the platform if you

5025
04:08:40,560 --> 04:08:42,479
haven't and go over to hack the box

5026
04:08:42,479 --> 04:08:42,880
because

5027
04:08:42,880 --> 04:08:44,159
i'm sure you'll love the challenges we

5028
04:08:44,159 --> 04:08:46,479
put on the site awesome

5029
04:08:46,479 --> 04:08:48,479

here at bishop fox

5054
04:13:22,800 --> 04:13:25,199
i came over here about three years ago

5055
04:13:25,199 --> 04:13:26,159
because

5056
04:13:26,159 --> 04:13:28,239
of our reputation as one of the largest

5057
04:13:28,239 --> 04:13:29,840
professional services firms

5058
04:13:29,840 --> 04:13:32,080
focused on offensive security and

5059
04:13:32,080 --> 04:13:33,600
security as a service

5060
04:13:33,600 --> 04:13:36,479
it's been a wild ride but part of i

5061
04:13:36,479 --> 04:13:37,920
stick around is because i love

5062
04:13:37,920 --> 04:13:40,880
working with such brilliant people i

5063
04:13:40,880 --> 04:13:42,479
love that we go out there and break

5064
04:13:42,479 --> 04:13:43,120
things

5065
04:13:43,120 --> 04:13:46,239
build new things break more things and

5066
04:13:46,239 --> 04:13:47,840
and always working with the latest

5067
04:13:47,840 --> 04:13:49,760
technologies to keep people safe

5068
04:13:49,760 --> 04:13:51,680
so it was a really exciting opportunity

5069
04:13:51,680 --> 04:13:53,520
for us to sponsor the red team village

5070
04:13:53,520 --> 04:13:56,080
capture the flag this year at defcon

5071
04:13:56,080 --> 04:13:57,840
where we can't wait to meet people

5072
04:13:57,840 --> 04:13:59,840
virtually and on site

5073
04:13:59,840 --> 04:14:02,479
and to hopefully find some new ways to

5074
04:14:02,479 --> 04:14:05,119
grow our team

5075
04:14:05,199 --> 04:14:06,720
hi savannah nice to see you i'm barrett

5076
04:14:06,720 --> 04:14:08,319
darnell managing senior operator at

5077
04:14:08,319 --> 04:14:09,120

i'm part of the continuous attack

5079
04:14:10,479 --> 04:14:14,000
surface testing team also known as cast

5080
04:14:14,000 --> 04:14:15,359
well we're really excited to have you

5081
04:14:15,359 --> 04:14:17,600
guys on this call today and

5082
04:14:17,600 --> 04:14:18,800
i would say the first question that we

5083
04:14:18,800 --> 04:14:20,319
kind of want to start off with is kind

5084
04:14:20,319 --> 04:14:20,880
of seeing

5085
04:14:20,880 --> 04:14:22,720
what you guys would say is the best part

5086
04:14:22,720 --> 04:14:24,159
of being a sponsor for

5087
04:14:24,159 --> 04:14:27,199
an event like this well for bishop fox

5088
04:14:27,199 --> 04:14:28,880
we're avid participants of the greater

5089
04:14:28,880 --> 04:14:30,479
infosec community and we feel that

5090
04:14:30,479 --> 04:14:32,239
sponsorship of conferences and efforts

5091
04:14:32,239 --> 04:14:32,880
like this

5092
04:14:32,880 --> 04:14:34,880
provide a real tangible value to the

5093
04:14:34,880 --> 04:14:36,800
community this ctf in particular

5094
04:14:36,800 --> 04:14:38,080
provides a tremendous amount of

5095
04:14:38,080 --> 04:14:39,439
realistic hands-on

5096
04:14:39,439 --> 04:14:41,199
experiences for those in the offensive

5097
04:14:41,199 --> 04:14:44,319
security particularly red teamers

5098
04:14:44,319 --> 04:14:46,720
yeah no that's that's awesome and i mean

5099
04:14:46,720 --> 04:14:48,239
i'm sure you know this barrett

5100
04:14:48,239 --> 04:14:50,159
with so many reasons that resources out

5101
04:14:50,159 --> 04:14:51,760
there uh why do you think kind of

5102
04:14:51,760 --> 04:14:53,439
sponsoring something like this is so

5103
04:14:53,439 --> 04:14:55,120
important

5104
04:14:55,120 --> 04:14:57,760
well for one uh this resource is free so

5105
04:14:57,760 --> 04:14:59,439
that barrier of entry is out of the way

5106
04:14:59,439 --> 04:15:00,960
uh anybody can participate

5107
04:15:00,960 --> 04:15:03,520
secondly it's realistic it mimics real

5108
04:15:03,520 --> 04:15:05,359
life scenarios that we've seen

5109
04:15:05,359 --> 04:15:07,120
on our customer engagements and so it's

5110
04:15:07,120 --> 04:15:08,560
not very esoteric uh

5111
04:15:08,560 --> 04:15:11,279
it's you know real tools real situations

5112
04:15:11,279 --> 04:15:12,239
you might be in

5113
04:15:12,239 --> 04:15:14,080
and it's also beginner friendly it

5114
04:15:14,080 --> 04:15:15,680
starts off where everybody can join and

5115
04:15:15,680 --> 04:15:16,880
get something out of it

5116
04:15:16,880 --> 04:15:19,439
but the difficulty ramps up so there's a

5117
04:15:19,439 --> 04:15:21,920
lot for experienced red teamers

5118
04:15:21,920 --> 04:15:25,439
to hone their skills on awesome i know

5119
04:15:25,439 --> 04:15:26,960
we've kind of just talked about

5120
04:15:26,960 --> 04:15:29,120
the benefits that people who are joining

5121
04:15:29,120 --> 04:15:30,880
the ctf would get out of it but

5122
04:15:30,880 --> 04:15:32,239
can you kind of talk about the benefits

5123
04:15:32,239 --> 04:15:34,000
bishop fox receives out of being a

5124
04:15:34,000 --> 04:15:35,760
sponsor for the red team village

5125
04:15:35,760 --> 04:15:39,199
ctf event at defcon yeah well

5126
04:15:39,199 --> 04:15:40,720
you know first and foremost we always

5127
04:15:40,720 --> 04:15:42,159
want to give back to the security

5128
04:15:42,159 --> 04:15:43,040
community

5129
04:15:43,040 --> 04:15:45,920
and this is a great way for us to

5130
04:15:45,920 --> 04:15:46,800
interact with

5131
04:15:46,800 --> 04:15:48,880
the hundreds maybe even thousands of

5132
04:15:48,880 --> 04:15:51,040
attendees and participants

5133
04:15:51,040 --> 04:15:53,680
uh whether they're there in person or

5134
04:15:53,680 --> 04:15:54,560
virtually

5135
04:15:54,560 --> 04:15:57,279
um it's great um from where i sit as a

5136
04:15:57,279 --> 04:15:59,359
recruiter because it gives us a chance

5137
04:15:59,359 --> 04:16:02,319
to meet new talent and people who we

5138
04:16:02,319 --> 04:16:04,319
maybe haven't engaged with before

5139
04:16:04,319 --> 04:16:05,920
and that's really important especially

5140
04:16:05,920 --> 04:16:07,680
as we continue to grow

5141
04:16:07,680 --> 04:16:09,840
our two new service lines the continuing

5142
04:16:09,840 --> 04:16:10,880
continuous attack

5143
04:16:10,880 --> 04:16:14,080
service testing team that barrett is on

5144
04:16:14,080 --> 04:16:17,600
and our red team yeah no i mean

5145
04:16:17,600 --> 04:16:18,880
everybody knows in the security

5146
04:16:18,880 --> 04:16:21,040
community who bishop fox is and i'm sure

5147
04:16:21,040 --> 04:16:22,479
they would love to know about the

5148
04:16:22,479 --> 04:16:23,520
recruitment

5149
04:16:23,520 --> 04:16:25,760
so i guess what types of people do you

5150
04:16:25,760 --> 04:16:26,800
guys typically

5151
04:16:26,800 --> 04:16:29,760
look for for the team yeah so you know

5152
04:16:29,760 --> 04:16:30,800
what we need

5153
04:16:30,800 --> 04:16:32,640
and what we're hiring for can kind of

5154
04:16:32,640 --> 04:16:34,399
shift month to month so

5155
04:16:34,399 --> 04:16:36,000
in the past if you engaged with us and

5156
04:16:36,000 --> 04:16:37,840
it wasn't a fit um that might be

5157
04:16:37,840 --> 04:16:39,680
changing so you know always stay in

5158
04:16:39,680 --> 04:16:40,399
touch

5159
04:16:40,399 --> 04:16:42,319
um first and foremost we look for people

5160
04:16:42,319 --> 04:16:44,080
who are really passionate about security

5161
04:16:44,080 --> 04:16:46,319
because that's definitely who

5162
04:16:46,319 --> 04:16:48,399
we are and you know we're always looking

5163
04:16:48,399 --> 04:16:50,640
for um a diversity of thoughts a

5164
04:16:50,640 --> 04:16:52,080
diversity of backgrounds

5165
04:16:52,080 --> 04:16:53,840
so uh you know we have a lot of people

5166
04:16:53,840 --> 04:16:56,239
who came from a pretty like traditional

5167
04:16:56,239 --> 04:16:58,080
career paths you know school

5168
04:16:58,080 --> 04:16:59,840
work but we definitely have folks who

5169
04:16:59,840 --> 04:17:02,239
are self-taught who are coming from

5170
04:17:02,239 --> 04:17:04,880
non-traditional backgrounds um you know

5171
04:17:04,880 --> 04:17:06,800
we we love our folks from the military

5172
04:17:06,800 --> 04:17:07,439
as well

5173
04:17:07,439 --> 04:17:09,120

5174
04:17:09,120 --> 04:17:11,199
can lead you to working at bishop fox

about some of the curriculum

5254
04:23:52,399 --> 04:23:53,840
i've been involved with sans for quite a

5255
04:23:53,840 --> 04:23:55,600
bit first as a student and then

5256
04:23:55,600 --> 04:23:57,760
as an instructor and so sans is a

5257

04:24:08,880 --> 04:24:11,359
or in one of our in-person events so i

5264
04:24:11,359 --> 04:24:12,960
invited henry onto the stream so we can

5265
04:24:12,960 --> 04:24:15,760
just kind of talk about the curriculum

5266
04:24:15,760 --> 04:24:17,359
um the first thing you know let's talk

5267
04:24:17,359 --> 04:24:18,640
about the offensive operations

5268
04:24:18,640 --> 04:24:19,840
curriculum can you kind of go over

5269
04:24:19,840 --> 04:24:21,279
what that what that focuses on

5270
04:24:21,279 --> 04:24:22,960
absolutely and so we've got a slide on

5271
04:24:22,960 --> 04:24:24,080
the screen here basically

5272
04:24:24,080 --> 04:24:26,080
uh we you know steve sims is our

5273
04:24:26,080 --> 04:24:27,439
technical director for the offensive

5274
04:24:27,439 --> 04:24:28,960
operations curriculum

5275
04:24:28,960 --> 04:24:31,040
and if you've watched what's happened in

5276
04:24:31,040 --> 04:24:32,560
probably about the last several months

5277
04:24:32,560 --> 04:24:34,319
we've transformed what was formally for

5278
04:24:34,319 --> 04:24:36,720
a long long time the sans pen testing

5279
04:24:36,720 --> 04:24:38,960
curriculum to a offensive operations

5280
04:24:38,960 --> 04:24:39,840
curriculum

5281
04:24:39,840 --> 04:24:41,279
and i'll cover some of the breakout

5282
04:24:41,279 --> 04:24:42,960
basically as to why we did that

5283
04:24:42,960 --> 04:24:44,640
uh you know one of the the main reasons

5284
04:24:44,640 --> 04:24:46,720
though was we covered the you know a lot

5285
04:24:46,720 --> 04:24:47,840
of the uh

5286
04:24:47,840 --> 04:24:50,159
baselining of you know the the uh i

5287
04:24:50,159 --> 04:24:51,279
guess

5288
04:24:51,279 --> 04:24:53,279
how can i phrase it here basically ttp

5289
04:24:53,279 --> 04:24:54,960
awareness basically in josh wright's

5290
04:24:54,960 --> 04:24:57,120
security 504 course uh and then what to

5291
04:24:57,120 --> 04:24:58,640
do with regard to instant handling

5292
04:24:58,640 --> 04:25:00,399
we covered a lot of the vulnerability uh

5293
04:25:00,399 --> 04:25:02,000
scanning and vulnerability assessment

5294
04:25:02,000 --> 04:25:03,359
threat modeling stuff

5295
04:25:03,359 --> 04:25:05,760
in matt tusein's security 460 course

5296
04:25:05,760 --> 04:25:07,120
over at the top there

5297
04:25:07,120 --> 04:25:09,439
and then we go in uh deep dive in you

5298
04:25:09,439 --> 04:25:10,560
know with network

5299
04:25:10,560 --> 04:25:12,080
authorized network pen testing and tim

5300
04:25:12,080 --> 04:25:13,920
median security 560 course

5301
04:25:13,920 --> 04:25:15,279
uh in the center there in that pen

5302
04:25:15,279 --> 04:25:17,840
testing comprehensive area uh we also go

5303
04:25:17,840 --> 04:25:18,319
you know

5304
04:25:18,319 --> 04:25:20,399
cover many other aspects to include you

5305
04:25:20,399 --> 04:25:22,159
know web even a new cloud

5306
04:25:22,159 --> 04:25:23,840
web app databases everything else

5307
04:25:23,840 --> 04:25:25,680
including even a new cloud pen testing

5308
04:25:25,680 --> 04:25:26,479
course as well

5309
04:25:26,479 --> 04:25:28,000
that's over on the right there written

5310
04:25:28,000 --> 04:25:29,600
by moses frost

5311
04:25:29,600 --> 04:25:31,120
uh and there's a new cert for that one

5312
04:25:31,120 --> 04:25:32,560
as well just to call that out since it's

5313
04:25:32,560 --> 04:25:34,319
new the gcpn

5314
04:25:34,319 --> 04:25:35,680
but one of the things that we noticed

5315
04:25:35,680 --> 04:25:37,920
was in addition to

5316
04:25:37,920 --> 04:25:39,920
these various areas we needed to grow a

5317
04:25:39,920 --> 04:25:41,840
little bit more to serve the purple team

5318
04:25:41,840 --> 04:25:42,560
community

5319
04:25:42,560 --> 04:25:44,800
the red team community specifically uh

5320
04:25:44,800 --> 04:25:46,640
specifically in talking with barrett

5321
04:25:46,640 --> 04:25:48,640
with georgia chiles uh previously

5322
04:25:48,640 --> 04:25:49,840
talking with uh

5323
04:25:49,840 --> 04:25:52,239
joe vest and james tuberville also we

5324
04:25:52,239 --> 04:25:54,800
had a single course that uh had started

5325
04:25:54,800 --> 04:25:56,000
in the red team uh

5326
04:25:56,000 --> 04:25:57,920
area but we wanted to grow the qriklin

5327
04:25:57,920 --> 04:25:59,840
to be a little bit more comprehensive

5328
04:25:59,840 --> 04:26:02,159
so uh omar can i ask you to uh to slide

5329
04:26:02,159 --> 04:26:05,600
to uh the second slide please

5330
04:26:09,680 --> 04:26:11,760
so the second slide there now covers a

5331
04:26:11,760 --> 04:26:14,479
little bit more of the uh

5332
04:26:14,479 --> 04:26:17,359
are we on the foundational still we're

5333
04:26:17,359 --> 04:26:18,640
on foundational

5334
04:26:18,640 --> 04:26:22,159
yes so next slide after this one please

5335
04:26:22,159 --> 04:26:30,800
it should say specialized top left

5336
04:26:30,800 --> 04:26:32,159
there we go that's the one all right

5337
04:26:32,159 --> 04:26:34,479
perfect

5338
04:26:36,159 --> 04:26:37,520
all right so let me let me just chat

5339
04:26:37,520 --> 04:26:39,359
about that one for a second basically so

5340
04:26:39,359 --> 04:26:42,800
you know we wanted to add additional uh

5341
04:26:42,800 --> 04:26:45,199
breadth depth uh in the uh you know

5342
04:26:45,199 --> 04:26:46,800
offensive operations curriculum where it

5343
04:26:46,800 --> 04:26:47,680
wasn't just

5344
04:26:47,680 --> 04:26:50,159
pen testing uh per se basically but we

5345
04:26:50,159 --> 04:26:51,439
cover a lot of the different

5346
04:26:51,439 --> 04:26:53,680
aspects you know red teaming if you uh

5347
04:26:53,680 --> 04:26:54,479
read uh

5348
04:26:54,479 --> 04:26:56,159
george archielice's course basically if

5349
04:26:56,159 --> 04:26:57,439
you've taken the course you understand

5350
04:26:57,439 --> 04:26:58,000
you know we start

5351
04:26:58,000 --> 04:27:00,239
with the the scanning the reconnaissance

5352
04:27:00,239 --> 04:27:01,760
basically we move on to

5353
04:27:01,760 --> 04:27:03,680
you know a little bit more of the you

5354
04:27:03,680 --> 04:27:05,040
know the social we move to the

5355
04:27:05,040 --> 04:27:05,760
weaponization

5356
04:27:05,760 --> 04:27:07,760
we move to the delivery we move to the

5357
04:27:07,760 --> 04:27:09,520
reporting the measurements obviously

5358
04:27:09,520 --> 04:27:12,239
always working with the uh the blue team

5359
04:27:12,239 --> 04:27:13,040
measuring

5360
04:27:13,040 --> 04:27:15,520
training trying to get better basically

5361
04:27:15,520 --> 04:27:17,040
and one of the things that we

5362
04:27:17,040 --> 04:27:19,120
have identified is that we need

5363
04:27:19,120 --> 04:27:21,199
additional depth and breadth basically

5364
04:27:21,199 --> 04:27:23,359
uh on the red teaming side in addition

5365
04:27:23,359 --> 04:27:24,720
to the one course that's mentioned at

5366
04:27:24,720 --> 04:27:26,159
the bottom right there which is

5367
04:27:26,159 --> 04:27:28,319
georgia chile's course uh and so we

5368
04:27:28,319 --> 04:27:30,239
wanted to expand things a little bit

5369
04:27:30,239 --> 04:27:31,680
more and that's what we've got with the

5370
04:27:31,680 --> 04:27:32,880
various areas now

5371
04:27:32,880 --> 04:27:35,120
so top left there is the the specialized

5372
04:27:35,120 --> 04:27:36,399
pen testing area

5373
04:27:36,399 --> 04:27:38,159
variety of courses that are listed i'll

5374
04:27:38,159 --> 04:27:40,239
call out real quick just a couple things

5375
04:27:40,239 --> 04:27:43,199
uh the security 467 course uh written by

5376
04:27:43,199 --> 04:27:44,239
dave shackleford

5377
04:27:44,239 --> 04:27:46,560
and uh james leyte vidal actually goes

5378
04:27:46,560 --> 04:27:48,080
live on september 8th

5379
04:27:48,080 --> 04:27:49,920
so that's in literally a month from now

5380
04:27:49,920 --> 04:27:51,279
so i just wanted to alert the community

5381
04:27:51,279 --> 04:27:52,159
about that

5382
04:27:52,159 --> 04:27:54,960
also the uh security 550 the active

5383
04:27:54,960 --> 04:27:55,600
defense

5384
04:27:55,600 --> 04:27:57,840
cyberspace trapping attack disruption

5385
04:27:57,840 --> 04:27:59,520
and cyber deception course

5386
04:27:59,520 --> 04:28:02,239
goes live on november the 15th at our

5387
04:28:02,239 --> 04:28:03,680
pentax hack fest event

5388
04:28:03,680 --> 04:28:05,199
we've been waiting for quite some time

5389
04:28:05,199 --> 04:28:06,800
for that course to uh to come back

5390
04:28:06,800 --> 04:28:07,439
basically

5391
04:28:07,439 --> 04:28:09,279
and it's finally made it back and then

5392
04:28:09,279 --> 04:28:11,439
finally uh last but not least uh

5393
04:28:11,439 --> 04:28:13,120
it's listed i think on the next slide

5394
04:28:13,120 --> 04:28:14,960
but we've got an iot pen testing course

5395
04:28:14,960 --> 04:28:16,880
in addition to some additional uh red

5396
04:28:16,880 --> 04:28:20,239
team courses that are coming as well

5397
04:28:20,239 --> 04:28:23,359
for sure we it's it's amazing how much

5398
04:28:23,359 --> 04:28:24,800
specialization can happen

5399
04:28:24,800 --> 04:28:27,120
with this with this field um you we

5400
04:28:27,120 --> 04:28:28,000
started with talking about the

5401
04:28:28,000 --> 04:28:28,800
foundational

5402
04:28:28,800 --> 04:28:31,279
uh material i i've been teaching 660 for

5403
04:28:31,279 --> 04:28:32,239
a bit now

5404
04:28:32,239 --> 04:28:34,080
and uh and just when you go to the talks

5405
04:28:34,080 --> 04:28:35,439
you see all the different villages

5406
04:28:35,439 --> 04:28:37,040
there's all these niches that people

5407
04:28:37,040 --> 04:28:39,040
people can dive in so it's nice to see

5408
04:28:39,040 --> 04:28:41,359
more and more material around the things

5409
04:28:41,359 --> 04:28:43,359
that that interest folks

5410
04:28:43,359 --> 04:28:45,680
i know with 660 we we have a date we

5411
04:28:45,680 --> 04:28:46,720
have uh

5412
04:28:46,720 --> 04:28:48,720
half the course we talk about advanced

5413
04:28:48,720 --> 04:28:50,319
pen testing and then we get into exploit

5414
04:28:50,319 --> 04:28:51,120
development

5415
04:28:51,120 --> 04:28:53,120
and a story that steve likes to tell

5416
04:28:53,120 --> 04:28:54,399
when he wrote the course was

5417
04:28:54,399 --> 04:28:56,560
he had he had an idea for just an

5418
04:28:56,560 --> 04:28:58,000
exploit development course

5419
04:28:58,000 --> 04:29:00,800
uh 10 years ago and at the time the

5420
04:29:00,800 --> 04:29:02,479
community really wasn't ready just

5421
04:29:02,479 --> 04:29:03,840
you know there wasn't a big enough

5422
04:29:03,840 --> 04:29:06,399
market just to do exploit development

5423
04:29:06,399 --> 04:29:08,000
and so 660 was born

5424
04:29:08,000 --> 04:29:09,279
where we talked about advanced pen

5425
04:29:09,279 --> 04:29:11,279
testing talked about um uh

5426
04:29:11,279 --> 04:29:13,279
exploit development and it was also a

5427
04:29:13,279 --> 04:29:14,880
little bit easier for folks to

5428
04:29:14,880 --> 04:29:16,720
to get their employers to sponsor that

5429
04:29:16,720 --> 04:29:18,159
because you know maybe they're an

5430
04:29:18,159 --> 04:29:19,600
offensive security role

5431
04:29:19,600 --> 04:29:20,720
but not necessarily something that

5432
04:29:20,720 --> 04:29:22,960
warrants an exploit development nowadays

5433
04:29:22,960 --> 04:29:24,159
you know there's a huge market for

5434
04:29:24,159 --> 04:29:26,000
exploit development uh people wanting

5435
04:29:26,000 --> 04:29:27,279
that that knowledge

5436
04:29:27,279 --> 04:29:29,920
and so uh you know so you showed us what

5437
04:29:29,920 --> 04:29:31,279
was the past what's the future what's

5438
04:29:31,279 --> 04:29:32,159
this evolution

5439
04:29:32,159 --> 04:29:34,720
in uh in red team training from sans and

5440
04:29:34,720 --> 04:29:36,080
so uh if we go to the

5441
04:29:36,080 --> 04:29:38,239
the third slide here thank you there it

5442
04:29:38,239 --> 04:29:40,880
is over on the right side uh we've got

5443
04:29:40,880 --> 04:29:41,359
some

5444
04:29:41,359 --> 04:29:42,720
new courses that are in development

5445
04:29:42,720 --> 04:29:44,640
right now i've alluded to a couple over

5446
04:29:44,640 --> 04:29:45,920
on the left side like at the bottom

5447
04:29:45,920 --> 04:29:47,680
there the iot pen testing course that

5448
04:29:47,680 --> 04:29:49,840
one actually comes out on september 29th

5449
04:29:49,840 --> 04:29:51,600
it is live right now on the uh the

5450
04:29:51,600 --> 04:29:54,239
website larry pesci uh james leyte vidal

5451
04:29:54,239 --> 04:29:55,920
and steve walbrow just wrote that course

5452
04:29:55,920 --> 04:29:57,520
and it's going to be a a great new

5453
04:29:57,520 --> 04:29:58,159
course

5454
04:29:58,159 --> 04:30:00,640
uh in addition to that though over on

5455
04:30:00,640 --> 04:30:01,439
the right side

5456
04:30:01,439 --> 04:30:03,279
top right and specific to this community

5457
04:30:03,279 --> 04:30:04,640
to the red teaming community

5458
04:30:04,640 --> 04:30:07,199
uh we've got a brand new five-day red

5459
04:30:07,199 --> 04:30:09,199
team operations course that's coming

5460
04:30:09,199 --> 04:30:11,040
now we've had red team operations

5461
04:30:11,040 --> 04:30:13,120
courses you know previously if you will

5462
04:30:13,120 --> 04:30:13,600
so

5463
04:30:13,600 --> 04:30:16,479
at least the security 5604 course

5464
04:30:16,479 --> 04:30:17,680
originally written by

5465
04:30:17,680 --> 04:30:20,199
joe vest and james tufferbell back in uh

5466
04:30:20,199 --> 04:30:22,159
2016-2017 time frame

5467
04:30:22,159 --> 04:30:24,720
and then rewritten by george ortillas

5468
04:30:24,720 --> 04:30:25,199
plus

5469
04:30:25,199 --> 04:30:27,439
c2 matrix integration and a variety of

5470
04:30:27,439 --> 04:30:28,960
other things basically that

5471
04:30:28,960 --> 04:30:30,640
enhanced that course uh when it was

5472
04:30:30,640 --> 04:30:33,199
rewritten in 2019 by george artiles

5473
04:30:33,199 --> 04:30:35,120
but we still only have a two-day course

5474
04:30:35,120 --> 04:30:37,199
and what we wanted to develop here was

5475
04:30:37,199 --> 04:30:39,120
get a little bit more depth on the red

5476
04:30:39,120 --> 04:30:40,800
teaming and get a little bit more

5477
04:30:40,800 --> 04:30:41,359
breadth

5478
04:30:41,359 --> 04:30:43,680
as well and so uh i will quickly

5479
04:30:43,680 --> 04:30:45,760
highlight three courses and then i think

5480
04:30:45,760 --> 04:30:46,560
uh

5481
04:30:46,560 --> 04:30:49,120
best uh thing i can do is i'll describe

5482
04:30:49,120 --> 04:30:50,720
what i'm aware of but i think barrett's

5483
04:30:50,720 --> 04:30:51,199
gonna be

5484
04:30:51,199 --> 04:30:54,159
the the better person to ask about 565

5485
04:30:54,159 --> 04:30:55,439
specifically but

5486
04:30:55,439 --> 04:30:58,000
565 in summary a five-day red team

5487
04:30:58,000 --> 04:30:59,920
operations course basically everything

5488
04:30:59,920 --> 04:31:00,800
from the

5489
04:31:00,800 --> 04:31:02,159
you know the concepts of red team

5490
04:31:02,159 --> 04:31:04,000
operations and performing you know high

5491
04:31:04,000 --> 04:31:05,840
value adversary emulation

5492
04:31:05,840 --> 04:31:08,800
all the way into the deep dive basically

5493
04:31:08,800 --> 04:31:09,600
of

5494
04:31:09,600 --> 04:31:12,239
using various tools which ones work best

5495
04:31:12,239 --> 04:31:13,520
in which situations

5496
04:31:13,520 --> 04:31:15,279
and then obviously doing what we do best

5497
04:31:15,279 --> 04:31:16,880
which is measuring people processes

5498
04:31:16,880 --> 04:31:18,399
technology everything else

5499
04:31:18,399 --> 04:31:21,920
and obviously you know doing both the

5500
04:31:21,920 --> 04:31:24,640
overall uh management of it but most

5501
04:31:24,640 --> 04:31:26,800
importantly also the deep dive technical

5502
04:31:26,800 --> 04:31:27,439
for

5503
04:31:27,439 --> 04:31:30,159
growing red team operators as well in

5504
04:31:30,159 --> 04:31:31,760
addition to that of course below it uh

5505
04:31:31,760 --> 04:31:33,120
security 67 the

5506
04:31:33,120 --> 04:31:36,159
that's our red team operations windows

5507
04:31:36,159 --> 04:31:37,680
tool development that course is

5508
04:31:37,680 --> 04:31:39,760
currently in dev from jonathan ryder

5509
04:31:39,760 --> 04:31:42,640
and uh he is taking time to cover what

5510
04:31:42,640 --> 04:31:43,359
we consider

5511
04:31:43,359 --> 04:31:45,680
a gap in offensive programming right now

5512
04:31:45,680 --> 04:31:47,439
by essentially working on

5513
04:31:47,439 --> 04:31:48,960
you know tool development working on

5514
04:31:48,960 --> 04:31:50,880
enumeration working on you know gaining

5515
04:31:50,880 --> 04:31:52,159
a foothold basically

5516
04:31:52,159 --> 04:31:53,760
and then obviously just gaining you know

5517
04:31:53,760 --> 04:31:55,760
persistence in the space

5518
04:31:55,760 --> 04:31:57,040
and then obviously more advanced

5519
04:31:57,040 --> 04:31:59,199
techniques and writer is uh

5520
04:31:59,199 --> 04:32:01,199
hoping to have that course out i believe

5521
04:32:01,199 --> 04:32:02,319
uh in the uh

5522
04:32:02,319 --> 04:32:05,120
q4 uh later part of this year finally

5523
04:32:05,120 --> 04:32:05,520
i'll

5524
04:32:05,520 --> 04:32:07,120
list one more that's not currently

5525
04:32:07,120 --> 04:32:09,199
listed on here but it is a

5526
04:32:09,199 --> 04:32:10,880
brand new development course as well and

5527
04:32:10,880 --> 04:32:13,600
that's matt tucsane's uh security 665

5528
04:32:13,600 --> 04:32:15,120
which is going to be an advanced red

5529
04:32:15,120 --> 04:32:16,640
team operations course

5530
04:32:16,640 --> 04:32:18,399
that's in very initial stages of

5531
04:32:18,399 --> 04:32:20,080
development but

5532
04:32:20,080 --> 04:32:22,720
with that all said i'm sitting next to

5533
04:32:22,720 --> 04:32:25,279
the author of security 565

5534
04:32:25,279 --> 04:32:27,120
red team operations of the new five-day

5535
04:32:27,120 --> 04:32:29,120
course i'd rather actually turn it

5536
04:32:29,120 --> 04:32:30,159
around and ask you

5537
04:32:30,159 --> 04:32:32,159
what's what's new what's different

5538
04:32:32,159 --> 04:32:34,159
between that security five six core four

5539
04:32:34,159 --> 04:32:36,399
or uh 564 course of the past

5540
04:32:36,399 --> 04:32:38,239
the two-day version and the new five-day

5541
04:32:38,239 --> 04:32:39,600
version that you're writing in security

5542
04:32:39,600 --> 04:32:40,800
565.

5543
04:32:40,800 --> 04:32:43,680
absolutely so uh we're shooting for a q1

5544
04:32:43,680 --> 04:32:44,399
next year

5545
04:32:44,399 --> 04:32:47,040
uh release of the beta version of the

5546
04:32:47,040 --> 04:32:49,120
course so uh what i've been working on

5547
04:32:49,120 --> 04:32:50,880
is is this five day course with the

5548
04:32:50,880 --> 04:32:52,880
sixth day of a fully immersive

5549
04:32:52,880 --> 04:32:53,760
environment

5550
04:32:53,760 --> 04:32:55,680
um the focus uh it's gonna be it's the

5551
04:32:55,680 --> 04:32:57,279
title is red team operations

5552
04:32:57,279 --> 04:33:00,000
and assume breach and uh and and the

5553
04:33:00,000 --> 04:33:00,640
course is

5554
04:33:00,640 --> 04:33:04,160
is is a is is uh

5555
04:33:04,160 --> 04:33:06,480
is sandwiched between some of those soft

5556
04:33:06,480 --> 04:33:08,400
skills that are often overlooked when

5557
04:33:08,400 --> 04:33:10,000
people think about red teaming

5558
04:33:10,000 --> 04:33:11,520
right of course you've got uh the

5559
04:33:11,520 --> 04:33:13,359
technical aspects of

5560
04:33:13,359 --> 04:33:15,840
of you know having strong tradecraft uh

5561
04:33:15,840 --> 04:33:17,278
getting that initial foothold doing that

5562
04:33:17,278 --> 04:33:18,080
louder movement

5563
04:33:18,080 --> 04:33:19,438
spending a lot of time in active

5564
04:33:19,438 --> 04:33:21,438
directory uh you know being comfortable

5565
04:33:21,438 --> 04:33:22,879
with with the tools and the way that

5566
04:33:22,879 --> 04:33:23,840
things are set up

5567
04:33:23,840 --> 04:33:25,359
but there's a lot about red teaming that

5568
04:33:25,359 --> 04:33:27,759
i think us uh can get overlooked and

5569
04:33:27,759 --> 04:33:28,879
and that's uh you know that's about

5570
04:33:28,879 --> 04:33:30,240
really understanding what your purpose

5571
04:33:30,240 --> 04:33:31,199
is as a red team

5572
04:33:31,199 --> 04:33:33,278
you know why are you there uh in the

5573
04:33:33,278 --> 04:33:34,719
first place whether you're an internal

5574
04:33:34,719 --> 04:33:35,520
red team

5575
04:33:35,520 --> 04:33:38,320
uh or a uh consulting red team you know

5576
04:33:38,320 --> 04:33:39,919
you know i often feel that your goal is

5577
04:33:39,919 --> 04:33:41,438
to make that blue team better

5578
04:33:41,438 --> 04:33:43,520
right uh if you if you do a pen test and

5579
04:33:43,520 --> 04:33:45,438
you find a lot of a lot of issues

5580
04:33:45,438 --> 04:33:46,799
you deliver those there's not a whole

5581
04:33:46,799 --> 04:33:48,240
lot of collaboration that happens it

5582
04:33:48,240 --> 04:33:49,199
kind of depends on

5583
04:33:49,199 --> 04:33:51,199
on the contract but uh but you might

5584
04:33:51,199 --> 04:33:52,719
come back a year later and still

5585
04:33:52,719 --> 04:33:54,958
see some of those things uh you know as

5586
04:33:54,958 --> 04:33:55,840
a red teamer

5587
04:33:55,840 --> 04:33:57,840
you want to do that adversary emulation

5588
04:33:57,840 --> 04:33:59,359
it's almost like giving

5589
04:33:59,359 --> 04:34:01,520
the test to the blue team hey this is

5590
04:34:01,520 --> 04:34:03,278
these are the ttps we're going to use

5591
04:34:03,278 --> 04:34:05,278
uh they're well documented we're going

5592
04:34:05,278 --> 04:34:07,278
to stick with this

5593
04:34:07,278 --> 04:34:09,759
and this is how you can you can grade

5594
04:34:09,759 --> 04:34:11,438
your systems as long as

5595
04:34:11,438 --> 04:34:14,160
uh you know we give you that score card

5596
04:34:14,160 --> 04:34:16,320
of we're going to emulate this adversary

5597
04:34:16,320 --> 04:34:17,759
you can make sure all of your detection

5598
04:34:17,759 --> 04:34:18,561
and response

5599
04:34:18,561 --> 04:34:20,561
are set up properly and so it's it's

5600
04:34:20,561 --> 04:34:22,080
very specific

5601
04:34:22,080 --> 04:34:23,759
but what you know what we can walk away

5602
04:34:23,759 --> 04:34:25,199
from after that engagement

5603
04:34:25,199 --> 04:34:27,359
is knowing that all of those controls

5604
04:34:27,359 --> 04:34:28,561
are in place and they're working

5605
04:34:28,561 --> 04:34:29,359
properly

5606
04:34:29,359 --> 04:34:30,639
right we're able to we're able to

5607
04:34:30,639 --> 04:34:33,039
validate and test it so uh you know i

5608
04:34:33,039 --> 04:34:33,919
think some of that

5609
04:34:33,919 --> 04:34:35,680
is important on the front and the back

5610
04:34:35,680 --> 04:34:37,919
end and then um and then the three days

5611
04:34:37,919 --> 04:34:39,118
in the middle we're gonna do a lot of

5612
04:34:39,118 --> 04:34:40,879
deep dive into active directory

5613
04:34:40,879 --> 04:34:42,799
go beyond what uh what we do in some of

5614
04:34:42,799 --> 04:34:44,719
the other courses in sam's curriculum

5615
04:34:44,719 --> 04:34:47,199
excellent

5616
04:34:48,160 --> 04:34:51,919
and uh let's see here we did we talked

5617
04:34:51,919 --> 04:34:53,118
about the um

5618
04:34:53,118 --> 04:34:55,359
the purple team tactics course we did

5619
04:34:55,359 --> 04:34:57,039
not yet actually so there are

5620
04:34:57,039 --> 04:34:59,278
uh two existing purple team courses

5621
04:34:59,278 --> 04:35:01,320
right now so there's security uh

5622
04:35:01,320 --> 04:35:05,039
599 uh written by uh the nviso team

5623
04:35:05,039 --> 04:35:06,958
basically but uh eric van buggen out and

5624
04:35:06,958 --> 04:35:08,000
steve sims

5625
04:35:08,000 --> 04:35:09,599
and that course essentially goes into

5626
04:35:09,599 --> 04:35:11,359
you know all the different uh techniques

5627
04:35:11,359 --> 04:35:12,639
that adversaries use

5628
04:35:12,639 --> 04:35:14,400
specifically advanced adversaries but

5629
04:35:14,400 --> 04:35:16,160
then each step in the kill chain

5630
04:35:16,160 --> 04:35:18,240
how defenders can actually help stop the

5631
04:35:18,240 --> 04:35:20,639
adversaries as early in the kill chain

5632
04:35:20,639 --> 04:35:22,480
as possible and then of course there's

5633
04:35:22,480 --> 04:35:24,160
another uh of course uh right on the

5634
04:35:24,160 --> 04:35:26,320
tail of that the security 699

5635
04:35:26,320 --> 04:35:28,400
uh purple team tactics uh course that

5636
04:35:28,400 --> 04:35:29,919
one's written by eric van buggen out of

5637
04:35:29,919 --> 04:35:31,199
the enviso team again

5638
04:35:31,199 --> 04:35:34,561
and uh jim shoemaker as well uh of sans

5639
04:35:34,561 --> 04:35:36,400
and uh that course is a little bit more

5640
04:35:36,400 --> 04:35:37,919
on the red side

5641
04:35:37,919 --> 04:35:40,320
more with emulating specific adversaries

5642
04:35:40,320 --> 04:35:41,680
so i want to say and i'm going off

5643
04:35:41,680 --> 04:35:42,320
memory here

5644
04:35:42,320 --> 04:35:44,639
he emulates three to four different uh

5645
04:35:44,639 --> 04:35:46,480
uh you know advanced uh groups if you

5646
04:35:46,480 --> 04:35:48,400
will basically threat actor groups

5647
04:35:48,400 --> 04:35:50,000
and then actually walks through and

5648
04:35:50,000 --> 04:35:51,759
helps individuals to

5649
04:35:51,759 --> 04:35:53,840
prep from both the red team perspective

5650
04:35:53,840 --> 04:35:55,840
of emulating them and then obviously

5651
04:35:55,840 --> 04:35:57,118
you know what you would do for it to

5652
04:35:57,118 --> 04:35:58,561
help the purple team side as well

5653
04:35:58,561 --> 04:35:59,278
basically or

5654
04:35:59,278 --> 04:36:01,118
tell both the uh the red and the blue

5655
04:36:01,118 --> 04:36:02,480
side as well

5656
04:36:02,480 --> 04:36:04,000
i'm really excited about the way that

5657
04:36:04,000 --> 04:36:05,599
the curriculum is just expanding and

5658
04:36:05,599 --> 04:36:07,118
going deeper into all these uh all these

5659
04:36:07,118 --> 04:36:08,080
different topics

5660
04:36:08,080 --> 04:36:09,840
uh another thing we've done uh with the

5661
04:36:09,840 --> 04:36:11,599
offensive operations curriculum is we

5662
04:36:11,599 --> 04:36:13,599
have a discord server out there um it

5663
04:36:13,599 --> 04:36:14,240
allows

5664
04:36:14,240 --> 04:36:15,599
it allows students to communicate with

5665
04:36:15,599 --> 04:36:17,599
instructors instructors after the course

5666
04:36:17,599 --> 04:36:18,480
is done

5667
04:36:18,480 --> 04:36:20,000
we obviously have our platform that we

5668
04:36:20,000 --> 04:36:21,759
use when we do the training but but this

5669
04:36:21,759 --> 04:36:23,438
is great to uh to circle back

5670
04:36:23,438 --> 04:36:24,879
with folks you can you can reach out to

5671
04:36:24,879 --> 04:36:26,879
the instructors uh can you kind of talk

5672
04:36:26,879 --> 04:36:29,039
about what you've used after the course

5673
04:36:29,039 --> 04:36:30,799
uh and so that that that's out there on

5674
04:36:30,799 --> 04:36:33,438
discord i'll i'll put a link out on our

5675
04:36:33,438 --> 04:36:34,160
uh

5676
04:36:34,160 --> 04:36:37,039
um on on our platform later and uh are

5677
04:36:37,039 --> 04:36:38,879
there any other resources that sans has

5678
04:36:38,879 --> 04:36:40,958
yeah in addition to the discord which i

5679
04:36:40,958 --> 04:36:42,561
think that's you and that's john

5680
04:36:42,561 --> 04:36:44,480
gorenflow right i believe uh in addition

5681
04:36:44,480 --> 04:36:47,039
to that we've also got sans.org free

5682
04:36:47,039 --> 04:36:50,240

5683
04:36:50,240 --> 04:36:53,039

04:37:41,039 --> 04:37:43,438
listed and tied into sans.org free as

5710
04:37:43,438 --> 04:37:44,320
well

5711
04:37:44,320 --> 04:37:47,118
great i appreciate you coming out hey

5712
04:37:47,118 --> 04:37:48,160
thank you for having me

5713
04:37:48,160 --> 04:37:50,240
uh while we're here i want to do one

5714
04:37:50,240 --> 04:37:52,240
more thing and that is uh

5715
04:37:52,240 --> 04:37:54,160
i know we recently announced on the

5716
04:37:54,160 --> 04:37:56,160
website uh that we had uh

5717
04:37:56,160 --> 04:37:58,080
certified you as an instructor again

5718
04:37:58,080 --> 04:38:00,240
that was totally unrelated to uh

5719
04:38:00,240 --> 04:38:01,919
to me coming out here but it was nice

5720
04:38:01,919 --> 04:38:04,080
because all the stars actually align for

5721
04:38:04,080 --> 04:38:04,719
once

5722
04:38:04,719 --> 04:38:06,400
instead of taking six months between

5723
04:38:06,400 --> 04:38:08,160
when we see each other and whatever else

5724
04:38:08,160 --> 04:38:11,199
uh may happen but i got a call from lisa

5725
04:38:11,199 --> 04:38:13,118
peterson who is somebody that i know you

5726
04:38:13,118 --> 04:38:14,799
know very well and all of our sans

5727
04:38:14,799 --> 04:38:16,400
instructors know very well

5728
04:38:16,400 --> 04:38:18,639
and she truly has been the sherpa is

5729
04:38:18,639 --> 04:38:20,080
probably the best way to put it

5730
04:38:20,080 --> 04:38:22,561
to get instructors from you know new

5731
04:38:22,561 --> 04:38:23,359
instructors

5732
04:38:23,359 --> 04:38:25,359
all the way through certified status she

5733
04:38:25,359 --> 04:38:26,719
is just good people for

5734
04:38:26,719 --> 04:38:28,799
always guiding somebody through the

5735
04:38:28,799 --> 04:38:30,480
various wickets of the process and

5736
04:38:30,480 --> 04:38:31,520
everything else and

5737
04:38:31,520 --> 04:38:33,680
pitfalls of the process as well and

5738
04:38:33,680 --> 04:38:35,359
getting people from a to z

5739
04:38:35,359 --> 04:38:37,919
she called me specifically and asked if

5740
04:38:37,919 --> 04:38:39,118
she could bring

5741
04:38:39,118 --> 04:38:41,680
me something because she knew i was

5742
04:38:41,680 --> 04:38:43,278
