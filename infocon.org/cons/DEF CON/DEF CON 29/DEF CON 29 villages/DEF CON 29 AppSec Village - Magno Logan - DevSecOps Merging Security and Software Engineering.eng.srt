i've been a devops and devsecops

14
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,680
enthusiast since 2017 when i started

15
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,079
researching about this topic and this

16
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:40,719

17
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,239

20
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,840
starting to write it

21
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,960

where i write some articles

25
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,000
about application security cloud

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,240
security or container security

27
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,720
and there is also all my contact

28
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,360
information there my social media

29
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,040
profiles and my all my previous talks in

30
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,119
my previous presentation and slides

31
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:17,920
since i

32
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,799
started uh talking about security in

33
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,159
2011

34
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:27,119
so so yeah that's it

35
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,920
okay so the agenda for uh for this

36
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,759
presentation right first

37
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,000
i wanna tell your story and talk a

38
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,920
little bit about my experience

39
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,119
uh of trying to uh

40
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,079
apply deploy uh apply security

41
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:44,079
principles and devops and devsecops

42
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,479
principles in different organizations

43
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:49,680
i worked in financial institutes

44
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,479
institutions back in brazil and i worked

45
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,000
in some tech startups

46
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,320
here in canada as well so i'll tell you

47
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,840
a little bit about that and i hope

48
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,479
that's

49
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:01,040
that's gonna be helpful for you uh we're

50
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,040
gonna try to understand like why there

51
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:03,840
is a uh

52
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,280
this um this kind of constant argument

53
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,080
between

54
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,800
the need for the word devsecops instead

55
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,720
of just using devops right and

56
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,160
understanding that and and

57
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,319
we're going to go into a little bit more

58
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,000
details there

59
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,879
um why why there is this need of of

60
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,080
devsecops right

61
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,400
isn't isn't just a different name for

62
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,239
the same thing and doing

63
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,840
a kind of uh just kind of a it's a new

64
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,760
buzzword that's been

65
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,040
um going on for a while now and and why

66
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:35,440
some

67
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,560
organizations um say that they're doing

68
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,599
devsecops

69
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:43,120
in and when actually they they're not

70
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,879
right

71
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:48,160
um yeah just creating some uh

72
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,200
also talking about like

73
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,920
how devsecops is much more than tooling

74
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,560
right and

75
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,239
and having those tools in your pipeline

76
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,120
although it's very important it's not

77
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,080
it's not that

78
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,239
that's not enough right so other

79
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:05,200
approaches

80
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,519
and other uh processes are also

81
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,280
necessary

82
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,680
and yeah just a little bit about that

83
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,800
and also

84
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,400
what what worked with me during my

85
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,159
uh my experience and my um

86
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,360
my approach applying those principles

87
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,080
in into different organizations and of

88
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,640
course

89
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,840
what didn't work uh as well so that you

90
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,319
know

91
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:33,120
that might not be as effective although

92
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,799
i tried

93
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,879
okay so before we start just getting

94
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,680
getting some things out of the way since

95
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,400
every

96
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,080
devops or devsecops talk needs to have

97
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,959
at least these three things right has to

98
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:49,920
have this

99
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,080
the infinity loop talking about

100
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,200
themselves

101
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,080
has to have this unicorn with the

102
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,280
rainbow and

103
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,319
has to talk about shifting left so we're

104
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,680
just gonna leave that here

105
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,879
uh before we begin so that you know that

106
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,760
okay yeah it's it's we're going to talk

107
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,560
about that

108
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,080
but it's not just that right

109
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,880
so let me tell you a story oops okay

110
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,199
let me tell you a story and and just to

111
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,478
paint the picture

112
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:23,440
for you as this was my experience uh in

113
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,320
a previous

114
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,720
employer right that was a tech startup

115
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,880
which was growing i think it wasn't

116
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,320
considered startup anymore they had over

117
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,759
um 1200 employees right

118
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,199
and out of those 1200 more than

119
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,400
300 of them were developers

120
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,520
right and they didn't have

121
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,000
any application security specialist

122
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,800
right

123
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,759
and so i was the first application

124
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,800
security specialist to join their team

125
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,000
and they didn't have pretty much

126
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,199
any kind of security tools into in in

127
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,880
their pipeline right they didn't have

128
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,160
any kind of

129
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,720
static analysis dynamic analysis or

130
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,560
software composition analysis

131
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,080
right there was nothing like that

132
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,600
there was also no secure code reviews

133
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,600
there was some code reviews but not

134
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,039
focused on security

135
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:25,280
per se and the only

136
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,440
um the only tool that i can say that

137
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,479
was related to security but it wasn't

138
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:35,120
properly set up and properly configured

139
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,960
was a web application firewall

140
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,840
in front of some of those applications

141
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,039
right

142
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:42,880
so you can see right away that there is

143
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,240
a big challenge here

144
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,639
right i joined their team and and i

145
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,320
needed to implement some

146
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,680
uh application security approaches and

147
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,120
projects

148
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,240
not just not just spin testing but also

149
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,479
training the developers on on secure

150
00:05:58,479 --> 00:05:59,520
coding

151
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,960
and also there was

152
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:07,120
a project regarding pci compliance and

153
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,639
and that's one of the reasons why the

154
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,319
secure coding training was

155
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,880
was needed as well right so there was a

156
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,240
lot of challenge there

157
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,759
and and one of the things was

158
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,680
that that i did that was really

159
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,039
interesting was

160
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:24,479
okay right i i realized i can't do

161
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,360
everything on my own and i need help

162
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,800
right

163
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,319
so uh with that i started talking

164
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,520
with different developer teams

165
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,039
and also q a teams to understand

166
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:42,000
uh uh their process how they work which

167
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,280
tools do they use

168
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,400
right uh which just like okay which ide

169
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,680
do they use and

170
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,800
how how that works how they get a a

171
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,840
code out of the door right so how how

172
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,400
does

173
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,880
like they decide on each sprint what

174
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,319
they're going to work on

175
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,160
and and they have those tickets assigned

176
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,520
to the developers

177
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,840
right and so on how everything works so

178
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,280
the first months were

179
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,520
understanding that and i think that was

180
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,520
really important to connect with them

181
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,120
right but then i created

182
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,039
a secure coding training and

183
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,400
when i went to talk to the

184
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,840
their engineering managers right to okay

185
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,800
now i created this material based on the

186
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,520
oas top 10 proactive controls

187
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,639
and i i want to

188
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,560
like have some time and and have some

189
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,639
developers join at least on the first

190
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:37,599
session

191
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:40,000
so so that we can teach them and talk

192
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,599
about secure coding right

193
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:44,720
and so the training was very interactive

194
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,680
it was uh uh i had some some plans some

195
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,759
hands-on exercises so that they could

196
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,400
see

197
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,199
uh why the vulnerabilities happen but

198
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:53,680
also

199
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,639
how they they uh how they could fix it

200
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,639
right so that's one of the reasons why i

201
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,160
didn't choose the

202
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,000
oasp top 10 which is the most

203
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,039
traditional uh a top 10 document of oas

204
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:08,240
but i chose the proactive controls which

205
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,360
are much more

206
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,759
focused on the developer right much more

207
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:12,960
focused on

208
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,280
fixing the vulnerabilities or or even

209
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,960
avoiding the vulnerabilities from

210
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,599
happening

211
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:20,240
right if you implement them correctly um

212
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,680
and that's what i wanted like

213
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,319
i i don't want to teach a developer how

214
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,039
to

215
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,199
exploit a sql injection or exploit

216
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:28,720
across site scripting

217
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,080
i want to teach them and and show them

218
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,399
how to avoid them from happening in the

219
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:35,279
first place

220
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:38,479
right so yeah the training took uh

221
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:40,559
uh it was going the plan was for the

222
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,399
training to take four hours

223
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:46,000
uh so half a day and and right away

224
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,320
once i scheduled the training i received

225
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,440
some pushback

226
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,959
from the engineering managers right

227
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:55,519
they said no that's too long and and the

228
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,200
developers can't stay

229
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,360
uh four hours in this training that's

230
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,959
not relevant for them

231
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,399
and and that's not gonna work so

232
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:06,640
yeah the first that's that's i know i

233
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,160
understand that that's a struggle

234
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,040
right so i had to cut the training down

235
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,880
to two hours and and

236
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,120
because of that i had to remove most of

237
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,000
the

238
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,040
a hands-on part of the training right

239
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,560
um and okay like we did it with uh a

240
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,000
smaller group of

241
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,880
uh developers so that they would kind of

242
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,800
evaluate the first session

243
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,920
and see how that worked and and yeah

244
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,200
okay that that went well finally but

245
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,440
i just want to give you a warning here

246
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,560
and

247
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,680
make sure that once you join

248
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,680
a team especially in knapsack and

249
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,760
especially if you're trying to apply

250
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,360
uh some devops and devsecops approaches

251
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,320
that you need the support of the

252
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,399
engineering managers and the leaders

253
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:54,959
right

254
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,360
it's not going to work if you try to

255
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,279
push those changes because there are

256
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,360
sometimes they can be cultural changes

257
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:01,839
and

258
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:04,000
it's not the way how the the company

259
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,040
used to work and

260
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,120
and and you implement different tools

261
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,240
that might

262
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,839
affect their process right so

263
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,519
if you don't have their support it's

264
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,519
going to be really really hard for you

265
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:16,079
to

266
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:18,800
apply uh apply those and implement these

267
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,920
processes

268
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,480
okay so yeah this is the beginning of

269
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,839
the story and we're gonna talk more

270
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:24,240
about

271
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,680
later about what worked and what didn't

272
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,320
work

273
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,040
in regards to this process at the end of

274
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,839
this presentation

275
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,079
so what is a software engineering right

276
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:41,120
uh moxie marlin spike the

277
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,000
creator of signo said that software is

278
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,360
never finished right

279
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,440
you can't just stop working on it it's a

280
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,519
part of an ecosystem that's

281
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:53,200
that's moving right and for myself

282
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,800
i i totally agree with him and i say

283
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,959
that software development is like a

284
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:01,920
mmorpg right like

285
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,640
i'm a sieve muted player online role

286
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,760
playing game

287
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,680
it's an ongoing process right it never

288
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,279
ends there is always quest

289
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:13,839
to do there is always places to go

290
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,160
things to buy right so there is always

291
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:16,959
different stuff

292
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:19,519
in on those games that it never ends so

293
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:20,640
i think that

294
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,519
uh software development is just like a

295
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,720
mmo rpg

296
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:29,200
so why

297
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,680
do you need to worry about soft

298
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,560
engineering

299
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,839
if you work in security right there is

300
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:36,880
this great quote

301
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,480
quote that uh chris hughes

302
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,519
reminded me this this past week

303
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,360
from this book agile application

304
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,040
security which by the way is a great

305
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:47,839
book

306
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,079
that says that security teams that try

307
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:51,440
to reduce the risk

308
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,920
by minimizing change rather than

309
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,680
supporting the developer teams

310
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,480
right uh supporting the development

311
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,279
teams right

312
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,560
to realize their ideas in a secure way

313
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,440
are doomed to increasingly irrelevant in

314
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:05,680
an

315
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,399
agile world right so what does that mean

316
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:09,120
right

317
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,240
if you if you try to keep

318
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,760
working as a security person

319
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,600
on the old ways of uh blocking

320
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,839
uh blocking the development of new

321
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:24,639
changes blocking

322
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:27,040
uh the deployment of software if there

323
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,959
is some vulnerability that's not even

324
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:29,680
critical

325
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,279
or really relevant um what's going to

326
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:34,240
happen

327
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,760
is exactly that the security teams are

328
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,000
going

329
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
to be bypassed their security teams are

330
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,680
going to be ignored

331
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:45,040
and i've seen this happen right so i

332
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,800
i had a real life experience with that

333
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,920
and and then what in the end nobody wins

334
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:52,480
right

335
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,160
because security is not going to get

336
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,920
their way and

337
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,320
uh developers are going to ship a

338
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,320
software that's not safe that's not

339
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,839
secure enough because

340
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:04,240
it didn't go through any process right

341
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,079
so we need to understand that

342
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:08,880
and i think that's one of the big

343
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,760
reasons

344
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,480
why application security engineers need

345
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,279
to understand

346
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:15,760
code and need to understand how to code

347
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,880
so that they can

348
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,760
understand the developers mindset right

349
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,000
we

350
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,480
always talk about oh we need to have the

351
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,720
the attacker's mindset the hacker's

352
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,360
mindset

353
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,920
right but in this case here the

354
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,600
application security engineers need to

355
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,920
have the developers mindset so that they

356
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,600
understand their struggles and

357
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,279
understand that sometimes

358
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,839
it's not up to them to choose what to

359
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:38,560
focus on

360
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,560
right if they're going to develop a new

361
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,399
feature or if they're going to fix a

362
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:43,519
vulnerability

363
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:46,320
sometimes it's it's up to the uh

364
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:46,959
leadership

365
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,120
team or the project managers or the

366
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,160
product owners

367
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,320
there are the ones that decide that

368
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,639
right okay

369
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:57,839
good so what

370
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:00,959
what really is devops right what is

371
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,320
really devops

372
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,680
how does that work so

373
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,120
devops was created in as a

374
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,320
evolution of the agile methodologies

375
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,519
and it's it's not just tools

376
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,920
and processes right it's it's a set of

377
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,399
cultural changes and practices

378
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,399
that increases the organizational

379
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,480
ability to deliver value

380
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,120
and deliver code and applications and

381
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:27,760
services

382
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,959
at a higher speed right so in a way that

383
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:32,560
there is always

384
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,240
uh new features and and new applications

385
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,079
deployed in production

386
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:41,120
that they they bring value to your

387
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,600
customer right to your end customer

388
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,800
um but where where is

389
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,399
well like i don't see how

390
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:54,240
uh security can be uh

391
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,480
part of this this kind of this diagram

392
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,279
here right

393
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:00,000
security is not there because most

394
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,519
organizations that say that they're

395
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:02,959
doing devops

396
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:06,720
are not focusing on security right

397
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,440
they're doing devops they're doing agile

398
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,639
they're doing sprints

399
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:13,920
but most of them are not doing security

400
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,000
and that's why i think it's very

401
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,279
important to

402
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:20,480
mention that that for my perspective

403
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,079
that's one of the reasons

404
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:25,600
why the the word devsecops and other

405
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,480
words were

406
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,839
were uh coined as well to to create this

407
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:31,440
awareness right to create

408
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,160
to raise the awareness of where is

409
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,120
security

410
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,160
right so yeah where is security

411
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,560
many organizations are applying devops

412
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,240
without thinking about security and

413
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:42,880
that's

414
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,920
that's critical here right the goal of

415
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,160
devsecops is exactly to raise the

416
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,920
awareness and increase the need of

417
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,880
security

418
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,920
in this shifting culture using the agile

419
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,920
and the automation mindset right

420
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,399
so it's not just tools it's not just

421
00:15:58,399 --> 00:15:59,120
culture

422
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,000
but also automation right the way and

423
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:02,720
and for

424
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,360
for you to have automation most of the

425
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,040
times you're going to need to code you

426
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,000
know you're going to write

427
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
some scripts and that's why it's

428
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,279
important for

429
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,759
security engineers to know and

430
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:14,639
understand

431
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,720
programming language and understand how

432
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,120
to code

433
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,720
so devsecops is an evolution of devops

434
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,440
right

435
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,959
uh to make sure that security teams

436
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:29,680
stop being the bottleneck of digital

437
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,920
transformation

438
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:36,959
okay so okay but

439
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:38,480
what is the difference between those

440
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,160
right it's still maybe you're still

441
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,120
confused and

442
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,079
and it's not clear what's going on there

443
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:45,680
are some companies that

444
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:49,279
can do security uh with devops

445
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:52,560
but that's not the majority of them

446
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,639
devsecops means considering like

447
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,880
application infrastructure security

448
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,759
from the very start right without

449
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,759
slowing down the devops workflow

450
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:04,880
and and what does that mean right you

451
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,640
need to understand how the pipeline

452
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,959
works how they're shipping code

453
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:11,599
so that you can implement security

454
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:12,240
features

455
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,679
at each step of the pipeline and without

456
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:17,439
slowing them down right you don't want

457
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:18,959
to block them you don't want to slow

458
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:19,839
them down

459
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,240
and especially you you don't want to

460
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,079
break the build right you want to avoid

461
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,599
breaking the build because that's going

462
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:26,880
to create friction

463
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,160
with the developers so introducing

464
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,440
security in the beginning

465
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,720
right in the inception of the

466
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,880
development life cycle and

467
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,440
uh automating testing within the develop

468
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,799
devops workflow

469
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:41,120
so let's say the developers are shipping

470
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,000
code and they're

471
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,520
already using a ci cd uh too

472
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,720
like i don't know jenkins yeah i mean

473
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,080
it's still used today but so how are you

474
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,520
going to automate your

475
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,480
security testing right one way of doing

476
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,200
that

477
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,799
is uh applying your scripts and your

478
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:01,760
testing

479
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,919
on the pipeline the same pipeline that

480
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:05,520
they're running their builds right

481
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,840
so you apply your security testing

482
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,640
together

483
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,360
with jenkins and jenkins and other cicd

484
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,280
tools have many plugins

485
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,240
that are uh that can do this for you

486
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,120
right they can

487
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,160
trigger some static analysis testing or

488
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,480
dynamic analysis or even software

489
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,000
composition out of this testing so

490
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,440
that's very important right

491
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,880
using what you have to uh

492
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,480
on uh to help you automate and increase

493
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,160
the security on the pipeline

494
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,559
of course devops has and devsecops has

495
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,240
many different names

496
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,280
right it started as like a rugged devops

497
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:45,679
right

498
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:48,000
and and any change over the years you

499
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:48,960
may find

500
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,320
uh uh different names for devsecops or

501
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,440
sec devops and nigel security as well

502
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,880
but to me they all mean the same thing

503
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,240
they all mean applying security

504
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,280
verifications on the pipeline in a way

505
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,520
that doesn't affect development

506
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,559
but also apply gives them some guard

507
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,400
radios and some

508
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,440
guidance right like

509
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,160
some protection before the code goes

510
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,360
into production right

511
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,160
we all know that identifying those

512
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,000
issues early and often

513
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,320
it's cheaper right and it's easier to

514
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,679
fix right so why

515
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:31,039
we're not doing that yet

516
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,840
so one of the things that i like to

517
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,440
mention here is

518
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,160
focus on some opportunities to improve

519
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,280
uh security

520
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,919
at some key points in the life cycle

521
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:42,880
right

522
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:47,440
um and in security or devsecops right

523
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,640
the game changes frequently right new

524
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,679
vulnerabilities

525
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:55,360
and new um threats must be addressed and

526
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,520
resolved on an ongoing basis right

527
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,160
it's very hard even for us that work in

528
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:00,880
security

529
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,480
it's very hard to keep up with the

530
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,640
latest stress and latest vulnerabilities

531
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,280
right

532
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,919
imagine the developers right that's not

533
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:09,600
their main focus and we don't want

534
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,840
developers to be an expert in security

535
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,159
right

536
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:15,280
we want them to be our uh uh

537
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,159
helpers and always always also our

538
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:19,039
champions

539
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:22,720
right so closing those security gaps

540
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,640
early and in the life cycle reduces the

541
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,960
the operational impact the risk of

542
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,080
exploitation

543
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:35,120
and the cost of responding to incidents

544
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:39,039
so yeah like having fast dust and

545
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,480
software composition analysis

546
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,200
is not devsecops right that doesn't mean

547
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,159
that you're doing

548
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,480
uh uh devsecops that's great having

549
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,080
those tools in the pipeline

550
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,080
especially if you you're addressing

551
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,080
those vulnerabilities and the reports

552
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,480
and of course validating them as well to

553
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,200
avoid

554
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,200
sending noise and false positives to the

555
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,240
developers

556
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,120
but that's not enough right devsecops is

557
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,000
is bigger than

558
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,760
that and and there's different

559
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,360
approaches that we can do

560
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,000
in the even in the early stages of the

561
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,360
life cycle before

562
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,919
even there is even some code written

563
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:13,679
such as threat modeling

564
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:16,960
uh to to start

565
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,960
some devsecops process and implement

566
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,159
some requirements

567
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:22,400
on on the process on the project

568
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,039
lifecycle

569
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,840
so why not just start left

570
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,400
right we talk about shifting left and

571
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:34,880
and

572
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,559
and all that stuff like okay yeah let's

573
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:38,400
shift security left

574
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,520
and although that seems

575
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:45,200
uh reasonable most of the times

576
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,000
if you start shifting security left by

577
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,600
the time that you get

578
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,159
at the beginning of the life cycle it's

579
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:53,679
going to be too late

580
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:56,640
process is going to be already changed

581
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,039
uh uh uh projects have moved

582
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:01,840
on and completed right so that's not

583
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,159
going to work

584
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:07,360
so i heard about this approach

585
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,080
i think was from uh stephanie from

586
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,679
secure code warrior

587
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:14,799
that okay why not just start left

588
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:17,919
right and that really really uh uh made

589
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,200
me thinking like

590
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,320
hmm okay yeah that makes sense

591
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,760
we should start our application security

592
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,960
approaches

593
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,000
together with the development of the

594
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:30,799
application

595
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:34,080
right if if the this life cycle

596
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,480
starts at the planning session and

597
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,200
talking about features and requirements

598
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,039
that's when should we should start as

599
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:42,880
well so maybe

600
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,520
starting with like a threat modeling

601
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,400
starting

602
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,960
participating on those planning sessions

603
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,159
and understanding

604
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:53,679
uh features that might be security

605
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:55,840
related or that might need some security

606
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:56,960
requirements

607
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,600
that's even better than trying to bring

608
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,039
security

609
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:03,760
uh uh left from like okay from paint

610
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,640
testing

611
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,360
to maybe dust and maybe sassed and all

612
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,640
that stuff right

613
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,400
so i i really like that idea

614
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,360
of starting left and not just shifting

615
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,080
left

616
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,320
and i think that's that's a very

617
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,159
important thinking here

618
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:22,480
that maybe we need to change to make

619
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,880
sure that devsecops is not just

620
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,760
a a joke to to people and not just okay

621
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,919
yeah i have those tools implemented and

622
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:31,840
i'm on fine i'm doing devsecops

623
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,960
right so yeah that that's that's what i

624
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,159
would like to

625
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:39,600
uh uh to recommend and maybe provide

626
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,080
some

627
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,279
uh uh feedback here get get some

628
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:44,640
feedback actually

629
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,360
from from you to see how how you think

630
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,559
about that like

631
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:50,960
is it better to just start left instead

632
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,400
of shifting life

633
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,799
right shifting left is not that simple

634
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:57,440
it takes time and effort right

635
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,760
by the time you have shifted left it

636
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,080
could be already too late

637
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,120
and shifting left can require purchasing

638
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,360
and and maybe the deployment of new

639
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,400
tools which

640
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,279
also takes a lot of time right so think

641
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:13,840
about that

642
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,480
so what worked and what didn't work for

643
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:18,880
me

644
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,240
when i tried to apply this uh devsecops

645
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,880
approaches in different organizations

646
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,400
right what worked what worked was

647
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,120
partnering with different teams such as

648
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,440
the q a team for deploying tools in the

649
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,799
pipeline

650
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:37,840
so for example as i mentioned earlier

651
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,320
we didn't have any application security

652
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,400
tools in our pipeline right

653
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,120
and we thought about it right and okay

654
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,880
maybe we should deploy something

655
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,279
and and should at least to have a

656
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:50,320
overview of

657
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,279
okay what is your or what is our attack

658
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:54,320
surface right

659
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:57,039
what is the kind of the projects and the

660
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:58,960
repositories that are most

661
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,400
at most at risk so

662
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,480
we deployed a tool called solar cube

663
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,200
to analyze the quality and the security

664
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,080
of the code

665
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,799
right and and so some of you may say oh

666
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:14,000
but sonarcube is not

667
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,480
a security tool right it's more like a

668
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,600
code quality and

669
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,720
code coverage testing coverage too right

670
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,960
you're correct but sony cube has

671
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,240
different

672
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,320
uh plugins and different features that

673
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,440
can detect

674
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,080
security vulnerabilities as well right

675
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:30,960
and so

676
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,159
by by deploying star cube you have the

677
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:36,000
support of the qna team

678
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
because they're also interested in in

679
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,679
detecting and fixing

680
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:42,400
quality issues in the code right so that

681
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,279
was

682
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:45,279
something that really worked for me and

683
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:46,480
i had the support

684
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,679
of the q a manager to do that and and

685
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:52,799
that went really well

686
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:55,840
another thing that worked for me was

687
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:56,640
bringing

688
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,960
senior developers to the abstract team

689
00:25:58,960 --> 00:25:59,840
right

690
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,720
so as i said before when i joined one of

691
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,760
those teams that i

692
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,799
worked for uh uh in an organization i

693
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:08,799
was the only application security

694
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:09,440
analyst

695
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,960
right so like i wasn't going to be able

696
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,799
to to handle everything

697
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:18,000
and and we started hiring not just

698
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,320
internally but also externally to build

699
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,039
out the

700
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:23,360
the whole security team not just upset

701
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,120
but but the security in general

702
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:29,600
right so one thing that worked was

703
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,840
some senior developers that were already

704
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,440
in at the company

705
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,840
and they were working on their own

706
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,760
domains and their own code bases and

707
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,640
projects

708
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,320
but they really they really like

709
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,760
security and they're really interesting

710
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,760
security right

711
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:47,279
at the beginning we started something

712
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:49,279
like like everybody knows as the

713
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:50,559
security champions

714
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:54,640
right oh they stay on their own teams

715
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,919
but they are the the voice of security

716
00:26:57,919 --> 00:26:59,600
on that team

717
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:03,279
let me tell you the problem of that

718
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,159
once the developer that's part of the

719
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:07,760
team and reports to

720
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,880
a team lead or or like a developer

721
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:11,919
manager

722
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:15,600
starts voicing problems

723
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:19,440
on the code of their own peers

724
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,799
they start getting like

725
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:26,080
being pushed around and being excluded

726
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:29,440
of other activities

727
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,559
and i know that kind of sucks but at

728
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:33,440
least that was

729
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,240
that was what happened with me uh and

730
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,279
and with my

731
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:41,039
uh with my experience actually so

732
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:43,840
what we we changed this uh approach on

733
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,600
the security champions because it wasn't

734
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,399
working

735
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:49,760
and also because who this uh the person

736
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:50,799
who decided

737
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:54,240
um which features or which tickets the

738
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,399
developers were going to work on

739
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:58,320
was the project managers the product

740
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,159
owners sorry

741
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:02,799
so unless they really said okay you work

742
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:04,720
on this security ticket

743
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,279
they couldn't work on that and although

744
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:09,039
there were some vulnerabilities from

745
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:11,039
previous fantastic reported to their

746
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:12,320
team it was

747
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,559
always on the backlog right and last

748
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:15,600
there was some

749
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:19,279
some really uh escalations to fix those

750
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:20,240
issues

751
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,159
there was always they always stayed on

752
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:23,679
the backlog right

753
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:26,080
and and and and kind of being ignored

754
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,039
there until

755
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:30,320
until there was some escalation so what

756
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,200
worked for us

757
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,760
was bringing the developers to the

758
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:34,960
abstract team okay

759
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,159
now you're not just security champions

760
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:40,320
but now you are part of the security

761
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,159
team you are the voice

762
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:43,919
of the security team and you have the

763
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:45,360
authority to say

764
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,480
that what you're doing is wrong or or in

765
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,000
a way of course it's not like pointing

766
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:50,880
fingers but

767
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,120
it's in a way that they need to fix this

768
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,279
vulnerability right this is critical

769
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:59,120
and even they can even help with um

770
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,159
like specific stuff actionable uh stuff

771
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:04,080
on on how to fix that issue right

772
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,600
because they understand the code base

773
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,799
they understand the code

774
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:08,960
they can even write a pr if they want if

775
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,480
they are available

776
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,840
all the the the developer teams need to

777
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:14,559
do is

778
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:17,360
review the pr accept the vr and that's

779
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:17,840
it

780
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:21,279
right so that really worked for us so

781
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:23,200
the security champions was kind of

782
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,880
something that we needed we needed to

783
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,200
adjust in our organization and maybe

784
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,679
that that's similar with uh your

785
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:31,840
experience as well

786
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:34,480
another thing that worked really well

787
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,600
was

788
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,760
to bring the support of the other

789
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:38,640
developers

790
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,840
other analysts and qna teams we did a

791
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,360
lot of exercises on

792
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,080
city apps we presented to them what is a

793
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:46,880
ctf

794
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,880
right we did some red team blue team

795
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,039
exercises with the developer teams as

796
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:51,760
well

797
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,000
so that they could understand how the

798
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:54,799
attackers

799
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:56,880
uh compromised some applications and

800
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,240
some vulnerabilities

801
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,399
but also how they could protect those

802
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:02,080
issues with code

803
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:05,120
or with tools right so that was really

804
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,520
uh uh that was really interesting to

805
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,240
create the

806
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,720
the to raise the awareness for the

807
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,360
developers

808
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,799
as well and now here we created the

809
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:16,960
kind of the attacker's mindset that's

810
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:20,840
that's that was the goal for for this

811
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:23,520
exercise

812
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,640
and what didn't work right so

813
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,880
i talked about what worked let's talk

814
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,120
about the bad stuff or what didn't work

815
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,320
and and maybe

816
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:35,520
maybe you can uh we can discuss what

817
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,559
could have done

818
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:39,760
could have been done better right one of

819
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,120
the things was

820
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,360
the lack of understanding and the

821
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,279
support of engineering leaders

822
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:49,200
in regards to security right as i said

823
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,080
uh in the beginning in related to the

824
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,360
secure coding training

825
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,360
right they didn't they didn't think it

826
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,600
was relevant for the developers and

827
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,679
didn't think was necessary to to have

828
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:00,880
the developers

829
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:04,080
spend uh uh four hours on a training

830
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:07,840
right and and and that was kind of

831
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:11,440
uh really frustrating to me

832
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,600
um so yeah you need to have the support

833
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,399
of the the leaders and the managers

834
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:18,880
especially on the engineering team if

835
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,480
you have if you want to build a good

836
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,240
relationship with the developers

837
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,760
and have their support as well

838
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,960
another thing was lack of the ability to

839
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,360
prioritize critical security issues

840
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:34,799
right as i said the person who decided

841
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:37,039
what was going to be worked on on that

842
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:37,919
street

843
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:41,039
was the product owner right and unless

844
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:43,840
we convinced the product owner that that

845
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,919
vulnerability or that security feature

846
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:47,840
was important

847
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,480
he or she wasn't going to uh they

848
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,760
weren't going to do

849
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,000
to implement that and to prioritize that

850
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,519
it was always going to stay on the

851
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:56,159
backlog

852
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:01,279
right so security maybe can have a uh

853
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:04,320
a discussion with that in about that

854
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,120
in regards to okay who should be

855
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,840
responsible about prioritizing security

856
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,760
right one of the things that we're

857
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:12,880
trying to implement

858
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,080
but but we couldn't do it in time

859
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:19,120
was deciding okay

860
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:22,159
now if 30

861
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:25,120
or or x amount of percentage of your

862
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,159
sprints

863
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:28,480
should be related to security right

864
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,840
maybe 30

865
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,919
okay so if you have any security

866
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:33,440
vulnerabilities that are

867
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:36,320
kind of high or critical or if you have

868
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,679
security features that can be

869
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:38,640
implemented

870
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,279
let's say to uh prevent brute forcing

871
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:42,399
attacks implement

872
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:45,519
captcha or something like that then you

873
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:47,120
need to focus on those

874
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:50,080
for the 30 of your sprint right so yeah

875
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,760
if the sprint is two weeks right you

876
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,279
need a couple days there

877
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:57,039
to focus on security stuff

878
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:59,120
right but that that didn't get

879
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,320
implemented in time

880
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:03,360
so that didn't work and

881
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:06,480
another thing that didn't work was app

882
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,480
sack or application security or

883
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,440
infosec in the beginning wasn't involved

884
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:11,760
in

885
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,600
as an active participant in the plenty

886
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,360
of new features right

887
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,080
so we didn't know what the developer

888
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,760
teams were working on

889
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,080
any major products or features that they

890
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,399
were planning and developing

891
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:28,159
so we're kind of kept in the dark there

892
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:31,519
so we had to we had to like

893
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:36,159
kind of it was was almost like we had to

894
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:39,039
listen to our developer friends and talk

895
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:40,559
to them to try to

896
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:42,640
to try to get those informations about

897
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,360
what was what was happening and what was

898
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,720
being developed and if there was

899
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,000
something that could be

900
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,720
uh potentially critical in regards to

901
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,120
security like a new payment feature

902
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:56,240
or the the company accepting now

903
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,039
uh gift cards and stuff like that right

904
00:33:59,039 --> 00:33:59,840
that could be

905
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:02,240
really affecting uh uh the security of

906
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,519
the whole application

907
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:05,919
right so that's that's something that

908
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:06,720
that's probably

909
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,280
uh um that that's really important to

910
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,359
have and and maybe having a security

911
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:12,480
team or a

912
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,520
an upset person joining

913
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,520
the the sprint planning sessions of

914
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,879
those teams or at least

915
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:22,719
being involved and being uh

916
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:25,359
being informed about those new features

917
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:27,760
that especially the critical ones

918
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,280
that's really important

919
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:33,760
uh i forgot to mention but one of the

920
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,918
things that did work for us

921
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:39,119
was working with uh

922
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:43,440
third-party uh vendors and and

923
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,079
yeah third-party vendors that provided

924
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:46,800
some

925
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,520
uh some paint testing as a service so

926
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,359
since we didn't have the team

927
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:54,159
and enough uh people to do pen testing

928
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:56,079
on many different applications

929
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:59,359
we had uh someone help us with

930
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:02,000
uh with those testing that that we they

931
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,920
would report those vulnerabilities

932
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,320
and what we did was based on that

933
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,920
reporting we would add

934
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,880
the the vulnerabilities as a jira ticket

935
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,480
into our ticketing system

936
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:16,160
and place that ticket into into the

937
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,720
the backlog of of the the specific

938
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,760
developer teams

939
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,839
right so that was also something that

940
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:24,160
worked

941
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:28,800
so to summarize that and and i think um

942
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:32,000
i hope that brought you some uh

943
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,280
interesting remarks here right um so

944
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,760
try to make security as much part of the

945
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,320
development process as writing code

946
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,200
so understanding the tools that they use

947
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,079
like i said

948
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:47,520
uh it can be jira which ide do they use

949
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,800
is it yes code or is it intellij right

950
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,520
how do they work on their own tickets on

951
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,119
their own bugs even if they're not

952
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:56,480
security bugs right

953
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:59,040
and then you can se follow the same

954
00:35:59,040 --> 00:35:59,920
process

955
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,320
for for vulnerabilities or which or

956
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,680
security bugs as well

957
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:07,200
right make security transparent and part

958
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,160
of the developer

959
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,160
workflow right without adding more

960
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,520
barriers now

961
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:14,800
so don't don't force don't force

962
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:18,560
uh the developers to use security tools

963
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,560
don't force the developers to be to need

964
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,599
to access

965
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:24,480
a console off of the res to get the

966
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,720
results of a security testing

967
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,640
um that's not gonna work right that's

968
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,720
not going to work

969
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:33,839
so there is one uh uh and one great

970
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:34,320
quote

971
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:37,760
from uh disney denis cruz from oasp

972
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:41,680
that he he said that in the upset latin

973
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:44,400
latin america in 2011 right so 10 years

974
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,599
ago

975
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:47,760
and that really caught my attention

976
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,760
nobody likes bugs

977
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,560
not even the developers it makes them

978
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:52,880
look

979
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:56,400
bad also nobody likes to be

980
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,720
told that they're wrong especially in a

981
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:01,520
report report format right a pdf format

982
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,440
if you send a pdf to the developer

983
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,920
i'm sorry but i can't help you right

984
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,000
that's not going to work

985
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,560
so the idea here is to become the

986
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,160
developer's best friend

987
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,000
and they will help you without even

988
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,599
knowing right

989
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:17,200
kind of the security champions

990
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,440
initiative as i as i mentioned

991
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,720
right and also him remember what matters

992
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,000
to the business

993
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,200
and balance security with

994
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:31,119
features okay that's it for this talk i

995
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:32,800
hope you have enjoyed and i'll be

996
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,599
available for

997
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:37,359
questions thank you
