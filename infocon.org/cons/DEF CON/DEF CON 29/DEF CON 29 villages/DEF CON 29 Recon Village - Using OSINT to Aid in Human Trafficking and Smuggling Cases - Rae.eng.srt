1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,120
hey thanks for having me today uh my

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,520
name is ray baker

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,960
um wundersmith underscore ray on twitter

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,280
if you are into that sort of thing

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,759
i'm really excited to be here this is my

6
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:14,559
first

7
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:18,080
talk at defcon recon village

8
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,160
my talk today is about using ocean to

9
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,359
combat human trafficking and smuggling

10
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:25,119
so i'm going to talk a little bit about

11
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:26,640
some statistics

12
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,599
and then how trafficking has permeated

13
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:31,199
our culture and then we're going to go

14
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:32,640
into a case

15
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,840
a case study i guess

16
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,879
so i'm not a huge fan of these interest

17
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:42,840
slides

18
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,559
um but i think it's kind of important to

19
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,879
talk about who i am and what i do and

20
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:50,239
then it will make a little more sense

21
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:51,199
why this is

22
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:54,800
uh such a passion so i've been

23
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,239
in osam for about two years now i work

24
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:00,399
as a senior recon

25
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,520
analyst and i also have the pleasure of

26
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,040
being involved in a few

27
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,840
non-profits and they're very close to my

28
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,840
soul

29
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,080
the first one is ocean curious where we

30
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,200
bring osint

31
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,240
content to the community we

32
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,479
kind of educate on tools and processes

33
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,159
and things

34
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,520
and just kind of talk about

35
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,439
the innocent lives foundation i

36
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,119
volunteer there in the

37
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:30,159
fight against child exploitation and

38
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,439
operation safe escape i assist domestic

39
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,360
violence victims and help them escape

40
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:35,840
from their

41
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,280
abusers using osint

42
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,439
um additionally i added on here that i

43
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:42,880
have a deep love for

44
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,600
maritime content and if you follow me

45
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,720
you

46
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,320
will find that out very quickly

47
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,600
so i think it's kind of good to outline

48
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,200
like what we're talking about when we

49
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,880
say human trafficking

50
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,399
um i think a picture we have

51
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,840
of human trafficking is

52
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,040
you know a shady kind of guy

53
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,840
tricking a woman or a child into doing

54
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,160
something that they don't want to do

55
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,360
um but it's not

56
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,239
just women and children uh who can be

57
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:19,200
trafficked so this

58
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,879
this could be anybody any age race

59
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:27,520
sex gender education level anybody

60
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,280
there are some groups that are

61
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,319
more vulnerable to trafficking and this

62
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,160
could be like

63
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,400
undocumented workers um the lgbt

64
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,000
plus community um

65
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
previous domestic or abused victims

66
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,519
um ethnic minorities

67
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:53,760
uh they tend to all be a little more

68
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,280
vulnerable

69
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,440
um people who don't speak english very

70
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,920
well or are here on asylum

71
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,879
um people who can be manipulated through

72
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,080
debt or things like that

73
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,959
so that leads us to why why are people

74
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:11,920
trafficked

75
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,080
we know about sexual exploitation and

76
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,120
sex trafficking those ones are

77
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,959
pretty much talked about everywhere

78
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,920
uh but there are some other reasons and

79
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,640
and that's

80
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,920
like forcing children to serve as

81
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,599
soldiers people are forced to

82
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,640
commit crimes for criminals um you could

83
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,640
be forced into labor so this could be

84
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,239
like domestic

85
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,360
servitude or some kind of like farm

86
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,120
labor or something

87
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,640
forced marriage sometimes even organ

88
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,840
removal

89
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,599
which is a thing that i was unaware of

90
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,040
until i

91
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,080
researched for this uh

92
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,120
so how are these people traffic

93
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,599
you might say like there's no way that i

94
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,040
would be trafficked i wouldn't fall for

95
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,560
that

96
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,239
but it's really easy once

97
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:11,760
these traffickers find your need

98
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,280
like maybe you have a substance abuse

99
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,160
issue or

100
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,279
you have unstable housing you have no

101
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,358
place to live

102
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:24,000
mental health concerns maybe maybe you

103
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,759
are offered a job and you're in

104
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,800
a lot of debt so there's a need

105
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,120
that they fulfill um

106
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,600
and then there and then there's an

107
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,759
ultimatum like you can't leave because

108
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,479
now you are

109
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:42,800
in debt with me um

110
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,400
so that's that's how people fall into

111
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,320
this situation

112
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,560
um and and when i was researching this i

113
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,400
did find some facts that i thought were

114
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,840
really interesting that i wanted to

115
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,120
outline

116
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,720
in 20 20 21

117
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,199
uh because of the pandemic there's

118
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,639
obviously an increase

119
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,960
in commercial exploitation and sex

120
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,160
trafficking

121
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,240
and this included csem material which is

122
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,199
child sexual exploitation material

123
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,400
so um it's not really surprising which

124
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,000
with a lot of people home and not

125
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,470
working

126
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:15,680
[Music]

127
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,600
but what did surprise me is that a

128
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,840
portion of the increase was due to

129
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,360
people recirculating misinformation

130
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,080
on social media so this was people

131
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,440
trying to share

132
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,160
things to raise awareness like they were

133
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:30,800
sharing

134
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,960
cesa material and basically distributing

135
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,199
it

136
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:38,000
and re-victimizing again to try and

137
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,720
raise awareness

138
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,000
there was that story about children

139
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,240
being smuggled inside of furniture

140
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,600
that blew up a while ago and

141
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,880
you know you laugh about it like that's

142
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,720
ridiculous but it

143
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,080
it takes away resources and time from

144
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,840
people who are actually trying to to

145
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,120
help

146
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,440
so spreading that misinformation

147
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,880
actually causes a lot of

148
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,440
of trouble so in 2020 there were 9876

149
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,440
prosecutions

150
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,199
in the u.s 5271 convictions

151
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:18,240
and 109 216 victims were identified

152
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,720
um there's kind of a disparity between

153
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,560
how many victims were identified and how

154
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,440
many were

155
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,800
prosecuted and convicted

156
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,400
i think we can do better

157
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,240
um so the idea of trafficking is kind of

158
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,160
ingrained in our society and

159
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,240
in our culture and to the point where we

160
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,759
might not even realize that it's

161
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,120
trafficking story we're just kind of

162
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,000
used to hearing these things happen

163
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,240
and the one that i always go back to is

164
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,360
the story of pinocchio and i'm sure

165
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,840
most of us have heard pinocchio if not

166
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,440
seen it

167
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,599
so the story is pinocchio he gets

168
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:00,960
abducted by strangers who kind of coerce

169
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,720
him into going with him

170
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,880
he gets sold to an abusive puppet master

171
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,800
who makes him be a puppet and perform

172
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,000
under duress and threats and then he

173
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
escapes but he gets caught again

174
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,599
and then finally he heads off to this

175
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:19,280
debaucherous pleasure

176
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,639
island um which you can see in this

177
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,639
picture like all these boys going to

178
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:25,199
this

179
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,400
pleasure island and this is a pretty

180
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,199
typical

181
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,039
trafficking story so you're taking

182
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:32,240
someone out of their

183
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,919
surroundings that they're familiar with

184
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:35,680
you're isolating them you're forcing

185
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,160
them to perform

186
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,319
threatening them hurting them and then

187
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:41,840
you're denying their needs

188
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,840
it's like a it's a cycle

189
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,919
so now that we've kind of covered what

190
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:51,520
human trafficking is

191
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,919
um i'm going to go into a fictional

192
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:54,639
scenario

193
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,479
so 100 fictional all these pictures are

194
00:07:58,479 --> 00:07:59,360
fake

195
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,639
um not a real story but the idea is that

196
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:03,440
i want to

197
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,479
illustrate kind of how we can use open

198
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,000
source intelligence

199
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
analysis to aid in finding victims of

200
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,800
human trafficking

201
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,160
so this story starts with a woman named

202
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:18,879
naomi

203
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:21,360
and she lives in an unstable home she's

204
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,400
not really

205
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,160
doing well there she's reported missing

206
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,919
by her job

207
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:29,919
she left some clues behind that kind of

208
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:31,440
indicated it might be a human

209
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,640
trafficking case

210
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,240
so the police have looked into it

211
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,919
they've hit a dead end and

212
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,440
they've run out of resources and they

213
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,519
need us to help

214
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,000
so using ocean we will figure out how

215
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,839
she was lured

216
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:46,800
hopefully find some patterns that will

217
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,360
identify her and then we will find naomi

218
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,080
if we're lucky

219
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,839
so this story kind of starts with um

220
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:57,680
grooming

221
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,080
so the police was were able to provide

222
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,080
uh direct messages from

223
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,000
instagram uh

224
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,560
showing a conversation between crystal

225
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,360
and naomi

226
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,600
and so naomi's been having a hard time

227
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,760
she's been posting pictures online and

228
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,240
this

229
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,000
woman named crystal has been liking them

230
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,240
giving her support

231
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,360
kind of just talking her through it um

232
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,120
i think it's a misconception that

233
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,800
grooming is done mostly by

234
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,240
men um a lot of

235
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,240
trafficking starts with a woman seeking

236
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,080
out another woman to bring her into the

237
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,480
fold so if you think like elaine maxwell

238
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,560
kind of situation

239
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,800
where it's like a friendlier face up

240
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,519
front pulling you in

241
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,760
so this conversation crystal's giving

242
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,120
naomi compliments

243
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,160
um naomi says like i'm broke

244
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,720
it's sad um crystal showing her a gucci

245
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,160
purse that this guy named jay

246
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,040
brought her so she's getting expensive

247
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,320
gifts

248
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,720
um naomi's probably feeling kind of

249
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,760
jealous

250
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,200
and then crystal says you know i know

251
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,000
you need work

252
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,600
i have some work for you you know i

253
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,040
always say you're a model

254
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,360
you look like a model so my friend jay

255
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,440
can hook you up um he knows this guy who

256
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,480
wants

257
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,640
he'll pay for a date just a date nothing

258
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,560
weird um just go on the date you'll get

259
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,640
money and it'll be over

260
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,920
so she seems a little nervous about this

261
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,120
um but they continue to talk

262
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,600
and over time naomi has stopped talking

263
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,959
to all her friends

264
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,120
and she becomes completely consumed with

265
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,079
this relationship

266
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:34,560
she's formed with crystal and this guy

267
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,399
jay

268
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:39,440
so in this screenshot here

269
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,880
she posts a picture of herself and

270
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,079
jay posts oh i you know i told you you

271
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:47,920
could be a model

272
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,839
so he's now grooming her um

273
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:54,240
it's classic you know find the need

274
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,440
build rapport

275
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,360
be the one who can solve the problem but

276
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,040
it's a limited time offer

277
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,640
like you gotta hook up with this guy now

278
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,399
make some money because he's gonna be

279
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,640
gone and you'll lose the opportunity

280
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,920
so at this point this is where the

281
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,839
meetup between jay and naomi gets

282
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:14,000
started

283
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,480
as a notice and analysts um we always

284
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,240
look at social media

285
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,600
social media will

286
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,800
blow up everybody's um other social

287
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,519
media all their

288
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,160
connections all their other accounts who

289
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,000
they're talking to we can find a lot

290
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,920
through social media

291
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,920
so we use things like what's my name dot

292
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,120
app or

293
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,680
name check things like that to enumerate

294
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,440
all of these social media accounts so we

295
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,360
look at naomi crystal and jay and their

296
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,000
connections

297
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,640
and then what they're connected to and

298
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,839
it looks like pornhub

299
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:50,880
cash app instagram facebook

300
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,959
so these all will be good selectors to

301
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,480
to pivot through to find

302
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,959
every account that they own that is

303
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:59,439
available

304
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,839
so if we turn back to naomi's instagram

305
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:06,160
we are shown the last picture that she

306
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,959
made it was a photo of herself

307
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:11,360
um the comments are her boss being

308
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,240
worried

309
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,200
people are noticing her missing uh are

310
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,800
you okay you never showed up last night

311
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,160
call me

312
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,000
so everyone's worried we know she's gone

313
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
this is the last picture naomi took

314
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
it says las vegas nevada at the top

315
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,040
and again as an ocean analyst

316
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,240
we could look at exif data

317
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,839
which is data that is

318
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:37,600
put into pictures when you take a

319
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,120
picture there's data in green in the

320
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,240
picture

321
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,680
uh that tells you the camera make model

322
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,440
flash maybe gps locations um

323
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,839
what programs were used blah blah

324
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:54,720
so social media tends to strip that out

325
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,040
so instagram does not have exif data so

326
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,720
we can't use that in this case

327
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,320
but if we look closely

328
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,480
we can see a reflection in our glasses

329
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,000
and it kind of looks like a building

330
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,800
i think but let's reverse it and see

331
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,200
so okay flipping this image we can see a

332
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:13,839
building

333
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:16,959
and we can see it's a south point it

334
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:19,519
kind of looks like a casino

335
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:20,959
which would align with the fact that

336
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:23,279
she's in vegas

337
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:27,200
so using the instagram location of vegas

338
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,200
uh the reflection in her glasses the

339
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,320
name southpointe

340
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,040
and google maps were able to figure out

341
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,399
that her

342
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:37,600
approximate last location was

343
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,800
here at this south point uh hotel and

344
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,720
casino and spa

345
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,639
so this is where she was when she took

346
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,839
this last photo

347
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:49,920
know this scenario probably seems pretty

348
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,279
far-fetched

349
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:53,839
uh until you see news articles like this

350
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:55,120
one

351
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,240
uh in this news article a stalker

352
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,360
stalked someone online that they liked

353
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,519
zoomed in on her eyes and found the

354
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,279
reflection

355
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,680
um and used google street view to find

356
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,680
out what station she got off at

357
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,639
on her way home he also watched her she

358
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:14,160
had youtube videos up he watched her

359
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,079
youtube videos and noted the setup

360
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:17,839
of her apartment and which floor she

361
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:19,360
lived on

362
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,360
so he was able to follow her from the

363
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,639
station

364
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:24,560
to her house knowing which level she

365
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,800
lived on and then he ended up assaulting

366
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,079
her

367
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,399
so not too crazy i mean it's crazy but

368
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,680
not out of the question

369
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:35,920
so at this point we could send

370
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,680
information to law enforcement which

371
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,959
would be good

372
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:40,880
they could potentially pull the casino

373
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,079
footage uh

374
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:46,000
track her phone she has a verizon phone

375
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,120
we just know that so according to the

376
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,240
retention records um for verizon they

377
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,160
can provide the range to tower data for

378
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,920
seven to ten days

379
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,040
and they can provide live pings um

380
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,079
for about 400 bucks

381
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:06,319
so they could potentially find her here

382
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,160
so now that we've logged her last

383
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,839
location we've enumerated her social

384
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:13,440
media along the way we found this

385
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,800
website

386
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,320
so it's fake.net and it's an escort site

387
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,760
obviously and it has her image on it

388
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,199
so we're going to dig a little bit into

389
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:25,680
this site normally we would note things

390
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,079
like

391
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:29,360
servers uh ip addresses numbers

392
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,279
subdomains things like that

393
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:33,199
because we would want to pass that on to

394
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:35,440
law enforcement

395
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,199
but this it was not buried too deep

396
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:42,560
we found a registrant listed

397
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,000
his name is tabiru bulat bonus points if

398
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,399
you know who that is

399
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,079
and the organization is listed as

400
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:52,000
escorts international

401
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,800
super transparent guy owns an escort

402
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,199
company

403
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,959
so again we could provide law

404
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,480
enforcement with

405
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,240
domains emails names subdomains things

406
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,079
like that and they could try and maybe

407
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:07,600
shut down the website and prevent other

408
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,639
people from

409
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:12,000
being trafficked through the site

410
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,839
it's good to keep keep law enforcement

411
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,759
involved so this is a touch point

412
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:18,160
area

413
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,160
so back to social media because it is

414
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,920
the gift that keeps on giving

415
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,199
uh we are going to look at the

416
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:26,880
registrant and see what we can find on

417
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,720
his social media

418
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,600
um so we follow mr bulat and we can see

419
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,800
how he's connected to

420
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:37,360
fake.net um jay crystal naomi

421
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,440
uh we see he's also connected to a guy

422
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,920
named pieter bulat

423
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,199
who owns a company called bulat trucking

424
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:49,199
so that is something we note down also

425
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:52,560
connected to fake.net is victor small

426
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,360
so victor small has an account for cash

427
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,399
app

428
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:59,600
and he has an account for kik

429
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,680
so blowing this out a little bit we can

430
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,079
see victor small

431
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:10,240
and his kik account here

432
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,480
which has a profile image and the

433
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,559
profile image if you blow it up and you

434
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,480
reverse it

435
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,839
it's a rotterdam sports team so that's

436
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,000
of note that would indicate that he

437
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,599
probably lives near

438
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:26,400
rotterdam um or is at least from

439
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,959
rotterdam

440
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,559
so his kick account username is smalls

441
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:35,360
underscore vic

442
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,760
and what's interesting when we ran

443
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,360
because what we do is we go through each

444
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,799
username if there's

445
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:43,120
a username we try it everywhere to see

446
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:43,919
if maybe they're

447
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:45,919
reusing the username because that that's

448
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:47,679
a thing people do

449
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:50,960
so we search this username and it pops

450
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,880
on the dark web

451
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,240
so this guy's not very smart he uses

452
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,440
usernames across accounts um

453
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,799
outside and inside and we find

454
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:06,640
an interesting conversation

455
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,559
so this is a conversation we found

456
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:09,760
between uh

457
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,200
victor and two other people and this is

458
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,080
on a dark web

459
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,200
forum so it's a bunch of people

460
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:21,440
talking about how they hate women

461
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,039
um i'm talking about a video of

462
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:28,240
i don't know abuse or something and

463
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,360
um the

464
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,520
victor small says you know you think

465
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,360
this video is crazy my cousin i

466
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,120
literally bring ship loads of people

467
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,200
over here in containers

468
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,440
so let me know if you want one and i'll

469
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,720
hook you up keep an eye

470
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,840
out for the good old iron spire

471
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,120
so i'm not really sure what that means

472
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,520
yet but he mentioned shipping containers

473
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,600
and iron spire

474
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,679
so this guy's like no i don't believe

475
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:57,679
you um and he says so the trick

476
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:58,880
is to have them sealed up in the

477
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,799
container at the port so no one will

478
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:02,559
open it and no one will look

479
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:05,440
it will go across the ocean to the other

480
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,120
side and then it will get dumped onto a

481
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,799
truck

482
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:13,200
so poor victor small has told us

483
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,559
potentially the entire uh back end of

484
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:18,559
this escort company and human

485
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:20,799
trafficking organization

486
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:23,120
i'm hoping the iron spire makes sense

487
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,240
soon

488
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,480
so

489
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,720
we're going to pivot back quickly to the

490
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,760
escort site

491
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,840
so while we were on the escort site just

492
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,280
log all that out of their information in

493
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,039
your report

494
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:39,760
going back to the escort site uh we see

495
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,799
that there is another

496
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:44,480
picture under her account and this

497
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,480
picture is of a hotel room and she's on

498
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,760
the bed it's obviously

499
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,760
you know trying to solicit business on

500
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,240
the site

501
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,000
so we know social media strips out

502
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,760
exit data but if you take a picture and

503
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,280
you put it straight up on the web

504
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,880
it does not always strip out exif data

505
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,360
so this picture luckily enough when we

506
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,880
look at the properties

507
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,559
it doesn't have the camera it doesn't

508
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:10,480
have you know the brightness and all

509
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,120
that

510
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,919
but what it does have is a gps location

511
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:14,799
and that's

512
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:17,840
super interesting

513
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,760
so at this point i

514
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,039
would note down the latitude and

515
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:26,640
longitude and this photo

516
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,840
and i would drop in the latitude and

517
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:30,559
longitude

518
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:35,600
into google and when i do it shows us

519
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,159
500 west 4th street los angeles

520
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:39,039
california

521
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,799
which is very interesting since she was

522
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,080
in nevada

523
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,280
and now she's in los angeles

524
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,320
so we know she's traveling um the

525
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,159
the name is blurred out it's not a very

526
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:51,760
fancy hotel at all

527
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,960
but when we pivot over the or hover over

528
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,159
the little

529
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:58,640
picture thing there it just gives us the

530
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,440
name anyway

531
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,000
so i'm not really sure why it blurs out

532
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,280
but

533
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,440
uh so we have the hotel that she's in

534
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,640
it's called the all-star

535
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:11,120
inn so now to verify

536
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,280
that she is actually in the all-star end

537
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,840
and the gps was not

538
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:20,000
incorrect we can go to the all-star in

539
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,159
google page or the website and we can

540
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:24,240
look through the photos

541
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,159
and when we look through the photos on

542
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,240
google we can see the rooms

543
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,640
and we end up finding the exact room

544
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,400
that she is in

545
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,240
so now we have this picture we probably

546
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,760
could have reversed image search the

547
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,799
picture as well

548
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:39,919
and come across this but so this

549
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:42,159
verifies that the gps location

550
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:45,919
in the photo is actually at this hotel

551
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:47,520
where she was at when the photo was

552
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,360
taken and when we look

553
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,640
at the location of the all-star inn

554
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,840
on the map it is suspiciously close to

555
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,840
the lax terminal island

556
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:03,200
which concerns me because victor was

557
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,159
talking about putting her on a container

558
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:09,120
and being by one of the ports that is

559
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,520
known for trafficking

560
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,879
that is highly of note

561
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,840
so focusing on the dark web brag post

562
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,840
with our new information about her being

563
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:27,600
in lax versus las vegas

564
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,240
we could run a search of the ships in

565
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,840
the port

566
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,600
and when we do that it leads us to a

567
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,600
ship that is

568
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,039
docked called the iron spire

569
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:42,880
so now this makes sense uh and we look

570
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,559
at the destination it's

571
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:47,760
lax to rotterdam

572
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,159
so now that makes sense too so the story

573
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:51,039
is lining up

574
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:52,720
um he basically leaked all of his

575
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,400
information on the dark web

576
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:59,600
which would probably not happen um

577
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:02,080
so we know victor's sports team was in

578
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,600
rotterdam he's probably

579
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,880
in rotterdam working the organization on

580
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,440
that side

581
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,919
so now i want to see i want to see the

582
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:12,720
ship

583
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:17,039
so i pop over to the this lax port cam

584
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,159
and you can find these cameras

585
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:20,000
everywhere you can find street cams you

586
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,120
can find port cams

587
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,159
all over the place so this one

588
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:27,520
is a new dock street and we happen to

589
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,000
see

590
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,760
our ship getting containers loaded onto

591
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,520
it

592
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:37,039
so that's very interesting

593
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:39,679
and we could find one that says bubat on

594
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:40,320
the side

595
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,039
something like that

596
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,360
at this point i would let the port

597
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,559
authority know

598
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:50,799
or law enforcement they could probably

599
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:52,880
pull bills of lading for the containers

600
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,640
or the shipments

601
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,159
they could pop open the container

602
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:04,000
and search it if they needed to

603
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,440
now we know it's a shipping company and

604
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,960
we're going to research that specific

605
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,799
ship to find what shipping company they

606
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:10,640
use

607
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,919
and we see that

608
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:16,240
bula trucking has heavy connections to

609
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,120
this shipping company we see

610
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,679
um bula trucks going in and out of the

611
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:23,760
same location over time

612
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:27,039
um in rotterdam

613
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:30,640
so we know based on this location of

614
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,480
in this corporate record of bulat

615
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,559
trucking in rotterdam

616
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:36,960
we see a a picture of the bullet truck

617
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,720
it has a blue front it has blue

618
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,799
on the side um

619
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:45,200
just as a little tidbit organized gangs

620
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,000
usually smuggle

621
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,760
people in hard sided trucks while small

622
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,559
time traffickers use soft sided trucks

623
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,080
i'm not really sure why but

624
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:58,240
that's interesting to know

625
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:01,279
so following the connection between mr

626
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:02,080
billot and

627
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,120
peter billot and a lot trucking i find a

628
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,640
webcam

629
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:10,000
in rotterdam at the port

630
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:14,000
so looking at the terminal cam we watch

631
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,200
this we see our iron spire come in

632
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,600
while we're watching at the eta listed

633
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,520
on the shipping

634
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,080
um we see the truck come in we see it

635
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,279
get unloaded

636
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:28,960
onto a truck

637
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,679
we see this truck drive away and when we

638
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:33,360
zoom in we see the blue front

639
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,719
so this is a lot truck

640
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:39,600
we suspect that naomi and possibly other

641
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,760
people are on this truck

642
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,879
potentially more victims

643
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,799
and this is where the port cam was

644
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:51,360
on this map

645
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,640
so now we alert the local authorities in

646
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,919
rotterdam

647
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:57,760
they're able to rush out they stop the

648
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,400
truck they free all the victims

649
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,640
these victims had endured days inside of

650
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,480
a refrigerator truck packed on top of

651
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,480
each other they probably

652
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,320
were hungry and they didn't have

653
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,240
anywhere to go to the bathroom

654
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,279
it was probably terrible

655
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:16,960
cases are really not this easy um

656
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,159
this was a fictional scenario i

657
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:21,919
made all these connections very easy to

658
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:23,600
find

659
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,840
uh you probably would have a much harder

660
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,840
time tracking

661
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:32,399
uh these human traffickers in real life

662
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,960
and if you're good at police uniforms

663
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,799
looking at this picture you've probably

664
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:39,520
realized that this

665
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,080
policeman here and these investigators

666
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:42,799
are not

667
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:44,640
from the netherlands they're not in

668
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,320
rotterdam

669
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:50,000
this photo here sadly is not from our

670
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,440
fake scenario

671
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,880
this this case is a very real case

672
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:58,720
from essex where 39 trafficking victims

673
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,679
from china

674
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:02,640
were put on a container and sent across

675
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,720
the english channel

676
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,720
and onto this truck and none of them

677
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,840
made it so while our fictional scenario

678
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,559
they were rescued this one unfortunately

679
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:17,760
39 people were not

680
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:20,559

and um i'd like to

683
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:28,320
refocus a little and give you a place to

684
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,960
direct your anger and your emotion

685
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:35,600
um in how to help so if this has

686
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,640
uh made you mad if it

687
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,640
uh brought up emotions that you need to

688
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,080
deal with

689
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:45,440
or even if you just want to help

690
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,120
here are some things you can do so if

691
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,559
you see something say something

692
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:51,840
especially if you live in nevada if you

693
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,679
live in california if you live in

694
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:54,880
florida

695
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,799
high trafficking areas definitely keep

696
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:58,159
your eyes out

697
00:27:58,159 --> 00:27:59,679
know what trafficking looks like know

698
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:01,279
what victims look like know what

699
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:04,240
recruitment tactics look like

700
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,760
and you can always call the 24-hour

701
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,240
hotline

702
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,200
it's better to be safe than sorry

703
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,799
another thing you can do is be informed

704
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:14,159
about the goods that you buy

705
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:17,760
so you don't want to support trafficking

706
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,600
by purchasing something from the supply

707
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,159
chain

708
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:24,480
that is made by trafficked laborers

709
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,799
it's just something to be aware of you

710
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:28,640
can always volunteer

711
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,840
for anti-trafficking efforts

712
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,679
you know operation safe and safe doesn't

713
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:36,159
directly

714
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:38,960
work with human trafficking but we do i

715
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,399
mean we would support

716
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:43,039
the efforts

717
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:45,279
there are plenty of organizations at

718
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:48,080
will and if you don't want to physically

719
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,159
uh volunteer you can always throw money

720
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:51,840
at these organizations they i'm sure

721
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,440
they need it

722
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,840
um or you could send a letter meet with

723
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,200
um government

724
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,880
ask for better laws to be enacted

725
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:04,960
some countries don't have great laws to

726
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,159
help victims of human trafficking and if

727
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:10,559
you're a business you can always

728
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:13,600
provide skills or a job to

729
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,399
survivors of human trafficking um and

730
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:16,960
give them

731
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,279
something to to hope for and work

732
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:20,399
towards

733
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:24,080
and finally if you're if you're just

734
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:27,200
someone on twitter with a loud voice

735
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,559
use your platform spread awareness

736
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:34,799
volunteer that way talk about it

737
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:38,320

can be used to assist in these types of

744
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,399
cases

745
