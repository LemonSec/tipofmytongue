1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,920
voters is easier than hacking ballots

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,720
my name is maurice turner and in this

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,880
talk i will cover who i am

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,440
human-based election vulnerabilities

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,519
social media analysis

6
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:15,839
foreign adversaries and recommendations

7
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:17,199
to help prevent

8
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:19,920
voter hacking

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,600
i call myself a public interest

10
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,160
technologist currently i am the cyber

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,119
security fellow

12
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:29,359
at the alliance for securing democracy

13
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:30,960
at the german marshall fund of the

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,960
united states

15
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,480
i helped develop comprehensive

16
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,000
strategies to deter

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,399
defend against and raise the costs on

18
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,320
autocratic efforts to undermine and

19
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,440
interfere in democratic institutions

20
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,520
my focus is securing critical

21
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,360
infrastructure and deterring

22
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,800
cyber operation escalation i have also

23
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,480
held positions in the united states

24
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,559
election assistance commission

25
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:57,360
the center for democracy and technology

26
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,160
the united states

27
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,120
senate and in other public sector and

28
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,879
private sector organizations

29
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:06,159
in dc and california i hold degrees in

30
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:07,680
public administration and political

31
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,880
science

32
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,400
as well as a certificate in cyber

33
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,360
security strategy

34
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,000
i got my start in tech probably the same

35
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,759
way that some of you did

36
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,759
i broke things around my house and tried

37
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:21,680
to put them back together

38
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,000
sometimes it worked other times not so

39
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,040
much

40
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,479
in high school and through college i

41
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:28,400
built computers and worked at a small

42
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,079
medical product development firm where i

43
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:32,240
grew my skill set from basic repairs

44
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,280
to sysadmin to product design and cad it

45
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,799
was my first experience being part of a

46
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:38,240
product lifecycle and seeing how

47
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,000
decisions made by a small group

48
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,200
could literally mean the difference

49
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,799
between thousands of patients going home

50
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:43,600
weeks earlier

51
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,720
or dying that lesson has stuck with me

52
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,560
throughout my career

53
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,320
i got my start in elections at around

54
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,240
the same time

55
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,399
first i volunteered on local campaigns

56
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,960
in southern california while in college

57
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,840
in 2008 i made the shift to the other

58
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,439
side of elections to become a poll

59
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:02,880
worker

60
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,520
the new dres were being used so i knew

61
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,200
it was a good opportunity for

62
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,119
me to bring my tech know-how to help

63
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,038
other poll workers who might not be as

64
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:12,480
comfortable with the digital voting

65
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,680
machines

66
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,840
i continued that for nearly 10 years

67
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,959
even after i moved to virginia

68
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:20,640
i took a deeper dive into elections

69
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,239
after my first defcon

70
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,720
at the inaugural voting village learning

71
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,080
about election security was

72
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,200
eye-opening to say the least what keeps

73
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,879
me interested in the field is the

74
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:33,040
combination of it modernization

75
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,879
cyber security policy and administration

76
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:38,720
all working toward helping people

77
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,560
exercise their constitutional rights

78
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,519
the u s election infrastructure is

79
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,560
maturing but still has a major weakness

80
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,440
its voters malicious domestic and

81
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,400
foreign actors

82
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,200
capitalize on free seats protections and

83
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,959
inconsistent content moderation

84
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:57,840
enforcement

85
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,280
to seed and amplify disinformation and

86
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,640
misinformation on social media platforms

87
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,720
the alliance for securing democracy has

88
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,120
developed a social media analysis tool

89
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,519
to track these overt disinformation

90
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:12,159
messages

91
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,560
that are targeting democratic elections

92
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,599
in the united states

93
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,200
as well as europe

94
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,519
authoritarian regimes have long used

95
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,360
influence campaigns as a means of

96
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,959
controlling public sentiment

97
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,239
internally and externally these regimes

98
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,239
have turned to social media platforms to

99
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,959
extend their power asymmetrically

100
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,720
but it's not too late to implement

101
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,879
technical and policy measures

102
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,640
to improve resilience in the election

103
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,799
infrastructure in the united states

104
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:46,959
and in other democracies

105
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,319
u.s elections infrastructure

106
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:51,200
vulnerabilities

107
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,200
malicious actors are growing adept at

108
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,120
using social media platforms to

109
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,840
communicate directly with american

110
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,159
voters

111
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,000
they have used facebook and twitter

112
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,200
since at least the 2016 general election

113
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,360
youtube and instagram users are also

114
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,200
being targeted with visual content

115
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,879
that may be more difficult for content

116
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,799
moderation teams to identify

117
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:18,399
and track snapchat and tick talk are the

118
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,399
latest platforms gaining popularity in

119
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,680
america

120
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,000
as you'd expect the attackers will

121
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,040
follow users

122
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,199
to continue their efforts at perception

123
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,840
hacking

124
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,479
apts attributed to russia china and iran

125
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:36,240
targeted hundreds of political

126
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,160
organizations with hack and leak

127
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,600
operations in the 2020 election cycle

128
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,000
the goal was to gain access to personal

129
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,600
accounts in order to exfiltrate

130
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,639
sensitive data

131
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:47,919
that could be used in future

132
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,000
disinformation campaigns or

133
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,040
extortion attempts

134
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,080
the vast majority of americans use at

135
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,160
least one of the popular social media

136
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,759
platforms

137
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,759
most of these users are on their

138
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:02,880
preferred platform

139
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,840
daily despite saying that social media

140
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,840
is having a mostly negative effect on

141
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,520
the way that things are going in the u.s

142
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,280
today

143
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,600
what those users are looking for is new

144
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,919
content that is engaging

145
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,840
content that malicious actors are happy

146
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,960
to create or amplify

147
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,120
the concerns about just how effective

148
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,199
algorithmic suggestions are

149
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,120
at leading users toward progressively

150
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,560
more divisive content

151
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,840
are well known even the criminals know

152
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,080
how to game the algorithms

153
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,880
and for those that don't disinformation

154
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,120
as a service operators are standing by

155
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,280
to write articles make social media

156
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,160
posts

157
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,080
and even provide search engine

158
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,199
optimization

159
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,960
for disinformation campaigns

160
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,440
technical advances to generative

161
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,120
adversarial networks

162
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,199
and artificial intelligence have made

163
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,199
the creation of believable bot

164
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,319
accounts nearly trivial it's a constant

165
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,319
battle to take down these fake accounts

166
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,560
as quickly as possible

167
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,720
facebook reports that it bans billions

168
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,400
of accounts a year

169
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,400
but banning accounts is not as simple as

170
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,520
you may think

171
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,680
just ask twitter last month they

172
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,919
verified several fake accounts

173
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:17,520
that had supposedly gone through a more

174
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,039
rigorous verification process

175
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:23,039
i believe that there is a greater value

176
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:24,479
in fake accounts

177
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,520
when they are used to amplify rather

178
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,479
than create disinformation

179
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,639
it's far less risky to boost the reach

180
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,960
of a real user's social media post

181
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,960
because all the platforms value

182
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,280
authentic engagement

183
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,759
sometimes that engagement is prioritized

184
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,759
even when it violates policies

185
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,720
social media analysis

186
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,840
so to help researchers and journalists

187
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,599
reveal some of these state-backed

188
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:56,639
messages

189
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,720
the alliance for securing democracy

190
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,680
created the hamilton dashboard

191
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,759
it can be used to help shed some light

192
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,280
on these attempts

193
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,360
using disinformation to subvert

194
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,840
democratic institutions

195
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,759
to learn more about how the hamilton

196
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,680
tool was developed

197
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,360
let me introduce you to my colleague

here's brett with more on hamilton this

222
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:17,280
is the hamilton 2.0 dashboard which is

223
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:17,520
an

224
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,680
online open source tool developed by the

225
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,520
alliance for securing democracy at the

226
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,879
german marshall fund

227
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:24,639
that tracks the outputs of russian

228
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,080
chinese and iranian

229
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,840
government officials and state media

230
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,120
accounts and outlets

231
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,280
across twitter youtube state-sponsored

232
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,519
websites as well as through the official

233
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:34,159
outputs

234
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,320
at the ministry of foreign affairs in

235
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,360
the coming months we're going to be

236
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,760
adding in facebook data as well

237
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,599
so whenever user first lands on the

238
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,240
dashboard we provide a summary analysis

239
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,399
of the topics and themes that have been

240
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,399
promoted the most often by the networks

241
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,880
that we track over a given time period

242
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,480
we typically default to the last seven

243
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,640
days i've selected the last 30 but this

244
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,120
is customizable so users can select any

245
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,560
date range of interest

246
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,560
i've also selected all three countries

247
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,240
that we monitor but again

248
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,600
if your interest is in a specific

249
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,440
country you can just select on that

250
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,080
country

251
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,800
and drill a bit deeper into that network

252
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,240
so as a user scrolls through the

253
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,320
dashboard it's a great way to orientate

254
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:12,800
yourself

255
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,640
around the topics and themes that are

256
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,160
being promoted the most

257
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,920
during this specific time period that

258
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,920
has been selected we also show a

259
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,519
snapshot of the accounts

260
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,040
that have been the most influential

261
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,560
during that time period

262
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,279
as well as the individual tweets that

263
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,040
have received the most retweets and

264
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:29,839
likes

265
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:31,440
but we provide things like the countries

266
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,120
most mentioned the urls that have been

267
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,040
the most shared as well as the accounts

268
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,000
that have been the most

269
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,720
mentioned the dashboard also provides

270
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,200
for

271
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,959
a little bit deeper analysis though so

272
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:42,320
if your interest is less

273
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,560
in the topics and narratives being

274
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,360
promoted more

275
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,640
in the accounts that are the most

276
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,720
influential a user can select the

277
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,600
account page which for example will show

278
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,519
the accounts that have had the most

279
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,519
gains and followers over a specific time

280
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:56,160
period

281
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,000
we again show a little bit more detail

282
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,600
here in terms of which accounts have the

283
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,680
most follows the most retweets the most

284
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,480
likes

285
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,560
and if you scroll down you can look at

286
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,079
things like the

287
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:08,720
most retweeted accounts that are outside

288
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,480
of the network so these are the accounts

289
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:10,800
that

290
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,200
official state-backed actors are trying

291
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,560
to boost through retweets

292
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,240
you can also dig into an analysis of the

293
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,640
networks that are the retweet networks

294
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,959
that are sharing specific content

295
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,120
so i'm gonna change to a different tab

296
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,040
here only because things tend to work a

297
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,640
little bit slowly when doing a screen

298
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,440
share

299
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,000
but i looked at the last 30 days

300
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,880
selected former president trump as my

301
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,519
key phrase of interest and here it will

302
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:40,079
show me

303
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:41,920
the retweet network so these are

304
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,240
accounts that have tweeted about trump

305
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,320
and then have been retweeted by one or

306
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,760
more of the accounts that we

307
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,360
follow on the dashboard as mentioned

308
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,160
we also provide a bit of analysis of

309
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,720
youtube and state-sponsored websites as

310
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,120
well

311
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,360
so again clicking to a new tab on

312
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,720
youtube we are tracking

313
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,240
four channels that are financed by the

314
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,560
russian and chinese government so rt rt

315
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,839
america cgtn

316
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:10,640
and cgtn america and again just

317
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,079
scrolling through here you can get a

318
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:14,480
pretty quick snapshot of the content

319
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,120
that is

320
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,680
that has rece received the most views

321
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,160
likes

322
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,959
dislikes over a specific time period

323
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,560
again great way for a user to

324
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,560
familiarize themselves with the kind of

325
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,519
topics that are

326
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,480
being promoted by each network but also

327
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:28,800
we

328
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,760
give the user the ability to do a bit

329
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,839
deeper dive analysis as well

330
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:35,760
on state-sponsored websites we are

331
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,120
currently tracking about

332
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,160
35 websites most of them russian-backed

333
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,200
at this point

334
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,279
but here we'll have every article that

335
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:45,120
has been published through

336
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,720
particularly english language

337
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,240
state-sponsored websites

338
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,320
as well as a few cutouts as well so

339
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,560
these are websites that we know to have

340
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,240
connections to russian military

341
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,399
intelligence for example

342
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,160
across the dashboard if you're

343
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,680
interested in something that is not

344
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,440
appearing in one of the top charts

345
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,760
you can always run a custom search here

346
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,920
as i did by running former president

347
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,720
trump with the network analysis and the

348
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,160
dashboard will show you

349
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,279
relevant metrics we have also created a

350
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:14,160
tool that we call

351
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,160
hamilton search what it is is

352
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,440
essentially a

353
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,639
google for state-sponsored outputs so

354
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:24,160
here i ran president biden over the last

355
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,120
two years

356
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,120
and you'll show all of the tweets that

357
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,279
have mentioned biden from russia

358
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,200
we have a global control group that we

359
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,560
use as well uh

360
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,519
china and iran and a few other actors as

361
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:36,240
well

362
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,839
and then scrolling through here you can

363
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:39,360
just see the

364
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,959
most recent content but you can also

365
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:42,399
change to

366
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:43,920
well what's been retweeted the most

367
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,800
often and this is a great way to get a

368
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,440
pretty

369
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,800
quick sense of how these networks are

370
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,480
talking about a specific

371
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,880
individual or how they are discussing a

372
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:55,680
specific

373
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,959
topic so that is the quick four to five

374
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:00,880
minute overview of the hamilton

375
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,839
dashboard

376
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:04,000
as mentioned it is an open source tool

377
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,279
that we hope

378
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,519
uh ocean researchers and others will

379
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,519
utilize to get a better sense

380
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,839
of how state-backed actors are messaging

381
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:13,600
around topics of interest

382
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:21,839
uh to audiences around the globe

383
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,839
foreign adversaries

384
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,000
let's start with russia russia has a

385
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,399
long pattern of u.s election

386
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,160
interference online

387
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,880
after 2016 most in the u.s were

388
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,720
convinced by the evidence that russian

389
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,720
agents were actively trying to influence

390
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,839
public sentiment

391
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:49,199
surrounding divisive issues in 2018

392
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:51,680
u.s cybercom actively disrupted the

393
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,440
internet research agency

394
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,079
a russian troll factory to discourage

395
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:59,279
interference in the election midterms

396
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:02,079
in 2020 russia produced content using a

397
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:04,480
website called newsroom for american

398
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,199
and european-based citizens and followed

399
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:09,199
american users to new social media

400
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:10,800
platforms like gab

401
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,639
telegram and parlor russian interference

402
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,959
campaigns are mostly covert

403
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:20,320
the ira and now the website

404
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,440
r i a f a n

405
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,600
generate content under the guise of

406
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,320
multiple blogging personas

407
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,560
these articles often contain compelling

408
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,600
keywords

409
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,240
or at mention popular handles in order

410
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,279
to make them compelling to followers

411
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,279
they are also signal boosted through

412
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:40,880
linking schemes with the goal of

413
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,639
spreading the misinformation to

414
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:46,320
legitimate news organizations

415
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:48,480
russia is willing to harbor cyber

416
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,399
criminals that target critical

417
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,480
infrastructure

418
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,639
my biggest concern is the escalation

419
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:56,480
from information-based attacks

420
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,160
to attacks on the operational

421
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,399
infrastructure of elections

422
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,040
the us intelligence community said that

423
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,839
this did not happen in 2020

424
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:08,399
however the recent diplomatic and

425
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:09,920
enforcement actions by the biden

426
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:10,959
administration

427
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:13,040
in response to the spate of ransomware

428
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,959
attacks on other critical infrastructure

429
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:16,079
operators

430
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:18,720
shows that russia is openly permitting

431
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,160
or even encouraging

432
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,519
criminals to operate within its borders

433
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,519
russia is uniquely positioned to launch

434
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:27,440
a disinformation campaign

435
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,600
based on a legitimate attack on election

436
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,120
infrastructure

437
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,959
it would be trivial to leave evidence of

438
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:35,199
a data breach on a county server

439
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:37,279
and then spread claims that that same

440
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:39,120
attack occurred in counties

441
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,399
across the nation

442
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:44,959
the research shows that russia was quite

443
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:46,639
active in promoting claims of voter

444
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:47,920
fraud

445
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,920
stories about mail-in ballots and

446
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,600
president trump disputing the election

447
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,680
results were spread across social media

448
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,040
networks from official

449
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,880
and unofficial media accounts

450
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,800
we expect that russia will continue to

451
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,880
evolve its tactics in order to evade

452
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,800
content moderation efforts by social

453
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,120
media platforms

454
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,519
these tactics include setting accounts

455
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,759
within the target country

456
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:14,240
renting the accounts of authentic users

457
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,839
and recruiting domestic

458
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:18,399
activists

459
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,120
here are some examples as we would

460
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,000
expect

461
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,920
there are quite a few examples that at

462
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,720
mention real donald trump

463
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,519
for example 66 tweets between november

464
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:32,000
1st

465
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,240
2020 and january 31st 2021

466
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,399
include the word fraud and mentioned at

467
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,560
realdonaldtrump

468
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,360
however sputnik affiliates are the only

469
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,120
accounts that actually use his handle on

470
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,519
twitter

471
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:53,120
iran iran is active in

472
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,000
covert and overt campaigns against

473
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,480
critical infrastructure

474
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,480
iran is another country with a long

475
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,160
history of digital attacks

476
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,480
against the united states and a strong

477
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,079
interest in sowing distrust

478
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:09,439
in the democratic process in september

479
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:11,119
2012

480
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:13,439
iranian hackers directed a ddos attack

481
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,520
against u.s banks

482
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:19,119
in march 2018 iranian hackers crippled

483
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:20,799
atlanta's city government

484
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:24,400
with the samsam ransom attack

485
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,280
in october 2019 an iranian government

486
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,360
hacker group tried to breach microsoft

487
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,320
email accounts

488
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,520
associated with journalists current

489
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,799
and former us government officials

490
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:40,720
and a u.s presidential campaign

491
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:44,080
in june 2020 google announced that iran

492
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,240
unsuccessfully tried to breach president

493
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,240
trump's re-election campaign email

494
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,640
accounts

495
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:54,080
iran has experience with successful and

496
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:54,799
sustained

497
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:58,080
information campaigns iranian affiliates

498
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,240
have operated websites and social media

499
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,080
accounts in the open

500
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,919
these websites and accounts are used to

501
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:05,760
create and amplify pro-iranian

502
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,280
propaganda

503
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,799
the united states has been able to take

504
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:10,480
down some of these websites using legal

505
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,280
means

506
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,480
last october 92 domain names used to

507
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,840
push disinformation

508
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,960
by the revolutionary guards were seized

509
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,760
in june the department of justice also

510
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,240
sees

511
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,000
the press tv al-alam and more than 30

512
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,039
other pro-iranian domains

513
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:31,120
press tv is the islamic version of

514
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,120
russia's rt

515
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,840
a homegrown news themed media outlet

516
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,120
aimed at influencing

517

00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,480
and twitter are also popular means for

520
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,320
spreading disinformation

521
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,640
and stealing credentials by iranian

522
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,080
hackers

523
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,520
twitter removed 238

524
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,000
identified accounts as attempting to

525
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:56,799
interfere

526
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:59,280
with the 2020 election by directly

527
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,320
influencing public conversation

528
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,280
facebook removed nearly 200 iranian fake

529
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,000
accounts

530
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,320
that were targeting military personnel

531
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,919
and companies in the defense and

532
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:11,760
aerospace industries primarily in the

533
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,440
u.s

534
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,760
this persistent attack used a

535
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,000
combination of social engineering

536
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,960
phishing and malware in an attempt to

537
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:21,760
conduct

538
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,200
espionage operations one of the

539
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,799
limitations of the hamilton platform

540
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:29,039
today is language support

541
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:31,360
as some of these messages are in english

542
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,320
but most of them

543
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:37,200
are targeting non-english audiences

544
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,960
there's also the issue of what happens

545
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,400
to social media posts

546
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,919
that link to domains that have been

547
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:46,080
seized and are no longer visible

548
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,440
here are examples from iranians efforts

549
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,160
they certainly covered stolen election

550
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,760
fraud campaigns

551
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,000
but largely from an anti-trump point of

552
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,880
view

553
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,720
so most of the coverage was de

554
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,400
dismissive

555
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,400
also as per usual most of their output

556
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,520
isn't in english so it's targeting

557
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:15,200
that non-american audience

558
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,000
china china has a history

559
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,280
of industrial espionage and

560
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:25,520
anti-democratic messaging

561
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,679
the chinese government is notorious for

562
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:29,760
its theft of intellectual property

563
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,600
in order to provide an advantage to its

564
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,760
domestic business interests

565
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,960
the ccp's industrial espionage asparatus

566
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,159
is quite effective compare the new

567
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:42,880
j-31 stealth fighter on the top with the

568
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:43,520
u.s

569
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:47,039
f-35 stealth fighter plane on the bottom

570
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:48,480
president obama entered into an

571
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,039
agreement with president xi in 2015

572
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:54,880
to curtail this kind of ip theft

573
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,919
in 2017 chinese military-sponsored

574
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:00,080
hackers conducted a cyber attack

575
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,919
on one of the united states largest

576
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:03,760
credit reporting agencies

577
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:07,039
scraping the personal data of around 150

578
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:08,240
million u.s

579
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,600
and uk customers

580
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,240
china has begun to utilize wolf warriors

581
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,679
to spread its version of

582
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:18,320
information on twitter in mandarin as

583
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,159
well as in english

584
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:21,919
these high-level trolls will join

585
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:24,400
divisive conversation online

586
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,640
like black lives matter in order to

587
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,400
deflect from domestic human rights

588
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:28,880
issues

589
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,880
like pro-democracy protests in hong kong

590
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,480
it's amplifying the voices of

591
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,120
influencers who are motivated by a

592
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,320
pro-beijing

593
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,600
anti-west world view

594
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,120
china is doing something that russia

595
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,280
isn't which is engaging with

596
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,440
inauthentic accounts or at least

597
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,760
accounts that are highly suspicious

598
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,520
it's hard to know if these were created

599
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,799
by the government

600
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:55,760
or computer generated accounts either

601
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,480
way

602
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,880
beijing's diplomats have retweeted these

603
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,760
accounts

604
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,760
hundreds and hundreds of times and

605
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,200
they're included among the

606
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,640
top most retweeted accounts

607
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:10,799
china is a well-established presence on

608
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:12,720
social media platforms as a means

609
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,640
of influencing foreign policy and

610
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,159
attempting to control the chinese

611
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:17,440
diaspora

612
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,400
the strategy intensified in 2020 once

613
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,840
reports of kobit 19

614
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,760
originating from china began to gain

615
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,440
traction globally

616
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,000
chinese officials themselves started

617
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,400
promoting outright fake information

618
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,720
starting in march 2020 a foreign

619
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,640
ministry official shared conspiracy

620
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,320
theories tying the virus to a u s

621
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,360
military research

622
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:40,320
facility in maryland later that month

623
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,760
one of his colleagues shared a video

624
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,880
purporting to show

625
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,200
italian singing thank you china from

626
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,039
their balconies after receiving chinese

627
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:48,559
medical supplies

628
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:50,080
italian fact checkers term that the

629
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,640
video was at least partially doctored

630
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,799
another takedown of over 30 000 twitter

631
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:56,320
accounts in june 2020

632
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,000
also showed that the chinese state is

633
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
still resorting to inauthentic behavior

634
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,520
to amplify its propaganda

635
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,400
there's no evidence of china using

636
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,400
informational or cyber attacks against

637
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,520
the united states

638
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,280
elections what is particularly

639
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,919
concerning is that china has tremendous

640
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:16,159
cyber capability that it's not using

641
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:18,159
it's currently ranked second to the us

642
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:20,080
on the belford center's national cyber

643
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,840
power index

644
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,640
to date it appears as if u.s elections

645
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,120
don't fall into the category of being

646
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:36,320
valuable enough to hack

647
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,480
here are some examples of china's wolf

648
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,840
warrior diplomacy

649
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,399
in action

650
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,400
recommendations despite these growing

651
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,240
concerns about foreign information

652
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,080
attacks there are still some precautions

653
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,360
that election officials and state

654
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,240
leaders can take

655
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,480
to mitigate these risks continue

656
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,919
training on the basics

657
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:00,559
near the top officials have access to

658
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:01,039
free

659
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:02,880
state-of-the-art training from several

660
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,400
organizations

661
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,799
learning about strong passwords in 2fa

662
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:08,240
is the foundation for getting

663
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,480
officials and leaders onto social media

664
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,360
platforms

665
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,799
where the disinformation is being

666
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:15,200
propagated having verified accounts in

667
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,279
those

668
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:19,120
is platforms opportunity to counter

669
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,960
divisive narratives and report

670
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,520
fake accounts it's not enough for

671
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,679
elections to be administered smoothly

672
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:27,520
officials need to be able to communicate

673
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,960
the integrity of the election to the

674
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,000
public

675
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,919
communication and incident response

676
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:34,640
training can help

677
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,880
both resources emphasize the importance

678
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,960
of having a communication plan that

679
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,039
provides timely updates to reduce the

680
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:41,520
space

681
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,640
for disinformation to spread

682
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,400
the social media platforms themselves

683
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,760
play an obvious role in the spread of

684
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,120
misinformation

685
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,799
the evolution and enforcement of their

686
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:52,640
content moderation policies are what

687
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,400
lead to message deletions and account

688
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,279
bans

689
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:56,880
but platforms are still struggling to

690
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,039
apply these policies in a consistent and

691
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,720
equitable manner

692
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,039
having verified accounts for officials

693
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:05,120
helps to establish their

694
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,960
trustworthiness as an authoritative

695
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,120
source this is the first step in

696
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,080
prebunking

697
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,640
misinformation and reducing the chance

698
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,240
that is amplified

699
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,400
preventing amplification of false

700
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,240
information got a boost from government

701
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,640
agencies this election cycle

702
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,600
cisa's rumor control website headlined

703
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,559
in november

704
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:26,640
as a source of reliable election

705
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,960
information to counter the common rumors

706
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,120
about ballot handling and vote tallying

707
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,520
that were circulating in the media

708
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,919
on the other hand another debate that

709
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:37,200
inexplicably

710
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,120
continues is the claim that ballots in

711
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,120
arizona were tampered with

712
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,120
in response the maricopa county election

713
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,159
department launched

714
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:47,679
the justthefacts.vote website and

715
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:50,240
real auditors don't hashtag campaign to

716
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,360
specifically bust

717
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,360
myths propagated during the fake audit

718
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,279
process

719
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:57,520
as new and upcoming networks like

720
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,279
snapchat and tick tock or

721
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:02,640
parlor and getter grow in popularity

722
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,760
they only go through the same

723
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,000
deliberation process of how to

724
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,320
manage divisive election content or

725
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,200
whether to

726
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,120
allow users to engage in political

727
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,640
speech altogether

728
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,559
it will be important to include election

729
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:16,240
officials in these conversations to make

730
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,320
sure they understand how quickly

731
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,919
and effectively voters can get engaged

732
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:24,799
and connected with authorities that have

733
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:28,799
the source of information on elections

734
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,039
the one area of responsibility for

735
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:33,919
security

736
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:35,520
that lies squarely with the federal

737
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,520
government is in deterring attacks by

738
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,440
foreign malicious actors

739
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,520
more coalition-based responses are

740
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,360
needed against regimes that harbor

741
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:47,279
criminals or themselves conducting

742
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:49,679
operational or information attacks on

743
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:51,360
critical infrastructure

744
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,279
that includes gathering more support for

745
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:54,400
the paris call on

746
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,039
global cyber norms and further

747
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:58,320
developing

748
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:01,120
the offensive and defensive escalation

749
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,320
pathways

750
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,760
when there is an attack in the cyber

751
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,880
domain it's up to united states and its

752
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,279
nato allies to leverage foreign policy

753
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:10,880
and military options

754
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,279
that can buy time for network defenders

755
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:14,559
and the american people

756
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:15,919
to build resilience against these

757
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:18,320
attacks

758
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,720
asd will continue to develop the

759
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,080
hamilton dashboard

760
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,320
an authoritarian interference tracker to

761
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,480
help uncover

762
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,559
subversion attempts of democracies

763
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:30,000
around the world

764
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,919
the current dashboard has specific

765
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:33,360
technical limitations that need to be

766
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,559
overcome

767
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:36,559
the biggest is that it is text only and

768
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:38,240
restricted to languages that our human

769
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,399
coders and automated transition

770
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:43,360
services can understand that is

771
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,360
sufficient for text-based platforms but

772
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,000
obviously

773
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,919
a much larger problem for visual first

774
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:49,840
platforms

775
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,880
video content on youtube is analyzed

776
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,159
by services including vitterover

777
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:59,120
and microsoft

778
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,360
at the end of the day it is still a

779
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,120
manual process

780
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,960
that has the potential for human error

781
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,120
and variability is greater

782
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,799
than would be acceptable in an academic

783
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:10,159
study so we

784
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:12,320
urge caution when using or citing

785
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:17,120
categorical data i'd like to

786
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,640
thank you all for joining me today on

787
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,159
this talk

788
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:22,159
and to especially call out the defcon

789
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:23,200
voting village

790
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,520
the alliance for securing democracy

791
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,799
election officials

792
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:29,440
voting advocates security researchers

793
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,440
and most importantly voters

794
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,720
thank you
