1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:02,320
thank you sean i appreciate the

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:03,120
introduction

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,600
and welcome everybody i i haven't talked

4
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,759
at def con in a couple years

5
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:09,760
and you know this is uh actually it's

6
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,120
been a couple months since i've talked

7
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:11,440
for

8
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,000
uh the ics village i'm always

9
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,599
appreciative that they

10
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,600
keep inviting me back to talk about some

11
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,520
of the things that i've been working on

12
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,439
and you know providing me with these

13
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:23,039
opportunities so i give back every

14
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:24,000
chance that i get

15
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,439
uh if you're is this is your first ics

16
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:28,320
village

17
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,240
please start to get involved reach out

18
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,479
to them for some of your research

19
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,640
with some of the information volunteer

20
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,000
to talk as well

21
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,920
we want to hear from all of you and i

22
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,040
really appreciate it

23
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,640
uh what i'm here to talk to you about

24
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,960
today is the scripts and tools to help

25
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,800
your ics infosec

26
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,360
journey and this is just going to be

27
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,360
kind of a brief introduction

28
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,440
to how to do some of the things or at

29
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,280
least how i approach

30
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,800
automating some of my tasks

31
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,160
and come up with some of the scripts

32
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,079
that i use to

33
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,000
pull information from devices whether

34
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,120
it's for

35
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,840
security research as i'll keep pointing

36
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:06,880
over here but

37
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,280
um you know ics village provided me the

38
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,880
schneider electric

39
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,400
modicon m221

40
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,799
program logic controller or plc to do

41
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,320
some of my research on

42
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,240
uh and so when i point down like that

43
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,240
that's what i'm talking about

44
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,880
but whenever i'm doing security research

45
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,799
or i'm going on site to do a security

46
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,159
assessment for somebody

47
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,400
i try to automate things as much as

48
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,000
possible and a lot of times i find out

49
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,799
that i'm doing it

50
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:35,680
on the fly and so when tom asked me to

51
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,119
give a talk

52
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:38,799
i couldn't think of any research that i

53
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,040
was doing but i thought about this

54
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:41,840
helping people

55
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,240
understand how i approach some of my

56
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,520
tool development

57
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,840
and automating some of my processes so

58
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,360
that's what we're going to talk about

59
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,720
who am i i'm don c weber also

60
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,439
known as cutaway i've been doing

61
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:56,719
information

62
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:59,119
security since 2002 when i got out of

63
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,200
the marine corps and went back to school

64
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,320
i have been fortunate enough to work on

65
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:04,960
a lot of

66
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,000
great teams i have a broad background

67
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,639
in information security forensic

68
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:11,920
incident response

69
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,520
penetration testing security research

70
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,200
and right now i'm doing helping

71
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,720
organizations within the industrial

72
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,680
control

73
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,720
arena to evaluate their programs to

74
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,879
understand doing security assessments

75
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,160
with their within their control

76
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,480
environment uh reviewing their

77
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,200
information

78
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,519
security programs to protect those

79
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,120
environments as well

80
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,080
some of the things that we're going to

81
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,400
be talking about and actually building

82
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,519
towards

83
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:39,920
are some of the tools that i used during

84
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,680
my assessments and you can see those out

85
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,760
at the cutaway security github

86
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,000
you can see that listed here i'll

87
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,360
highlight it

88
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,200
more specifically we'll at least look at

89
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,680
one script from the cut sect tools

90
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,959
some of the things that i've developed

91
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:55,280
to gather information and that's my goal

92
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,519
is to help you if you're if you're just

93
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:58,400
starting out

94
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,319
understanding the thought process for

95
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:01,920
coming up with something that you can

96
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,519
automate if you want to do some

97
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,000
asset discovery that's one of the tools

98
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,360
that we'll look at if you're

99
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,200
working in this arena and need to gather

100
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,159
information about your assets you know

101
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,480
understanding the firmware of your

102
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,680
devices

103
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,440
what version they're running you can

104
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,120
automate some of that information

105
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,959
gathering and store that off

106
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,519
and make that process repeatable so

107
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:26,400
that's what we're going to do we're

108
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:26,799
going

109
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:29,120
to talk about some of the concepts

110
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,200
around information gathering and

111
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,640
developing a script out of it we'll

112
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,640
develop a script real quick

113
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,879
uh we'll talk about some device

114
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:37,920
interactions

115
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,920
uh not sure what depends on how fast

116
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,040
we'll go we'll talk about

117
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,120
uh network analysis and then we'll look

118
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,239
at one of the scripts

119
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:46,959
from the cut set tools all right i'm

120
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,560
going to go pretty fast because i'm

121
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,319
covering only have 25 minutes and we've

122
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:52,080
got a lot of things to cover

123
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,439
so the first thing i want to do is i

124
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,120
want to open up a terminal i've got

125
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,120
i'm using kali as you can see here it's

126
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,400
a little bit older version but

127
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,120
it will do for what uh um for what we're

128
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,400
working on here

129
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,480
when i get on to a network whether it's

130
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,680
you know talking to

131
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,280
going to converse with a specific

132
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,120
devices management interface

133
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,720
or it's a device out in my clients

134
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,040
environment if i'm on the network i need

135
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:15,920
to understand

136
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,120
how my network devices are configured so

137
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,240
i'm going to run the ip adder as we can

138
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,160
see i actually want to take off

139
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,520
i want to remove that ip address

140
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,639
so let's go ahead and i believe it's

141
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,120
delete

142
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,639
yeah so i'm going to start

143
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,639
i'm going to start my ip address or my

144
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,440
um my analysis without having an ip

145
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,040
address on my interface

146
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,199
okay i've got two interfaces here this

147
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:46,639
is a virtual machine so i've got my

148
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:47,600
ethernet

149
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,360
0 which is bridged with my host

150
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,040
operating system

151
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,720
that would be connected possibly to the

152
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,080
internet and so i don't want to connect

153
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,040
my clients

154
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,919
uh networks to that so i usually go with

155
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:58,560
a

156
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,240
usb interface as well and that's what

157
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,919
the eth1 is i've got a usb

158
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,560
interface that's attached to this it's

159
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,800
not going to my regular operating system

160
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,440
i can't bridge it to another network it

161
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,120
can only operate on this network

162
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,759
so that's where i start then whenever i

163
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:14,160
plug

164
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,800
into a device like the the plc that i

165
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,520
have here

166
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,800
i have to understand what the

167
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,680
management interface is looking for i

168
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,000
need to understand what subnet it's on

169
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,520
now i can go through the vendor

170
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,280
documentation and that

171
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,120
is one way to discover it another way is

172
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,199
is to actually query the information

173
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:36,160
because

174
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,320
our operators and our engineers they can

175
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,680
change the configuration

176
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,280
of those devices those management

177
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,039
interfaces so they might have done

178
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,600
something to keep it from us and that's

179
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,120
what we're going to see here

180
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,440
so one of the things that i start with

181
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,199
is when i connect to a device or to a

182
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:52,720
subnet i just start

183
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,800
actually the first thing i do let's call

184
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,160
that up real quick

185
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,680
the first thing i do is i start a

186
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,160
wireshark okay and i just start sniffing

187
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,360
on the network

188
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,600
okay and i'm connected directly to a

189
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,600
device so this isn't broadcasting

190
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,000
anything

191
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,840
i might start and stop it see if that

192
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,240
changes if i was on a regular network we

193
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:10,800
would see

194
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,120
things like address resolution protocol

195
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,319
arp requests

196
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,560
we're going to see a broadcast you know

197
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,560
if it's ethernet if it's some type of

198
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,600
industrial

199
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,919
control protocol like bacnet we're going

200
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:23,199
to see multiple

201
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:26,000
devices communicating over broadcast

202
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,120
messages

203
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,800
for that protocol so

204
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,479
i would listen to that to see if i can

205
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,000
glean information understand

206
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,919
the ip addresses and the types of

207
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:37,600
devices that are out there

208
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,360
in this case we don't have that so we

209
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,080
have to do that our discovery ourselves

210
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,560
let's go ahead and close that in this

211
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,080
case what i want to do is i want to use

212
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:46,960
arcscan

213
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,800
need to run it as administrator i'm

214
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,560
going to run the arp scan tool

215
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,080
i need to tell it which interface i

216
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,880
wanted to go out which is our ethernet 1

217
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,599
and then i want to tell it which subnet

218
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:59,599
to look for so i want to identify all of

219
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:00,800
the devices

220
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,599
the endpoints i need to ask them for

221
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:04,800
their hardware interface

222
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,080
for this subnet okay and when i run this

223
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:08,800
command

224
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,280
we can see that it's a you know it's

225
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,560
starts putting out a warning because i

226
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,240
don't have an ip address

227
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,759
on my own interface uh it

228
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,840
tells me what my interface information

229
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,039
about my interface is

230
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:23,599
but it also says that there are no there

231
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:25,039
were no responses

232
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:28,400
to the art requests so in other words uh

233
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,199
this tool sent a bunch of arp requests

234
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,440
for that subnet but nothing returned

235
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,560
well that's because the device has been

236
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,000
configured with a different subnet

237
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,440
when i run it with the 192.168.0 subnet

238
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,919
we can see that something responds in

239
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,080
this case this is the plc

240
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:52,160
it's been assigned the 0.21

241
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,759
ip address the hardware address

242
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:58,960
for its interface is this this right

243
00:07:58,960 --> 00:07:59,599
here

244
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:02,160
and then we can see the manufacturer for

245
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,680
that interface as well

246
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,639
okay this is how i start my assessments

247
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,000
now

248
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,360
as i mentioned the process engineers

249
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,639
they didn't have to

250
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:15,280
keep the um default you know so this

251
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,479
looks like a default

252
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,400
address you know but they could have

253
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,840
changed that it this very

254
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,960
easily could be in 192.168.50

255
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,000
or 100 and doing

256
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,120
this by hand is really slow

257
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,400
in other words i wouldn't have been able

258
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,360
to find that myself and so i could click

259
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:33,919
up and

260
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:37,360
you know i could uh um tab up and and

261
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,640
keep doing this myself

262
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,200
but i want to automate this process and

263
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,200
the way we do that is i mean first

264
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,760
first we need to start by getting rid of

265
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,600
some of that extra information

266
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,120
in other words we had that warning

267
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,959
message

268
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:53,200
we also had the information about our

269
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,320
interface

270
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,080
we don't need all of that information

271
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,399
okay i've got all that documented now

272
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,160
so what i want to do is i want to

273
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,000
leverage my uh

274
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,880
terminal and some of the things that it

275
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,000
is capable of

276
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,760
i want to redirect the warnings and so

277
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,600
the file handle 2 i can redirect that

278
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,839
into devnow which is like the trashcan

279
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:14,080
i can also search for the lines that

280
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,000
have the information that i expect

281
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
so i should have the information about

282
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,200
the subnet

283
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,399
and if i create change that to zero and

284
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:23,440
hit enter

285
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,760
now this is gonna run notice i didn't

286
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,279
get any warnings or any other

287
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:28,080
information i have

288
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,279
nice clean output if there is

289
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,839
no information coming back so like the

290
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:36,160
one

291
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,680
there's absolutely nothing coming back

292
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,680
so i know have a nice clean

293
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,640
output now remember i want to automate

294
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,040
this

295
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,120
if i don't know the actual subnet if i

296
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,120
wasn't lucky with the first two

297
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,120
uh then i want to come up with a way to

298
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,360
enumerate through all of the subnets and

299
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,959
we do that by

300
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,839
looping through things and so this is

301
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:57,440
just a command right here

302
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,720
uh leveraging a for loop okay

303
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,120
for i and i is going to be our uh um

304
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,320
a a variable that we um that

305
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,920
we keep information in and we're going

306
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,920
to keep a list of numbers

307
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,959
for zero through five okay and then

308
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:16,160
we're going to

309
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:20,800
leverage the dollar sign i and our shell

310
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,839
in this case it's the zsh our shell is

311
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:25,920
going to replace every dollar sign i

312
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,240
with a number and this is just the

313
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,480
syntax for enumerating

314
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,720
through so zero one two three four five

315
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,240
i could go up to two

316
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,519
uh um 254 because that would be the max

317
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:38,480
number of subnets

318
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,600
and that's what i want to do but we're

319
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,000
only going to do five here for

320
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,480
speed okay and then you can see we have

321
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,959
our arp scan here and this is our arc

322
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:48,560
command that we just

323
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,959
um we just talked about i include the

324
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:51,839
echo here

325
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:54,560
uh the echo with the um so this is we

326
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,800
understand we need a way to understand

327
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,399
that our command is still running

328
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,240
okay because a lot of times if we don't

329
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,399
have output some of our output might not

330
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:03,040
happen

331
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,399
and if we don't have something to

332
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,880
display then we might think that it's

333
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:07,760
frozen

334
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,760
frozen when sometimes it just takes a

335
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,279
lot of time to get a response

336
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,880
and as you can see here i have nice

337
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,800
clean output i can

338
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,920
redirect that into a file and i've got

339
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,160
so i've collected some good information

340
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,680
about this environment

341
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,320
i've created a repeatable process i can

342
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,760
copy and paste this

343
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,320
the command and i can keep this like in

344
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,720
a you know a text document like this

345
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,720
and that way i i always ensure that i

346
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,480
run this command the same way

347
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,760
every time okay and that's great

348
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,519
but i still want to automate it a little

349
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,680
bit further i want to actually come up

350
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,000
with

351
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,399
some type of script and so that's what

352
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,000
we have here so i've

353
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,200
actually got a list so if i look in the

354
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,680
i've already put everything in the arp

355
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,560
scan

356
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,480
so if i cut this out we'll see

357
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,480
that i've just created a script with the

358
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,399
line that the command line that we just

359
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:01,040
had

360
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,680
uh we have to um it's best if we tell it

361
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,959
which shell to go in

362
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:07,200
uh our for loop here so iterate through

363
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,120
zero from zero to five

364
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,639
uh our echo this time we want to tell it

365
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:14,000
specifically where

366
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,200
our um our program is we don't want to

367
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,240
just put our scan

368
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,519
or the arp scan in our script because

369
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:22,880
now our script is going to check our

370
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:23,440
path

371
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,200
if we have issues with our path it's

372
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,480
going to break our script and so we

373
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,440
don't want to do that

374
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,360
so really all i did was when i was

375
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,760
writing this i just did a which

376
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,200
arp scan which tells me which

377
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,959
program where the program is actually

378
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:38,639
located and i just put that in there

379
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,720
now if we run this command we have to

380
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,480
make it executable but if we run this

381
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,320
command

382
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,560
now we can see that output and that's

383
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,970
not what i expected

384
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:51,070
[Music]

385
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,638
what did i mess up here

386
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:07,839
that should have run correctly oops

387
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,639
oh

388
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,279
i didn't include pseudo in there and we

389
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:15,200
definitely don't want to include sudo in

390
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,639
there we want to run

391
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,399
sudo you know and that's a that you know

392
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,600
failure is a uh um

393
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,240
a great tool and i you know whenever i'm

394
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:26,959
on site

395
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:29,040
uh whenever i'm doing research uh there

396
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,320
are a lot of times when i do this i

397
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,680
don't get the results back that i

398
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,320
expected

399
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,760
well there could be a reason either i

400
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,519
made a mistake in my script

401
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:38,079
made a mistake in my command line or i

402
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:39,920
forgot to run it as administrator and we

403
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,040
can see that here

404
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,040
i ran the script everything went right

405
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,160
went fine

406
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,199
but the error message because i had sent

407
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:49,199
the error message to deb null

408
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:51,920
i didn't see that result okay so running

409
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:52,800
with uh

410
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,399
sudo we can see that now we have output

411
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:59,519
that we expect to find and that's great

412
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,600
this is exactly what we want

413
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:06,000
now we have a repeatable process

414
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,040
okay from there

415
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,600
i can just save that out actually

416
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,519
actually after this i should go and

417
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,160
store that

418
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,800
in the cut tech tool so hopefully this

419
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,600
uh um

420
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,880
i'll remember to do that after we're

421
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,279
done here from there that's when i want

422
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:21,680
to

423
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,920
assign myself or my interface

424
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,920
an address on this network remember we

425
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,160
don't have an address on this network

426
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,160
let's go ahead and go back i'm just

427
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,320
going to scroll up so i write

428
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,360
run the command correctly

429
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,040
so let's add an ip address

430
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,920
to our interface so sudo ipader we want

431
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:44,880
to be on the

432
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,880
zero subnet so let's give ourselves a

433
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,439
dot two

434
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:51,920
and when we run the ip adder again we

435
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,560
can see now we have an address on there

436
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,519
and from there we can start looking at

437
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:58,959
that device

438
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:01,199
okay and in this case i want to

439
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:02,959
understand the services that are running

440
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:03,760
on there for

441
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,959
plc i would expect that they have

442
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:08,800
management interfaces potentially

443
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,000
on potentially a web server usually an

444
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,560
ftp server but there's always some type

445
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,079
of service running on there

446
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:17,920
and so what i'm going to do is i'm going

447
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,199
to do an map we have to be

448
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,760
careful with these devices because

449
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,199
they're not like our windows operating

450
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:25,360
systems our linux operating systems

451
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,959
they don't handle unusual connections

452
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:30,959
well and nmap does make unusual

453
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,800
connections to see how the endpoint

454
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,759
responds

455
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:36,880
so we're going to format our

456
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,040
nmap command to make it safe for the

457
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,000
device and we can see

458
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,959
i do want to run it as an administrator

459
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:45,519
and said well that will help with the um

460
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:48,880
the output uh we want to don't ping the

461
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,160
device so don't worry about if it

462
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,920
doesn't respond to pings

463
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,160
don't resolve so the dash n is don't

464
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,360
resolve

465
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,399
both the port numbers and the endpoints

466
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:01,600
the st will be a full tcp

467
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,120
tcp handshake and it will establish the

468
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,720
connection and tear it down

469
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,880
some devices if you just do a sin scan

470
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,000
they will hang

471
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
and nothing else can connect to that

472
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,759
until it actually gets a

473
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,800
tear down packet for that connection and

474
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,600
that could be

475
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,040
have a negative

476
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,959
impact on the functionality of that

477
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:24,399
device

478
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,240
then we're going to look for a specific

479
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,519
we're not going to look for all

480
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,680
top 1000 ports we're only going to look

481
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,040
for something that

482
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,680
for ports that are associated with some

483
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,600
of the management interfaces we expect

484
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,600
we want to start this and we might scale

485
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:37,920
up

486
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,839
but let's start small so let's go ahead

487
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:41,360
and do a scan of this

488
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,560
right now and as you can see

489
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,759
it ran we didn't need to throttle this

490
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:49,600
it went through and it searched all of

491
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,920
those ports and now we can see that it

492
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,440
only has

493
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,759
one service that's running okay and this

494
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:57,920
is actually i like this it doesn't have

495
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,759
an ftp server on it to

496
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:03,920
serve up the configuration files but the

497
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,760
only real way to communicate with these

498
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,199
types of devices

499
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,919
you actually have to use a modbus and

500
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:12,240
its proprietary modbus that's associated

501
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,520
with modicon

502
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,319
and that is what allows the

503
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,039
communication

504
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:19,439
configuration of the remote com

505
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,199
configuration and management of these

506
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:22,079
devices

507
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,079
so it actually would have to click over

508
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,520
to my windows system

509
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:29,200
and run that schneider electric software

510
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,000
to interact with this but certainly now

511
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:32,960
we could start

512
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,520
interacting uh with the modbus on this

513
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,240
device

514
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,000
i'm not going to get into that you guys

515
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,600
can go out and find some of that learn

516
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,600
how to interact with modbus

517
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,520
actually i've got some videos that are

518
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,200
out there on the sans

519
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,400
ics concepts uh youtube playlist so if

520
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,760
you go out to that you can just search

521
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,559
for

522
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:53,679
sans ics concepts uh you should should

523
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:55,360
come up with some of the videos there's

524
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,720
three videos on

525
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,760
modbus enumeration uh analysis and man

526
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,480
in the

527
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,480
machine in the middle attacks so you can

528
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,240
go out there and check that out

529
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,520
uh what we want to do is uh

530
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,080
you know so now i've we want to talk

531
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:10,720
about

532
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,799
um a more

533
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:18,160
scripting and information gathering um

534
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,160
i wanted to and i didn't realize how

535
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,320
long i would have i wanted to talk a lot

536
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,120
more about

537
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,440
uh some of the things that i do

538
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,799
associated with

539
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:28,720
uh information discovery with wireshark

540
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,000
you know let's go through that real

541
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,240
quick let me see if i can open this up

542
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,760
i've gone out to the um control things

543
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,880
website uh and

544
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,240
you can go out there and there's a

545
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,559
repository in the ct samples

546
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,280
and you can download some pcaps of

547
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,720
different protocols and that's what i've

548
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,280
done

549
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,360
i've done i've gone and downloaded the

550
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,210
combined

551
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:53,840
[Music]

552
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,440
i've looked in the combined folder and

553
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,120
i've downloaded the plant one

554
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,600
pcapp and as you can see here this is

555
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,799
just a

556
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:02,799
pcap with a lot of different industrial

557
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:05,039
controls and what i can do here is i can

558
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:06,799
search on for things like

559
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:10,240
modbus traffic

560
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,080
okay and this will display this filter

561
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,320
this display filter will filter out

562
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,799
all of the different things that you can

563
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:17,840
find

564
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,520
within this that are associated with the

565
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,120
modbus protocol

566
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,400
all right and how i script this is

567
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,640
i'll start my analysis here and then

568
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,799
i'll start doing things like

569
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:32,400
uh searching on destination so i will

570
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,960
destination port so i'll click right

571
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,720
click on destination port and i'll say

572
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,360
prepare as a filter and select it and

573
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,400
then i'll just

574
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,520
search for everything that is

575
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:45,200
destination port 502

576
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:47,760
and we can see that this finds all of

577
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,160
the queries so this is just the queries

578
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,160
the client which is requesting

579
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,240
information from a device

580
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,799
that i know that this is a good filter

581
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:59,120
and then i can go in and i can take this

582
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,200
filter

583
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,280
and i can automate some t-sharp commands

584
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,480
and i can go back to

585
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,960
i can go and locate the actual pcap

586
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,640
and run a command line

587
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:35,840
oops let me copy it over one time

588
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,720
i can run t shark which will go out and

589
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,360
now i can

590
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,000
set up a filter that will search on

591
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,440
modbus

592
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,480
search just on the destination port 502

593
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,840
so just the requests like we saw in

594
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,640
in wireshark and then i can tell it hey

595
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,520
only split out the two fields i want the

596
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,000
ip

597
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,720
source and the ip destination okay and

598
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,120
then

599
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,919
sort that information and sort it so

600
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:08,640
that

601
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,720
you remove all of the extra occurrences

602
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,360
and you only provide me with unique

603
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,200
results so that's the sort you

604
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,760
and as we can see here we've got a

605
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,720
modbus client which is a single server

606
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,080
querying a whole bunch of different

607
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,559
devices and so this is how

608
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:28,799
and what i do is i take this command and

609
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:30,880
i copy it out and i maintain this so

610
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,400
that i can repeat this

611
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,000
command i don't have to look this up

612
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,600
every single time

613
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,440
and while modbus might be relatively

614
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,280
easily some of the other industrial

615
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,039
protocols get a little bit more complex

616
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:43,200
for the information gathering like this

617
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,039
and so this is just a valuable way to do

618
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:46,559
that i'll take

619
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,320
all of this information and i'll take

620
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,679
all of these techniques

621
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:53,120
and i'll start to

622
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:56,240
excuse me what i'll do is

623
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,360
i will create scripts so let's go ahead

624
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,799
and i'm going to look in the cutaway

625
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:02,880
security tools ics

626
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:08,000
i've created some discover asset scripts

627
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:11,520
and if we look at this let me make this

628
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,240
a little bit bigger

629
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,159
we can see that i'm i've made a i've

630
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:20,159
taken python and i've created a python

631
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:20,799
script

632
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:24,840
that pool that leverages a python

633
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,360
modbus module

634
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,640
and uh i've configured it so that will

635
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,159
iterate over any subnet that i provided

636
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:35,360
and that's what we have here so we've

637
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:35,679
got

638
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:38,559
a range which is a list of subnets okay

639
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:38,880
um

640
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,280
i've got some specific devices that i've

641
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,799
gone out and pulled

642
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:45,919
research from the internet and looked up

643
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:47,280
their modbus map

644
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,880
actually that's what i was showing you

645
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,400
up here okay

646
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,280
so i went out uh so i went out this is

647
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,000
an example of

648
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
a ge device a d60 line distance relay

649
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,400
i've went out and gathered the

650
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,520
instruction manual

651
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,600
i'll search the instruction manual for

652
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,720
the modbus

653
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,960
map and the modbus map for these devices

654
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,360
if you interact with these this ge

655
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,000
device

656
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,520
you can pull things like the serial

657
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,360
number the manufacturer

658
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,520
the modification number ethernet mac

659
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,760
address all of this information is

660
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:23,200
stored in uh specific locations

661
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,240
within the modbus memory and then you

662
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,120
can go and take that information

663
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,360
and generate a script and as you can see

664
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,400
i've

665
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,880
gone through and looked at the memory

666
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,679
mappings of

667
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:38,159
several of these ge devices and i've

668
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:40,000
come up with ways to query

669
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,799
get the ge firmware and we'll go out and

670
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:44,640
retrieve that information

671
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,960
and bring it back to me and print all of

672
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,240
this information

673
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:52,880
out and um i can redirect it into a file

674
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,960
and this is one of the ways that i

675
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,080
assist some of my

676
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:59,360
uh clients with doing asset discovery

677
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,640
within their environment

678
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,919
i did all of this by doing this research

679
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:06,000
by interacting with the devices

680
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,960
on the command line first figuring out

681
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,840
the important

682
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:13,120
information uh to grab uh doing

683
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,320
additional research

684
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,960
and then finding ways to script this up

685
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,559
so that it's a repeatable process

686
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,120
all right and that's all i wanted to

687
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,880
show you once again i appreciate

688
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,559
everybody coming out

689
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:29,360
