1
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:15,679
thanks

2
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:18,160
uh so i'm ben i'm pretty excited to be

3
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:18,720
here

4
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,439
talking today about truck hacking i'm

5
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:23,439
going to introduce you to commercial

6
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:25,760
transportation show you why it matters

7
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,760
we're going to be talking about trucking

8
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,760
in particular so trucks and trailers and

9
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,000
distribution centers etc

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,960
then we're going to get into the

11
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,120
technical details of the three main

12
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,480
vehicle networks that are found on

13
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,920
trucks today

14
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,280
in the second half of the talk i'm going

15
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,800
to do a review of some of the public

16
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:41,440
attacks

17
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,760
on trucks and i'll highlight areas where

18
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,360
you could use some more hacking

19
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,640
so there's definitely room for your own

20
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,160
research and i'll give you some ways to

21
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,600
get involved

22
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,280
then we'll wrap up the session by

23
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,120
looking at some concrete examples

24
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,039
of using tools to interact with the

25
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:57,280
vehicle networks and i'll also give you

26
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,079
a whole

27
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:59,600
list of tools that you can go and get

28
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,320
and play with yourself

29
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,600
just a very little bit about me i'm a

30
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,200
cyber security research engineer

31
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,040
contractor at the nmf da

32
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,320
i have some previous experience in

33
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,920
embedded systems design and reverse

34
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:12,479
engineering

35
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,799
i'm also proud to be a cyber truck

36
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:16,320
challenge instructor

37
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,320
and a volunteer at the uh defcon

38
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,840
hardware hacking villages

39
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,200
and karachi villages

40
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,200
so commercial transportation what is it

41
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,759
a very broad topic

42
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:30,079
all possible transportation of goods or

43
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:31,119
people for a business

44
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:33,840
purpose just about anything it makes up

45
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,799
you know trailers

46
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,640
trains and ships which you can see

47
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,920
pictured here

48
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,759
also card retainers which is called

49
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:41,439
intermodal is a big part and we'll talk

50
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:43,200
about that

51
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,799
why does commercial transportation

52
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,320
security matter

53
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,920
uh look around the room you're in right

54
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,439
now

55
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,680
if you bought it it came on a truck uh

56
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,799
truck problems are

57
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,920
big problems for society and

58
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,680
if you need to be convinced i encourage

59
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,360
you to take a look at a week without

60
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,240
truck transport

61
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,520
at iru.org it's amazing just how deep

62
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,079
the supply chain of trucking goes there

63
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:07,360
are some communities that even need to

64
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,000
get their drinking

65
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,120
water from trucks and then

66
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,120
probably most obviously trucks are the

67
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,360
big lumbering giants on the road

68
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,680
and safety issues with trucks are all of

69
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,160
our issues

70
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,280
if you think about all the modes of

71
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,319
transportation and not

72
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,800
just trucking it matters because we're

73
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,040
all linked by that global supply chain

74
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,120
but also because all the technologies

75
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,280
are shared among the different modes

76
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,000
so a vector of an attack in one mode can

77
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,160
actually be an attack across the board

78
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,480
uh for example the can bus hack research

79
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,360
that demonstrates

80
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,160
engine's disablement via d-rate abuse is

81
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,760
actually applicable across all the modes

82
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,760
because diesel is found in all the modes

83
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,720
and we're going to talk about that a

84
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,840
little more later

85
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,239
so trucks pictured here in this

86
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:55,760
spaghetti diagram they have a lot of

87
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,480
features

88
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,920
a lot of connectivity and they have a

89
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,760
lot of variations

90
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,360
trucks are actually leave the factory

91
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,120
today sometimes with three different

92
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,000
cellular modems

93
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,800
installed the particular components and

94
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,840
specs of a truck

95
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,840
are built to order by the fleets which

96
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,319
accounts for all the variation

97
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,000
these trucks actually use multiple

98
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,760
different vehicle networks and sometimes

99
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,440
multiple segments of the same network to

100
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,080
accomplish

101
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,800
all the features that are necessary this

102
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,159
diagram you can see is

103
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,239
showing three different types of

104
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:25,840
networks three connectors

105
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,760
a whole bunch of different components

106
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,200
one of the things we're not picturing

107
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,040
this diagram is components that bridge

108
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,879
multiple segments other than that

109
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:33,599
gateway

110
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,280
because doing so would make it a bit

111
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,959
more of a spaghetti mess

112
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,720
but those types of components the bridge

113
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,879
segments are also present

114
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:43,120
and take note of the connectors here the

115
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,640
j560 connector

116
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,560
is the uh is what's used to make the

117
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,560
umbilical connection between the tractor

118
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,599
and the trailer that obd connector is

119
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:52,879
the uh regulated

120
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:55,439
onboard diagnostics connector found in

121
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:56,159
all trucks

122
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,159
and then the rp 1226 is a newer

123
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:01,439
connector but was put there because

124
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:03,040
permanently connecting devices such as

125
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,959
telematics or other aftermarket

126
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:06,480
is not recommended for the obd connector

127
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,159
so the oems place that there to give

128
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:09,840
fleets a place to put their permanently

129
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,200
or semi-permanently start

130
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,599
installed equipment and of course it

131
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:14,879
goes without saying

132
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,798
these trucks they exist as money makers

133
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,320
if they're not rolling

134
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,358
then the fleet is losing money so what

135
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:22,800
about trailers the other things that

136
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,440
roll

137
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,199
they actually outnumber tractors in

138
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,040
north america they have plenty of

139
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,080
features

140
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,400
what you see pictured here is a summary

141
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,840
of the features you'll find in a trailer

142
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,600
based on questionnaires that we put to

143
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,960
our fleets

144
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,520
they all have trailer abs unsurprisingly

145
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,120
because that's regulated

146
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,800
there's also other features and the

147
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,080
other features are usually integrated

148
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,840
with wireless proprietary but there are

149
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,400
other

150
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,720
proprietary type networks that will

151
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,199
enable those features as well

152
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,759
and uh it seems like there's still quite

153
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,040
a bit quite a bit more than just

154
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,960
trailer brakes these features aren't

155
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,720
stopping there though they're growing

156
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,840
every day uh this is a conglomerate

157
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,600
of future looking features that you

158
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,600
might find in a trailer based on a bunch

159
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,479
of webinars

160
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:06,560
by paul menig and the people that he

161
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,600
invited into

162
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,120
ata tmc task forces combined with some

163
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,560
of the questionnaires that we put to our

164
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,080
members and you can see it's

165
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,000
quite a lot of features quite a lot of

166
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,960
different bus options

167
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,320
note that the adoption of these

168
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,320
technologies has been pretty slow a lot

169
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,000
of these things that you'll see here

170
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,440
have actually been listed as next

171
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,199
generation technologies

172
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,400
in a report that dates to 1998 so take

173
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,080
the marketing with a grain of salt

174
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,080
but these kind of technologies are

175
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,000
coming as are the switch to a different

176
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,440
bus

177
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,080
you'll see here we're listing can j1939

178
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,600
as well as iso 11992-2 which is also

179
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,120
known as tt can

180
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,800
these can buses and trailers are much

181
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,880
more common in europe

182
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,320
in north america today they're pretty

183
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,080
rare but that may very well

184
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,680
change in the future and then

185
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,280
an important thing to mention is that if

186
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,039
you thought getting testing time on a

187
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:00,400
truck was hard

188
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,919
imagine getting testing time on a

189
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,000
trailer if these trailers

190
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,280
aren't rolling or docked they're

191
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,840
actually parked holding cargo

192
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,360
so getting time in a trailer is pretty

193
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,000
difficult and the trailers last a really

194
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,720
long time

195
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,639
they stay a service lifetime of about 30

196
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,319
years in north america

197
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,080
so a lot of the trailers you'll run into

198
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,240
are quite old maybe beaten up

199
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,360
and seen better days

200
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,680
so trucking uh you know goes without

201
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,440
saying i think i said it before

202
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,759
it's a money maker the vehicles are

203
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,680
owned for commercial purposes

204
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,440
sometimes they're leased for companies

205
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,880
for example penske

206
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,639
and they uh they protect their

207
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:37,840
investments with preventative

208
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,319
maintenance so maintenance is a big part

209
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,479
uh tractors actually spend more time in

210
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:43,520
a service center connected to

211
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,240
diagnostics than any passenger car would

212
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,080
uh the diagnostic software is quite

213
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,400
powerful you know

214
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,840
you can see that paper reference there

215
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,680
that bill haas was on the

216
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,599
diagnostic software for example is

217
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:57,440
capable of disabling engine cylinders

218
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,440
and cycling abs pressure valves

219
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,520
and a lot of this diagnostic software is

220
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,039
actually just low quality

221
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:06,560
windows software another big part about

222
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,240
trucking is the distribution centers

223
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,400
so fleets actually make extensive use of

224
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,440
these

225
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,160
for example in ltl less than truckload

226
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,440
where these distribution centers are

227
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,639
called terminals

228
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,240
and moving freight there is much more

229
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,199
like moving passengers and air traffic

230
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,840
um than it is like packets in a network

231
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,520
package in a network is more like truck

232
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,319
load

233
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,240
so you can also think of ltl as how the

234
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,599
postal service operates and these

235
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,680
terminals end up being staging areas for

236
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,960
different groups

237
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,599
of passengers as they get regrouped into

238
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:37,039
different trailers and sent on to their

239
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,960
next destination

240
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,400
these distribution centers actually have

241
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,160
a lot of technology and a lot of attack

242
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,520
surface themselves

243
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,840
which i'm not prepared to talk about but

244
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,680
it should be unsurprising to you to find

245
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,319
that

246
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,720
handhelds and tablets and iot and all

247
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,080
the other embedded systems

248
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,560
actually pervade the distribution center

249
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,879
today

250
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,440
intermodal briefly a lot of people

251
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,919
recognize intermodal as containers

252
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,240
um a lot of fleets make extensive use of

253
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,000
them transferring them from train to

254
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,479
ship

255
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,960
to trailer as they're designed to do

256
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,240
we've heard that some intermodal

257
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,680
containers actually have their own

258
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,720
networking

259
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,639
interconnects and many of these

260
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,479
containers have their own telematics

261
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,160
modems so just another way that things

262
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,319
are all interconnected

263
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,319
i'm not an expert in the other modes

264
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,000
here but it's important to let you know

265
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,879
what they are and that they all share

266
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,759
technologies

267
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:30,319
so ships also use jnt-39 and there it's

268
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:31,840
called nmea

269
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,240
trains also use jit-39 because they have

270
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,440
a diesel engine

271
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,519
although on the trains a lot of times

272
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:38,799
the diesel engine is set up as a

273
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:42,080
generator and not as an engine to move

274
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,440
as a motor to move the train and another

275
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,880
thing that all the modes share in common

276
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,320
is they're all

277
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,040
kind of accreting all of this iot stuff

278
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,480
and adding them on to their business

279
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,279
operations

280
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,440
you can see here a picture of a port

281
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,519
that has all kinds of handhelds and

282
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,279
different sensors and integration with

283
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:00,800
the ships the dock much like the

284
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,519
distribution center

285
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,000
so i hope i've convinced you that

286
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,760
commercial transportation is important

287
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,720
and that the other

288
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,640
all the other modes are interrelated i'd

289
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,320
like to move into discussing

290
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,880
particulars of truck vehicle networks

291
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,320
starting with j1939

292
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,640
i think a lot of people here joining the

293
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,760
car hacking village are going to be

294
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,680
familiar with can networks especially as

295
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,519
they relate to passenger cars

296
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:27,839
so i'd like to introduce you to j939

297
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:29,360
which is found in heavy vehicles

298
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,680
as it relates in an analogy to passenger

299
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,040
cars so

300
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,000
in both cases the can buses are encoding

301
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,360
time-varying signals

302
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,040
and packing those time-varying signals

303
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,720
into bit field locations

304
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,399
in passenger cars the bit field

305
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,000
locations are

306
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,680
you know signals that are identified by

307
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,279
these arbitration ids

308
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,120
and both the arbitration ids that

309
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,120
identify the group of signals

310
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,720
the locations of those signals as

311
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,480
they're packed our proprietary

312
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,760
information

313
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,440
in j1939 in contrast pgns that identify

314
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,200
the grouping of signals and the spns

315
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,959
that identify where they're packed

316
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:04,800
are the standardized parts in fact in

317
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,399
j1939

318
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,839
for the most part in passenger cars uh

319
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:11,600
diagnostics were standardized this is

320
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,040
mostly for carb

321
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,680
and in contrast in heavy vehicles it's

322
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,880
actually the diagnostics that are

323
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,839
proprietary

324
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:21,440
some passenger cars you should be

325
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,079
familiar with uds for diagnostics

326
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,000
trucks have more than one type of

327
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,680
diagnostic uds

328
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,480
is available and is gaining a share it

329
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,079
has its own reserve pgn for example

330
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:36,880
here's a nice little decode of a can

331
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,440
frame

332
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,640
that is encoding aj 1939 seed key

333
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,240
exchange

334
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,680
this was put together using ken

335
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,399
tyndale's can 2 decoder which is great

336
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,880
at looking at extended errors

337
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,880
and does a really nice breakdown and

338
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,079
build up of the parts of the frame

339
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:57,040
you can see here that j1939 frames use

340
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,760
extended 29-bit arbitration ids

341
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,079
which is the combination of ida and idb

342
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:03,839
that you see there

343
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,240
they can have a variable data field in

344
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,160
this case three

345
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,040
and then have all the normal can parts

346
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,320
there's also a diagram

347
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,720
below showing you how the pgns are

348
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,760
actually packed

349
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,800
into that arbitration id so there's both

350
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,839
unicast and broadcast pgns when we're

351
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,079
talking about a broadcast pgn it uses

352
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:27,519
all of the bits from 23 to 8

353
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,680
and for a unicast it actually just uses

354
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,120
the upper bits and encodes the

355
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,160
destination address and

356
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,880
arbitration id and in all cases the

357
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,720
arbitration id also encodes a source

358
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,519
address

359
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:39,920
and a priority as well as one reserve

360
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,320
bit and a page that is starting a page

361
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,519
bit that's starting to be used more

362
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:44,399
extensively

363
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,519
in the j1939 definitions

364
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,079
j939 has a lot of different features i

365
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:52,240
told you it has unicast and broadcast

366
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,680
it also has its own transport

367
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,680
fragmentation and reassembly mechanism

368
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,639
address claiming request to pgn data and

369
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,399
then more importantly to truck hacking

370
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:01,920
there's proprietary messages that flow

371
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,000
over j9039 networks

372
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,240
and they have their own reserved range

373
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,200
of pgns

374
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,320
both cast and broadcast

375
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,920
when you're dealing with trucks a lot of

376
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,519
the fun stuff the dumping and

377
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,279
reconfiguring and reflashing

378
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,120
is all protected by authentication and

379
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,959
authorization challenge response system

380
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:19,600
called

381
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,480
seed key exchange and the uds is used

382
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,279
for

383
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:26,480
cp exchange it has a reserved pgn of hex

384
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,079
da double zero

385
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:29,519
and you saw some of that encoded in the

386
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,360
previous slide

387
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,639
so let's talk about where you might be

388
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,680
able to find j9039 on a truck

389
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,000
first up is that onboard diagnostics

390
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:38,720
connector

391
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,480
these can be found in either black or

392
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,720
green they're located below

393
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,160
the steering wheel just to the left of

394
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,399
it they're usually this deutsch

395
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,800
9 pin although some oems actually use

396
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,560
the passenger car style

397
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,680
obd2 connector

398
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,800
on the black socket you'll find that

399
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,880
in addition to j1708 there's actually

400
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,480
two j1939

401
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,360
buses the second one is optional and on

402
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,480
the black socket

403
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,480
j939 runs at 250 kilowatt

404
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,519
on the green variety uh the j1708 bus is

405
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,120
actually optional

406
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,880
replaced usually by j939 and the j959

407
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,839
buses on the green socket run at 500

408
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:20,240
kilowatt

409
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,160
now those oem specific pins that you see

410
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,160
pictured there those are also

411
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,560
probably another j939 bus on many of the

412
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,959
vehicles

413
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,200
fine h9 on the rp 1226 aftermarket

414
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,279
connector it should be present on pins

415
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,120
two and nine and four and 11.

416
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,240
remember this is the aftermarket or

417
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,079
telematics connector that you might find

418
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:44,240
behind the dash or behind the berth

419
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,279
this was provided by oems to

420
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:49,279
give fleets a place to connect things

421
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:50,800
permanently or semi-permanently that

422
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,360
wasn't the obd connector

423
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,199
notice here that there's also two oem

424
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:56,480
specific pins

425
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,639
those are probably also a j1939 bus

426
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,760
in addition uh many modern vehicles have

427
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,839
lots of different j1939 segments that

428
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:06,800
are not pinned out

429
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,120
on the onboard diagnostics connector

430
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,199
this architecture diagram you see here

431
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:14,160
is from a textbook by duffy and wright

432
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,160
and it shows no less than six separate

433
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,279
can segments

434
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:18,959
only two of which are present on that

435
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,320
diagnostics connector

436
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,839
so you'll probably be able to find more

437
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:24,000
j939 if you poke around

438
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,519
in the harnesses of the truck

439
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:30,639
last uh finding j9039 is going to be

440
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:32,800
possible on db15 connectors

441
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,639
many of the adapter cables that you'll

442
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,959
use on heavy vehicles are

443
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,040
pinned out on db15 connectors so knowing

444
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,959
this pin out is really useful

445
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:43,120
can is present on 5 and 10 and 12 and

446
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,959
13.

447
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:47,920
so that was ji 39 let's talk about 1708

448
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,839
and 1587.

449
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:52,399
these two standards are pretty much

450
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,240
always found together

451
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,800
they pre-date j-1939 by many years

452
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,320
they're sometimes still found

453
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,800
in tractors and they're always still

454
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,760
found in the trailer

455
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,199
as j2497 more on that later you can see

456
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:07,279
here this analogy diagram that tries to

457
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,360
roughly place where j1587

458
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,519
is relative to where j1939 or say udp

459
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:14,880
would sit on top of ethernet

460
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,120
just so you can get an idea of the place

461
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,480
in the stack up

462
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:23,360
of these different standards so j1708

463
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,519
has a very similar bus arbitration to

464
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:26,880
can the lowest byte

465
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,720
first wins j1780 always runs at 9600

466
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,440
baud

467
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,120
8 bits one stop at no parity so 8n1

468
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,480
at the physical layer it's very much

469
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,399
like rs-485 but it has

470
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,959
hard time constraints for framing and

471
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:42,399
bus arbitration so

472
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,720
if you want to write j1708 you have to

473
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,600
actually

474
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,560
have um hard real time hold offs for

475
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,120
frame

476
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,600
delimiting if you just want to read j728

477
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,480
and dump it

478
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,160
any rs485 adapter should do

479
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,360
in j1708 that first byte is um called

480
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,120
the mid and it's much more like a source

481
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:01,680
address

482
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,399
than arbitration ids are on cam and

483
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:05,519
there's many

484
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,880
sort of noteworthy mids

485
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,880
one one one is factory test and that's

486
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,920
fun

487
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,160
there's also off-board diagnostics

488
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,079
programming there's a vehicle security

489
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:17,040
reserve number

490
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,360
there's bridges for drivetrain as well

491
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,120
as tractor trailer

492
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,120
and then uh four total j2497 reserves so

493
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,800
there's 10 and 11 which is the lamp on

494
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,160
lamp off that's the whole

495
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,519
razon detroit for j2497

496
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:34,800
um for 128 through 255

497
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,519
those are actually defined by the j1587

498
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:38,959
standard

499
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:42,720
so j1587 signals are identified by a pid

500
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,920
byte which gets

501
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,040
put into the payload of the j1708 frame

502
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,759
this is kind of different than j1939 or

503
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,199
passenger cars

504
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:54,160
where maybe the pgn implicitly specifies

505
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,440
the bit packing

506
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,920
um these signals are identified by a pid

507
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,199
that's put in the frame

508
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:00,639
and then how you decode the data that

509
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:02,800
follows the pid that's where you have to

510
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,359
refer to the j1587 specification

511
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:06,720
and of course there are tools out there

512
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,480
that can take the saa pdf

513
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,679
um and do a decode like pretty 1587

514
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,640
and we'll talk a bit about that later

515
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,799
j1587 has a lot of features

516
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,720
both broadcasts and unicast frames are

517
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,599
possible there's ways to request data

518
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,520
both requesting broadcast data as well

519
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,720
as component specific

520
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,039
data it includes fragmentation and

521
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:27,839
reassembly

522
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,720
both a transport protocol that's unicast

523
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,360
and a

524
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,720
special multi-section parameter pid-192

525
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,440
for pids that are broadcast there's also

526
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,400
a free-form

527
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,799
data standardized request that sits on

528
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:42,240
top of the transport protocol where you

529
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,080
can ask for interesting things like

530
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,919
programmable parameters and calibration

531
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:47,760
and executable code

532
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,360
there are of course uh since it's

533
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,120
automotive proprietary messages

534
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,720
and the private dairy messages where the

535
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,440
fun stuff happens in 1587 this is called

536
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,640
data link escape

537
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,200
and these are unicast so they're made up

538
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,160
by pid254 and 510.

539
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,480
uh an example message you might see is

540
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,720
you know

541
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,200
acfe80fo17 down here

542
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,640
which is a 254 pid being sent

543
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:17,200
from mid hex ac to mid hex 80

544
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,240
and the payload fo 17 is what gets

545
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,200
interpreted

546
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,559
by the destination on the other end

547
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:26,960
where will you find 1708 you saw this

548
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,799
already on a couple of the deutsche 9

549
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:31,360
pin connectors j7208 should be present

550
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,240
on fng on that black socket and it'll be

551
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,480
optional on the green socket

552
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,720
if you have an rp 1226 connector you may

553
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,039
very well have access to a 1708

554
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:44,400
bus on pins 6 and 13.

555
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,960
and of course if you have a db15 cable

556
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,320
adapter you're probably going to find

557
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,240
your 17 8 bus on pins

558
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,799
14 to 50. so we have reviewed the

559
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,559
locations where it's possible to find

560
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:57,440
1708 or 1587 but the presence of this

561
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:57,840
bus

562
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,240
is becoming increasingly uncommon on

563
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,200
tractors

564
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,720
the reason why it's relevant why we

565
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,280
cover it here is because

566
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,679
this network does show up on powerline

567
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:08,559
carrier

568
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:11,760
form in all tractors since 2001.

569
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,640
let's talk about that form it's known as

570
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,200
j2497

571
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,600
and it's what links tractors and trailer

572
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,600
abs

573
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,280
roughly speaking j2497 is j1708 over

574
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,039
trailer power lines it's also known as

575
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,320
plc for trucks

576
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,360
and you can think of it as an

577
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:31,120
alternative transport layer for 1587.

578
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:34,160
um the way it works is

579
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,919
it's almost exclusively implemented by

580
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:39,120
the intel on ssc p485 chip which

581
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,640
adds uh preamble and sync bits

582
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,880
around the beginning and the end of j178

583
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:45,679
messages

584
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,559
and this is a bi-directional switch you

585
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:50,400
can also see a time domain plot at the

586
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,000
bottom of the kind of chirps that it

587
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,840
puts together

588
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,160
j2497 has a lot of features itself the

589
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,160
primary purpose is for those

590
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,880
mid 10 and 11 frames oao and obff

591
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,440
are these the default frames for lamp on

592
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,880
and lamp off that's the whole reason why

593
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,159
they developed it

594
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:11,840
but because it is j1708

595
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,000
it has all of those features plus they

596
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,919
also had a dynamic address claim to

597
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:16,799
support

598
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,679
having road trains so multiple different

599
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,919
trailers connected together

600
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:23,440
because this is the data network the

601
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,360
trailer brake manufacturers

602
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,200
put together trailer brake diagnostics

603
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,880
so all the abs air pressure valve

604
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,280
cycling and ecu reconfiguration

605
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,320
should be present over 24.97 and some of

606
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,000
those brake ecs and trailers actually

607
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,520
have their own scripting languages

608
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,960
that are programmable over j2497

609
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,799
so one of the interesting things about

610
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:44,559
this network is because of that added

611
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,240
preamble that that chip

612
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,000
adds to the beginning of the message

613
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,919
there's a duplication of the first byte

614
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:51,280
being an id byte

615
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,799
you can actually create priority

616
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:55,440
override frames so for example you can

617
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,679
you can send a maximum priority double

618
00:20:57,679 --> 00:20:58,640
zero

619
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,200
and a j1708 inside it as a minimum

620
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,400
double f

621
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,480
and that double zero frame will override

622
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,080
the priority of all the traffic but it's

623
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,120
received as a

624
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,000
mid double f and then finally because

625
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,440
this is a power line character

626
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,520
a carrier technology and it uses very

627
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,200
long conductors

628
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,919
we have been able to receive this using

629
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:18,720
the

630
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,720
sdr software from six feet away from the

631
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,400
trailer

632
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,640
so where are you going to find j2497

633
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,400
well it's always going to be

634
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,960
on that power bin the center pin aux on

635
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,960
the j560 connector

636
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,799
at the back of the tractor or the front

637
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:34,640
of the trailer pictured on that green

638
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,480
cable in the top right

639
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,000
which means all the adapters in the

640
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,080
bottom left are your friend

641
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,919
so you might find some adapters that

642
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:44,000
give you a db15 power right out to the

643
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,480
j560 as picture in the bottom left

644
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,280
there are in-line adapters um next from

645
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,159
the left

646
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:52,159
that's you have to be careful some of

647
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:54,400
them actually include an intel on

648
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,760
chip so they will convert from 2497

649
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:01,039
to 1708 some of them don't you can also

650
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:03,360
make your own inline adapter by taking

651
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:03,760
the

652
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,880
shell off a j560 cable and inserting

653
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,720
your own pigtail as you can see pictured

654
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,159
there second from the left

655
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:14,880
you might also find j2497 on the power

656
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,600
pins of the diagnostic connector that

657
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,640
obd connector the deutsche 9 pin but

658
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,480
you have to be careful some trucks

659
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,320
include filtering

660
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,559
so that the diagnostics connector is

661
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:27,360
actually

662
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,960
got filtered power relative to what

663
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,640
you'd find on the tractor uh

664
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:35,679
same for 2497 on the rp-1226 connector

665
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:36,159
so the

666
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:39,440
rpe 1226 document says that it should be

667
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,240
there

668
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,880
all the oems that i've ever talked to in

669
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,520
meetings

670
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,440
say that it probably won't work it

671
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,280
probably is filtered so you may or may

672
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:51,039
not find it on the rp-126 connector

673
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:53,440
uh 2497 might actually be on the battery

674
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,799
terminals

675
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:56,640
of the trunk which makes this adapter

676
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,000
useful sometimes but

677
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,799
it may also be filter paired the only

678
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:02,480
place is guaranteed to be found is on

679
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,280
that tractor

680
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:07,120
connected to the j560 but i have no fear

681
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,559
you might just be able to set up an

682
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:10,640
active antenna and some sdr software

683
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,880
and receive the traffic standing next to

684
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,840
the trailer anyways

685
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,640
of course there is going to be other

686
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,559
vehicle networks in intermodal

687
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:23,679
um we know that j1939 is going to be

688
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:27,120
found anywhere there's a diesel engine

689
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,720
and since j1939 historically replaces

690
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,960
j178 and 1587

691
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,720
uh it stands to reason that there may be

692
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,039
installations that also have j1708 on

693
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:38,400
their diesel engines

694
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,840
in intermodal we've also heard that

695
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,320
j2497 might be

696
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,080
used for power line communications on

697
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,679
some containers but haven't been able to

698
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:48,159
test this yet

699
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:50,480
in the future uh of course as

700
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,440
applications for

701
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,840
for high-speed data uh keep increasing

702
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,279
uh the number of buses and types of

703
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:57,039
buses that will be deployed will go up

704
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:58,799
some of the ones not listed here you

705
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:00,799
might find passenger cars like

706
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:04,640
flex-ray most um in heavy it looks like

707
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,440
can fd

708
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,080
may or may not make it in can hg looks

709
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,760
like a good option

710
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,240
to uh to avoid the incompatibilities

711
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,440
automotive ethernet

712
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,360
seems pretty clear that it'll find

713
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,039
applications on trailers

714
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:18,559
and of course the proliferation of

715
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:20,159
different wireless technologies

716
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:23,760
is inevitable on these vehicles

717
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,240
okay so that was an overview of what

718
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,120
trucking is

719
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,200
how it works with the technicals let's

720
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,840
talk about truck

721
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,679
hacking starting off with the can attack

722
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:35,600
methods so if you actually have access

723
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,000
to a can bus what can you do

724
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,320
um if you're thinking at the frame level

725
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,279
how you create

726
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:44,000
the can messages you can flood the bus

727
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,440
that's a pretty obvious one and i think

728
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,880
there's lots of examples of that in the

729
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,679
literature

730
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:49,600
or you can just send a message that you

731
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,720
want um

732
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,240
and pretend that you were the the

733
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,840
intended source and that's

734
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,520
spoofing but might be known by other

735
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,760
names all of the types of attacks that

736
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,200
we're going to discuss

737
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,880
in this section are all just simple

738
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,120
spoofing attacks so sending data

739
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,880
pretending that you the ecu that you

740
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,480
want to be

741
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,360
but there's more than that

742
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:11,840
there's a lot of different ways to

743
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,200
attack the protocol

744
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,320
level sort of below the payloads and the

745
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,000
arbitration id you might create using

746
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
something like socket can

747
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,320
so both the can hack tool by ken and

748
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,039
dell

749
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:25,919
and the cant tool by bitbain and n2 at

750
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:26,799
grim

751
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:28,799
are capable of doing things like bus off

752
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:30,000
attacks

753
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,320
spoofing immediately after a frame goes

754
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,320
by so you can be sure that

755
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,320
the receiver buffer will get it as soon

756
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,640
as possible and if the receiver uses

757
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,200
timed

758
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,640
receiving then you can actually replace

759
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,880
the message they're capable of causing

760
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:43,919
double receive

761
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:47,679
messages overload frames uh there's a

762
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:48,640
way to force

763
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,799
transmitters and error passive and then

764
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:53,120
replace the data or spoof the data

765
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,120
and then this type of an attack that's

766
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,159
janus which

767
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:58,480
exploits the fact that different

768
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,400
sampling points can be configured on can

769
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,039
receivers

770
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:04,320
so you can create a waveform that

771
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,720
is received with different data by

772
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,200
different configured sampling points

773
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,320
and then of course things like bus

774
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,080
shorting and knack data replacers so

775
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,360
those last three

776
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,440
actually require analog switches in

777
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,640
hardware

778
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,320
but they are an interesting attack

779
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,919
that's possible with some of the cant

780
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:23,120
tools all the ones that are in red are

781
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,480
possible attacks to

782
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:28,159
to employ if you have an soc that has

783
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:31,039
gpios connected to a can transceiver

784
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:34,159
so many socs uh have this configuration

785
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:35,919
where the can controller is embedded

786
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:38,559
in the chip and then there's an external

787
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:39,919
can transceiver that does the

788
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:40,720
differential

789
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:44,080
pair level shifting and if the

790
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,000
pin box could be reconfigured so that

791
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,760
gpios are connected to that transceiver

792
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,840
instead of the can controller which is

793
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,480
almost all socs and all of these red

794
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,240
attacks are then possible by software

795
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,520
takeover of those nodes

796
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,159
it turns out that analogs to these

797
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:01,039
attacks

798
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:02,640
some of them anyways are also possible

799
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,320
with j1708

800
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,240
so bus flooding and simple spoofing yep

801
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,000
that's just by creating the data

802
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,760
um doing bus off and spoofing

803
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,520
immediately is definitely possible with

804
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,440
real time control as would be

805
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,600
an error passive data replacing style

806
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,918
attack

807
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,480
so um let's talk about some of the

808
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,000
public attacks in literature

809
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,200
we'll talk about ten um each result is

810
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,039
true only on a specific model

811
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:29,200
per year of a particular truck so your

812
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,039
mileage may vary but they're worth

813
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:34,240
testing if you have access to a truck

814
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,440
first up is vehicle disable or limp

815
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,399
by uh def def additive message

816
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:41,679
manipulation so the def

817
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:43,440
is the the additive that's added to

818
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,880
diesel to make it burn

819
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,399
cleaner so urban johnson back in 2015

820
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:49,520
proposed this

821
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,039
the way the trucks are set up by

822
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:53,200
regulation uh when there's failures

823
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,919
in the additive control system the death

824
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:57,360
levels for example

825
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,279
the truck has to actually eventually

826
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:00,960
enter a limp

827
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,559
mode which where it's going very very

828
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:04,640
slow almost completely useless

829
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,000
so by manipulating those def levels

830
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,520
if you had access to the segment where

831
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,679
they were being sent you could actually

832
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:14,880
cause a vehicle disabled

833
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:18,399
denial of ecu's is possible so subujit

834
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:22,320
um et al demonstrated this back in 2016.

835
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,080
um they were actually able to exploit a

836
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,440
weakness in the data link layer

837
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,399
protocols of

838
00:28:27,399 --> 00:28:30,000
1939-21 they demonstrated there was

839
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,600
actually a practical denial of service

840
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,080
attack

841
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,440
in these systems they're they're

842
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,880
practical because they were actually

843
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,440
later demonstrated on real vehicles

844
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,600
uh crafting the attacks did require

845
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,360
studying the workflow of the data length

846
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,240
layer

847
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,000
and identifying points that are suitable

848
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,360
for disruption

849
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,440
there were actually three categories of

850
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,880
dos that are identified there was a

851
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,399
request overload

852
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:52,799
there was false rts's and there was

853
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:53,520
connection

854
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,080
exhaustion

855
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,960
there's more vehicle disables and lymphs

856
00:28:58,960 --> 00:28:59,919
that are possible

857
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:02,880
this is some research that was performed

858
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,200
by

859
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,399
um can bus hack sponsored by the nmfta

860
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:07,840
and they actually identified a whole

861
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,360
family of message types that could

862
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,559
possibly lead to

863
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:12,799
a d-rate event and hence also a limp

864
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:13,919
mode

865
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:16,159
so once more they created a very simple

866
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:16,960
fuzzing like

867
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,720
attack kind of a search through the

868
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,399
proprietary message space that was

869
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:22,399
demonstrated to find and cause d-rate

870
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:23,360
events

871
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,520
with a known investigation or reverse

872
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,480
engineering sorry

873
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,360
no reverse engineering required and they

874
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:32,159
also demonstrated that the d-rate events

875
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:35,039
could be caused by reconfiguring the

876
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:36,960
calibrated limits that are stored in the

877
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,559
engine components

878
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:40,159
which underscores the importance of

879
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:42,480
diagnostics security

880
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,799
there's more details on uh this attack

881
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:46,159
which is pretty recent

882
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:50,000
at our portal cts rpm fta org

883
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,360
seen there in the link what about

884
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,399
1587 and this is also in the category of

885
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:57,200
abusing

886
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,080
diagnostics uh haystack and six volts uh

887
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,440
deliberate a talk here at the car

888
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,919
hacking village in defcon 24

889
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:06,320
and in it they included an example of

890
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,320
how you could actually disable

891
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,640
a truck ecm by misconfiguring it and

892
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,360
they did this

893
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,000
by um doing some protocol and software

894
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:14,960
reverse engineering

895
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,919
of 1708 traffic and to demonstrate that

896
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:19,360
there were no access controls

897
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,200
on what needed to be sent from the

898
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,600
diagnostics software to create bad

899
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,559
engine configurations so in addition to

900
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:27,760
physical access

901
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,399
uh being required they also highlighted

902
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:31,200
that

903
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,200
compromise of the diagnostic software

904
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,240
would in fact be

905
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,080
sufficient uh remember the diagnostic

906
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,840
software is highly privileged

907
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,159
is usually just windows software running

908
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:41,679
on a windows pc

909
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:45,279
in a maintenance bay what else can you

910
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:46,080
do

911
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,840
it's possible to override the instrument

912
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,000
cluster display i think lots of people

913
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,919
have done this playing with instrument

914
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:54,240
clusters set up on benches for past cars

915
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,399
the same thing is possible in uh heavy

916
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:58,720
vehicles as demonstrated by

917
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,840
um liza virakova bill haas leaf milar

918
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,519
etc more by liza

919
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:07,840
and bill's team you can actually do rpm

920
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,279
control and engine brake

921
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:13,440
disable not only were they able to

922
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,279
disable the engine braking

923
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:17,120
but over 1708 they found that they could

924
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,559
disable cylinders

925
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:20,880
the particular truck they were testing

926
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,480
and this was done via legitimate

927
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,320
diagnostics functionality similar to

928
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:24,640
what

929
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,720
a stack and six volts presented

930
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,200
previously

931
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,159
they also were able to cycle abs air

932
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:33,519
release

933
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:35,200
and they noticed um that they could do

934
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,440
this by replaying diagnostics

935
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,799
diagnostic tool traffic those

936
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:40,799
unauthenticated uh

937
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:42,399
and what's interesting is that the same

938
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:44,880
functionality is also present on j2497

939
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,799
networks which maybe isn't

940
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:49,919
surprising since that's just j 1708 over

941
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:52,480
power lines

942
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,919
uh so last up is reading remote traffic

943
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:58,320
from j2497 we mentioned this in the the

944
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:58,960
technicals

945
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:02,240
of j2497 so we we did find that you

946
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:02,559
could

947
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:05,600
cycle the abs pressure valves but

948
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,519
um when you're just reading traffic it's

949
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:09,600
possible to get it from six feet away

950
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:14,240
and this was published as cisa advisory

951
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:18,240
last year and also got a cd

952
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,320
so in summary there's plenty of things

953
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,320
you can do both in 1939

954
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:26,240
1708 and 24.97

955
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,080
but there's more and we would like you

956
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,919
to give it a shot uh so what actually

957
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:31,519
needs more hacking well

958
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:33,200
abuse of the legitimate stuff is

959
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,559
probably a good place to start

960
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:37,200
so no no exploitation needed take some

961
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,120
diagnostic software and and see what can

962
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,799
actually be replayed it's a good place

963
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:42,240
to start

964
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,000
we have seen several examples of

965
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
fruitful abuse so far

966
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,720
but there hasn't been much in terms of

967
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:49,360
abusing

968
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:52,799
adas features or mobilizer body control

969
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:56,000
so some things to think about there's

970
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,960
also definitely research needed into

971
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,320
vehicle network gateways

972
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,320
so gateways being the devices that are

973
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,440
going to bridge multiple

974
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,799
can or j939 segments in the vehicle

975
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:08,480
sometimes they're being introduced for

976
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,640
performance reasons

977
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,360
um but whether they're being introduced

978
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,799
for performance reasons or not

979
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:16,960
they're always a security relevant

980
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:17,840
device since

981
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,440
they connect multiple segments and

982
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,440
pivoting is possible

983
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:25,360
so those could use some sunlight as well

984
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,880
what other truck and trailer hacking can

985
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,799
you do well just like car hacking you

986
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:30,159
know truck hacking is really

987
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:31,919
the olympics of hacking which is a quote

988
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:33,360
attributable to will

989
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:36,880
carijuana all the usual iot stuff is

990
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,519
there

991
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:39,679
game hacking as well telematics is

992
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:41,919
pretty much iot devices

993
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:44,799
all the mobile handhelds and head units

994
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:45,440
and

995
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,919
logistics devices are all android the

996
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:49,440
diagnostics and maintenance tools are

997
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:49,919
usually

998
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:52,080
just you know not very high quality

999
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,600
windows software although that is

1000
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,640
getting better

1001
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,559
and of course rf there's lots of rf all

1002
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:57,840
over the trucks and

1003
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,559
rf is usually you know whatever you got

1004
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:03,039
whatever you want to try

1005
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:04,640
so there's definitely a place for you to

1006
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,159
get involved

1007
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:07,760
if you're a professional or a student

1008
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,520
that wants to get involved definitely

1009
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,199
recommend the cyber truck challenge this

1010
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:11,839
is

1011
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:12,879
an event that's put together

1012
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:14,719
specifically to train students it does

1013
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,879
get attended both by industry

1014
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:20,000
experts as well as the students and oems

1015
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,359
and suppliers

1016
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:23,280
each student that attends pretty much

1017
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,800
gets more than ten thousand dollars in

1018
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,000
free training

1019
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,320
there is a stipend for students that are

1020
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,520
eligible

1021
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,359
there's going to be stuff to crawl under

1022
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:34,560
and over in the form of trucks and boxes

1023
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:38,399
and i do encourage you to participate

1024
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:40,000
of course and this shouldn't be

1025
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,440
surprising when watching the videos you

1026
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,800
can definitely get involved through the

1027
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,000
car hacking village

1028
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,839
this year we're going to have some more

1029
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:48,399
air brakes setups

1030
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:50,320
launching some nerf darts for fun if you

1031
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:53,280
want to join and try

1032
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:54,800
if you want to get involved i highly

1033
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,879
recommend doing a bench setup this is

1034
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:58,640
definitely necessary in this field

1035
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:01,520
because getting time on trucks is hard

1036
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,720
as we mentioned if the trucks aren't

1037
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,640
rolling the fleets aren't making any

1038
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,800
money but you can make a truck in a box

1039
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,760
looking at haystack and six volts paper

1040
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,280
that's available on github

1041
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,200
and for all the really gory details you

1042
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,640
can check jose's

1043
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,320
master's thesis which is available at

1044
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,280
the university of tulsa

1045
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:22,400
let's move on to some technical stuff

1046
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,920
and talk about tools

1047
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,599
for truck hacking or just vehicle

1048
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:28,240
networks in general

1049
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,320
so if you're on a j933 network and

1050
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,400
you've got some traffic flying by

1051
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,880
um you want to know what it is that

1052
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:35,599
you're looking at

1053
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:37,760
in a passenger car you might need to try

1054
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,839
to get your hands on a dvc file that

1055
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:41,680
defines all the bit fields and what they

1056
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:44,000
mean and maybe with the arbitration ids

1057
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,680
are supposed to be

1058
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,480
in the case of j939 uh most of this is

1059
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,400
standardized and if you had a copy of

1060
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,720
the j1939 digital annex

1061
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:56,079
you could go and decode it yourself

1062
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:57,599
there is a nice tool that we've

1063
00:35:57,599 --> 00:35:59,760
developed called pretty j1939 which

1064
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,760
takes that digital annex

1065
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:05,200
converts it into a j1939 json file

1066
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,520
uh and is able to use that json database

1067
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:10,320
to decode the j959 traffic

1068
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,480
the tool is also compatible with lots of

1069
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,760
previous versions of the j1939db.json

1070
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,320
format that you may find floating around

1071
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:21,280
on the interwebs so if you have one of

1072
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,200
those json files you're in luck you can

1073
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,320
use it

1074
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,400
i remember though that your decode is

1075
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,079
only as good as the

1076
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:30,880
db that you use with so um previous

1077
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,480
versions didn't actually capture

1078
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:35,200
all the details of j39 accurately so the

1079
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,960
best quality will be obtained by

1080
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,400
purchasing the digital annex and

1081
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,000
converting it

1082
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,320
the output that you see here is showing

1083
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,400
how you can augment the can dump

1084
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:47,359
format with commented json objects you

1085
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:48,079
can also

1086
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:50,480
omit the can dump stuff on the left and

1087
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,119
just

1088
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:54,400
put out a sequence of json objects that

1089
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,480
format with just json is very useful for

1090
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,160
filtering and beautifying with something

1091
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:58,720
like

1092
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:02,480
jq requiring the json

1093
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,560
the can data you see here is from the

1094
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:07,200
colorado state public can data logs

1095
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,160
and so is the vin of the truck that they

1096
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,720
own there

1097
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:16,079
what about sending j1939 you can do that

1098
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:17,119
using socket can

1099
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:19,119
and you can do socket can on a truck

1100
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:21,520
duck so the truck duck was introduced

1101
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:24,000
here at the karaki village in defcon 24

1102
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,920
by six volts and haystack it's the blue

1103
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,440
one pictured on the left

1104
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,200
since then they've put up together some

1105
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,680
more versions like the 1.5 yeet

1106
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:34,160
which is green and that mega board which

1107
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,400
is blue next to it

1108
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,880
also pictured here on the right is my

1109
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,119
truck cape which is a truck duck

1110
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:44,400
remixed by dr daley and it's in my

1111
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,960
custom monogrammed laser case which i'm

1112
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,000
very proud of

1113
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
you can also see the sma connectors

1114
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,359
sticking out of it which i use

1115
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:55,839
for j2497 research

1116
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:59,599
you can send j939 using socket cam

1117
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:02,480
so here is a snippet of some python you

1118
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,240
need to use sock raw

1119
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:07,359
in most cases um

1120
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:09,599
it won't send frames with transport for

1121
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:10,880
longer data so you'll have to do your

1122
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:11,599
transport

1123
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:13,119
breaking up yourself but there are other

1124
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:14,960
tools we'll talk about

1125
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,520
um and this does let you put together

1126
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,880
programmatically

1127
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:22,640
we're showing a hex up here you have to

1128
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:23,920
use you don't have to use struct pack

1129
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,680
but you can see the struct pack example

1130
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,280
there's um some patches that are

1131
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,800
necessary for using other features of

1132
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,720
j939 and we'll talk about that a bit in

1133
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,240
a second

1134
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,480
if you want to know more about what's

1135
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,920
actually happening

1136
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,599
in this snippet where address claim

1137
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:39,359
messages are being put together

1138
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:40,880
i recommend you check out the

1139
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:43,920
presentation at our portal by dr daley

1140
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,520
and you can see some of the sample code

1141
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,280
at dr daley's

1142
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:50,400
github i think there so there's lots of

1143
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:54,079
alternatives to sending j39

1144
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:57,040
since linux 5.4 there actually is a new

1145
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,520
socket can type can j1939

1146
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:02,560
which can be used uh since c python 3.9

1147
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,560
so as long as you're above that

1148
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:07,280
you can go direct to can j1939 for your

1149
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,640
socket type instead of using

1150
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,200
can raw like we saw on the snippet that

1151
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,880
is how haystack put together

1152
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:16,000
the truck duck for pi hv networks

1153
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,800
um but wasn't actually but that was done

1154
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,240
in a back port so it wasn't available

1155
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,119
mainline until

1156
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:23,520
much more recently there's a lot of

1157
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,040
different kind of

1158
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,680
semi-dead or semi-active python things

1159
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,400
out there

1160
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,240
the one that seems to be the most

1161
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:33,040
actively developed is python can g1939

1162
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,680
linked here that one uses can raw so

1163
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,480
we'll be

1164
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,800
workable on more systems than just the

1165
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,040
most recent patched linux kernels

1166
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,680
the api that it has there is best suited

1167
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,839
for developing j939 ecu's but i'm sure

1168
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:47,200
it would still be fine if we're putting

1169
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:47,839
together

1170
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:50,160
messages that you want to send all that

1171
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,680
to say that

1172
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,359
socket can isn't the only way to send

1173
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:55,440
j939 there are other tools such as the

1174
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,560
can cat

1175
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,320
and the truck devil which are great

1176
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,920
sending j939

1177
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,960
we'll talk about those as well so let's

1178
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:07,040
move uh to j1708 and 1587 and 24.97

1179
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,880
you can decode all these networks using

1180
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,880
the pretty j1587 tool so this is the

1181
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:11,920
tool that will

1182
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:16,160
take the sae pdf of j1587 and j1708

1183
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,000
it'll convert them into a database and

1184
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,280
then if you feed it

1185
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:22,319
of frames from j1708 or any other two

1186
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:23,520
networks we mentioned here it'll

1187
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,960
actually do the decoding

1188
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,119
this was presented last year by dan

1189
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:29,359
salam and thomas hayes

1190
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:32,400
uh here at the ceo of the chp

1191
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,240
uh the data you see here is actually

1192
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,599
from a couple attempts

1193
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:38,240
at launching the nerf darts last year so

1194
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,839
this was by u-locks

1195
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:42,079
he gave it a shot spoiler neither of

1196
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:45,280
these worked but it was a good idea

1197
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:48,480
what about sending data so you can do

1198
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,480
that using the j7200 send

1199
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,319
on a truck duck some hardware

1200
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:54,079
modifications are required and for

1201
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:54,880
details on that

1202
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,720
see the see the github as well as the

1203
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:59,439
talk last year

1204
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,560
um right and that's not the only tools

1205
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,760
we mentioned this earlier

1206
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,680
there's non-socket can options such as

1207
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,440
truck devil and cancat which are great

1208
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,280
tools for putting together your own can

1209
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,440
frames or even receiving your own can

1210
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,200
frames for 1939

1211
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,880
the can matrix tool is great for

1212
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,480
converting between different database

1213
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,359
formats

1214
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:20,160
it actually has a basic j1939dbc that's

1215
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,520
available in it

1216
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:24,720
uh grj2497 developed by chris poor at

1217
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:25,280
ais

1218
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:29,680
it actually does 2497 decoding on sdrs

1219
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:32,560
the pi hv networks library by haystack

1220
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,319
and six volts

1221
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:37,359
does j1708 sending as well as g7208

1222
00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:40,960
receiving and of course

1223
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:44,240
usb links and dpa4s so first up is the

1224
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,760
truck double by hannah

1225
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,400
civil silva it actually does decoding

1226
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,760
and logging and sending

1227
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:53,040
i works on the machina m2 and there is a

1228
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:55,119
really cool fuzzer that's in development

1229
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:56,880
hannah put together training videos and

1230
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,319
these training videos for the truck

1231
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:00,640
devil are also available on our portal

1232
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:03,680
uh ctsrp nmfta org

1233
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:06,319
the cancat which is developed by atlas

1234
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:07,760
uses a custom firmware

1235
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:10,880
for the m2 and it has its own client

1236
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:13,520
which includes j939 support

1237
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:16,160
the uh the cancad is developed much like

1238
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:18,319
a lot of atlas's stuff which is a

1239
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:20,800
interactive python rebel so if you're

1240
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:21,440
into

1241
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,359
programming at a ripple this might be

1242
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:25,119
for you

1243
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:27,200
and of course can matrix don't forget

1244
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,599
there is a basic j9039 dbc

1245
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:32,760
in the can matrix by edward brooker

1246
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:36,000
2497 receiver by chris port ais

1247
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,079
this is freely licensed if you want to

1248
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:40,160
use it it has flowgrass and custom

1249
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:40,880
blocks and

1250
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:43,920
will let you read j2497 traffic if you

1251
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:46,560
have an sdr

1252
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,880
pi hv networks um is pretty much the

1253
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:51,520
only way to send j728 and 1587 traffic

1254
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:52,880
using open source software

1255
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:55,119
it works only on the truck duck at this

1256
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:56,720
point anyways

1257
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:59,599
so if you need to send j1708 j587

1258
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:00,960
traffic you're going to want to head to

1259
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:03,119
this

1260
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:05,280
um having open source software and open

1261
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,119
source hardware isn't your only option

1262
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:08,640
when you're dealing with trucks you're

1263
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,480
going to run into oem diagnostic

1264
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:11,119
software

1265
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:13,200
it's a really good idea to have what are

1266
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,280
called vehicle diagnostic adapters

1267
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,920
and these are um they let you plug into

1268
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,119
the vehicle but they also have a

1269
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:20,880
standardized programming interface

1270
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:23,680
dlls in fact that are specified by rp

1271
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:24,640
1210

1272
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:27,119
so having an rp 1210 vda really lets you

1273
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:28,960
use any of the oem software

1274
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:31,760
the nexa usb link in particular is cheap

1275
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:33,040
and easy to find

1276
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,880
there are definitely rip off versions

1277
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,880
that you can find on less reputable

1278
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:37,280
sites

1279
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,960
we of course recommend you buy the real

1280
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:41,599
one the nexic usb link

1281
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:44,480
original not two not the version two

1282
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:46,400
actually has a dd15 connector

1283
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:47,599
which we highly recommend because

1284
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:49,200
there's a lot of cheap cables and

1285
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,960
adapters for db15

1286
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,480
as opposed to some of the newer stuff

1287
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,240
that move to db25

1288
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:57,200
and other higher density connectors

1289
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:58,079
similar vein

1290
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:00,880
is the dgtech dpa4 also rp1210

1291
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:01,920
compatible

1292
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,839
also has a db15 connector which is

1293
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:05,280
really useful

1294
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,359
the dpa5 does not have the db15

1295
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:08,640
connector although it's also

1296
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:11,119
a really great adapter the drivers for

1297
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:12,880
both of these dpas include a really

1298
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:14,400
useful data logging feature

1299
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,319
they call it debug file when you turn it

1300
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:18,079
on you get a dump of all the traffic

1301
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:19,359
going on all the buses

1302
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:22,880
on the diagnostic adapter

1303
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:24,880
so i hope we covered everything we

1304
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:26,640
wanted to cover

1305
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:29,440
uh in review i hope i convinced you that

1306
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:31,280
commercial transportation is important

1307
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:32,560
to everybody

1308
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:34,880
i showed you that trucks have three main

1309
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:37,280
types of vehicle networks

1310
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:38,960
two of all of these uh two of these

1311
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:40,400
vehicle networks are found on all the

1312
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,560
trucks in north america

1313
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,319
uh we did a survey of all the public

1314
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:46,720
hacks of trucks by a host of

1315
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:50,000
a bunch of people

1316
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:50,960
there are waste money which is

1317
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,640
definitely room for more and i showed

1318
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,160
you how you can get involved in a whole

1319
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:56,160
bunch of different ways

1320
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,319
so you know virtual transportation is

1321
00:44:58,319 --> 00:44:59,359
important

1322
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:02,839
and i hope that this talk has convinced

1323
00:45:02,839 --> 00:45:04,000
you

1324
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,640
lastly our program the commercial

1325
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:08,240
transportation security and research

1326
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:09,599
program at the nmfta

1327
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:12,640
is always open to collaboration

1328
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:15,440
we fund as well as collaborate directly

1329
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:17,280
on a variety of topics including vehicle

1330
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:18,400
security office

1331
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,640
and defense which you saw in this talk

1332
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:22,319
we're also interested in back-end system

1333
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:23,359
security

1334
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:25,760
distribution service center security and

1335
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,119
both mainframe and mid

1336
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:31,040
so ibm z and ibm i security

1337
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:32,800
if you are interested in collaborating

1338
