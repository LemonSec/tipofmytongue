00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,200
couple keyboards from the key company

25
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,120
they sent us these uh pretty awesome

26
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,640
terminal green portico kits that we're

27
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,319
gonna put together today

28
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:27,200
um

29
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,800

44
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,239
fun

45
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,280
board and and desk mats so yeah yeah

46
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,280
obviously we'll talk about later but

47
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,920
yeah yeah no no subtle show for this

48
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,720
yeah

49
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,440
no no subtle look you know it's helping

50
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,440
kids though man it all goes to a charity

51
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,120
like i can show when it's when it has to

52
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,280
do okay seven thousand dollars that goes

53
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,680
to a charity that has a budget of 40 is

54
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,879
like a huge contribution so i'm not i'm

55
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,360
not upset about it yeah yeah absolutely

56
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,040
well yeah we can get into that later so

57
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:25,920
uh

58
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,680
did you wind up doing any mods to your

59
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,239
stuff today i did i did some switch mods

60
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:31,680
and then i actually opened this up not

61
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,519
too long ago for the first time and

62
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,120
found like some pretty cool extras in

63
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,599
here like this like neoprene like yeah

64
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,360
spiller that they're on i think it's

65
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,200
actually pretty great so um so a couple

66
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,440
of things um you know

67
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,920
i'm certain that anyone watching the

68
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,080
stream that you know you're using your

69
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,440
keyboard a ton of the time right you

70
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,480
know

71
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,640
i i hope i hope for your sake it's not

72
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,560
like that run of the mill like dell or

73
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,840
hp

74
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,439
thing that you get with your company

75
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,400
issued uh computer um but that said a

76
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,239
lot you know i i know that a fair amount

77
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,080
of folks either have maybe like an ergo

78
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,760
docs or have bought an aftermarket

79
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,840
mechanical keyboard um

80
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,720
but

81
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,319
it can get kind of difficult to get

82
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:11,280
there so

83
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,599
so there's this huge

84
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,360
like subculture of mechanical keyboard

85
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,639
obsession uh that that andy has been a

86
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:21,040
part of and i still am very active in

87
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:21,918
um

88
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:23,600
and so you know that's kind of what

89
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,800
we're talking about today so so this kit

90
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,680
um

91
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,759
is is is a 65

92
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,560
keyboard so um to give you an example

93
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,240
you know that's a smaller form factor

94
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,160
it's got all of your main

95
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,479
alpha keys and and arrows as well so

96
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:39,759
right like that's that's kind of what

97
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,440
we're talking about so

98
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,759
i have several uh software engineer

99
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,600
friends who are big into the 65 realm

100
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,000
because they still get their arrows um

101
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,919
and that's what we're gonna build

102
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:53,360
today so i i absolutely tangent full on

103
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,639
that so i'm sorry andy about that but um

104
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,160
no absolutely do you want to walk them

105
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,360
through like all the parts and stuff

106
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,800
since you've got the setup going on i'm

107
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,960
just adding some stabs right now yeah

108
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,080
so so so um a couple of things so your

109
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,000
your mechanical keyboards are gonna come

110
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,320
with a few different things uh there is

111
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,759
a very uh

112
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,520
lively debate about what makes a thing

113
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,479
mechanical in in the community uh so i

114
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:19,120
will keep it very simple and will not go

115
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,880
like super into that

116
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,479
um but you have different parts right

117
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,000
you've got your keycaps which this comes

118
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,680
with keycaps this kit comes with them

119
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,840
and they are the terminal colored you

120
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,840
know with your black background in your

121
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,560
and your green text with green accents

122
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,320
and then you've got your case right

123
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,080
you've got your whole keyboard that

124
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,360
comes together and i've i've

125
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,560
intentionally pulled it apart because i

126
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,560
have to build some things but um you've

127
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,479
got your plates and you've got your pcb

128
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,560
your programmable circuit board

129
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,720
and to your point uh andy you know

130
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,160
you've got this interesting kind of

131
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,840
neoprene bottom here not only does this

132
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,600
add weight to the case because it is you

133
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,199
know an injection molded plastic to keep

134
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,080
costs down but also these kind of hex

135
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,479
shapes help with sound distribution and

136
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:00,160
also dampening so

137
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,680
that you don't

138
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,400
in in 2050 when we finally go back to an

139
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,400
in-office uh situation

140
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,400
um you know you're not annoying everyone

141
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,560
around you so

142
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,440
um

143
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,840
and then and then uh other other big

144
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,479
notable parts of the keyboard which this

145
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,639
case uh this this whole

146
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,360
package also comes with a cable so it's

147
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,919
a nice like coiled kind of vintage style

148
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:27,280
cable uh it's usbc so you know it's it's

149
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,919
not 1997 anymore so we've got usb a to

150
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:31,280
usb c

151
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,680
and then um the one thing that is not

152
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,919
included in the kit as far as i'm aware

153
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:37,360
is

154
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,120
our switches so mechanical keyboards

155
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,880
come with discrete individual switches

156
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,400
right so so instead of a typical

157
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,160
membrane keyboard where you're

158
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,000
depressing a piece of rubber that's

159
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,520
that's closing the circuit you have

160
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,680
individual discrete switches um and

161
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,039
that's we're gonna we're gonna put some

162
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:52,800
of those in today and we've got the the

163
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,520
terminal themed color way for those

164
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,919
as well so i'm doing i'm doing my best

165
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:59,919
to not like full on shill for the key

166
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,479
company i'm i'm doing my best to

167
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,080
educate you as well

168
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,039
um there are other parts inside of of

169
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:09,199
your keyboards and if you're if you're

170
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,520
using a mechanical keyboard or even even

171
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,039
if you're using like a membrane keyboard

172
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:14,639
the four dollar one that came with your

173
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,479
setup you know it's got all of these

174
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,000
same things it's got the programmable

175
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,599
circuit board individual discrete

176
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:21,919
switches and also stabilizers for your

177
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:24,240
larger keys so you've got your enter

178
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,160
we've got a full backspace here which i

179
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,759
personally hate we can talk about that

180
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:29,520
if you like and then shift keys and i

181
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,080
left spacebar undone so that i could

182
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,160
if anyone is interested in building

183
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,440
their own or getting into there i could

184
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,280
at least show you how relatively easy it

185
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,039
is to do that

186
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:41,360
so those are the main parts of your your

187
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,360
keyboard that we're talking about also a

188
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,560
lovely thing for those of you that

189
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,160
travel and still need something that

190
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:51,039
doesn't that isn't a um an hp laptop

191
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,000
keyboard uh it does come with this this

192
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,759
this travel case as well so that's

193
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,360
that's something that's nice too um

194
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,120
but remember it's not it's not limited

195
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,960
to just this one thing right there are

196
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,680
there is a massive thriving

197
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,720
business around custom keyboards in this

198
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,400
hobby and you know all different kinds

199
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,560
of form factors i showed you 65 this

200
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,599
right here is like an ergonomic 40 so

201
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:18,000
it's removed the number row there's no f

202
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,840
row apparently my camera thinks that

203
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,800
that is a face so that's cool um

204
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,479
we have like full ergonomic with with

205
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:29,360
the with the number row but no f keys

206
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,160
right

207
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,919
um

208
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:33,839
we have i'm sorry and i'm just using my

209
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,399
own personal boards now so we've got uh

210
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:39,440
a traditional 60 with arrows and a

211
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,958
numpad if you need that if you're in

212
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,559
excel

213
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,959
we've got the sexy 60

214
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,959
everybody loves that we got some hebrew

215
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:47,920
here

216
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,399
and then a personal favorite of mine

217
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,800
because it's a set i designed we've got

218
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,399
a tkl this is

219
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,480
every gamer's friend a tkl we've got

220
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,000
some artisans here you know we're doing

221
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,839
that so

222
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,440
lots of different options andy i've

223
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,720
talked for six minutes i think

224
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,760
what thoughts or comments

225
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,839
yeah yeah absolutely i think that

226
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:14,160
definitely explains the game of a quick

227
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,000
customization uh

228
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,600
examples that you can do maybe maybe

229
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,080
it's good to start with uh why why

230
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,320
bother and like where jesus where did

231
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,080
where did custom keyboards come from

232
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,399
into like a a multi-vendor

233
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,200
um high beast driven

234
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,560
like

235
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,240
clout like

236
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,279
the tldr or or nerd response which one

237
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:36,959
would you prefer i mean you know it's

238
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,560
like we got defcon people watching you

239
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,399
might as well get monkey details okay so

240
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,560
so so there is there is this situation

241
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,480
that has happened uh with mechanical

242
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,040
keyboards specifically where you harken

243
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,519
back specifically to vintage keyboards

244
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,680
right um if you're if you're someone

245
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,839
who's been in the game for a while or

246
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,880
you grew up as a gen xer or a millennial

247
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,240
and and the internet was either

248
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,160
blossoming around you or computers

249
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,160
became more and more accessible for you

250
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,959
um at the time you had these

251
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:07,279
incredible keyboards at your disposal

252
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:09,760
you had ibm beam spring computers if

253
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,440
you're on the earlier end of gen x you

254
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,920
had all of your model m like all of your

255
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,600
buckling spring that that really

256
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,360
satisfying like typing feeling and sound

257
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,440
that just kind of was ubiquitous for

258
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,720
your experience associated with a

259
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,760
computer right so then we

260
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,320
came of age and we got to our office

261
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,279
setting and they said here is an hp

262
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:32,560
rubber dome

263
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,519
that sounds and feels like you're typing

264
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,279
on rotten

265
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:40,480
over soggy rice so enjoy your work

266
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,880
experience now but we we took typing

267
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,200
classes and all through our lives we use

268
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,880
these great keyboards so that's kind of

269
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,320
where the genesis of like being obsessed

270
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,320
with with like wanting a better keyboard

271
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,440
came from

272
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,720
um

273
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,360
and and so it really was until about

274
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,360
like 2016 2017 was like a super niche

275
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,320
hobby

276
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,079
um but then

277
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,320
uh gamers kind of picked up on it right

278
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,040
because because you could customize

279
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,880
weights of springs for individual

280
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,959
switches and really kind of get into

281
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:14,800
that so then it was like oh okay i like

282
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,240
a lighter switch because that actuates

283
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,440
better that makes me a better gamer i'm

284
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,320
gonna put quotes around that because

285
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,360
it's ridiculous um but anyways well you

286
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,519
had the whole like you know the hhkb the

287
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,680
duck saver like the whole korean market

288
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,480
too

289
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,480
yeah i mean obviously obviously like

290
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,880
outside of the u.s like you have a

291
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,360
massive massive market

292
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,120
associated with keyboards esp like

293
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,000
korean customs especially are super

294
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,160
important and super desired because

295
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,240
their attention and focus early on in

296
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,519
the career

297
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,040
really really made

298
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,880
part of what the community is what it is

299
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,680
now

300
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,880
um

301
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,560
and and i mean there's there's over a

302
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,720
billion people in china and many many

303
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,079
many people

304
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,079
in you know metro

305
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:01,440
china use

306
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,880
some form of of keyboard right so uh

307
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,560
there's there's a big big big market

308
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,079
there so much so that you know we're

309
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:10,079
getting requests for adding more chinese

310
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:12,720
vendors for certain things because

311
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,200
you know there are almost aren't enough

312
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,720
right well yeah that that's a good place

313
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,320
to take this conversation next right so

314
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,320
like now that we kind of know okay you

315
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,880
know where it came from and kind of why

316
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,959
all of this rampant customization for

317
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,560
you know i mean even in the last year

318
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,160
right like getting getting matching

319
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,079
colored stabilizers like these green

320
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,519
things we're putting on these pcbs right

321
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,120
now and like you know every switch color

322
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,200
under the sun was not a thing and many

323
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,519
people think that you know mx

324
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:39,360
mx style switches are just like that

325
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,639
like that is

326
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:43,279
a keyboard switch right but like a lot

327
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:45,680
of this started from uh people doing

328
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,279
google form group buys where they say

329
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:48,639

they're like okay well uh i need to find

335
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,760
enough people that i can split the cost

336
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,079
of manufacturing or a point where it

337
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:06,240
where it's not massively expensive right

338
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,079
and and from there

339
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,320
you had a couple uh

340
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,240
internet vendors like online stores if

341
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,720
you will pick that up and say hey uh we

342
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,639
can we can kind of officiate this and we

343
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:18,399
can we can do this in a manner where

344
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,800
it's not you know paypal goods and

345
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,240
services to make sure you can file a

346
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,440
complaint if you never get what you

347
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,880
bought and like you know that was like

348
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,639
you know your novel keys and your dixie

349
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,959
mech which is now omni type rebranded um

350
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,120
and then from there like

351
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,320
there was really i want to say in the

352
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,880
last five years specifically just an

353
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,440
absolute explosion of options and

354
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,760
vendors and you know community members

355
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,120
coming together like you know for those

356
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,560
of you if i've got like my keyboard

357
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,160
folks in chat right now like you guys

358
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,160
remember box gate and like you know

359
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,440
we're box switches we're cracking

360
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,800
everybody's stems and someone in the

361
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,199
community is like yo i uh

362
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:53,120
i mean i 3d model like i can design

363
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,399
something and like

364
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:55,760
i think within a month they had like a

365
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,440
metal like this metal

366
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,199
stem shaver yeah i remember that they

367
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:00,959
have everybody's stems like but but like

368
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,320
the community's like that just on

369
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,760
steroids about everything and you know

370
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,000
that harkens back to like

371
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,800
the plank right and and you know the the

372
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,360
roots there and qmk that went back there

373
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,639
yeah like

374
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:14,240
you know you go from the plank and jack

375
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,199
jack

376
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:16,480
who you know did

377
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,720
qmk and uh

378
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,399
really set a standard for the community

379
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:21,680
as far as

380
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,120
firmware and

381
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,959
and it kind of just took off from there

382
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,160
where

383
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,600
people just couldn't get enough i mean

384
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,360
to the point now where if you join an

385
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,959
officiated group buying on some place

386
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,839
like canon keys or the key company or

387
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,120
you know wherever granite the key

388
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,880
company um

389
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,360
um i don't think runs gmk sets very

390
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,440
often but they don't they don't like it

391
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,240
is backed up for like a year like a year

392
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,560
for production times yeah like that's

393
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,480
how popular it's gotten which is just

394
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,720
crazy

395
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,880
it's

396
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,839
how to how to uh wade into that water um

397
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:59,680
yeah the one thing i think the main

398
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,240
takeaway from all of the insanity that

399
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,320
we're kind of breezing over right now is

400
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,120
that

401
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,639
there are many

402
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,040
many i mean i mean well over a million

403
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,920
people that are weirdly obsessed with

404
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,240
keyboards and it's not just from like an

405
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,079
aesthetic thing although you know some

406
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:17,760
folks are very focused solely on

407
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,160
aesthetics it's really a i have this

408
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,560
tool i use every day i would like to be

409
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,120
able to customize it in the most

410
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,880
efficient or or lovely way for me

411
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,320
possible right

412
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,360
and that's kind of where it has

413
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,800
blossomed there is a very high

414
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,720
preponderance of software engineers that

415
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,199
are in the custom keyboard hobby i

416
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:37,199
myself am a professional

417
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,199
learning i'm an instructional designer

418
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:41,519
um so i'm typing a lot of copy and

419
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:43,360
scripting a lot of the day so i think

420
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,279
it's folks that are using that tool

421
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,880
frequently um

422
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,360
but the reason that i say that is

423
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,000
like this we are talking about this

424
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,320
right now in the event that you have a

425
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,639
disposable income that you want to do

426
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,399
something like this right like here are

427
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,160
the parts of a keyboard at a high level

428
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,880
you can have basically anything you ever

429
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,800
want and if it doesn't already exist the

430
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,959
community is probably trying to do that

431
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,360
like you know it's

432
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,320
like

433
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,880
custom steno keyboards yup like that's a

434
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,639
thing you know uh if you want to type

435
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,480
super fast if you you know you've got

436
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,839
your hkb

437
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:20,000
uh blocks i specifically didn't show off

438
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,440
my hhkb because i hate it personally

439
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,880
yeah i know you're not i know you're not

440
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,240
a topper fan

441
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,759
i know you don't like rubber domes i

442
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:29,839
know that's not your thing uh

443
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:33,040
that said it is an exceptionally

444
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,040
favorite keyboard of the community so

445
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,959
yeah my

446
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:38,880
that's what the hobby is like all about

447
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,720
is about preference right like right now

448
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,639
i'm lubing stabilizers to make sure they

449
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:45,040
don't sound a certain way which most of

450
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,480
the community does

451
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,360
um but i'm using

452
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,480
lube that almost no one does uh also i

453
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,480
think that we should mention for those

454
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,920
that aren't

455
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,160
knowledgeable about custom keyboards

456
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,320
when we talk when we say things like qmk

457
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,920
we're talking about the protocol for

458
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,240
which we're we're programming the the

459
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,160
pcbs right the programmable circuit

460
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,199
boards um when i say lube i don't mean

461
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:12,400
special time i mean a lubricant for

462
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,079
uh mechanical parts inside of our

463
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,000
keyboards um yeah

464
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,319
so it's it's important i think that i

465
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,640
make those distinctions um

466
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,640
because this is probably a good time to

467
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,799
kind of transition into like what what

468
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:26,319
what is the process like what are these

469
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,679
parts we're using what is the process

470
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,679
for building these boards and like

471
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:30,799
why like

472
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,240
why is there modding why don't they why

473
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,679
doesn't it just come sold that way and

474
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,679
like you know um and i think a good

475
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:38,000
start to that is is to say you know

476
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,840
uh a lot of what we're building right

477
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,600
now um is kind of standing on the

478
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,200
shoulders of giants and that you have a

479
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,280
kit that normally uh when you get a

480
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,600
group buy and you buy a board it shows

481
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,799
up with

482
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,120
a kit that contains

483
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,240
um

484
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,880
a range of of extra parts but normally

485
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,160
at minimum

486
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,919
a pcb

487
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:00,160
such as the one you see that i'm holding

488
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,039
now

489
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:04,480
a case for that to go into and then a

490
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,240
plate

491
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,679
these can be all kinds of different

492
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,000
styles they could be integrated into the

493
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,640
top of the case they can be some some

494
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,120
sort of what's called top mount system

495
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,160
wherein

496
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,240
the pcb

497
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,320
accepts the mx switches or the op

498
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,440
switches if that's what you're using

499
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,200
through the plate and then is secured to

500
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,360
the bottom of the case through screws

501
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,080
that screw through both of these pieces

502
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,559
and then as a recent we talked about uh

503
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:31,760
in the last five years there's been like

504
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,240
a rampant explosion of of all kinds of

505
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,880
just different preference driven things

506
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,600
for more more flex feel or a firmer feel

507
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,640
or like a sound profile and out of that

508
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,240
want for extreme niche personalization

509
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,080
has come a lot of these components that

510
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,600
you're seeing now you know that have

511
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,320
like um these sandwich mount types or

512
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,320
some have gasket mounts or some are a

513
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,520
hybrid mounting style full isolation or

514
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,600
burger or like i don't i don't know the

515
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,600
difference anymore like i live and

516
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,360
breathe the hobby and i can't keep up

517
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,280
like yeah i mean the memes are bound

518
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,320
really like

519
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,720
in terms of in terms of all of that and

520
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,400
and on top of that um it seems like

521
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,919
everyone is opening a store to sell

522
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:13,039
switches

523
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:14,720
and uh

524
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,640
switch openers and like lubrication

525
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,320
stands and like

526
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,720
there's some oddly feverishly hot wants

527
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,120
to come out with like the next you know

528
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,760
the next thing in the community um off

529
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,240
of what just came out you

530
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,440
you accidentally gave me such a good

531
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,480
segue

532
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,480
into a conversation that happens in the

533
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,080
community very frequently especially as

534
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,720
a professional learning person myself

535
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,600
uh

536
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:43,919
there is an extremely steep curve

537
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:46,080
that is getting into the hobby outside

538
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,480
of just like buying a a

539
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,400
relatively very easy kit like this this

540
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,840
is hot swap so you just push your

541
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,600
switches that you've chosen in there you

542
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,039
don't have to lube your switches all of

543
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:57,520
this is super easy but the second that

544
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,360
you start having conversation about like

545
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,840
plate materials is do you prefer brass

546
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,799
or fr4 or a or stacked acrylic like all

547
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:07,600
of this stuff then it it goes from zero

548
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:11,200
to a billion very quickly so um

549
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,039
that in store

550
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:16,080
uh you know again she'll shill company

551
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,600
uh they have they have kind of an

552
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,960
introduction to keyboards 101 um if

553
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,320
you're interested in that kind of a

554
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,280
resource

555
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,240
also many folks just kind of learned

556
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:30,000
through discord or the rmk or excuse me

557
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,360
reddit r mechanical keyboards forum um

558
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,039
you know there's there's no right or

559
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:36,799
wrong way to do things uh asking

560
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:38,159
questions and watching streams is

561
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:40,960
typically the best um but

562
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,039
yeah i just

563
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:45,840
if if you have time or are looking for a

564
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,679
hobby or want to customize your typing

565
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:48,400
experience

566
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,559
not only can you do all of that yourself

567
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:51,520
there are

568
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,720
many many nerds such as myself that will

569
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,799
help you in that journey and would love

570
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:58,960
to do that so if if this is something

571
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,520
that you're like golly geez

572
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,919
i sure do want to do that it's you know

573
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:06,320
you don't have to do it alone or or or

574
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,400
just you you know yeah

575
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,400
um yeah i built many a board for people

576
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,480
who were you know in one of the social

577
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,559
areas and like yeah i you know

578
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,320
don't know if i want hot swap or not but

579
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,000
i also don't want to solder anything and

580
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,280
i'm like well don't let that stop you

581
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,480
like i'll like send it to me i'll just

582
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,600
build it and send it back to you like

583
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,400
that's fine yeah um

584
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,039
yeah and it's it's also uh

585
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:29,600
kind of kind of it depends on

586
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,880
what kind of boards you get right it's

587
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,880
like the boards we're building today um

588
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,559
have hot swap components which means on

589
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:36,640
the bottom of this pcb they've got these

590
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,520
um kale style exceptional

591
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,360
zoom in on mine

592
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,760
uh yeah so they'll they'll take the the

593
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,880
pins that you have on um those keyboard

594
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,480
switches right and they'll complete the

595
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,520
circuit on the pcb and another way to do

596
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,600
that is is to just literally solder them

597
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,760
on a pcb that you

598
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,679
get with a kit that

599
00:21:57,679 --> 00:21:59,840
does not have hot swap sockets and a

600
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,520
third option for that

601
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,440
is what's called mill max sockets um and

602
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,840
those are basically like metal sleeved

603
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,520
housings that go into um these

604
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,960
pin receptors

605
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,720
are you right over there man yeah i i'm

606
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,559
sorry you said milmax and i had a little

607
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:16,880
bit of a reaction i'm sorry i just you

608
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,600
don't like milmax oh so so my problem

609
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,520
with milmax is that

610
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,480
unless you are

611
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,400
good at soldering already

612
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,640
mail max will make your life

613
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,960
horrifyingly terrible like you're going

614
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,039
to have a couple bad a couple of bad

615
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:34,799
joints like

616
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:36,400
we'll do we'll do it in the in i'll try

617
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,159
and put it on my camera so like

618
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:39,280
at the bottom

619
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,240
you have hot swap super easy and then

620
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,240
like slightly above that soldering it

621
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,320
like the the electrical

622
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,080
requirements for soldering a keyboard

623
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,799
are exceptionally uh resilient and very

624
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:53,520
forgiving and then right up here at the

625
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,000
very top of the hell escape that is

626
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,960
keyboard world is milmaxing a keyboard

627
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,480
to make it hot swap so as a beginner

628
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,120
i don't recommend them and although i

629
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,480
know you were just saying that's an

630
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,440
option i felt like i had a duty to

631
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,120
inform everyone

632
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,679
that golly geez i don't recommend that

633
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:16,640
uh sure not up the gate

634
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,640
yeah so like back to preference practice

635
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,000
preference right that's the thing that i

636
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,640
prefer because yes uh i can solder once

637
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,000
and if i ever have to take apart this

638
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,919
board for any reason like my joints are

639
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:27,840
already done and i'm not redoing that

640
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,840
work all of the time um

641
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,760
risking damage i've got a de-solder

642
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,240
station and i'm happy to solder all day

643
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,400
so like me i don't care about hot swap

644
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,600
like at all but i also stream every week

645
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,679
of my life so yeah you know it's

646
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:43,600
different different expectations i have

647
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,120
i showed you

648
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,720
what seven boards and they're all my

649
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,720
personal boards and there's another six

650
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,240
or seven just right there and that's

651
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,480
before we talk vintage like

652
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,600
there's different levels of the

653
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,600
community man like yeah

654
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,320
yeah

655
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,640
absolutely absolutely

656
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,960
um yeah so so up to this point basically

657
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,240
uh i know

658
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,159
lang looks like he's uh pretty close in

659
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:06,799
tow what i have at this point is uh the

660
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:08,880
stabilizers installed and these are

661
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,120
these are what are going to allow for

662
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,760
like the actuation of your your larger

663
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,480
keys in a manner that keeps them on this

664
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,320
switch right otherwise you would depress

665
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,559
this key and like your your space bar

666
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,240
has like pretty much a 50 50 shot of

667
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,080
just shooting right off this right off

668
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,919
this switch that would be here um and

669
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:27,279
normally

670
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:29,600
people use these for anything that is 2u

671
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,080
or larger that is to say that any one

672
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,799
switch position on these pcbs is one

673
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:35,840
unit

674
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,279
uh in size and any keys that are outside

675
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:42,880
of that single one um either alpha

676
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,960
alphanumeric or number key that you're

677
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,520
used to um are some number of units

678
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,799
larger

679
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:51,120
than one um yeah so the two u keys that

680
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,480
you're going to see on a traditional

681
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,360
keyboard are your backspace your enter

682
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,000
both shifts are larger than 2u your

683
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,559
spacebar and if you have a numpad

684
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:03,039
your zero key is usually or your enter

685
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:04,640
in plus it depends on what layout you've

686
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,760
got there but

687
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,640
um

688
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,400
yeah

689
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,360
yeah

690
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,760
yeah and uh uh andy i will i will

691
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,559
caution you to not forget your little

692
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:16,080
standoffs

693
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,760
that go

694
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:21,279
on the pcb because this is hot swap that

695
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:24,320
securely anchors your plate to the pcb

696
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,640
this is a rare option that comes with

697
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,600
this stuff so because there's no solder

698
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,840
that's literally connecting the two

699
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,440
we've got screws that are going to hold

700
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,279
these two pieces together

701
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:36,080
so

702
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,440
yeah so normally when we were going to

703
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,640
put these together if it wasn't going to

704
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,400
be hot saw white right what we would be

705
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,279
doing

706
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:43,840
would be on the back of these pcbs

707
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,600
right we would be purposefully

708
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,600
positioning these

709
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,400
um with the switches loaded into the

710
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,200
plate and

711
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,039
depressing down when we're trying to

712
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:57,039
solder to make sure there is absolutely

713
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:59,760
no gap between any of these components

714
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,240
because the one thing that we don't want

715
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,320
uh is rattle whether that's stab rattle

716
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,480
or that's like you know any any kind of

717
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,159
uh switch ping or

718
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:10,880
or sound notes that we don't want yeah

719
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,279
do me a favor if you if you're watching

720
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:14,240
this

721
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,960
and you have and like like one of those

722
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,200
traditional i got it when i joined the

723
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,400
company

724
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,799
plastic keyboards that they left on your

725
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:25,039
desk and you know you're just using it

726
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:26,320
because it's not a thing that care that

727
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,159
you care about just go ahead and tap on

728
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:31,120
that space bar a couple of times and and

729
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,919
when the 80 decibels of rattle happens

730
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:35,520
that's what we're trying to avoid with

731
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,480
all of this

732
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,559
so yeah and that's really why like um

733
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:42,080
typically with these stabilizers um up

734
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,400
until very recently these bottom feet

735
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,520
would cause um some issues that you

736
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,600
would have with that very sound we're

737
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,960
talking about so you you would have to

738
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,240
go in and clip these and people would

739
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,240
say you know why don't they just make

740
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,360
them so you don't have to do that

741
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,320
anymore that's what everyone wants to

742
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,679
buy and they are getting to that point

743
00:26:57,679 --> 00:26:59,279
but for a long time it was just because

744
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:00,559
you know they have those molds and you

745
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:02,000
can just clip them so that's what people

746
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,600
would do they would clip them and then

747
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,120
um they would put

748
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,039
their like insert grease of your choice

749
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:10,320
whether that's you know gpl 105 or 205

750
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,240
or crytox or you know whatever that is

751
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,279
into here

752
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:15,600
and it helps

753
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,840
it it's debated whether or not you know

754
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,520
based on preference you want to leave

755
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,320
your status but it's a pretty common um

756
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,120
i

757
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:26,960
i i don't know many many hobbyists that

758
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,880
are like gosh

759
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,039
lube and your stabs is dumb like it's

760
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:33,360
it's super rare it's super rare most

761
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,039
people tell you don't use band-aids

762
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:36,799
because you're you're yeah your keyboard

763
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:39,360
isn't hurt like don't use band-aids

764
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,640
uh also extremely diy to the point that

765
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,880
there for many many years was the

766
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,760
band-aid mod where it's if you want it

767
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:51,919
to not sound bad you caught band-aids to

768
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:54,559
put on the pcb so where the stabilizer

769
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:56,799
hits it doesn't doesn't make up an

770
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:59,200
undesirable sound i'll use that word

771
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,360
yeah greasy and desirable

772
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,440
grease trampolines

773
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,919
yes yeah so yeah and another

774
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:08,720
modification that um we we've done um i

775
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,000
assume you have i have is i've put

776
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,080
different kinds of greases on these

777
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,720
switches and this is what a switch will

778
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,240
look like when you've disassembled it

779
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,880
right and you use one of these switch

780
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,120
openers to then open the switch which

781
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:26,000
consists of a leaf spring

782
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,200
a an actual spring which causes the stem

783
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,840
to actuate up and down the stem itself

784
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,840
which is this gray part and then the top

785
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,760
and bottom plastic housing and these

786
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,559
have

787
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:38,720
uh little pins in them and and that's

788
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,679
the

789
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:41,520
that is the positive and negative

790
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,880
contact for the leaf spring uh which is

791
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,039
shaped something like a p right and then

792
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:50,159
when the stem of this

793
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:51,200
switch

794
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,080
um which i i believe the uh there should

795
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,240
be a guide um that's getting linked

796
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,840
that'll have better pictures of this and

797
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,120
walk you through all this that you can

798
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,840
use later um but it'll it'll show you

799
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,760
exactly what the difference is between

800
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,399
linear switches and clicky switches and

801
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:08,320
um tactile switches right and it's the

802
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:11,520
shape of this little bitty stem

803
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,440
on the side of

804
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,600
on the side of this plastic piece and

805
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,679
whether or not that is shaped

806
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:19,200
like a lightning bolt or a straight

807
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,880
linear curve

808
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,880
right and the degree of that shape is

809
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,640
what's going to affect

810
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,480
the feel of that switch

811
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,679
um

812
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:30,720
for five years and no one has ever

813
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,360
described a tactile force curve as a

814
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,600
lightning bolt until now and my brain

815
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,840
hurts with how accurate that is

816
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,360
yeah yeah

817
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,720
yeah and you know and there's and

818
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,039
there's like there's very hotly debated

819
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:46,720
like what you use on these switches

820
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,960
right it's like for me um my my spice

821
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,760
every time is 105 on the springs and 205

822
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,440
on the stems i'm not asking questions

823
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,360
i'm not seeing anything else now see i'm

824
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,440
a heavy girl i'm a heavy girl i put

825
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,440
heavy lube on them springs like give me

826
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,840
a 205 on the springs give me a 205 on

827
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:02,880
the on

828
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,120
on everything else because i use linear

829
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,159
so like i want smooth as butter but not

830
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:10,159
so much that it slows the spring down

831
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:13,039
which this is this right here and this

832
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:14,960
this is a shocker for a lot of people

833
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,279
this keyboard right here is my daily

834
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:20,080
driver i use this every day i work

835
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,480
i use this at least five days a week and

836
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,320
in it i have linear springs not a

837
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,240
surprise but the weight on the linear

838
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,279
springs is 150 grams and that's my daily

839
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:31,279
driver that's how i type now

840
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:33,120
your traditional gaming keyboards that

841
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,200
you get that has like cherry cherry reds

842
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,919
or whatever that's 55 grams so almost

843
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:40,480
triple the weights because

844
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,960
like why why else would i not type on on

845
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,279
that you know like we've got them swole

846
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:46,799
fingers right like

847
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:48,880
the only strong thing in my life is my

848
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,240
fingers yeah and and as if we haven't

849
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,880
delved into the the plethora of options

850
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,720
and you know this the seascape of things

851
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,919
that you could

852
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:00,960
customize add add infinitum right uh

853
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,279
switches oh my god like

854
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:06,159
you can change the spring the spring cur

855
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:08,000
like curve type you can change the

856
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,320
weight friend ben owns more than a

857
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,880
thousand variations of switches yeah in

858
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,960
his collection um

859
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,000
here's

860
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,480
frankensteining switches different parts

861
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,760
jesus my goodness my goodness um

862
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:24,960
i i think it's very important that we

863
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,320
mention

864
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:29,360
although we sit here and we are

865
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,080
like

866
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,480
dousing the world with knowledge about

867
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,120
keyboards we are nearly complete

868
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:38,080
building a keyboard like that like

869
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:41,200
it is much easier than it sounds

870
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,360
so like if your keyboard is not quite

871
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,679
there or you bought a custom

872
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:47,279
and you're like

873
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:50,159
i wish it did this instead like all of

874
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:52,080
these things are possible and that's not

875
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,880
a sales pitch for any specific company

876
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,720
yeah that is just

877
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,720
if you're not pleased with the thing you

878
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,679
use

879
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:01,760
all the time especially if you're a

880
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,880
gamer and also using it for work uh i

881
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,720
highly recommend that this is something

882
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,000
if you have disposable income that you

883
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,559
get into also yeah and i mean if you

884
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:12,240
don't you can take any board you have

885
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,519
now and apply some of the things we've

886
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:15,679
been talking about like the greases and

887
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:17,840
lubes and modifications and lining your

888
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,080
board with sorbothane or drawer liner or

889
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,720
you know any any number of modifications

890
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,159
and see if this is even something that

891
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:27,039
you enjoy or or quite frankly notice

892
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:29,360
those of you who have for those of you

893
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,600
that have purchased an hhkb right

894
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,440
because you're hackers right like it's i

895
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,360
feel like it's a requirement

896
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,600
to own the thing that says hacking in

897
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,559
the name okay if you take this apart

898
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:42,399
and you fill it you know you know that

899
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:44,240
like i think they call it like magic

900
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,159
stuff or the magic foam that you spray

901
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:48,480
into a crack and it expands

902
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,080
if you spray that in the back of this

903
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,120
case

904
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,039
it no longer is like this hollow

905
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:54,880
terribleness it it all of a sudden

906
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,559
becomes a better keyboard to use and

907
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:59,600
adds some weight and like structure so

908
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,159
for the cost of i think eight dollars

909
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:04,159
from uh from a hardware store you could

910
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:07,919
make your 250 keyboard better already

911
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:09,600
and what an exceptional segue to talk

912
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,919
about why why uh

913
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:13,600
people only seem to buy and sell metal

914
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,880
boards

915
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,799
with with big brass weights

916
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:18,080
that you can't that are engraved then

917
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,240
that you can't see with big brass

918
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,240
weights um hold on a second everyone

919
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,919
loves putting logos on you know on the

920
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:25,440
bottom of the board with with the

921
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,960
weights and

922
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,640
it's all about that heft and that and

923
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:32,080
that uh premium that premium feeling

924
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,559
with big brass weights well

925
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:36,240
sometimes it's not about the weight

926
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,480
sometimes about the board that you

927
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,519
wanted

928
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:41,679
oh my god my headphones right now

929
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:43,840
sometimes gorgeous

930
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,679
first joined

931
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:48,559
uh the hobby and you know maybe maybe

932
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:50,640
the thing you want has a literal clock

933
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:53,840
on the back you know because

934
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,240
yeah why not um

935
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,760
and even though the board sits like this

936
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,799
and i never see it

937
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,919
i wanted it because reasons right well

938
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:07,279
that's the same reason people you know

939
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:08,239
like

940
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:10,399
we we have these uh kiwi switches that

941
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:12,000
they that they send us to obviously

942
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,520
aesthetically match the board and the

943
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,719
same for

944
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:15,918
um these

945
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:16,800
green

946
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,000
c3 equal stabilizers that this is

947
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
right like no one's gonna no one's

948
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,599
probably gonna see the switches or the

949
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:25,040
stabs but like

950
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,760
like i know like we we know it's there

951
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,199
and and you know there are certain

952
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:32,320
things too uh such as like conventions

953
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,119
for

954
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:35,280
mechanical keyboards just like keycon

955
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,679
you know and and people go to those

956
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:39,839
specifically to flex like it's got one

957
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:41,119
in september

958
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:42,719
you know it's like a car meet of

959
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:44,320
keyboards people just show up they pop

960
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,159
the trunk and you'll pop the hood and

961
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:47,679
let everybody uh

962
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:49,280
know what they've been working on my

963
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,800
favorite thing to see in a keyboard meet

964
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,079
up is this where someone's like really

965
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:54,030
close in there

966
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:55,520
[Music]

967
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,839
yeah i like that yeah

968
00:34:57,839 --> 00:34:59,440
it's like when a dude starts a car at a

969
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:03,359
car meet up you're like yeah oh yeah

970
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:04,800
yeah but that's that's that's what it's

971
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,720
right like the the search for the

972
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:10,240
the like was it uh odyssian like the the

973
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,400
in-game just the perpetual ball up the

974
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,079
hill no

975
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:14,960
that's

976
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,359
that's something the sisyphean yes this

977
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:20,400
is that's the sisyphean task is trying

978
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,400
to find in game you know

979
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,880
that that holy grail perfect combination

980
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,400
of things

981
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,720
i've decided long ago end game does

982
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:32,240
exist but i choose to ignore

983
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:35,119
that i own endgame already because i

984
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:37,920
just like keyboards and want to continue

985
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,760
the struggle yeah

986
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,920
i've decided that my perfect combination

987
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,680
already exists and it's this keyboard

988
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,720
here it's this keyboard right here okay

989
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:51,359
i i love this i literally ruined it i i

990
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:54,640
patinaed the copper on this to be blue

991
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:57,119
because why not it's it's it's heavy

992
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:59,440
it's 11 pounds of a keyboard

993
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:02,240
because why would i not want that and

994
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:05,119
key caps fall off it has a palm plastic

995
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:07,680
plate with with very specific key

996
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:10,400
switches in it and arabic uh language

997
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,000
keycaps on it because i don't speak

998
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,119
arabic but it's beautiful to me um

999
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:16,720
and that exists as my end game and you

1000
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,079
know what i'm going to do with it i'm

1001
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:20,160
either going to continue to ruin it by

1002
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,520
continuing to mess with the weight or

1003
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,280
i'm going to auction it for a charity at

1004
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,520
christmas time this year and i'm gonna

1005
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,200
get rid of it like

1006
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,880
i hope somebody buys it for five

1007
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,480
thousand dollars because that is

1008
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,640
absolutely in the realm of the cost if

1009
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,400
someone would pay for these keyboards

1010
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,760
you could buy this kit that we're

1011
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,800
building right now for 135 shipped and

1012
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,680
then buy switches and have a keyboard

1013
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,839
or you could be an aftermarket whale

1014
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:45,680
that wants the one of one thing that

1015
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,760
exists and spend five grand on the thing

1016
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,920
and that is the gamut of the hobby at

1017
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,359
this point

1018
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:52,800
yeah and that's a perfect time to talk

1019
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,960
about like okay um most people enter the

1020
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,440
hobby through like they want something

1021
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,800
that's easier to type on or they want

1022
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,079
something that's more attractive and

1023
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:01,680
they search like where it goes click

1024
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,280
click that's why i joined

1025
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,560
yeah you know they get prepped from

1026
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,400
keyboards they find the subreddit you

1027
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,839
know and then they figure out that

1028
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:09,040
everyone who's selling literally

1029
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,800
anything related now has a discord they

1030
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,760
join those um you know mex on deck and

1031
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,119
top clack are great ones if you're

1032
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:16,880
googling along at home i highly suggest

1033
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:19,359
those as starter communities i also have

1034
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:22,880
a plug for my very good friend keebanoob

1035
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:26,320
newb she is fantastic

1036
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:29,760
and and very welcoming so um i also have

1037
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,320
a discord but my discord exists solely

1038
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,480
for people to ask when cafe is happening

1039
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,800
again so like you don't need to join

1040
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:40,000
mine like it's fine cafe cafe is a meme

1041
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,560
it's only brown olivia it's only brown

1042
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,119
olivia that's like that's another thing

1043
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:48,079
it's just the hobby is so big now that

1044
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:49,920
i've never seen a community more like

1045
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,760
just detail-oriented about

1046
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,920
stuff that just doesn't matter sometimes

1047
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:56,720
like pulling out calipers to test

1048
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,960
literal literal micro millimeter

1049
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,839
differences in things and then you know

1050
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:03,440
this isn't what i this isn't what i paid

1051
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,560
for this isn't what i got but that's

1052
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,079
what we're trying to do

1053
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:09,040
has a consulting business to match

1054
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:12,640
colors of keycaps like that is he he

1055
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,960
scientifically matches keycaps so that

1056
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,119
the end product is exactly what was

1057
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:18,720
represented

1058
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,320
correctly like

1059
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,400
like that's

1060
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:27,040
we are a community of nerdy nerds like

1061
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:30,560
it's it's not even funny yeah

1062

about who i am as a person okay so

1089

the one thing that the keyboard hobby

1090
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:33,520
has that i highly recommend to you

1091

00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:47,680
to be a part of it you can be if you

1096
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,839
don't want to hear it you absolutely can

1097
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:53,119
avoid it but i have entire discord

1098
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:55,760
channels devoted to just specific humans

1099
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:59,280
that cause drama like i am not kidding

1100
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,359
it's it's pretty much like just you know

1101
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:04,079
well sitting on the vegas strip and at

1102
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:06,319
midnight and just the people watching

1103
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:09,839
watching the kicker fan oh my god yeah

1104
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:12,400
all right so alone is like just years of

1105
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,040
drama in a human and i love it so much

1106
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:18,000
yeah yeah just just just wild

1107
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,119
um so at this point i've got the

1108
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:24,480
switches inside of the

1109
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,880
case and pcb and everything is connected

1110
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,000
and set up

1111
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,119
and then i've

1112
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:31,520
installed that into uh the case which

1113
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,680
was a two-part case with the screws on

1114
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:34,560
the bottom

1115
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,000
and and

1116
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,400

1118
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,640

this as far as what exact plastic type

1120
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:48,079

1121
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:50,240
pps

1122
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,800
based solely on the cost effectiveness

1123
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,280
of pps and injection molding yeah i have

1124
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,040
stats on like everything but plastic

1125

00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:10,640
i'm a pro streamer when that's a lie

1159
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,960
but i do build boards pretty nicely so

1160
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,800
if you ever need one help like i don't

1161
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,800
charge to build stuff if you ever want

1162
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,079
me to put this all together and you're

1163
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:20,400
like golly geez that's too much to learn

1164
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,520
you just

1165
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:24,240
send it to me i put my at as my name i

1166
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,560
on all socials that's where i'm at

1167
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,960
twitch the instas those are really the

1168
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,480
two i use

1169
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:33,200
uh discord a lot

1170
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,720
hey when you put caps on do you still

1171
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,480
like say every

1172
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,079
single key when you go across the road

1173
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:39,119
to make sure you put it in the right

1174
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:40,800
place i don't know how many boards i've

1175
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,000
built and you would think i have this

1176
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,680
thing memorized and i just don't i've

1177
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,920
been streaming for like 14 months now

1178
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,599
and i've probably built

1179
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:49,680
200 boards in my life

1180
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:53,440
um on and off stream and i still pull up

1181
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,760
my key tester to know exactly where

1182
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:58,079
every key is

1183
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:00,480
so i don't say them i just cheat

1184
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:03,520
constantly because um

1185
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,440
i'm a terrible human

1186
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:06,640
uh

1187
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:09,520
yeah and i'm not gonna refute that ever

1188
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,319
yeah i absolutely just you know

1189
00:43:11,319 --> 00:43:13,680
a-s-d-o-g-h-j got it

1190
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:16,000
you know

1191
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:20,319
all right we are nearly finished here

1192
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:22,560
yeah what what uh what what do we what

1193
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:23,839
have we missed so far i know we had an

1194
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:25,280
agenda worked out to kind of walk people

1195
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,880
through you know i had it pulled up and

1196
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,400
my brain just kind of went you know we

1197
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:31,119
didn't talk about we um do we have

1198
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:33,520
questions i can't see the chat

1199
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,599
um are there questions that we should be

1200
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:37,520
answering because check let me check

1201
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:40,960
real quick i i uh feel bad about that um

1202
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,880
one thing that i did want to mention is

1203
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:44,720
we kind of breezed over it earlier you

1204
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:46,560
know um

1205
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,720
the the thing that i think keeps me

1206
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,560
loving the hobby so much is the ability

1207
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:52,160
to not only connect with people but also

1208
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:55,520
give back so um you know last year andy

1209
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:58,240
and i partnered on creating this key set

1210
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:00,240
that is here on this keyboard now

1211
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:03,359
um and he did an incredible in most all

1212
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:06,480
of the work to be completely fair um and

1213
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,400
designed this lovely desk mat that we're

1214
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:11,040
looking at here inspired by the 808 the

1215
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:14,720
trs-808 uh rhythm composer and we and

1216
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,720
through that got to donate

1217
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:19,280
to seven thousand dollars to a charity

1218
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:21,520
called the children's music fund um

1219
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:24,160
their website is the cmf.org

1220
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:26,160
if you are in california or you like

1221
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:28,720
children or like helping sick children i

1222
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:30,800
highly recommend you go to them um they

1223
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:33,839
actually do music therapy with with

1224
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:36,720
children who have to be in hospitals for

1225
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:39,760
extended periods of time so to kind of

1226
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,760
cut the monotony of their lives and

1227
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:44,079
maybe enrich them they give lessons they

1228
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:45,680
they play music for them they give

1229
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,760
concerts um you know they have a small

1230
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,680
budget of about forty one thousand

1231
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:50,800
dollars a year and they're extremely

1232
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:53,680
highly rated in terms of funds going to

1233
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:55,760
the actual uh thing that they say

1234
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:56,880
they're going to do

1235
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,880
um so

1236
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:00,880
you know we we likely will be doing

1237
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,640
another run of the 808 set so you can

1238
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:04,079
get a key set and donate at the same

1239
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:06,800
time but if you just like to give money

1240
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:09,119
to good things or good people

1241
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:11,040
you know the community helped us do that

1242
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:12,880
but i also urge you to at least check

1243
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:13,920
them out especially if you're in

1244
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,119
southern california that's where they do

1245
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:18,319
most of their operations um that's

1246
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:19,920
that's really the main thing i wanted to

1247
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:24,079
talk about aside from keyboards today so

1248
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:25,760

1250
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:28,960

like an absolute uh

1252
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,920

1264
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,319
is trying to build your first custom

1265
00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:00,400

knowledge uh but

1269
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:09,200
he is one of

1270

the most desired artisan makers in the

1271
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,200
community and even more so because he

1272
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:17,200
doesn't you know he's moved on from that

1273
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,599
now so um

1274
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:22,480

1275
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:25,040
makers i ever came in contact with

1276

but i do have artisans in front of me

1289
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:56,880
yours i don't have in front of me but

1290
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:59,280
like here's an example here's an example

1291
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:00,160
so

1292
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:01,599
speakers

1293
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:04,240
in collaboration with 808 because

1294
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:06,720
obviously 808s

1295
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:08,839
come out of speakers

1296
00:47:08,839 --> 00:47:11,599
um let's see uh just recently i got into

1297
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:12,640
a friend

1298
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:14,079
q caps

1299
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:15,839
he makes these blanks

1300
00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:18,319
that are just giant question marks

1301
00:47:18,319 --> 00:47:20,640
and i love that so much they're shaped

1302
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:22,319
like a keycap they're made of resin

1303
00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:24,640
they've got designs on them um an

1304
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:28,240
incredible one that i only have one of

1305
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:30,559
is hello caps and he makes little kits

1306
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:32,160
and little cats

1307
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:34,160
little cats and then lachry alum she

1308
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:35,839
makes these fun things that was a cafe

1309
00:47:35,839 --> 00:47:37,599
collaboration

1310
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:40,000
you know we've got jam jams and space

1311
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,359
jams this is a seal in pajamas

1312
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:45,359
named jam jams

1313
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:48,000
how amazing is that we've got space jams

1314
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,040
the seal in pajamas in a space suit

1315
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:53,200
because why not

1316
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:55,280
look at this little alpha keys look

1317
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:57,119
artisans are a whole thing okay and

1318
00:47:57,119 --> 00:47:58,880

well and funny funny enough um it's

1407

actually more blue than it is in person

1408
00:51:14,319 --> 00:51:18,160
it is it is very accurate to terminal

1409

extremely green gmk terminal or uh the

1410
00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:23,040
terminal caps that they've ran gmk i

1411
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:25,280
believe was the original colorway that

1412

to that

1414
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:29,599

1643
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:35,520
hey everybody how's it going

01:03:37,359 --> 01:03:39,920
being here today and i want to uh thank

1646
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:41,839
optic for being a sponsor for the red

1647
01:03:41,839 --> 01:03:44,079
team village ctf this year your support

1648
01:03:44,079 --> 01:03:46,559
really helps uh and it goes a long way

1649
01:03:46,559 --> 01:03:48,640
at uh allowing us to provide a big event

1650
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:51,119
both in person and virtually can you

1651
01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:54,000
tell me a little bit more about optiv

1652
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,480
yeah absolutely so to put it very simply

1653
01:03:56,480 --> 01:03:58,480
optiv is a pure play cyber security

1654
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:00,799
partner and what does that mean

1655
01:04:00,799 --> 01:04:02,960
we aim to do security all security all

1656
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:05,119
the time right we can help in ways of

1657
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:07,440
advisory deployment and even manage

1658
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:09,520
operations right so ultimately our goal

1659
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:11,280
is very simply to

1660
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:13,280
help organize organizations realize a

1661
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:15,520
more effective security program and

1662
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:17,920
posture

1663
01:04:19,119 --> 01:04:21,760
and uh for for both of you specifically

1664
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:24,160
what do you do at optiv

1665
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:26,079
so i'm a senior director inside of

1666
01:04:26,079 --> 01:04:27,680
threat management which is a larger

1667
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:29,280
umbrella but i specifically have the

1668
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:30,960
privilege of leading our attack and pen

1669
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:33,680
team um so my focus is on the direction

1670
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:35,680
of success of that team and i achieved

1671
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:37,839
this largely by enabling the great folks

1672
01:04:37,839 --> 01:04:40,559
around me such as mr reidelberg here

1673
01:04:40,559 --> 01:04:43,680
and i'm a technical manager under uh

1674
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:45,440
attacking pen my primary role is leading

1675
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:47,839
the adversarial simulation services this

1676
01:04:47,839 --> 01:04:48,960
is our

1677
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:50,880
branch that focuses primarily on red and

1678
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:53,200
purple team operations my role in there

1679
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:54,799
is not only executing these types of

1680
01:04:54,799 --> 01:04:56,799
engagements but also focusing on helping

1681
01:04:56,799 --> 01:04:58,960
to innovate the team and grow

1682
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:00,480
more operators to perform these types of

1683
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:02,880
engagements

1684
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:05,039
all right and uh and for the for that uh

1685
01:05:05,039 --> 01:05:07,200
attack and pen practice uh why do you

1686
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:09,839
like working there

1687
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:12,720
yeah so for me uh first and foremost uh

1688
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:14,640
it's it's the close family atmosphere

1689
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:16,640
that we have on the team and what i mean

1690
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:18,079
by that is i've been on the team for

1691
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:19,359
almost nine years now i've been an

1692
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:21,760
attack and pen the entire time and i'm

1693
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:23,039
not alone in that there are several

1694
01:05:23,039 --> 01:05:25,359
other individuals on the team that have

1695
01:05:25,359 --> 01:05:26,559
been here for a certain amount of time

1696
01:05:26,559 --> 01:05:29,280
such a such as matt himself so what that

1697
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:31,359
yield is a really good dynamic of folks

1698
01:05:31,359 --> 01:05:33,119
to work well together while we

1699
01:05:33,119 --> 01:05:34,559
simultaneously you know pursue our

1700
01:05:34,559 --> 01:05:36,480
passion about offensive security and

1701
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:38,000
just add on to that i would say in a

1702
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,240
single word the community uh the team

1703
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:41,200
itself

1704
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:43,039
honestly strives constantly to push the

1705
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:44,799
boundaries to teach each other new

1706
01:05:44,799 --> 01:05:46,640
things whether or not it's a you know

1707
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:48,640
failures from previous engagements to

1708
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:51,599
help educate for future uh

1709
01:05:51,599 --> 01:05:54,160
tests or even success stories it's all

1710
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:55,920
about sharing and kind of bolstering

1711
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:59,200
each other and through knowledge sharing

1712
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:01,280
absolutely and uh you know and a plug

1713
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:02,559
for that that giving back to the

1714
01:06:02,559 --> 01:06:04,160
community aspect you know i was on your

1715
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:06,079
github the other day and uh i was

1716
01:06:06,079 --> 01:06:07,440
looking into scarecrow and i know i've

1717
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:09,200
got that on my list to do a deep dive on

1718
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:11,440
after after defcon you know love love

1719
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:13,039
the fact that uh you know a lot of big

1720
01:06:13,039 --> 01:06:15,200
players in information security share

1721
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:16,799
that research share that tooling that

1722
01:06:16,799 --> 01:06:19,280
they create yep that's what we strive to

1723
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:20,960
do here

1724
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:23,200
and for your team um you know what types

1725
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:24,559
of people work there what are their

1726
01:06:24,559 --> 01:06:26,400
backgrounds

1727
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:28,400
so it's a good variety of backgrounds

1728
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:30,640
right so we have folks uh some from

1729
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:32,880
being a good part of us being veterans

1730
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:34,799
uh to business-minded folks to

1731
01:06:34,799 --> 01:06:37,039
engineering folks et cetera right uh but

1732
01:06:37,039 --> 01:06:38,559
like i mentioned earlier there there's

1733
01:06:38,559 --> 01:06:40,240
the ultimate uh

1734
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:42,799
commonality right of a shared objective

1735
01:06:42,799 --> 01:06:44,720
of offense and passion for offensive

1736
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:46,799
security testing and then what we

1737
01:06:46,799 --> 01:06:48,640
qualify that success really is helping

1738
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:50,000
leave our clients better than we found

1739
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,839
them at the end of the day and of course

1740
01:06:51,839 --> 01:06:54,000
you know folks have a very specific uh

1741
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,760
or can have a specific subset of

1742
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:57,920
interest inside the team uh that could

1743
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:00,960
be of iot to embedded to wireless to

1744
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:03,440
low-level windows stuff to evasion etc

1745
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:05,200
right so there's definitely some

1746
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:07,200
sub-pockets for people to really go mile

1747
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:09,280
deep on

1748
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:11,520
great and with such a diverse group what

1749
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:14,720
makes somebody a success in amp

1750
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:17,359
so aside from a technical acumen which

1751
01:07:17,359 --> 01:07:18,720
obviously is held you know it's an

1752
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:20,559
important quality on this specific uh

1753
01:07:20,559 --> 01:07:23,200
role right uh is the ability to show

1754
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:24,960
ownership and leadership and give back

1755
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:27,359
to the team um really you know owning a

1756
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:29,760
specific service or an offering uh

1757
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:31,599
helping others mentoring et cetera we

1758
01:07:31,599 --> 01:07:34,079
hold that in incredibly high value um

1759
01:07:34,079 --> 01:07:35,359
and then as we mentioned earlier with

1760
01:07:35,359 --> 01:07:37,359
regard to um like source zero and

1761
01:07:37,359 --> 01:07:39,520
scarecrow right is the the public

1762
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:41,280
thought leadership to help the team

1763
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:43,039
immediately and then also give back to

1764
01:07:43,039 --> 01:07:44,640
the community as well

1765
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:46,240
yep and just to add on to that i would

1766
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:48,480
say the eagerness to learn and improve

1767
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:51,520
your tradecraft um honestly the ones we

1768
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:53,359
see that excel the most are the ones

1769
01:07:53,359 --> 01:07:55,359
that not only focus on themselves but

1770
01:07:55,359 --> 01:07:58,160
also make sure that they help their

1771
01:07:58,160 --> 01:08:00,319
fellow teammates or co-workers whether

1772
01:08:00,319 --> 01:08:01,359
or not they're struggling with something

1773
01:08:01,359 --> 01:08:03,680
or helping to help them also pursue and

1774
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:05,760
grow their talents those are the ones

1775
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:08,000
that i see often have the basic success

1776
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,280
here

1777
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:10,960
that's great uh absolutely i mean this

1778
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:12,799
is this is a team sport uh doing what we

1779
01:08:12,799 --> 01:08:14,799
do

1780
01:08:14,799 --> 01:08:16,238
for the for the red team village one

1781
01:08:16,238 --> 01:08:18,719
thing that we we uh really love to do is

1782
01:08:18,719 --> 01:08:21,040
is offer a lot of uh environments for

1783
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:23,520
training we do workshops we we

1784
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:25,600
participate in a lot of different cons

1785
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:27,759
um and one thing you know we want to do

1786
01:08:27,759 --> 01:08:29,600
is bring as many people into this

1787
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:31,920
community as possible and so i'd i'd

1788
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:33,359
like to ask for both of you you know

1789
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:34,880
what is your advice for people who are

1790
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:36,640
interested in cyber security as a

1791
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:38,799
profession

1792
01:08:38,799 --> 01:08:40,880
yeah absolutely so i mean i'll speak to

1793
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:42,238
you know the path that i took to get

1794
01:08:42,238 --> 01:08:44,319
here and i think it holds true to the to

1795
01:08:44,319 --> 01:08:46,319
the question right but i think it's very

1796
01:08:46,319 --> 01:08:47,839
important or imperative for folks to

1797
01:08:47,839 --> 01:08:50,238
have a a deep foundational understanding

1798
01:08:50,238 --> 01:08:51,839
as to how uh

1799
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:53,600
things work right so what i mean by that

1800
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:55,439
is how does active directory work how

1801
01:08:55,439 --> 01:08:57,279
does networking function how can you

1802
01:08:57,279 --> 01:08:59,520
manipulate these things to maybe work

1803
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:01,279
outside the bounds it was intended to

1804
01:09:01,279 --> 01:09:02,719
right so that can apply to even

1805
01:09:02,719 --> 01:09:05,439
development web applications etc um

1806
01:09:05,439 --> 01:09:07,198
oftentimes i get asked by people that

1807
01:09:07,198 --> 01:09:08,640
are a bit younger and stay in college or

1808
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:09,759
whatever and they're like hey should i

1809
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:11,120
take this security class and become a

1810
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:13,279
pen tester well i would really encourage

1811
01:09:13,279 --> 01:09:14,880
folks to get a lot of those more

1812
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:16,719
foundational understandings just how

1813
01:09:16,719 --> 01:09:18,560
things work before they move to the

1814
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:20,399
stage of trying to you know

1815
01:09:20,399 --> 01:09:22,399
move to the adversarial emulation types

1816
01:09:22,399 --> 01:09:23,600
part

1817
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:25,600
yeah and i would just add to not just

1818
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:27,439
focus when you're learning on red team

1819
01:09:27,439 --> 01:09:29,759
tactics it's incredibly valuable in the

1820
01:09:29,759 --> 01:09:31,359
current landscape to

1821
01:09:31,359 --> 01:09:34,158
focus on both blue and red team having

1822
01:09:34,158 --> 01:09:36,479
that ability to speak both can really

1823
01:09:36,479 --> 01:09:38,960
augment your skill set and you know this

1824
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:40,880
is very much a cat and mouse game based

1825
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:43,759
industry and just knowing both sides

1826
01:09:43,759 --> 01:09:45,198
their playbooks can really help you

1827
01:09:45,198 --> 01:09:47,040
understand the strengths and weaknesses

1828
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:48,640
of both sides so when you're coming up

1829
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:50,399
against a red team or a blue team you

1830
01:09:50,399 --> 01:09:52,640
know what they are great at what their

1831
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:54,320
weaknesses are to really help plan out

1832
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:56,480
those attacks or even your knowledge set

1833
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:58,960
to improve on

1834
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:01,360
those that is phenomenal advice this

1835
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:03,600
industry is is a challenge because

1836
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:06,239
there's so much breadth and depth that

1837
01:10:06,239 --> 01:10:07,360
you can take

1838
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:09,040
not to mention that it's evolving every

1839
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:11,280
single day it's impossible to keep up so

1840
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:12,400
you've got to have that thirst for

1841
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:13,840
knowledge and and without that

1842
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:15,679
foundation it is quite difficult i mean

1843
01:10:15,679 --> 01:10:17,040
you might throw that exploit and get

1844
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:18,800
that get that shell back but then the

1845
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:20,560
question is what do you do next right

1846
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:23,440
and so uh great advice i want to thank

today is almost a wrap and um

1898
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:56,800
first things first i'm sharing the

1899
01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:59,600
leaderboard of the finals

1900
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:01,840
and guess what ai generator is in the

1901
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:04,640
first place and then followed by ep ept

1902
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:05,679
and then

1903
01:20:05,679 --> 01:20:07,199
by son of anton

1904
01:20:07,199 --> 01:20:09,040
but not by much actually the second

1905
01:20:09,040 --> 01:20:11,679
place is is held by three

1906
01:20:11,679 --> 01:20:14,000
three teams in there so it's pretty

1907
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:15,760
pretty rough competition

1908
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:17,360

01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:02,400
activities in

1932
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:04,239
in the discord channel

1933
01:21:04,239 --> 01:21:05,360

um honestly everything in discord has

1937
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:11,840
been pretty quiet we've had some

1938
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:14,400
questions from the the ctf participants

1939
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:16,800
and uh you know our team has been doing

1940
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:18,239
a really good job addressing them as

1941
01:21:18,239 --> 01:21:20,560
they've come up everyone seems to be

1942
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:22,159
cooperating with each other and not

1943
01:21:22,159 --> 01:21:24,000
abusing machines too bad and all that

1944
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,960
sort of stuff so i'm really happy to see

1945
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:28,880
everything going as smoothly as it is i

1946
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:30,159
know these things are always kind of

1947
01:21:30,159 --> 01:21:32,080
crap shoot you can't ever

1948
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:34,000
you can't ever anticipate the types of

1949
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,239
attacks everyone's gonna launch so

1950
01:21:36,239 --> 01:21:37,840
um everything seems to be running really

1951
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:40,480
