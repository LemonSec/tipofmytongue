1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,480
all right

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,720
10 seconds of white paper

3
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:09,280
okay

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,679
thank you so much for being here

5
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:13,280
today we're going to be talking about

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,360
healthcare innovation with people of all

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,480
abilities

8
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,960
and this presentation is all about

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,199
possibility

10
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:23,760
so with that in mind we hope that this

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,640
sparks some ideas around initiatives

12
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,480
that the different communities that

13
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,640
include disability medical device

14
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,960
manufacturers regulators

15
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,960
cyber research citizen science and

16
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,719
biohackers can collaborate on

17
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:40,640
and with that we hope you take away an

18
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,879
understanding of disability

19
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:45,039
universal design and accessibility and

20
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:46,719
we're going to be dis demystifying

21
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,000
disability and debunking some myths in

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,360
order to help you recognize

23
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,440
opportunities to extend innovative

24
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,160
solutions to people of all abilities

25
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,800
and with that i'd like to uh introduce

26
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,879
my co-presenter joel

27
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:03,199
hi there my name is joel isaac i'm an

28
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:05,920
accessibility specialist i guide

29
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,119
businesses

30
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:10,000
in integrating accessibility into their

31
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,479
digital experiences

32
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,280
i've been losing my eyesight for many

33
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,680
years and that's actually led me into

34
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,759
the space from being a full stack

35
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:24,159
developer

36
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:25,759
in the past that was a full stack of

37
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:28,240
developer before that was even a thing

38
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,119
i built uh medical weight loss programs

39
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:32,799
from the data all the way up to the

40
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:35,439
interface i also worked on some security

41
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:38,720
apps for nasa but i worked for about 20

42
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,240
years as a full stack developer

43
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,040
and what's interesting is

44
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,200
my educational background also kind of

45
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,479
goes into healthcare my thesis was on

46
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,880
how to apply a disease state management

47
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,360
to an online environment to lower

48
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,880
healthcare costs

49
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,280
and it really got me into thinking about

50
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,040
how different people

51
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,840
use software and hardware and just have

52
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,240
different experiences based on their

53
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,399
abilities and capabilities

54
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,560
and it really got me fascinated into

55
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,280
accessibility and it it's

56
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,000
brought me here today where my real goal

57
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,040
my life goal has become like how do we

58
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,080
make digital experiences more inclusive

59
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,640
how do we include all all kinds of

60
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,000
people

61
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
in a digital experiences so they can all

62
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,040
benefit from the integrations that and

63
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,280
adaptations we're trying to provide

64
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,840
to the public

65
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,800
you for that joel and my name is

66
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,160
piazzaragosa i'm a ux mentor at

67
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,400
springboard but i'm also an innovation

68
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,920
fellow and

69
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,480
i leave customer experience research at

70
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,120
a cyber security agency and i'm really

71
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,519
passionate about inclusive design

72
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:54,800
and inclusive research efforts and this

73
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,920
is something that i study a lot as well

74
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,360
as practice

75
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,239
and

76
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,640
part of the reason is is because

77
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,200
i think that when we solve for one we

78
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,959
can extend to many

79
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,959
and that is really

80
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:10,159
about

81
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,159
you know speaking to the possibilities

82
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,480
that that lie in innovation and when we

83
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,560
talk about solving for one

84
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,800
um you know this is really about

85
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,519
understanding you know for instance in

86
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:24,400
this case who's being excluded

87
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,239
and how we can

88
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,720
design better and research better for

89
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,959
those folks and making sure that they're

90
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,080
included and so i've talked a little bit

91
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,480
about exclusion and typically how this

92
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,640
shows up in our work is we're excluding

93
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,920
seniors

94
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,879
sometimes folks living remote and rural

95
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,840
areas women

96
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,400
immigrants

97
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,440
people with disabilities racialized the

98
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,439
lgbtqia plus two-spirit

99
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:54,480
groups

100
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,640
as well as low-income low-literacy and

101
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,080
indigenous

102
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,000
and you know i've mentioned inclusive

103
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,439
design and research and if you want to

104
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:03,599
learn more about this microsoft has a

105
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,159
really great inclusive design toolkit

106
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:09,120
and as well as what you see here is from

107
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,319
um

108
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,080
ontario government

109
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,720
and so i encourage you to definitely

110
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,798
look more into this

111
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,680
but yeah to me the the group of people

112
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,639
that you described it sounds the phrase

113
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,280
that comes to mind is traditionally is

114
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,880
the ignored and underserved

115
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,600
definitely and i think that this is what

116
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,280
it's all about and when we talk about

117
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,800
solve for one and extend money and

118
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,680
um you know there's just so much that

119
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,120
can be done

120
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,840
when we when we recognize inclu

121
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,680
exclusion early on and do something

122
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,880
about it

123
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,639
and with that let's kind of we've been

124
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:51,040
talking a lot about disability and to

125
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,800
really just go into this for a second

126
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,800
there's different types of disabilities

127
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,680
physical cognitive auditory and speech

128
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,520
and vision disabilities

129
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,919
and throughout somebody's lifetime

130
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:03,919
they can have

131
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:07,120
um one disability they can have many

132
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,080
it can be a range it could be permanent

133
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,639
situational it could be temporary but

134
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,240
just know that

135
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,960
these are just some of the ways and

136
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,520
naming conventions and groupings

137
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,520
then there's also universal design and

138
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,919
this is all about design that's usable

139
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:26,240
by all people to the greatest extent

140
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,039
possible without the need for adaptation

141
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:30,960
or specialized design

142
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,120
and this was originally coined by ronald

143
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,360
mace who's an architect and we think

144
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,600
about this not just in

145
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,000
physical spaces but also digital

146
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,360
environments

147
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,199
and then there's accessibility

148
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:46,479
accessibility is the measure of a

149
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,039
person's ability to perceive understand

150
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:50,960
and interact with a product service or

151
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,919
environment and accessibility principles

152
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:56,000
are essentially poor which stands for

153
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,479
perceivable operable understandable and

154
00:05:58,479 --> 00:05:59,759
robust

155
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,800
so for instance today i describe a lot

156
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,039
of what is on the screen

157
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:06,560
for someone who may have a vision

158
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,280
disability um hopefully this video will

159
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,639
have captions

160
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,960
so that somebody who can't hear will be

161
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,680
able to read and follow along

162
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,800
and so

163
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,240
these are

164
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,800
accessibility um

165
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,720
this is what accessibility is all about

166
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,039
is just ensuring

167
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:26,479
that

168
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,880
people with disabilities are able to

169
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,360
access the information or

170
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,759
um not just information but the

171
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,759
experience overall

172
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,120
and so with that

173
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,280
i want to share this quote by a

174
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,039
researcher

175
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,520
named lisa izzioni

176
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,600
and this quote goes studies of people

177
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,479
with disabilities show that most don't

178
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,720
view their lives as tragic

179
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,880
she added they figured out how to get

180
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,039
around in a world that wasn't designed

181
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,520
for them and view their lives as good

182
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,560
quality

183
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,880
and that's an important thing to call

184
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,319
out um that especially you know when you

185
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,560
see somebody who has a

186
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,319
visible disability but just also know

187
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,639
that there's also invisible disabilities

188
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,199
we can't assume the worst and we can't

189
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,599
adopt what something that is called

190
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:16,880
ableist

191
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,440
or ableism which is a bias

192
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,720
and joel maybe you can kind of uh

193
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,240
talk about that more

194
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,440
don't simply but ableism is really

195
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,199
condescending to people who you feel

196
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,639
have less abilities than yourself

197
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,039
in the south they call it paternalism

198
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,000
same type of thing i am the smart strong

199
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,680
person i will help you you poor disabled

200
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,120
uh poor weak person you know it's a

201
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,759
little bit it's a condescending attitude

202
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,800
but let's go back to visa i i totally

203
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,560
agree with that comment as i

204
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,199
lost as i've been losing my eyesight for

205
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:58,720
a long time

206
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,560
yeah of course it was frustrating losing

207
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,000
my eyesight

208
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,520
but i don't consider myself disabled

209
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,479
i consider the environment i'm in

210
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,960
disabling to me because it doesn't

211
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,080
consider my needs that's that's really

212
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,840
what visa is talking about here um

213
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,080
for me i i still have the same identity

214
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,319
and i have the same goals as when i

215
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,639
could see 20 20. i

216
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,400
you know these days i still

217
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,639
need to work i still need to feed my

218
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,319
children so

219
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,000
i it

220
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
eyesight may be an obstacle or a

221
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,399
challenge but it's not my identity

222
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,839
thanks for that joel and i think you

223
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:42,000
bring up a really important point

224
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,839
especially in the work that you all are

225
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:44,880
doing

226
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,640
to considerability

227
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,000
identity habits and preferences

228
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,440
and so let's talk a little bit more

229
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,360
about the landscape that exists and so

230
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,000
in the 2020 disability inclusion report

231
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,160
by the world bank

232
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:00,959
what

233
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,320
was reported was that 1 billion people

234
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,040
or 15 of the world's population

235
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,399
experience some form of a disability

236
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,720
but then there's also this notion that

237
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,720
people with disabilities are not a

238
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,040
solitary market and the centers for

239
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,200
disease control

240
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,600
mentioned that one in five people

241
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,120
for instance in the united states have a

242
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,399
disability

243
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,399
and then there's that four out of five

244
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,480
that care about them that

245
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,160
are their friends and family and part of

246
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,480
the communities that they belong to

247
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,880
and so with that

248
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,920
it's also important to note that in 2020

249
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,240
in the global economics of disability

250
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,760
report

251
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,279
this market influences 13 trillion in

252
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:48,720
annual disposable income worldwide

253
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,560
now back to lisa is yoni's research so

254
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,640
in the health affairs journal in

255
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,800
february 2021

256
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,040
she along with other researchers

257
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,279
published an essay

258
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,920
entitled physicians perceptions of

259
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,600
people with disability and their health

260
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,800
care

261
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,000
and

262
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,519
just to kind of highlight some of the

263
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,600
issues especially in healthcare

264
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,720
what was

265
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,399
mentioned in this essay was that

266
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,959
physicians associate disability with

267
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,279
worse quality of life

268
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:22,000
and that's a finding that may contribute

269
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,160
to care disparities for people with

270
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,920
disabilities

271
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,720
um and so just to kind of put an example

272
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,839
that out there that lisa kind of

273
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,920
mentioned um you know somebody who's in

274
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,480
a wheelchair that has breast cancer

275
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,680
uh may not necessarily uh hear from her

276
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,680
or his physician

277
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,640
um

278
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,040
about for instance reconstructive

279
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,399
surgery

280
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,839
um

281
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:49,920
and so with that in mind

282
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,160
i think that you know

283
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,600
the assumption there is that they don't

284
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,640
care about beauty or physical appearance

285
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,760
and so

286
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,160
once again it goes back to care

287
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,440
disparities

288
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,399
and it also extends to for instance

289
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,560
during the surge of the copic pandemic

290
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,640
in march 2020

291
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,560
the health and human services had to

292
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,480
issue a warning to healthcare providers

293
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,320
that people with disabilities should not

294
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,959
be denied medical care on the basis of

295
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:19,839
disability or perceived quality of life

296
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,360
absolutely pia so i mean it's it there's

297
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,480
clearly a

298
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,120
systemic problem in

299
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,360
health healthcare and just the medical

300
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,720
field in some ways in general

301
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,120
a lot of times people are considered

302
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,600
like clinical subjects

303
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,480
rather than active people

304
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,040
the reality is there's a lot of

305
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,040
assumptions made by healthcare

306
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,399
professionals

307
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,880
when dealing with somebody

308
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,920
in a patient relationship they treat

309
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,639
them more like something to be moved or

310
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:56,720
something to be fixed rather than a

311
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,440
person who has needs and has a serious

312
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,399
problem

313
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,000
that they need

314
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,320
to be heard and

315
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,440
considered

316
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,480
but

317
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,839
unfortunately

318
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:10,639
that doesn't happen but the reality is

319
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,480
everybody in the system the human

320
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,079
everybody needs to be treated with some

321
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:16,959
dignity and respect and be listened to

322
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:19,360
especially in a crisis situation that

323
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,959
many of our

324
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:22,720
our

325
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,720
wonderful medical people

326
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,600
are

327
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,120
always in the middle of

328
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,399
all right thanks for that and with that

329
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,279
let's go ahead and emboss some myths

330
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,519
um absolutely

331
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,560
so what we've been talking about so far

332
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,519
is pretty dry and serious so pia and i

333
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,000
thought we could make this a little bit

334
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,880
of fun by kind of putting this into a

335
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,240
myth busting model so we have three

336
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,800
myths for you today and who better

337
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,560
better to introduce the topic than the

338
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,920
cast of the popular 90s tv show the myth

339
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,320
busters so there they are decked out in

340
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,600
their leather jackets and and

341
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,000
pretty serious looks

342
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,320
taking stock of the situation and ready

343
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,920
for a challenge

344
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,480
and hey look at that guy with the braid

345
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,560
he's gonna be trouble

346
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,880
so let's go on to our myths period

347
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,560
what's our first one

348
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,880
all right myth number one people with

349
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,040
disabilities don't matter because there

350
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,480
is nothing that can be done for them

351
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,519
and so on this next slide what you see

352
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,920
is a vintage pin that says autistic and

353
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:36,880
proud

354
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,440
and along with the artistic network

355
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,639
international

356
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,480
and then there's a photo of veterans

357
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,760
protesting

358
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,880
and some of the signs that they're

359
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,360
holding say how about a brooklyn va

360
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,480
hospital

361
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,040
another sign is don't make promises

362
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:55,519
and then another sign says how dare they

363
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:58,720
take it away joel sure pia so

364
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,920
to me these images invoke a lot of

365
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,560
feelings and it really makes me think

366
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,399
about how

367
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,320
all people want

368
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,240
independence and autonomy they want

369
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,079
their rights they

370
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:14,320
want to be treated properly

371
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,760
so that pin for instance it shows that

372
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,680
even when somebody has a disability

373
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,279
they're still a person they're proud of

374
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:23,600
who they are so they're wearing that pin

375
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,639
because

376
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,720
even though they're autistic it's not a

377
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,720
tragedy for them it's something that

378
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,519
they

379
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:33,199
they appreciate and it creates

380
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:34,560
their identity

381
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,560
that makes them different it makes them

382
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,360
special and then pictures of the vets

383
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,800
protesting

384
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,880
who doesn't want health care

385
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,680
these are guys that want healthcare in

386
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,360
their neighborhood

387
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,920
they want to they they fought in a war

388
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,120
now

389
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,399
why not

390
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:56,160
have healthcare to to

391
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,880
help them with problems that

392
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,959
maybe they they gained during warfare

393
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:05,760
but and we look at this image and we

394
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,880
think

395
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,399
about the disability rights movement but

396
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,800
the disability rights movement

397
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,519
is

398
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,040
is an extension of the civil rights

399
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,839
movement it's it's really all one thing

400
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:20,720
even though we think of civil rights as

401
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,440
martin luther king and rosa park these

402
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,240
guys that you see protesting for the va

403
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,000
they could have just as easily been in

404
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,399
those sit-ins and and

405
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,320
those bus boycotts

406
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,040
and

407
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,360
we all have these needs and the civil

408
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,120
rights and disability

409
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,519
rights laws they aim at a lot of the

410
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,560
same things equal and fair employment

411
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,600
right to

412
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,240
access the public spaces

413
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,720
ability to free speech

414
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,399
uh just

415
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:51,600
it is

416
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,839
focused

417
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:56,800
on rising above discrimination

418
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,959
and with that let's go ahead and

419
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:01,120
transition into

420
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,079
this collage of different assistive

421
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:05,839
technologies

422
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,959
take it away joel

423
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,320
sure so

424
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,240
this is a pretty complicated image with

425
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,600
a lot of

426
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,600
interesting technology that you probably

427
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,440
never have seen before so that really

428
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,720
makes us

429
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,560
both think that we probably should

430
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:24,399
define assistive technology here so

431
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,480
it really is what it sounds like

432
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,199
assistive technology so it's technology

433
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:32,160
that you use to assist yourself in

434
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,639
achieving a certain goal right so that's

435
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:36,880
super broad and

436
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,720
in fact that's reflective of this system

437
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,600
technology it could go from very simple

438
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,600
to very complex like for instance a

439
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,600
magnifying glass is like this is the

440
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,240
technology and when you think about it

441
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,240
it may not even have a frame or a handle

442
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,680
around it it may just be a piece of

443
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,440
glass or plastic that when you put

444
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,360
something underneath it it magnifies it

445
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,360
you can see it easier

446
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,120
something more example of something more

447
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,600
complex think of some of these complex

448
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,839
wheelchairs that have motors or think of

449
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:05,919
some of these types of recognition

450
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:07,839
software that use ai and machine

451
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:11,199
learning to say for instance take a

452
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:14,400
image and describe it to a blind person

453
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,160
and then build up an understanding of

454
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,319
what the elements and the image are over

455
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:21,039
time and get them get better at being

456
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:25,199
able to describe surroundings

457
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,240
yeah and i think that an important call

458
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,080
out especially for

459
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,240
medical device manufacturers and

460
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,799
biohackers is to think about

461
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:37,200
um you know the next version of

462
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,440
assistive technology and also the

463
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,760
devices that are being created what's

464
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,160
the best way to integrate and thinking

465
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,559
about compatibility especially in the

466
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,000
research that i've done in the past

467
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,080
another also consideration is the level

468
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,600
of expertise

469
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,320
some people are very new in in using

470
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,400
assistive technology and some people are

471
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,600
experts

472
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,960
and sometimes there's just still more to

473
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,520
be done and more to be created and that

474
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,120
kind of brings us

475
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,280
to this next image here of somebody here

476
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,799
i want to talk about something just

477
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:11,520
before we move on here and it's a real

478
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,160
call out to this audience specifically

479
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,240
people who are hackers and innovators

480
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,400
and people who think

481
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,640
beyond the the narrow

482
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,360
scope of things like how do we do this

483
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,200
well the real

484
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,840
thing about assistive technology it is

485
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:31,039
the result of adaptation it's people

486
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:33,600
having a need for something this guy in

487
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,679
the wheelchair he's going uphill he

488
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:38,080
actually needs to adapt by building a

489
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,960
stronger motor or you either are

490
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,520
thinking about how you can adapt to a

491
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,160
situation to fit the

492
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,280
the place better or how can you create

493
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,559
tools that help you adapt better it's

494
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:55,600
really what has led to innovation in the

495
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,400
past

496
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,919
and we there are a lot of different

497
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:02,160
technology and devices that we think

498
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,360
about when

499
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,679
we think about the space if you've ever

500
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:08,480
used a gps in your car

501
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,799
that was really something that was

502
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:14,240
originally solved for by blind people

503
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,799
you're talking gps is something that was

504
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,799
originally conceived to help a blind

505
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:19,840
person

506
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,000
be able to navigate through their

507
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,600
environment without being able to

508
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,000
physically see a map and think of how

509
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
we're benefited here

510
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,840
where when you're in your car and you're

511
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,600
trying to get some place you've never

512
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,600
been before you don't have the thomas

513
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,760
guide on your lap anymore and you don't

514
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,000
have to worry about having to to quickly

515
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,679
look at the map and then look up before

516
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,919
you get into an accident now you have

517
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:44,240
this really nice voice

518
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,000
telling giving you the directions to

519
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,600
your next the next turn ahead

520
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,360
without you having to look at anything

521
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,960
you can keep your eyes on the road and

522
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,160
stay stay and there's tons of different

523
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:00,160
uh examples of assistive technology that

524
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,240
comes from an adaptation that's led to

525
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,960
innovation that's helped all of us

526
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,960
so ip i didn't mean to interrupt but i

527
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,720
thought that was a really important

528
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,440
thing that we needed to say here oh this

529
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,200
is such an important point and i'm glad

530
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,559
you brought that up

531
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:15,840
and i think that

532
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,000
one of the the things that you're seeing

533
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,440
here is

534
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,520
just experimentation

535
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,520
and also hacking

536
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,720
and this is a group of students at

537
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,159
the massachusetts institute of

538
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:30,720
technology during their assistive

539
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,440
technology hackathon because there's

540
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,360
there's a lot that exists but there's

541
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,039
still more to be done

542
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:39,280
and so with that um people with

543
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,840
disabilities don't matter because there

544
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,840
is nothing that can be done for them is

545
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,960
completely false because there's so much

546
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,400
to be done

547
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,080
um and so

548
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,640
moving right along to myth number two

549
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,360
cyber attacks don't affect people with

550
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,919
disabilities and with that i'm gonna

551
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:00,080
turn it over to joel to explain this

552
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,480
movie reference

553
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:09,200
so this is a

554
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,240
screenshot from the the movie war games

555
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,039
it's an old movie from the 80s in fact

556
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:17,679
it's so old that matthew broderick was a

557
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:20,559
teenager in this movie and he plays the

558
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:23,360
teenage hacker that accidentally breaks

559
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,600
into the department of defense and

560
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,000
thinks he's actually hacked into a game

561
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,559
company and he's looking at their their

562
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,799
newest games that haven't been released

563
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:35,919
but inadvertently he starts the nuclear

564
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,400
countdown and the rest of the movie is

565
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,200
him

566
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,440
uh trying to figure out how to stop the

567
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,240
clock and keep the world from exploding

568
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,039
and really that calls out

569
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:47,919
some of

570
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:49,760
the things that we have to

571
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,080
consider the consequences of just

572
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,080
focusing on innovation and not thinking

573
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,280
of the big picture things like security

574
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,400
and privacy

575
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,240
and thinking about how

576
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,600
people are diverse and they have

577
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,880
different needs and they have different

578
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,240
ways of achieving a goal one size does

579
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,679
not fit

580
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:10,080
so when we're thinking about a solution

581
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,760
we should be thinking about the

582
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,720
different fits of people and how

583
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,159
different people with different

584
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:19,840
abilities would approach something

585
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,280
all right

586
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,360
and with that um

587
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:28,320
here is a new patient intake form

588
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,080
yeah

589
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,880
yeah this is this reminds me of just a

590
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,000
lot of the security and privacy issues

591
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,440
that we

592
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,360
face when we're

593
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,919
in a health care situation we are super

594
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:44,400
vulnerable at that point that everybody

595
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,200
is

596
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,000
but

597
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,480
in some cases people with disabilities

598
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,360
may be more vulnerable and more at risk

599
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:55,120
just due to the nature of how

600
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,679
of their challenges

601
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:01,039
so think about in terms of cyber

602
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:03,520
security and identity theft a lot of

603
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,159
these intake forms are asking a lot of

604
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:09,360
detailed information that's what

605
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,679
really specific personal health

606
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:14,080
information or personal privacy

607
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,840
information that if it got into the

608
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,120
wrong hands

609
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,440
think about the consequences and one

610
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,280
issue that we've seen

611
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,320
come up is people with disabilities may

612
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,520
be

613
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,159
slower to recover from an identity theft

614
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:30,640
attack than somebody who doesn't have

615
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,880
any challenges think about

616
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,760
for instance a website that has credit

617
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,840
reporting on it that you can get your

618
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,840
identity back may not be accessible to

619
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,000
everybody and it may not be accessible

620
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,840
to certain specific people with

621
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,760
disabilities

622
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,840
additionally think about other things

623
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,440
like for instance physical uh situations

624
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,760
where social engineering could be used

625
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:57,600
against the a person with a disability

626
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,880
i'll give you a

627
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,080
scenario say a person in a wheelchair

628
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,400
rolls into their doctor's office

629
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,000
and it's their first time there so they

630
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,960
have to fill in the patient form

631
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,880
and think about all the information on

632
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,440
there i'm sure the the image that ps put

633
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,279
on the screen for that intake form shows

634
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:18,000
you things like social security so the

635
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,760
person comes into

636
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,320
the office in the wheelchair and

637
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,480
people assume that they can't fill out

638
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,760
the form so they want to help and of

639
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,480
course that's a commendable uh feeling

640
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,520
but they may not need that help and also

641
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,919
even if they do need that help

642
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:36,720
who's the person that's helping them but

643
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,799
is that person with a disability at risk

644
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:40,559
from that person who's saying that

645
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:42,400
they're gonna help oh sir can you give

646
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,799
me your social security security number

647
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:46,400
oh yeah and what's your mother's main

648
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,960
name those are two pieces of information

649
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,000
that could

650
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,559
steal somebody's identity pretty quickly

651
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:55,039
and this person in the wheelchair may

652
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:56,720
just think that they're being helped but

653
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,760
in fact

654
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,720
they're now a victim on a whole new

655
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,720
level

656
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,320
and so with that cyber attacks do affect

657
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,320
people with disabilities and sometimes

658
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,400
the consequences

659
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,559
are even more severe

660
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:15,200
and with that let's go to myth number

661
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,520
three innovation and emerging

662
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,679
technologies in healthcare and science

663
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:22,799
will save us all

664
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:27,520
so here you have nurses standing next to

665
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,600
different types of scales but the one

666
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,279
thing in common with these scales is

667
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,520
that you actually have to step up and

668
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,679
stand up in order to use them

669
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:37,360
turning it over to joel

670
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,640
yeah so

671
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,200
when i worked on the medical weight loss

672
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,159
application for for the company

673
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:46,960
they really were focusing on

674
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,720
health weight loss for people who were

675
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,360
morbidly obese so they really had some

676
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,159
great innovative scales that they had

677
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:56,799
created so one of the requirements of

678
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:58,480
the scale is that it should be able to

679
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,799
support a thousand pounds

680
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:02,400
and also this was one of the first

681
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,440
biometric scales that i had seen so a

682
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,440
person standing on the scale could hold

683
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,240
the

684
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,120
handles and then biometric information

685
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,279
would be

686
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:15,679
set to our databases and we'd be

687
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:18,240
tracking their water intake and just

688
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,240
different other

689
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,919
additional health care

690
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:24,080
pieces of information addition to the

691
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,919
weight that would all create a big

692
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:29,279
picture and this was a commercial uh

693
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:32,080
application of it so it was also

694
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,080
accessible in the way that there was a

695
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,720
big readout on the scale so if you're

696
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,640
looking at it from far away those

697
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,559
numbers were clear enough that you could

698
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:42,880
read them and also it made it was

699
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,400
accessible because the data it would

700
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,279
send out we could give that to you in a

701
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:49,279
list so you could see your charts and

702
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:51,600
you could see your graphs and

703
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,600
track your progress

704
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,960
we see this now making its way into home

705
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,440
healthcare for instance the scale i use

706
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,240
here at home now is a

707
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,440
low low emission bluetooth enabled so

708
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,120
when i

709
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,039
stand on the scale even though i can't

710
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:12,320
see the numbers that scale recognizes me

711
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,240
and then it's tracking

712
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,480
me and it's sending that information to

713
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,120
my phone so i get the tracking for my

714
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,840
weight and water intake and just like

715
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,840
the

716
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,480
weight over time like the fat intake

717
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,440
just different things my bmi it's doing

718
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,960
all this stuff but

719
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,000
it is an extension of these scales that

720
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,799
i was seeing 20 years ago there's a lot

721
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:40,720
of technology like this

722
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,320
and

723
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,399
the next

724
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:46,799
here is the scale tronics

725
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:50,159
and in this scale somebody is able to

726
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:52,559
easily be in a wheelchair in a sitting

727
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:53,520
position

728
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,799
and be weighed

729
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:56,720
yeah simply there's a ramp there and

730
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,919
that makes it accessible

731
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,640
all right

732
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,960
and in this image

733
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:08,640
there is a scientist um a woman who has

734
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,760
a disability a physical disability

735
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,720
um who is fully capable of doing this

736
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:19,360
work and there's this popular saying by

737
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:22,240
disability activists nothing about us

738
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,640
without us

739
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,360
yeah joel care to elaborate on that

740
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,840
i love it you need to have a

741
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,919
of the people that you're trying to help

742
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:34,320
without that you're just assuming things

743
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:37,120
and without the research you're out of

744
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,240
luck

745
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,520
it's it's just it's just luck that gets

746
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,559
you a successful product you're really

747
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:48,559
uh at real risk

748
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:49,679
right

749
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:52,320
and so with that in debunking myth

750
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,399
number three innovation and emerging

751
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,159
technologies in health care and science

752
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:57,679
will save us all

753
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:00,799
well obviously it can't save us all if

754
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:01,520
it

755
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,799
has anything related to exclusion

756
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:07,600
um whether that is a specific

757
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,679
demographic or segment

758
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:12,240
um or if it's the actual technology

759
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,679
itself

760
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:14,480
and

761
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,360
then there's also who's doing the work

762
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,919
and that is why early on we started with

763
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:22,159
this question what initiatives can the

764
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:25,200
disability medical manufacturers

765
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,399
regulators

766
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:28,720
cyber research citizen science and

767
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:32,000
biohacker communities collaborate on

768
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
and we started with this question and

769
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,600
we're also going to end with it and

770
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,080
hopefully this presentation gave you

771
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,440
more insight

772
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,399
to not

773
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:42,799
have inspiration but to actually have

774
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:45,279
the motivation to do something

775
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:47,360
um and also the provocation and with

776
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,799
that any closing thoughts joel

777
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,679
i think it's a community effort when we

778
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:54,640
have

779
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,600
thinking about overall community and we

780
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,600
have representation from different

781
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,320
groups like disability uh

782
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:06,080
medical manufacturers regulators actors

783
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,960
innovators technologists and just the

784
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,960
whole group of people thinking about a

785
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,679
problem together we come up with some

786
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:17,039
amazing stuff and we urge you

787
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:18,320
to to

788
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,480
build that community and think about the

789
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,720
people around you and think about

790
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,640
how we can do it together

791
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,480
all right and with that

792
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,799
we are so thankful for

793
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:34,159
to the biohacking village and of course

794
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:37,120
we're so excited to be a part of defcon

795
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,799
