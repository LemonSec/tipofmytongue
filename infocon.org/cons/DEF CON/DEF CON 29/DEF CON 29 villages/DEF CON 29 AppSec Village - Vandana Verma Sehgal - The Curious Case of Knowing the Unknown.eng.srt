00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:02,960
hi everyone good morning good afternoon

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,440
good evening wherever you are

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,759
today i am going to talk about a very

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:10,080
different topic at arctic village and

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,240
i'm so honored and privileged to be part

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,639
of apsec village again this year

7
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:17,199
um even though it's virtual but it feels

8
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:19,119
that i'm being i'm connected with this

9
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:20,720
village for so long

10
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,640
today i'm going to talk about the

11
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,840
curious case of knowing the unknown

12
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,480
especially the dependencies that we use

13
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,079
let me go ahead and get started with it

14
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:34,640
today's topic is curious case of knowing

15
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,960
the unknown especially the dependencies

16
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,960
let's get to know what it is and what we

17
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,719
are going to talk about today

18
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:43,040
bit about myself i am a security

19
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,680
relations leader at sneak i'm heading

20
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,320
the apg region as well as i root for pro

21
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,239
bono work wherein i'm one of the global

22
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:52,000
board of directors at pogas which is

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,399
open web application security project

24
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,320
i'm also on the review board of blackett

25
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,120
asia grace hopper india and few of the b

26
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,640
side conferences

27
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,879
i truly root for the diversity

28
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:05,199
initiatives wherein i run in for cycles

29
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,119
and for kids

30
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:09,360
now let's go come back to the topic

31
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,640
where

32
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,560
if we talk about uh

33
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,200
the basic or the usual application

34
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,960
security development life cycle that

35
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,080
used to be

36
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,680
through the waterfall model and few

37
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,360
other models that we had

38
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,600
wherein the development used to be done

39
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,680
it used to take some time to get

40
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,960
everything done

41
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,799
and then after six months or one year

42
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,640
the release used to happen but then time

43
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,840
has changed

44
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,280
wherein uh there is less of a playing

45
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,079
game wherein earlier every team used to

46
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:40,240
say that if there is a bug that comes

47
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,240
devs a security issue security says they

48
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,720
have issues or opposition op says that i

49
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,799
am nowhere in the picture

50
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,320
so that used to be a big big issue but

51
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,079
when it comes to security they used to

52
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,600
feel that oh this is something which is

53
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,479
a burden on ourselves and uh we're just

54
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,000
cleaning up the mess that has been

55
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,079
created by the devops team

56
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,759
but this is the kind of culture that we

57
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:04,079
need wherein dev ops and security all

58
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,399
need to work together to make sure that

59
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,720
we have a harmony in place

60
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,399
and we are avoiding all the critical

61
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,000
issues all the issues that we see

62
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,520
especially the breaches that have gone

63
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,920
to another level and i'm sure they're

64
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,959
gonna

65
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:18,000
rise

66
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,760
ever every day every month every year

67
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,560
the statistics we keep seeing they're

68
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,120
exceeding the numbers uh the forecasted

69
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,239
numbers

70
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,120
now if i talk about devops or devsicops

71
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,519
uh what it helps us in providing the

72
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:36,080
right observability uh providing the

73
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,640
traceability we it provides us with the

74
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,720
confidence that yes this is something

75
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,519
which we can achieve in timely manner

76
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:44,879
and it also binds us with the

77
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,800
compliances we have seen in the past

78
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,400
that there have been so many compliances

79
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,800
which have created a lot of issues

80
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,840
uh if i

81
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,760
talk about that

82
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,519
in the whole devops or devsecops

83
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,920
pipeline we all start with the ideation

84
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,440
process where and we try and do the

85
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,760
architecture review design reviews then

86
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,319
do the code review wherein if we do the

87
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:05,920
secure code review it helps

88
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,280
understanding the code better

89
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,400
implementing it better then scanning it

90
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,760
deploying it

91
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,959
testing it live on the production and

92
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:17,120
there are many cases wherein when the

93
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,040
testing is done on

94
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,640
a certain version

95
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,239
there are times when that version

96
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,400
doesn't go on the production but instead

97
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,560
there is something else that going on

98
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,640
going to the production now how critical

99
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,959
that would be how typical that would be

100
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,400
how problematic that would be

101
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,959
now if i talk about shift left is it

102
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,959
just enough saying that we want to shift

103
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,680
left wherein we are trying to enable our

104
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,519
developers we are trying to enable our

105
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:45,120
security teams we are trying to make

106
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,000
sure that all the teams involved are

107
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,239
curiously working on it making sure that

108
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,560
the security requirements are met

109
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,640
we are not vulnerable our applications

110
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,959
are not vulnerable and if i talk about

111
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,239
devops integration uh what it entails is

112
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,400
that starting from the beginning itself

113
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,280
we're talking about security and from a

114
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,720
code to

115
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,000
get repository to ci cd to production

116
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,480
security has always been like a gate but

117
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,680
how about

118
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,238
we involve security as an automation we

119
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:18,880
involve security as an ideation we do

120
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,519
all security as a culture wherein it is

121
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,560
not seen as an after thought it is not

122
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,080
seen as something which is totally

123
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,880
different from what uh what we have seen

124
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,199
in the past wherein we all are working

125
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,720
together to make sure that there isn't

126
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,639
harmony

127
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,880
if i talk about open source

128
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,440
everyone loves open source i'm a huge

129
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,280
fan of open source

130
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,759
but how much do we really know about our

131
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,919
own dependencies

132
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,000
this much this much

133
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,560
or this much but not the full

134
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,560
so we don't when we don't have a full

135
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,280
picture and especially if this is our

136
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,919
app and this is our code

137
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:00,880
how much of a code is open source

138
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,800
80 to 90 percent of the code on the

139
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,039
internet is open source and that much

140
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,919
code is open source do we have issues

141
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,560
absolutely we do have issues

142
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,520
we would be facing a lot of trouble

143
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,759
if i talk about containers

144
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,520
most of the organizations are trying to

145
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,320
achieve uh can train containerized

146
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,800
applications trying to build

147
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,840
all these things early and scale it up

148
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,000
at the faster pace if i talk about

149
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,520
infrastructure as a code that's another

150
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,720
thing which we have uh we started

151
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,960
leveraging and everything has a pros and

152
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,600
cons if we don't configure the

153
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,160
infrastructure code right

154
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,919
we're going to be spinning the

155
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:43,199
environment

156
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,080
vulnerable from the beginning

157
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,560
who can save us nobody can save us and

158
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,000
that's why there are services which

159
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,240
could help us in securing our

160
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,919
infrastructures

161
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:56,160
if you talk about supply chain attacks

162
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,400
they're on all-time high

163
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,199
and

164
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,280
the the latest uh

165
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,840
attacks they have actually created a lot

166
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,720
of issues wherein if i talk about

167
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,759
uh

168
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,840
these even stream vulnerabilities they

169
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,000
have been there for so long

170
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,800
but did we concentrate on them no we did

171
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,520
not we just go ahead and started using

172
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,600
them but then realized there was some

173
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,440
cookie data that was getting parse that

174
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,880
was used

175
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,520
for attacks now think about cookie data

176
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,600
is being used for attacks i can take

177
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,319
over as many accounts as what i want

178
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,800
similarly this is just a 40 lines of

179
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,360
code or like some 23 lines of code you

180
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,720
can say

181
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,560
and out of which

182
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,680
there is

183
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,840
some peace which is vulnerable are we

184
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,560
vulnerable absolutely we are vulnerable

185
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,120
and that's when if let's say while

186
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,960
fetching the cookies which is like the

187
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,520
basic function an application does it

188
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,599
uses a mail parcel

189
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:54,880
so this was

190
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,479
one of the parsers which was actually

191
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:00,880
getting downloaded half a million times

192
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,919
times in a month if that's a huge number

193
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,319
that is getting downloaded and if that

194
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,560
that meal parser gets

195
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,759
vulnerable

196
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,840
so that happened with this case wherein

197
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,160
the mail parser got vulnerable where the

198
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,160
attackers were able to put

199
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,639
the external dependencies to it which

200
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,120
made the whole code vulnerable and what

201
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,479
happened

202
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,240
a lot of victims

203
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,720
and that's when a lot of victims and

204
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,120
that's when we need to understand that

205
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,680
how many dependencies do we have

206
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,199
and especially

207
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:34,800
if one

208
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,319
dependency is fixed are there any other

209
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,319
underlying dependencies

210
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,720
for that which might make it which made

211
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,720
which might make our code more

212
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,919
vulnerable

213
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:46,720
so

214
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,520
uh

215
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,280
and it's not just with the application

216
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,800
it can be with the source code as well

217
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,240
it can be with the software as well

218
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,639
wherein we are writing a code for our

219
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,000
softwares and we're shipping it

220
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,919
everywhere and if it's vulnerable from

221
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:00,319
the beginning itself can we save

222
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,639
anyone no and that's what was the issue

223
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:07,039
with solarwinds that we saw and if i

224
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:08,800
talk about application security it has

225
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,240
become challenging it has become

226
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,639
innovative wherein we need to be

227
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,720
innovative to figure out hacks like

228
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,520
equal facts like this is one hack which

229
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,199
i always talk about why because we

230
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:22,720
we saw this coming

231
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,400
we've been using these third party

232
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,639
components these party resources for so

233
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:27,440
long

234
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,240
but how how much are we fixing about it

235
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,200
how much concentration we have on all of

236
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,399
these

237
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,958
very little i still see that there are

238
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,799
organizations who are stuck struggling

239
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:41,200
to maintain the assets inventory

240
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,519
maintain the application libraries that

241
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,839
what they have in our with what they

242
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:47,839
have in their own environment

243
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:49,920
what kind of applications they have what

244
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,440
is the underlying infrastructure they

245
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,760
have and if we don't detect fast respond

246
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,080
to it fast and do it at scale we will be

247
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,560
in trouble i still remember having those

248
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,480
sleepless nights when this vulnerability

249
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,959
came out from apache struts

250
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:03,680
and

251
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,680
if i have to say who to blame the

252
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,240
organization which got breached or the

253
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,399
the open source package

254
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,560
we can't define that the only thing that

255
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,240
we can do is when there is a package

256
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,560
which is vulnerable let's update it

257
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,360
let's keep a track of it and a chaos

258
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,880
engineering is something which can help

259
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,600
us really well in that what it is it is

260
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,519
a disciplined approach to identifying

261
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:27,760
the failures even before they happen and

262
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,600
all the outages that they have and

263
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,920
especially from the security perspective

264
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,160
it can actually help us it can help us

265
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,120
in a different way wherein we can figure

266
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:37,920
out

267
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,000
how

268
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,800
or

269
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,800
how the negative test can be performed

270
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,399
in an application how exactly we can uh

271
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,880
maintain the infrastructure environment

272
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,560
which can help us in tracking the open

273
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,200
source tools and which can also help us

274
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,959
in the automation because if we don't do

275
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,279
the automation right we will be in

276
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:58,399
trouble

277
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,720
we will see that humanly possible we'll

278
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,160
keep doing the things and making the

279
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,399
error but automation helps us in

280
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,079
reducing that and providing more

281
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:07,839
innovation at front

282
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,680
and that also helps us impeding the

283
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,680
compliance standards that are there

284
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,920
which are actually putting us at the

285
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,880
back seat think about gdpr think about

286
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,720
ccpa brazilian act and so many other uh

287
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,720
complexes which are there are they just

288
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,399
the checklist no they're not just the

289
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,800
checklist but if you don't need it meet

290
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,360
them there is heavy fine

291
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,959
and that's why we need to have the right

292
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:33,600
kind of monitoring to measure the

293
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,920
processes that that are there

294
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,720
and there are some use cases uh which we

295
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,320
which we can define via chaos

296
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,000
engineering starting with the incident

297
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,279
response uh then we have

298
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:47,519
security control validation we have

299
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,320
security observability and compliance

300
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,720
monitoring and if you want to know more

301
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,040
about chaos engineering with security

302
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,839
there is a wonderful book by orelli and

303
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:00,000
that was written by aaron reinhardt and

304
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,760
kelly shortridge

305
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,920
if i talk about devsecops it is not a

306
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,800
one person show it is people process in

307
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,600
technology all at once alongside the

308
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,519
right culture if the right culture is

309
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,920
not cooked with these three elements we

310
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,920
are not going to get the dish which is

311
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,480
called devsicops whatever we do whether

312
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,000
we can have the best of people we can

313
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,519
have the best of process we can have the

314
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,839
best of technology but honor is gonna

315
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:25,680
fail if you don't have the right culture

316
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,680
and we cannot enforce this it has to be

317
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,880
a mind shift that has to happen

318
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,440
and uh we talk about inviting to parties

319
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,959
and especially when we are in vegas we

320
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:37,360
have so many parties but like everywhere

321
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,760
it's just party party alongside a lot of

322
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,720
knowledge

323
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,200
but when it comes to developer security

324
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,440
we need to bring them to our own

325
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,920
discussions about security what we have

326
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,160
what do we want and how we all can

327
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,880
achieve it together

328
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,200
we work with so many teams

329
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,760
we work with the architects network team

330
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,920
resources asset management teams so many

331
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,279
teams are working

332
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:02,800
but how about

333
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,440
involving all of them bringing them the

334
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,839
right knowledge that is needed and

335
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:10,240
that's when automation helps us until

336
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,000
the time we don't embrace this

337
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,240
automation or embrace the automation

338
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,120
piece

339
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,519
we will never be able to achieve what we

340
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:20,720
really need to bring the right kind of

341
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,519
uh

342
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,680
culture as well as the right kind of

343
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,600
software or application that we need it

344
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,680
is very very important to have it and

345
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,360
who can help us in that

346
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,279
security champions a lot of

347
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:33,040
organizations are coming up with their

348
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,200
own security champions project now i'll

349
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,440
tell you a funny story or maybe an

350
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,240
interesting story for me wherein i used

351
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,000
to um

352
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,800
work for uh one of the clients wherein i

353
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,360
just started new in this whole devsicops

354
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:51,519
team and uh there used to be strum calls

355
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,760
one day there was a critical release and

356
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,480
uh scrum was supposed to happen at so

357
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,480
and so time but it happened half an hour

358
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,560
early and it used to be like a very

359
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,079
short call

360
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,839
when i went to the room there was no one

361
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,240
i went back and checked the whole like

362
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,680
the the team

363
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,920
who was supposed to be there they said

364
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,519
it happened early i said i didn't

365
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,440
receive an invite it said we just sent

366
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,560
it and it was a whole clash there but

367
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,800
realized that there was a

368
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,519
there was a bond that i need to create

369
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:24,320
which only can be done when i create

370
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,040
security champions where i embrace the

371
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,519
peace and respect the other people

372
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,040
opinion about

373
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,560
what they have to say about certain

374
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,480
peace so when we started working

375
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,160
together we realized that yes this is

376
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,320
something which is workable this is

377
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,240
something which is doable so we started

378
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,480
leveraging uh different people in

379
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,480
different teams around cyber security

380
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,240
around saying that okay these are the

381
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,680
things which are there this can be

382
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,720
useful

383
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,920
and

384
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,279
after a while

385
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:53,440
there was another release and

386
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,000
they actually invited me early on to the

387
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,680
discussions when the even the the

388
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,839
designing was getting done

389
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,240
so those kind of shifts take time but

390
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,160
that do happen

391
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,760
and that's one

392
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,040
we can actually talk about

393
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,399
cross-skilling

394
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,320
sharing knowledge with each other making

395
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,000
sure that people are getting accustomed

396
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,800
with it and we only can do it by

397
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,360
empowering our dev and ops team it can

398
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,440
never happen without that and we can

399
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,320
only

400
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,720
take care of that by making the security

401
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,440
everyday process now let me show you

402
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,240
if we don't have all of these things

403
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,720
right what can happen

404
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,399
so here we are i'm using this uh java

405
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:35,680
application

406
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,199
there are many applications which are

407
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:39,360
vulnerable so let me go ahead and

408
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,680
register for it because i'm a new user

409
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,240
i'm going to try that what it is how it

410
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,480
is

411
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,199
so i'm going to try so this is a java

412
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:51,680
application and i'm going to try um

413
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,199
different kind of things up on this

414
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:54,720
application i'm going to try and

415
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,320
register myself

416
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,360
and see how exactly it can show me that

417
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,519
what could go wrong if we don't have the

418
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:05,120
right libraries in the application

419
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,959
or if we don't

420
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:10,160
update them on time

421
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,560
all right so here we are

422
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,040
my name is bandara and i'm going to say

423
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,079
one thing at demo dot o

424
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:19,120
r g

425
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,639
i'll say abcd one two three four

426
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:24,079
and you must be thinking that it is the

427
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:26,480
most unsecure password i truly agree and

428
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,000
this is just for the demo

429
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,399
i'm gonna go sign up

430
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:31,759
and

431
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:34,320
here i am i'm never gonna save it i'm

432
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,920
not gonna do it

433
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,920
it's actually not in my

434
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,160
password manager so what i'm going to do

435
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:44,079
is i have my account here

436
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,440
i have few details here and i can create

437
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,000
i can upload some files i can create a

438
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,560
to-do list and when i upload my files

439
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,880
it's interesting that i can see my files

440
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,000
which means i can upload some files in

441
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,519
the public folder

442
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:03,440
now there is an about section let's see

443
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,720
what it has

444
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,959
so the first and foremost thing if i see

445
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:10,000
here that there is a struts

446
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,320
version that this application is using

447
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,600
idly

448
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,399
uh

449
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,800
this version is very rarely seen in the

450
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,519
application because we all know that

451
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:21,120
this was a version which was used in

452
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,680
equifax breach but if they're using that

453
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,920
means there is a there's some info juicy

454
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,759
information i can figure it out

455
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:29,199
and then there are some versions that

456
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:30,959
they're using

457
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:33,600
now here i can create a to-do list so

458
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,240
i'll say pandana i'll say due to it as

459
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,199
this

460
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:39,440
i'll go ahead and create a to-do list

461
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,519
okay this is what i have to do

462
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,320
now i'll go ahead i know that this is a

463
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,480
apache version that it's using so let me

464
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,880
go ahead and create a to-do list

465
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,399
with a symbol pi

466
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:53,120
and let's say this i'm going to create

467
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,040
it with the priority low

468
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,639
there is something that has changed if

469
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,480
you see here the

470
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,560
the pi has been changed to ascii

471
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,959
character so can i play around with it

472
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:05,919
can i just have some malicious files to

473
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:06,720
it

474
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,640
let's go ahead and upload some malicious

475
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,079
files to it

476
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,799
upload files i have the let's upload

477
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:13,839
files

478
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:17,119
and in the file i have some zip files

479
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,880
so this is the application which takes

480
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,880
zip files so i'm going to go ahead and

481
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,839
open

482
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,160
i'm going to hit upload

483
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,839
it says oh there's something that is

484
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:28,240
being uploaded to my files

485
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,440
but was this the only file that i had

486
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,120
let's see let's go and check so here i

487
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,360
had my zip file now what was there in

488
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,679
the zip file if you can see that i have

489
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:41,840
created a path reversal

490
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,039
and

491
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:45,120
there is so much more information if you

492
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,240
see here it's just going to go go

493
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,679
and it's just going to get some

494
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:50,799
information

495
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:52,480
and then there is a info some

496
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,559
information in the good doctor this is

497
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:57,200
an exploit that i created now does it do

498
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,559
anything

499
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:01,440
let's go ahead and figure it out

500
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,000
so now i have uploaded that file

501
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,559
if i'll go to create a to-do list

502
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,400
i'll say

503
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,400
uh whatnot

504
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,480
is a hacker

505
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,039
and if i say do it as this

506
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:16,720
i'm going to create this

507
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,400
and let's see what happens

508
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,039
there's something that has changed

509
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:22,320
which means

510
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,480
when there's a hacker is not coming

511
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,840
now can i create something

512
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:30,240
again one thing

513
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,440
is not a hacker

514
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,280
so i'm gonna say this

515
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,919
create a list

516
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:39,679
oh

517
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:41,440
it still says that

518
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,520
now these are the kind of remote

519
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,919
execution attacks that can happen that

520
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:48,320
can actually give hackers or attackers

521
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,320
like we are all hackers but attackers

522
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,640
the juicy information that they need

523
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,720
this is just a basic attack that i tried

524
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,000
but this can go to a severe in

525
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,160
uh instance where we can do some kind of

526
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:04,320
a execution of all these vulnerabilities

527
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,400
you know in

528
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,000
so this was one thing

529
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,480
can do i can do a lot of stuff i can

530
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,160
figure out so many details i have so

531
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,000
many exploits here

532
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,640
now coming back to the presentation

533
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,640
so the goal here is to make sure that

534
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,000
the ownership

535
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,600
changes from top to bottom bottom to up

536
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,480
leadership cascade the right information

537
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,200
being transparent and making sure all

538
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,039
the teams are binded together in the

539
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:35,440
first go it doesn't happen but it takes

540
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,280
time wherein the leadership also has to

541
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,120
bind all the teams together

542
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,080
and all the ground up team they need to

543
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,400
speak in the leadership language wherein

544
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,280
they understand the numbers so

545
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,679
if there is something new that they want

546
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:51,120
they have to have a buy-in from the

547
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,880
leadership so they have to speak in

548
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,080
their language which actually helps

549
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,480
in achieving shift left and top to

550
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,480
bottom strategy or bottom throw up

551
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,840
strategy

552
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,720
it is a team sport like i said

553
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,640
figuring out vulnerabilities early is

554
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,200
very very critical so uh another

555
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,280
scenario wherein i remember that there

556
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,120
was one vulnerability which was there as

557
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,799
part of the application which was the

558
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,480
medium vulnerability we took the

559
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,400
acceptance we said okay fine let's get

560
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,559
it updated in some time because we have

561
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:23,120
time so we just fixed the 15 days for it

562
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,120
but there was another release that came

563
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:25,919
in

564
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:28,480
and with that release that vulnerability

565
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,640
the medium vulnerability became critical

566
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,440
now think about a medium vulnerability

567
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,760
becoming a critical and i

568
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,600
missed that completely

569
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,240
humanly missed that but the team which

570
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,760
was working with me the security

571
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,280
champions which was working with which

572
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,440
were actually working with me they

573
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,240
mentioned even before something bad

574
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,600
could have happened that there is a

575
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,280
change that has happened to the severity

576
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,559
of the vulnerability we might need to

577
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,000
relocate

578
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,400
we all work together we analyze the

579
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,559
vulnerability and boom we were able to

580
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,080
figure out that yes it's a critical

581
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,080
vulnerability and which actually helped

582
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,960
us and that's when when we are connected

583
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,440
our source code repository we need to

584
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,520
continuously scan them rather than just

585
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,600
scanning it at the last and then saying

586
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,159
done but with every sprint we need to

587
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:17,039
scan it and it can only be done when we

588
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:19,039
connect all of our environments together

589
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:21,600
or the container registries and

590
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,240
scan them properly

591
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,840
and especially for containers when we're

592
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,440
talking about cloud native environments

593
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,240
we need to minimal scan to the base

594
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,600
images to figure out whether they are

595
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,440
vulnerable or not because if we are

596
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,120
using vulnerable images it's like

597
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,039
shipping the vulnerable software to the

598
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:38,159
production

599
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:40,960
we shouldn't make that mistake and our

600
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,559
infrastructure is

601
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:43,360
is

602
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,000
vulnerable if you don't uh monitor or

603
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,520
measure it because the

604
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,679
uh the incidence would happen whatever

605
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:51,919
we do we cannot say that we are 100

606
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:52,880
secure

607
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,960
everyone is vulnerable there are new

608
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,600
changes happening every moment when

609
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,120
that's there that means we need to

610
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,039
monitor it and fix it as soon as

611
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:04,080
possible before anyone come comes to us

612
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,400
and that's when i say that let's prepare

613
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,799
our umbrella before it rains and be very

614
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:10,320
cautious about these third-party

615
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,159
libraries and

616
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:13,919
third party companies third party

617
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:16,240
softwares that we use it's very very

618
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,360
important

619
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,679
to hold them together

620
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,760
and this is never gonna replace the pen

621
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,440
testing activity the pen testing

622
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,520
activities will keep going on at their

623
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,720
own pace

624
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,559
there are so many wonderful blogs out

625
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:30,559
there around these things

626
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:31,840
and

627
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,240
that is from mind so you can anytime
