1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:03,840
all right so thanks everyone for joining

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,680
our next talk the economics of cyber

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,520
security how market incentives fail to

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,200
protect users from cyber security

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:09,920
threats

6
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,160
uh but regulation can so we're going to

7
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,759
pivot a little bit a lot of the other

8
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:15,360
talks were a little bit more technical

9
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,400
here we're going to bring in some

10
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,000
economic concepts

11
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,240
to how we can hopefully solve some of

12
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,920
our cyber security

13
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,960
issues in health care

14
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,960
but first we'll introduce ourselves i am

15
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,000
a serious

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,440
business woman and not a cyber security

17
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,520
professional but i play one on tv

18
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,559
my background is in data science and i

19
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:39,920
have phd training

20
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,000
in econometrics economics and psychology

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,079
so i'll be playing the boring economist

22
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,120
on this talk

23
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,160
set and my name is matt mcmahon i've

24
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,680
worked for a couple different medical

25
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,160
device

26
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,879
manufacturers and i'm a professor in

27
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:59,600
healthcare and cyber security

28
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,199
and we just want to make sure that

29
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,920
everybody is aware the views on this

30
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,880
this talk are our own and not the views

31
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,439
of our employers

32
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:11,600
all right so we'll start off the talk

33
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,880
with just some kind of

34
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,200
high level notes uh about cyber security

35
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,320
and healthcare obviously

36
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,240
spy hiking village so we assume kind of

37
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,880
everyone's on the same page but

38
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,759
here's kind of three quick uh cartoons

39
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,280
or slides just

40
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,000
to lead off so the one on the left our

41
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,960
usual

42
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,439
colonoscopy equipment is down today so

43
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,600
we're going to use a tapeworm with a gop

44
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,920
gopro strapped to his head obviously

45
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,200
this is a joke but

46
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,320
you know in iomt you know there's a lot

47
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:40,640
of

48
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,240
we're using medical devices in many

49
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,000
cases for you know

50
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,439
sometimes for things that they're not

51
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,600
necessarily intended for uh that

52
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,360
that opens the door for some for some

53
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,439
cyber security issues

54
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,040
also the middle slide kind of talks to

55
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,720
that as well as the bonus feature you

56
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,640
can plug your iphone into your new pace

57
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,640
uh pacemaker to charge it

58
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,280
again while this is a joke you know if

59
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,000
you go

60
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,640
into a lot of hospital rooms today

61
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,360
you'll see

62
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,119
devices infusion pumps what have you

63
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,280
that have usb ports that you can plug in

64
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,038
an iphone and it will actually charge

65
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:12,319
and those do occasionally

66
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:15,360
bring down medical devices uh and then

67
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,040
the third point i see cyber risk

68
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,080
everywhere

69
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,400
you know it is easy to kind of go off

70
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,239
the deep end and just say you know

71
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,959
cyber security risks and health care are

72
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:25,599
everywhere

73
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,840
there's nothing that we can really do to

74
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,760
bring them down but i think most of us

75
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,560
that are in this talk

76
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,920
know that with some with some good

77
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,720
thought and

78
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,040
mitigations you can lower that risk to

79
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,640
hopefully a reasonable level so that's

80
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,000
what we'll be talking about here

81
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,840
today how we do that with economics

82
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,200
all right next slide

83
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,440
all right so a few key points again

84
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,120
we're not going to get too deep into

85
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,480
cyber security and health care because

86
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,080
we assume that most of you are working

87
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,360
in that space but

88
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,000
um you know we're all aware there's

89
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,840
millions of insecure devices out there

90
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,480
in operation uh with significantly

91
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,680
outdated

92
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,080
operating systems and we need to have a

93
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,519
little bit more investment

94
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,440
to protect patients as cyber security

95
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,000
risks grow

96
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,080
and the other point i'd like to

97
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,599
introduce here is that it's not a

98
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:16,640
technology problem

99
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,400
we know how to solve a lot of the

100
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,200
medical device cyber security risks

101
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,360
but we don't as an eating industry

102
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,640
or as an economy because the incentives

103
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,560
in the market are misaligned or they're

104
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,239
insufficient incentives

105
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:34,640
for manufacturers to invest in the

106
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,319
technological solutions that already

107
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,480
exist

108
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,720
and we'll set about to try to prove that

109
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,400
and show the solutions uh

110
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,640
and the rest of the talk all right so

111
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,400
most of us know the risk is increasing

112
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,640
it's not decreasing the number of legacy

113
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,519
devices

114
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:54,480
continues to increase unfortunately and

115
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,680
risks are growing

116
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,680
certainly we've seen with kovid the

117
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,360
number of cyber attacks

118
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,120
against the health care sector is

119
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,200
significantly increasing

120
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,599
not decreasing so the risk to broader

121
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,200
healthcare networks

122
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,680
which has a negative or has a potential

123
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,319
for a

124
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,080
adverse effect for patient safety

125
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,840
unfortunately is increasing

126
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,358
so just to give a little bit of

127
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:20,798
background and we're not going to go

128
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:21,839
through all these

129
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,080
examples again obviously most of us are

130
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,520
probably familiar with this but

131
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,440
you know wannacry obviously brought down

132
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,720
a significant number

133
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,360
of uk hospitals um completely brought

134
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,320
them down

135
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,199
um and then the the dusseldorf example

136
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,960
which many of us are familiar with

137
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,759
i was the first example where while a

138
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,360
couple wired articles have kind of

139
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,000
walked this

140
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,919
back it was believed to be the first

141
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:45,520
attack that had that

142
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,120
that directly led to uh patient fatality

143
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:49,759
but

144
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,120
again there's been some articles that

145
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,440
have kind of called into question if

146
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,960
that may be the case

147
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,240
matt do you want to talk a little bit

148
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,120
more about um the impact of cyber risks

149
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,960
specifically in health care like what's

150
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,320
at risk here it's

151
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,759
not just data privacy right yeah so

152
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,039
obviously certainly data privacy a

153
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,360
health record sells on the the dark web

154
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,160
for anywhere from 10 to 20 times

155
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,000
you know what a credit card record sells

156
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,280
for obviously you can't turn off a

157
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,800
health care record like you can a credit

158
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,759
card record

159
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,800
but also exactly patient safety

160
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,000
you know if if results are changed

161
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,520
doctors can make when doctors diagnose

162
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,120
based on those results

163
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,360
they could they could make a incorrect

164
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,120
diagnosis

165
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,960
prescribe a patient in incorrect

166
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,400
medication based on that

167
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,919
those incorrect results or if the device

168
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,080
simply isn't available

169
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,919
that could lead to patient injury or

170
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:49,360
even death

171
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,400
like with the case of stroke there's

172
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,320
there's a there's a quick time window or

173
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,759
turn around time

174
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,919
that doctors need to be able to see the

175
00:05:57,919 --> 00:05:59,759
results of certain tests

176
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:04,479
to be able to then make specific uh

177
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,479
to to to then go and treat the patient

178
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:10,240
whether one way or the other based on

179
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,600
the results of those tests

180
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,120
and if they don't have those tests then

181
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,960
they're really without the information

182
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,440
that they need to be able to proceed

183
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,960
so that could really affect patient care

184
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,960
so it seems like it's clear that the

185
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,440
risks exist in healthcare

186
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,919
and shouldn't consumers of healthcare

187
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:29,919
and by consumers of healthcare we mean

188
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:32,160
hospitals like they're buying medical

189
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,120
devices

190
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,479
and individuals i'm buying my you know

191
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,720
medical device which is in my apple

192
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,759
watch

193
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:43,280
i'm buying uh probably my infusion pump

194
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,280
or i'm buying it through my insurance

195
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,479
my insulin pump rather so you'd think

196
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:49,599
that as a buyer

197
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,759
i would want to buy secure products

198
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,120
however the

199
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,400
economic theories we're going to

200
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,479
introduce are probably pretty familiar

201
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:57,759
to it's pretty obvious

202
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,000
but on a market level make huge impacts

203
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,880
on how

204
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,520
cyber security is or isn't incentivized

205
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,120
so first

206
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,680
information asymmetry consumers don't

207
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,560
know

208
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,800
what a secure product is they can't

209
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,319
necessarily assess

210
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,479
that product's quality for and you know

211
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:16,160
it's cyber hygiene

212
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,919
um they're unaware of how it

213
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,479
how much it could impact them though the

214
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:23,599
risk isn't present

215
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:25,440
and they don't know how to evaluate so

216
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,880
they just don't buy

217
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,680
cyber security there's a couple

218
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,800
exceptions with

219
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,039
hospitals like mayo clinic has been sort

220
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:34,319
of a standout star

221
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:35,919
in its cyber security acquisition

222
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:37,680
program um but

223
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,240
in the end if there's a new device that

224
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,919
improves patient care

225
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:43,440
and is better for health healthcare

226
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,199
overall

227
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,120
if it's a little insecure they're still

228
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,560
going to buy it

229
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,240
unfortunately it's kind of the way the

230
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,240
market is right now

231
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,919
they're not willing to pay a premium for

232
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:55,759
security if they can't if a consumer

233
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:56,160
can't

234
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,000
assess whether or not that security

235
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,400
really is embedded into the device

236
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,280
um another bit of psychological bias you

237
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,240
know we just think where

238
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,680
everything's gonna go well like we're

239
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,520
short-sighted that's what myopia is in

240
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,800
that middle column

241
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,360
um and then tragedy of the commons is

242
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,240
well

243
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,680
somebody's going to make sure things are

244
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,199
secure right we wouldn't put things on

245
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:16,639
the market that aren't

246
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,960
or that don't meet some securable

247
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:19,759
patchable

248
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:23,039
baseline and we look to the fda to do

249
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:23,440
that

250
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,759
but the fda is doing this for newly too

251
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:27,039
they need to innovate

252
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,280
we'll talk a little bit more about that

253
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,400
later um

254
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,080
so i hope you pardon me for the

255
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,919
theoretical aspects of the next bit of

256
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:34,880
the talk

257
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,320
but we're just kind of laying a

258
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,479
foundation of why economics matters for

259
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:40,000
cyber risk

260
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,839
on the other side why don't

261
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:43,679
manufacturers do this manufacturers

262
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:44,640
should just know that they need to

263
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,519
secure their product

264
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:49,120
it's healthcare after all however

265
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,120
any company is only going to invest to

266
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,200
the level of risk that exists

267
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,839
and if the risk is is to the patients

268
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:57,360
but the manufacturer doesn't feel the

269
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,000
risk

270
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,080
they're not going to invest it um so

271
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,519
this is the left column the

272
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,760
the those in charge of protecting a

273
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,240
system or reducing risk are not the ones

274
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,440
that suffer if it fall

275
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,480
fails so manufacturers are not

276
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,399
suffering if someone dies

277
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,279
as a result of a hospital being down

278
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,200
because we're not tracing

279
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,839
that risk back to an original

280
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:23,279
manufacturer um

281
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,519
it probably can't be done anyway they're

282
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:27,200
not suggesting that's the way it needs

283
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,320
to go

284
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,080
but the problem then is who bears the

285
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,720
risk it just becomes a public risk that

286
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,959
that unfortunately the patient's there

287
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,000
and we can't prevent

288
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,320
matt is there anything else on the slide

289
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,680
that you'd really want to give to this

290
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,160
audience

291
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,880
um i think you've covered most of the

292
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,760
salient points

293
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:56,399
cool all right so we'll move on

294
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,720
to bear with me

295
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,920
so just um this isn't necessarily in

296
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,200
health care

297
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,160
but we found a paper that showed that

298
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,720
chief information security officers

299
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,120
buy security products or buy security

300
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,279
solutions for two reasons

301
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,760
one perceived risk to the company we

302
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,279
just talked about the perceived risk to

303
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,279
the company not being high enough

304
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,920
for medical debates manufacturers and

305
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,720
two

306
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,240
compliance regulatory compliance they do

307
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,160
it because they have to

308
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,880
and just a quick question matt you've

309
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,600
got experience

310
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,120
inside and outside of medical device

311
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,880
manufacturers have you ever heard of a

312
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,640
company or an individual foregoing a

313
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,640
security best practice like

314
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,880
a risk assessment a robust risk

315
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,640
assessment or

316
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,240
maybe multi-factor authentication

317
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,760
something simple that you'd think

318
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,040
everybody should do

319
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,320
um versus uh instead investing in like

320
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,000
something clinical outcomes more

321
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,200
r d yeah i think

322
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,920
you know it's a there's a belief that as

323
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,720
a company

324
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,160
you know there's endless money to be

325
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,720
able to invest in in cyber security and

326
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,600
the truth is

327
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,079
there really isn't a lot of companies um

328
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:12,560
drive their business lines is kind of

329
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,760
independent businesses so there's really

330
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,640
limited overhead um and yeah certainly

331
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,560
if there's only a certain amount of

332
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,240
money to be able to invest in the

333
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,320
product and you're looking at you know

334
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,720
potential threat for a cyber security

335
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,160
risk

336
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,279
versus a feature that you know through

337
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:34,000
customer interactions a number of our

338
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,680
number of the customers have said hey we

339
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,680
really want this feature

340
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,519
you know sometimes it's hard to quantify

341
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,200
cyber security risk

342
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,519
if we don't have like an fda regulation

343
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,279
saying all right you need this or

344
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,920
a known customer requirement saying yes

345
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,440
we will not buy a device like

346
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,079
you had said mayo you know we will not

347
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:53,680
buy the device if it doesn't have these

348
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,000
say

349
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,040
19 cyber security features

350
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,560
so yeah it's certainly we definitely

351
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,079
have seen

352
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:04,079
in companies across the board i'm sure

353
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:05,760
that they're that they're

354
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,519
not implementing certain security

355
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,839
features uh due to this

356
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,079
all right so we've established that

357
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,079
consumers not good enough consumers to

358
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:19,600
be able to pick out

359
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,000
more secure products medical devices

360
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,440
manufacturers don't have enough

361
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,399
incentive

362
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:29,200
to get roi on uh security features

363
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,399
how to have other industries solved

364
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,680
similar problems um i think we have

365
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,160
about

366
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,959
10 minutes left matt get check me on on

367
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:39,920
that timing

368
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:43,360
yep looks about right sounds good

369
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,200
so we'll go through these relatively

370
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,399
quickly um

371
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,160
the banking industry had a similar

372
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,519
problem with atms

373
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,720
um specifically securing atms

374
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,000
and the market solution in europe and

375
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,959
america was different some european

376
00:12:58,959 --> 00:12:59,680
countries

377
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,680
put the burden of assessing compliance

378
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,720
on the banks

379
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,639
while the u.s gave that power to

380
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,399
consumers through litigation

381
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,480
so if a consumer was defrauded in some

382
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,560
way they would litigate

383
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,120
um and they would get their money back

384
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,560
and banks

385
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,079
uh quickly reacted to that litigation

386
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:21,160
however with the with the bank sort of

387
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,560
self-regulating

388
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,839
um and assuming with the assumption

389
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:27,600
that they would reduce their own risk

390
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,880
for fraud um

391
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,320
they didn't solve the problem quickly

392
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,920
enough so it's an example of

393
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,040
giving litigation or regulatory power to

394
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,399
the consumers that bear the risk

395
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,639
kind of solves the the problem in and of

396
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,959
itself

397
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,639
the mortgage industry matt you want to

398
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:48,560
go through this slide

399
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,320
yeah so unfortunately many of us are

400
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,320
familiar with the the subprime mortgage

401
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,360
crisis but

402
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,680
um basically there was the inability to

403
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,440
uh anticipate the bubble

404
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,839
uh short of a few individuals uh which

405
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:01,839
um it was

406
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:03,760
mike michael lewis was the author that

407
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,199
uh that chronicled

408
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:07,920
those few individuals but um yeah

409
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,480
basically

410
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,399
with the risk we're undertaking with the

411
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,079
incorrect assumption that the conditions

412
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:13,839
would remain favorable we thought that

413
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:14,560
you know

414
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,560
mortgages were secure and it would you

415
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,480
know you could keep banking on that and

416
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,920
package it with other

417
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,279
um other financial services

418
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,120
um there was obviously large-scale

419
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,880
fallout millions of foreclosures

420
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,000
short sales yeah did did

421
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,360
you have anything on this shannon two

422
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,680
that you wanted to touch on

423
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,160
no just like that how can huge risk

424
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:36,800
exist

425
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,800
in a whole economy without somebody

426
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,199
recognizing it and reducing the burden

427
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:43,360
um we see that in healthcare right now

428
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,399
and it's

429
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:48,000
we have a very recent recent pretty huge

430
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,120
crisis

431
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,800
um example in our past

432
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,560
i'm going to skip the sterile injectable

433
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,199
but show it on the slide for a minute

434
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:00,079
just it's another example of how we

435
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:00,480
think

436
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,399
that the market should sufficiently

437
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,320
incentivize you know supply

438
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,360
of drugs but sometimes

439
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,320
if the company can't get enough roi the

440
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,240
the supply can fall

441
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,680
uh the analogy there being you'd think a

442
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,600
company would secure a product

443
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,839
um but if they can't get the roi

444
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,720
on the marketplace they might leave it

445
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,440
leave it

446
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,000
sort of poor cyber hygiene or or poor

447
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,120
securability in that product

448
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,279
so here's a list of how economists solve

449
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,440
these market incentive problems

450
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,839
anti-regulation is when a regulator has

451
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:39,519
certain requirements compliance

452
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,240
requirements

453
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,320
before something goes on the marketplace

454
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,759
and what's the analogy

455
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:45,519
here for the medical device industry

456
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:46,959
matt

457
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:49,759
um so yeah this would be essentially the

458
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,480
fda having basic requirements

459
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,120
we do see a number of requirements from

460
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,800
you know again the mayos and some of the

461
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,000
customers out there that

462
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,240
will specifically say we will not buy or

463
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,160
will not purchase medical devices unless

464
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,839
they have these requirements but

465
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,839
yeah an example of exante

466
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,519
anti-regulation

467
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,000
would be like say the fda had a list of

468
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,800
these requirements

469
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:15,680
yep and that's just for medical devices

470
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,360
that doesn't count the things that fda

471
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,600
doesn't regulate like electronic metal

472
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,920
medical records telehealth solutions

473
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,959
data storage formats etc

474
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:26,959
exposed liability is when you get in

475
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:28,480
trouble when you bear a risk

476
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,880
so you know this could be fda

477
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,399
enforcement but

478
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,240
unfortunately the problem there is

479
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,519
somebody has to die

480
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:38,240
before or or major problems have to

481
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:38,720
occur

482
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,040
before that liability can be traced back

483
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,680
to medical device manufacturer

484
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,399
or a healthcare product manufacturer and

485
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,079
it has to be a very clear cause and

486
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:49,120
effect

487
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,639
and unfortunately that's pretty tough

488
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:53,120
with cyber

489
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,560
information disclosure is another

490
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,240
regulatory trick

491
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,040
so arm consumers with more information

492
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,880
than the manufacturer would be naturally

493
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,199
willing to provide by requiring specific

494
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:04,400
disclosures and we'll

495
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,480
get into an example of that in a minute

496
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,880
actually just right now so

497
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,119
the ex-ante regulation that matt was

498
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,799
talking about as fda

499
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,720
post-market surveillance or pre-market

500
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,079
surveillance

501
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:22,959
fba does product benefit risk reviews

502
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,720
and cyber security risks would be

503
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,760
inside of that existing regulation

504
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,960
but you'd expect our regulator to have

505
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,039
just as many cyber security engineers as

506
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:34,880
they have biomedical engineers

507
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,720
but they're not quite that ready yet

508
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,039
fda is doing an incredible job moving

509
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:42,960
quickly and has been a

510
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:47,120
innovative regulator but more

511
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,959
resources would probably be valuable

512
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,880
um an ingredient list is a

513
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,320
is a required information disclosure for

514
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,640
food producers so is the software bill

515
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,840
of materials

516
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,320
for medical devices right now it's

517
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,240
actually voluntary but as soon enough it

518
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:06,640
will

519
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,640
likely become a mandated information

520
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,720
disclosure and that doesn't solve cyber

521
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,320
security problems in itself but it

522
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,160
solves the market inventive problems

523
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,280
suddenly there will be sort of

524
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,960
transparency

525
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,840
on for example whether or not medical

526
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,280
device components

527
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,639
are reliably patchable

528
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,559
matt you want to speak to some of it

529
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,000
what's going on in the health care

530
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,080
sector with respect to

531
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:36,000
um market incentives uh sure so

532
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,760
you know is a lot of us that are

533
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,440
involved with a number of the working

534
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,960
groups whether it's health care sector

535
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,280
coordinating council hisac

536
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,799
you know there's a number of initiatives

537
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:47,039
to try to uh you know bring to the

538
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:47,600
market

539
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,120
you know more of uh you know

540
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,640
more got at least guidance or

541
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,480
requirements um

542
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,400
whether it's fda health as i said health

543
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,000
care sect health care sector

544
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,919
coordinating council

545
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:03,440
h.i sac um csa

546
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,039
all of these organizations through

547
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:07,280
various working groups are doing work in

548
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,039
these sectors

549
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:10,960
then i'm going quickly but i know we're

550
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,520
tight on time as well

551
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,960
uh yeah it's just not enough um so the

552
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,799
the overall takeaway from this talk is

553
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,799
economics has a role in reducing cyber

554
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:22,320
risk specific for the healthcare

555
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,120
industry

556
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,880
and there's there's not enough going on

557
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,039
right now the market incentives of

558
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:28,720
with the current regulatory approach is

559
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,679
not is not sufficient to reduce risk

560
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:33,200
and the industry's not going to solve it

561
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,840
on its own um

562
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,960
matt you want to close us out sure

563
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,400
yeah so you know i think working in the

564
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,080
industry we keep kind of looking at the

565
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,320
same way we've always done it

566
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,240
in discussing this talk and some of the

567
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,160
other economic approaches to other

568
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,039
industries

569
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:52,559
i think it's it's nice to be able to

570
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,160
kind of take a step back and look at

571
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,600
other industries see what's worked for

572
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,320
them

573
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,400
um and see what's been you know proven

574
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,000
to work in those industries

575
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
um you know healthcare is a little bit

576
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,440
different in that we in

577
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,960
in shannon talked about we have the

578
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,799
different players so it's not like

579
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:08,480
say an apple watch or i buy the apple

580
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,240
watch and i assess it based on my

581
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,440
requirements but

582
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,640
you know we have medical device

583
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,559
manufacturers selling to

584
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:16,559
uh health delivery organizations that

585
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:18,400
are then preside providing services to

586
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,000
patients so there's there's a couple

587
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,679
different players and then regulators as

588
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,760
well so um you know we don't have the

589
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,440
clear incentives uh

590
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,520
everyone does isn't incentivized in the

591
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,280
same way all of those different players

592
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,320
uh to make

593
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,440
uh secure medical devices so um yeah we

594
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,720
just kind of wanted to

595
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,559
open up the discussion which will have a

596
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:38,240
question and answer soon we can kind of

597
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,919
talk a little bit in greater depth about

598
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:40,559
that but

599
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:42,159
yeah we just kind of wanted to present

600
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:44,400
the some other economic

601
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,200
possibilities for managing cyber

602
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,320
security risk

603
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,960
in health care

604
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:57,200
thanks
