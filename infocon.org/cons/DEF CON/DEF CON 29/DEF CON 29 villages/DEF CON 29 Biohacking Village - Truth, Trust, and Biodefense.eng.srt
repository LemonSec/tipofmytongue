1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,399
go

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,000
hey everybody i'm eric paraxels the

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,440
chief science and digital officer at

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,000
dcri and a professor of population

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,360
health sciences at duke college of

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,120
medicine i'm here today to talk about

7
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:17,000
truth trust and biodefense

8
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,160
so what does an 80 movies 80s movie has

9
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,359
to do with biodefense well i was

10
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,119
thinking about what i was going to talk

11
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:24,560
about and i was thinking about you know

12
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,880
what movie reminded me of the pandemic

13
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,560
and the movie that came to la

14
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,279
mind this pandemic was sex lives and

15
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:33,520
videotape and the more i thought about

16
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,280
it the more it made sense and there's a

17
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,280
couple of reasons for that right i mean

18
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,440
from wikipedia the plot tells a story of

19
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,040
a troubled man who videotapes women

20
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,440
discussing their sexuality and fantasies

21
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,120
and his impacts on the relationship of a

22
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,480
troubled married couple and the wife's

23
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,480
younger sister so kind of uncomfortable

24
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,800
right talking about sex and whatnot well

25
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,079
a lot of what's going on in this

26
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:53,840
pandemic with covet has to do with what

27
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,199
people are comfortable talking about

28
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:56,559
what they're not comfortable talking

29
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:58,480
about what they feel vulnerable

30
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,840
about what they're willing to share what

31
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,000
they're not willing to share and when

32
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
why and how those reasons might be their

33
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,680
own so i think i think there's some

34
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,040
wisdom in this but i also think there

35
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,520
might be a little fun in this

36
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,320
so for folks uh that aren't familiar

37
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,720
with the concept of biodefense the

38
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,799
history of biodefense has really been

39
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:17,680
about

40
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,960
um pathogen defense um and in particular

41
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,880
it's been really dominated by like the

42
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,560
terrorist use of pathogen defense like

43
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,159
biological weapons or something like

44
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,720
that and and the time that you know most

45
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,040
of us can remember maybe of that was was

46
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,880
back after 9 11 when some anthrax uh

47
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,040
laced mail was sent and actually you

48
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,360
know killed five people and 17 were or

49
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,799
sickened and this really really startled

50
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,720
the biodefense kind of industry just

51
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,119
like 911 startled everybody especially

52
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:50,000
the airline industry travel industry etc

53
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,119
this really

54
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,040
startled the biodefense industry but we

55
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,040
have to kind of be careful about that

56
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,719
right because it's it's there's a couple

57
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,240
things to it one

58
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,960
over responses uh are always something

59
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,479
you have to think about but when you're

60
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:04,320
talking about defense and strategy you

61
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,920
also have to really think about the

62
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,080
nature of an adversary and what they're

63
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,800
doing you know maybe they did something

64
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,560
to deceive you into looking at that

65
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,920
because they want you looking the other

66
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,640
way so you know maybe a a slightly

67
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,480
implied way to think about that is

68
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,440
imagine what you're the airline security

69
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,280
on your annual trip to disney world

70
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,040
would have been like if the shoe bomber

71
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,800
had put the bomb in his rectum instead

72
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,400
of his shoes nobody wants that

73
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,560
inspection at an airport right but yet

74
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,319
we take off everybody's shoes including

75
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,160
100 year old you know poor person a

76
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,360
wheelchair has got to take their shoes

77
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,519
off and you know we've got to be careful

78
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:38,959
about when we're being told to do things

79
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,400
when we're being told to look a certain

80
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,360
way by an adversary

81
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,720
so i want to start with a case of

82
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,200
redefining biodefense you're right so

83
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,360
again after 911 really got about

84
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,120
pathogens how to detect passages in the

85
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,959
mail how to detect pathogens

86
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:54,959
and you know in airports and things like

87
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:56,480
that but if you actually look at the

88
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,720
math here for a second you find out that

89
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,920
you know in 11 years from 1995 to 2016

90
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,400
you know there were roughly 3 220 plus

91
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,560
um american deaths uh due to terrorism

92
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,400
which of course is a horrible horrible

93
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,360
number the biohacking village and defcon

94
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,959
and myself in my own research were

95
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:16,480
really focused on medical device

96
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,560
security truth is as much as we know

97
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,080
there's a risk there aren't that many

98
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,760
documented cases yet

99
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,959
of where

100
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:24,239
you know there's actually been a death

101
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:25,680
or serious injury although we did have

102
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,080
one this year where ransomware attack in

103
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,680
germany was linked to

104
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,920
actually directly causing a death and we

105
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,000
know that the the rise of cyber attacks

106
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,080
and data breaches and hospitals has been

107
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,519
linked to things like higher incidents

108
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,519
heart attacks and things like that yet

109
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,440
at the same time we also know that 600

110
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,440
000 people died in this pandemic which

111
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,120
is way more than died in all of world

112
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,200
war ii so if we're going to think about

113
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,040
how we're defining biodefense and maybe

114
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,959
how we should redefine biodefense i

115
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,040
think we have to actually put

116
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,920
pandemics caused by whatever nature or

117
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,599
somebody else as one of the main things

118
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,239
that we're looking out for

119
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,159
so going back to the movie here i'm

120
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,360
going to talk about trust truth and

121
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,680
biodefense and so you know looking in

122
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,040
this movie there were just some really

123
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,680
really great co quotes that meant a lot

124
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,519
so in this case anne is mad when she

125
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:12,799
finds out her husband's cheating says

126
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:14,640
nothing's what i thought it was john's a

127
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,720
bastard let's make a videotape some

128
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,720
pretty important stuff in this first of

129
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,639
all um someone's mad and they want to

130
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,000
talk about it yeah well welcome to

131
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,919
facebook and welcome to online chat

132
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:25,360
groups and stuff like that when somebody

133
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,360
thinks that they've been deceived or

134
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,440
duped they're much more likely to talk

135
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,520
about it and they still may be wrong

136
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,600
about what really went on but the idea

137
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,120
here is that angry people take to the

138
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,280
internet many people can convince

139
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,960
non-angry people to do things so we have

140
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,199
to think about you know what we mean by

141
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,880
trust and when we're violating trust and

142
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,120
this especially includes

143
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,360
when medicine's violating trust i mean

144
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,199
right now we're in this latest wave of

145
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,240
covet and truly truly looking like a

146
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,639
pandemic of the unvaccinated that this

147
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,720
virus is just circulating and hopefully

148
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,880
not mutating and evolving and

149
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,840
unvaccinated populations you know we

150
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,680
know from vaccine sentiment and studies

151
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,919
like that that most of these people

152
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,880
uh that vac that aren't vaccinated ha

153
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,440
were influenced by by different types of

154
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,199
information campaigns and politics and

155
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,199
in the last election cycle and whatnot

156
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,320
like that there are some people that

157
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,759
have always been vaccine hesitant right

158
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,520
so that has to be out there too but we

159
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,880
know that it's a very different thing

160
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,120
now and we have to understand that

161
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,960
information media things like that are

162
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,360
directly contributing to life and death

163
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,560
choices that people are making

164
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,400
and i've been saying this for a while if

165
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,199
you saw my last deft on defcon talk i

166
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,360
think if we look at rebuilding trust and

167
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,759
medicine i think that's where we are you

168
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,039
know we can talk about the

169
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:42,720
disinformation and whatnot and we could

170
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,360
talk about the lady who you know was

171
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,880
went viral saying that you know a

172
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,479
vaccine made key stick to her head or

173
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,000
something like that we might even

174
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,600
snicker at that but the fact is there's

175
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,720
got to be a reason why these people

176
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,240
don't trust doctors and don't trust

177
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,440
scientists and don't trust the

178
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,360
government and you know here's just a

179
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,960
few few

180
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,800
facts but if you think about it if you

181
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,800
look at the last one if just one third

182
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,960
of americans trusted the government to

183
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,479
do the right thing in 2019 what do you

184
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,440
think that number is now

185
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,160
so this is from my last defcon talk and

186
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,080
in general the way i've talked about it

187
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,199
is that misinformation and

188
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,039
disinformation should be viewed as a

189
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:19,280
medical problem with the media dimension

190
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,360
and that the only way to address it long

191
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,759
term is to address why people don't

192
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,280
trust doctors in science and here's a

193
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,520
few of the facts medical errors still

194
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,280
the 14th leading cause of disease board

195
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,360
and across the w.h.o

196
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,960
we have significant unmet uh grievances

197
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,360
of cost and inequity in medicine today

198
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,880
people are cynical and isolated by

199
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,039
what's gone on there really isn't a

200
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:42,479
great way for patients to express

201
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,000
grievances with medicine today other

202
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,160
than taking it online you know how many

203
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,759
how many hospitals are really open or

204
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,520
hold open public forums and town halls

205
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,440
to hear about how patients felt that

206
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,520
week and probably not in a smart way to

207
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,120
do the cure but if you think about it

208
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,360
there really aren't forms for it how to

209
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,360
bend better enable gender faith and

210
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,240
ideologies based specificity people have

211
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,160
different beliefs and you know we can't

212
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,840
we can't discard that they're meaning

213
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,199
them you know

214
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,800
aren't all large industries corrupt if

215
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,720
people are making money and then what

216
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,639
about radicalization based on bad luck i

217
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,639
mean the fact is that you know we have

218
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,720
seen for example breakthrough

219
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,280
covet deaths because of a vaccinated

220
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,680
people it's extremely rare and the math

221
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,080
is extremely complex but you know what

222
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,400
it it happens and then it gets amplified

223
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,080
and then it gets blown out of proportion

224
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,599
so we really have to deal with this

225
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:33,360
medical problem with the media dimension

226
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,960
but can we get our message i mean you

227
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,039
know one of the things that that shocks

228
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,039
me is i continue to see what i think are

229
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:41,039
kind of self-inflicted wounds

230
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:43,520
by science and medicine you know

231
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,520
it's very easy to say you know pandemic

232
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,039
response hinges on trust i'm going to go

233
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,800
into that in a lot of detail from this

234
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,800
and other pandemics of course that's

235
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,800
true but how do you get to trust if you

236
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,400
can't stay on message

237
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,240
you know this one alone in the last few

238
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,479
weeks just startled me you know fisa

239
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,319
putting out an announcement or you know

240
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:01,599
basically communicating they thought

241
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:03,680
somebody might need a booster shot and

242
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,360
then immediately the medical

243
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,840
establishment cdc others says people

244
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,360
probably don't need a booster shot i'm

245
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,639
just kind of want to pull my hair out

246
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,199
and say really i mean really like like

247
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,879
fizzy you couldn't have like

248
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,319
talked to the cdc before you put the

249
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:17,680
message out and see if you guys could

250
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,599
have gotten on the same page instead of

251
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,360
doing something like this that's going

252
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,960
to actually allow you know

253
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,199
disinformation people to just go

254
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,680
hog wild we can't feed them

255
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,440
data like this we can't give them

256
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,000
reasons to do this stuff this to me a

257
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,679
hundred percent

258
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,360
preventable and naturally if you really

259
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,880
read it neither of these two are saying

260
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,559
anything that that really contradicts

261
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,799
the other but it can be sure be made to

262
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:44,480
sound like that that way in clickbait

263
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,160
let's talk about privacy in the movie

264
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,519
for a second so we're talking about

265
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,519
these interviews of people on their

266
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:50,800
their habits

267
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,880
and so these are interviews huh yes can

268
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,600
we watch one no why not well i promised

269
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,800
each of the subjects that no one would

270
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,959
see the videotapes except for me one

271
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:00,399
woman used up three minutes the other

272
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,800
one used up two two three hour three two

273
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,080
hour tapes

274
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,839
so this is a lot like conversations i

275
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:07,120
have when i've talked to people about

276
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,640
things like contact tracing and when i

277
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,040
talk to things about um

278
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,680
security or privacy and why this

279
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,360
enterprise thinks they should have data

280
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,600
but this one can't in particular in

281
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,360
trying to set up cova testing earlier

282
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,519
this year there was data that the cdc

283
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,200
wanted that was actually being blinded

284
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,360
by the counties to the states so how

285
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,959
does that data go through the answer is

286
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:27,839
it doesn't

287
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,000
you know and so we we've got to get on

288
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,600
page and what privacy is we've got to

289
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,200
get on page on in something like a

290
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,880
pandemic response with a simple case

291
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,399
report form about what's going to be

292
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:37,680
public what's going to be private and

293
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,160
that means to everybody

294
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,080
how about contact tracing what are those

295
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,320
phone calls like and did you touch did

296
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,040
he touch you no did you touch him no did

297
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,760
anybody touch anybody well yes

298
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,279
this is what contact tracing

299
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:52,560
conversations can sound like in case

300
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,839
you've never sat in and want to heard

301
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,200
one or anything like that to be very

302
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,360
personal you're out on a date you did

303
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,519
this you went to the dentist this day

304
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:02,720
um you know we have to think about what

305
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,560
we should have learned in the 80s from

306
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,760
hiv

307
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,640
when we had a an epidemic a deadly

308
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,200
non-treatable disease and the social

309
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,880
stigma was so bad that people were

310
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,800
scared to share their testing status

311
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,560
which was the most dangerous thing they

312
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,480
could do but they're worried about their

313
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,600
jobs and they're worried about their

314
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,440
lives and we're not we're not we've got

315
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,959
to be thinking clearly about this stuff

316
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:24,160
and we've got to remember that the

317
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,959
lessons are there

318
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,200
you know this is a great piece on

319
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,800
community trust in the ebola end game it

320
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,120
talked about what it was like in in the

321
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,920
west african ebola outbreak in 2014 2015

322
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,640
when i was there and it talks about how

323
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,640
um you know people would come in and

324
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,079
talk to people in villages and people

325
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:43,519
would run out screaming saying you know

326
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:44,320
they're going to take your baby and

327
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,200
they're going to cut your baby into

328
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,839
little pieces you know in 2014 15 that

329
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:49,839
sounded absurd have you seen some of the

330
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:52,720
us headlines in 2020 2021 they're no

331
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,880
less absurd than that and you know this

332
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,440
is uh myself and and a postdoc in a

333
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,760
village in kona sierra leone and you can

334
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,040
tell from the looks we're getting as

335
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,560
we're talking to people that you know

336
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,480
not exactly all that much trust and love

337
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,880
going on there but they did talk to us

338
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,800
and they they did point us to what we

339
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,120
needed to see but they did it because

340
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,560
we're standing there

341
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,600
nothing in our hands uh no soldiers with

342
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,920
us in the village being we were more

343
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,920
vulnerable than they were and they built

344
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,800
trust

345
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,160
we've got to learn from these lessons we

346
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,880
can't make mistakes and i i think we've

347
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,480
got to turn around and say even if we're

348
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,640
seeing what appear to be really severe

349
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,959
responses to things it can't be that we

350
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:32,880
go ahead and start tweeting about how

351
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,720
silly people are it has to be that we

352
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,560
start addressing why people feel that

353
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,480
way

354
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,240
you know and so very very similar you

355
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,000
know this was all over the place i was

356
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,120
interviewed i think it was on political

357
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,480
and a few other things about that but

358
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,399
the whole contact tracing thing most

359
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:47,519
people would just say probably hasn't

360
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:48,880
worked i mean there's a lot of reasons

361
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,959
for that one is the disease moved too

362
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:53,120
fast and we're too populated another

363
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,560
reason would be people simply didn't

364
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,639
trust it people didn't answer the phone

365
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:58,800
when an 800 number calls your cell phone

366
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,079
do you answer it if you don't know who

367
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:00,959
it is

368
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:02,639
people don't the other thing is that

369
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:03,760
some of these things are really just

370
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,440
surveillance you know some of these

371
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,279
these high-tech things that were really

372
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:09,519
just like proximity alerts of uh oh

373
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,440
you're you ha you're we can see you on a

374
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,079
gps and your your little red dot is next

375
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:15,360
to a red dot of somebody that might have

376
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,519
tested positive i mean it's brownian

377
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,040
motion of humans you don't know what

378
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,320
they were wearing you don't know if they

379
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,160
had masks on you don't know what happens

380
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,480
in lows on a checkout line and so i mean

381
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,680
contract tracing is something that's

382
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,760
been around for hundreds of years and

383
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,839
the truth has always been it's been

384
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:30,639
about

385
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:32,399
about trust and this this menace to

386
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,120
public health um article i suggest to

387
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,440
everybody it's a great it's uh article

388
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,600
on 1800's 1900's past 1700's past

389
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,120
epidemics and how people got people to

390
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,200
talk to them paying them usually worked

391
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,600
but it's a pretty fascinating piece to

392
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,360
see what we're what we're living with

393
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,760
living through again

394
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,360
and the bottom line is simply here you

395
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,279
don't need invasive tech for successful

396
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:57,600
contract tracing what you need are

397
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,600
community-based engagement and you need

398
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,639
trust and you need to ask ask

399
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,399
questions that respect privacy and you

400
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:05,600
need to provide assurances that you're

401
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,360
going to protect privacy it's a little

402
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,880
bit late now with the level of community

403
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,880
spread we have and stuff like that but

404
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,040
you know one of the things that

405
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,560
people like me think about people where

406
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,160
this isn't their first rodeo when it

407
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,880
comes to infectious diseases is that i

408
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,040
really hope the next one isn't more

409
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,040
deadly than this you know with a disease

410
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,720
like this as horrible as it is all the

411
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,639
people we've lost

412
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,360
roughly you know 1.8 death rate or

413
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,800
something like that overall right pretty

414
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,200
low what if it was 20 or 30

415
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,880
you know what we've shown is how badly

416
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,320
we can handle it we need to show how

417
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,279
well we can handle it

418
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:40,639
what about truth

419
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,399
graham i'm reading somewhere that men

420
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:43,600
learn to love the person they're

421
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,440
attracted to and women become more

422
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,519
attracted to the person that they love

423
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:48,560
and ann

424
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,639
i've just got all this time in my hands

425
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,399
i sit around and i start inventing these

426
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,399
like intricate scenarios and then i

427
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,160
don't want all that wasted time i want

428
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,760
to believe in them let's talk about

429
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,320
misinformation versus disinformation

430
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,079
you know because i i actually have

431
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:03,680
worked with a family that had a child

432
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,079
that had cancer um and the child did

433
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,639
very very well with cancer um but the

434
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,040
child recently was taken out of

435
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,519
follow-up care because that one of the

436
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,920
parents became very vaccine hesitant and

437
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,680
very suspicious of the medical

438
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,279
establishment that had saved their

439
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:20,639
child's life

440
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,880
and now not only did that child get

441
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,320
coveted and did okay

442
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,720
great shape but also now you know is not

443
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,480
not doing follow-up care or adult care

444
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,040
for her very serious childhood cancer

445
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,480
and you know people do have a lot of

446
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,959
time on their hands during lockdowns and

447
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:36,480
people will read all kinds of stuff and

448
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,000
they will invent scenarios and then they

449
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,680
will talk about them this is really

450
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,760
human behavior but that type of

451
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,360
misinformation we have to make sure

452
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,639
we're we're separated from

453
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,720
disinformation which which unfortunately

454
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,320
is what i feel is going on in parts of

455
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,360
the media right now where they're

456
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,560
intentionally

457
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,320
giving up false information to try to

458
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,440
drive certain behaviors

459
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,600
um you know so this is a great couple of

460
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,360
piece something that i've you know

461
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,800
people ask me about sometimes is you

462
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,519
know are we living in a post-truth world

463
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:05,680
and i didn't really know what that meant

464
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,920
but um this particular npr interview is

465
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,360
really really good on it

466
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,440
and what this what lee mcintyre says in

467
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,880
my book i define

468
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,720
post-truth as the political

469
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,720
subordination of reality

470
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,480
so i think of post-truth as a tactic

471
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,199
that's used by our authoritarians

472
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:23,120
in their wannabes to control the flow of

473
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,760
information so they control the populous

474
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,839
is any of this sounding familiar to you

475
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:29,519
all because it really really should

476
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,000
shouldn't it

477
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,720
you know so on the left hand side we've

478
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,759
got a a a picture

479
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:40,320
from the american media in spring of

480
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,800
2020 and on the right-hand side is a

481
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,720
large banner i took in a traffic jam in

482
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,120
sierra leone during the ebola and people

483
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,759
were believing ebola was real

484
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,440
people weren't believing it was real

485
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,199
right it's very alone in the us people

486
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:54,959
were saying it was politicized there was

487
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:56,800
no epidemic this isn't going to get you

488
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,720
it's all it's all being made up

489
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,040
um to drive behavior

490
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,959
i mean i mean come on right so what do

491
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:05,040
you do in this situation what i did was

492
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,560
i ran the experiment

493
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,160
how did i run the experiment well i was

494
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,680
asked um to comp comment on

495
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,000
some privacy issues on fox news and i

496
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,360
had a lot of suspicions and i'm i'm a

497
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,600
empathetic left-leaning person and i'll

498
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,920
put that out there but at the same time

499
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,440
you know i try to be objective and i

500
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,000
said let's let's let's figure this out

501
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,880
and so i i i met the person good people

502
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,240
trying to do good work and they

503
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,240
interviewed me and this is what that

504
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,079
interview ended up looking like on tv

505
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:35,680
you know eric how's the weather the

506
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,199
weather's really nice today it's sunny

507
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:38,720
it's bright everything's going good and

508
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,320
like well well you live in new england

509
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,079
right so so what's the weather like in

510
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:44,240
new england on the worst day well on the

511
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,079
worst day we can have blizzards we can

512
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,560
have ice storms things can be shut down

513
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,240
um you know you'd be saving water in

514
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,519
your bathtub like it's a hurricane that

515
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:53,199
could be the worst day what did the

516
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:55,360
interview look like on tv hey eric

517
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,040
what's the weather like what's the worst

518
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,480
possible weather because it's blah blah

519
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,880
blah i mean a hundred percent without a

520
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,480
doubt i actually taped my own interview

521
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,799
without them knowing it and they've been

522
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,799
they scrambled answers and questions and

523
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:08,480
it wasn't cool and i haven't gone on

524
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,480
again because of that but i think i

525
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,000
think when you see that

526
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,760
um you've got to recognize it now people

527
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,520
will tell me well but don't all medias

528
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,199
do that and i'll say actually my

529
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:19,199
experience this year no i was on here

530
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,679
and now twice this year on npr

531
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:23,439
both times that not only was that not

532
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:25,599
done but in one of the interviews on

533
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:28,240
kova testing i actually corrected

534
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,760
the host because she said something had

535
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,840
been fda approved and i said it had an

536
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,679
emergency youth authorization they went

537
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,520
back and retaped it to make sure that

538
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,360
she said the correct thing and i'm not

539
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,720
so i'm not going to say always good

540
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,799
always bad what i'm going to say is the

541
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:43,440
media is 100 being manipulative and

542
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,120
people have to be smart and be watching

543
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,200
out for that and at some point we have

544
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,720
to decide what's legal and what's not

545
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,720
legal if people are being harmed and

546
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,480
killed

547
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,480
so on social responsibility graham

548
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,840
you're right i've got a lot of problems

549
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,919
but those problems belong to me and you

550
00:17:57,919 --> 00:17:59,440
think they're yours but you're not

551
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,880
everybody that walks in that door

552
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,720
becomes a part of your problem anybody

553
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,720
that comes in contact with you i didn't

554
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,640
want to be part of your problem but i am

555
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,440
so what if that problem was a virus

556
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,880
right i mean

557
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,039
let's be let's be clear we have to be

558
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:14,400
thoughtful about this

559
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,720
you know if i'm a supermarket delivery

560
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,760
driver

561
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,720
hourly rent um hourly wage

562
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,600
month to month rent a baby at home

563
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,520
and i think i might have covet and if i

564
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,600
tell my boss i'm getting fired i might

565
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,280
put on gloves mask up and not want to be

566
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,679
tested too and i and i and in this and

567
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:33,600
as irresponsible as that seems i think

568
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,960
we've got to understand that for people

569
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,799
food clothing shelter matters

570
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:39,360
right at the same time when people do

571
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,160
have

572
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,240
the ability um to take care of

573
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,160
themselves and to quan to quarantine and

574
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,600
stuff like that we have to be able to do

575
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,360
it and i think that's one of the reasons

576
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,720
why some of our research programs

577
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,160
haven't been effective it was about the

578
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,160
wraparound services you know people can

579
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,320
only do what they can do take the belief

580
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,600
out of it for a second if i've got to be

581
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,440
to work i'm going to be at work you know

582
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,360
and i'll i hope i don't get anybody else

583
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,799
sick but you know what

584
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:03,200
it is what it is social responsibility

585
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,360
and morality they're really different

586
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,679
when something's going on but attacking

587
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,360
these things intentionally that's

588
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,480
something else

589
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,799
you know telling people you know

590
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:15,039
vaccinated people telling unvaccinated

591
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:17,039
people they shouldn't get the vaccine

592
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:19,919
that's something else

593
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,840
so a little bit about this you know rand

594
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,559
paul vows to introduce

595
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:26,640
to um legislation to repeal mass

596
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,640
mandates and stuff like that

597
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,160
you know what

598
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,440
you know what i mean this type of

599
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,240
politicization it's just hurting people

600
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,480
and you know what i i know it's politics

601
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,000
i know that stuff goes on but for me

602
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,440
there's there's just been lines that

603
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,360
have been crossed when it comes down to

604
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,880
doing things and saying things that are

605
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,480
going to get people hurt you know if

606
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,640
you're norwegian cruise lines you know

607
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,000
you're going to lose millions and

608
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
millions of dollars because you can't

609
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,559
put your ship into florida you know

610
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,080
you're being you're being penalized for

611
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,360
trying to do the right thing which is

612
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,799
saying look

613
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,480
the public sentiment now is a lot of

614
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,640
people people like me may never get on a

615
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,320
cruise ship again it doesn't matter if

616
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,000
it's covered or not they just may never

617
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,840
do it right and so these are industries

618
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,440
that are trying to survive at least

619
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,360
they're trying to be responsible and we

620
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,799
shouldn't have a political system that's

621
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:14,480
that's trying to punish them for that

622
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,840
we had this interesting thing a few

623
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,720
weeks ago you probably saw it um biden

624
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,720
said facebook

625
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,000
platforms like facebook are killing

626
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,640
people with coveted misinformation and

627
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,880
then facebook isn't killing people biden

628
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,200
softens his attack you know my view on

629
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,720
these platforms frankly is that they can

630
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,960
be weaponized and it's it's you can say

631
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,480
it's whether it's their fault they can

632
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,520
be weaponized or they can't be

633
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,280
weaponized but are arms dealers and

634
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,600
bullish dealers responsible for wars not

635
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,440
for starting them right they might make

636
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,360
it easier but i think but i think things

637
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,120
can be weaponized i mean a car can be

638
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,799
weaponized by a drunk driver

639
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:48,400
right i mean these these things can

640
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,240
happen i think we do have to think about

641
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,240
these these social media platforms and

642
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,240
the harm they can cause and the fact

643
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,080
that by the way they are cleaning up

644
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,200
right because they're taking out money

645
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,640
from everybody they're taking it from

646
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,120
both sides which in an election is 100

647
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,880
fine in a public health emergency i

648
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,000
think that's getting to be something

649
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,760
else so while i would probably agree

650
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,799
that

651
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,880
facebook's like saying that platforms

652
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,240
like facebook are killing people might

653
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,919
be a step over the line it's just a

654
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:14,840
toenail over the line as far as i'm

655
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:18,080
concerned on where to go from here so

656
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,440
john mulaney things are getting too

657
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,880
complicated and cynthia no they're

658
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,640
getting real simple and i got to tell

659
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,919
you at this point i think things are

660
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:26,480
getting real simple i think that

661
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,320
with what we've seen you know two years

662
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,159
ago i stood in front of this audience in

663
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:32,480
this form and talked about the threat of

664
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,120
men of misinformation it was

665
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,559
600 000 lives of an epidemic

666
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:41,039
earlier we had no idea we had no idea

667
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:42,880
what would be right now and so i you

668
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,400
know i'm going to say some of those same

669
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,679
things but i'm going to say them with a

670
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:49,200
lot more um force and and a lot more uh

671
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,480
intensity because i think they're

672
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,880
essential

673
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,559
i think first of all as i as i wrote in

674
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:58,720
march of 2020 and then my colleagues at

675
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,240
harvard wrote again

676
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,240
in april 2021.

677
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,360
you know one of the most important and

678
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,960
most successful tools in all pandemics

679
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,880
have been community health workers i was

680
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,440
recently on a panel um

681
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,960
with the african-american dakova task

682
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,320
force down down at duke in north

683
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,240
carolina and one of the community

684
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,880
leaders um that was was there was a

685
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,559
community health worker he was a barber

686
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:20,159
and you know how you talked about how

687
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:21,600
you know how many people and how many

688
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,280
conversations go through a barbershop in

689
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,039
a day of people that have questions

690
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:26,320
whether they should get vaccinated or

691
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,240
not not only that but you know what if

692
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,480
amazon drivers were

693
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,240
community health workers what if they

694
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,760
had a community health worker in the

695
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,039
truck with them when they went into air

696
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:37,200
on to every street

697
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,600
in this country every single day what if

698
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,799
they brought food what if they could

699
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,080
vaccinate what if they could do covet

700
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:45,039
testing we we have to enable community

701
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:47,039
health workers and

702
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:48,640
my closing thoughts here again about how

703
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,120
we enable hackers as community health

704
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,400
workers to save lives

705
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,000
so one of the best things in government

706
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,520
is when they can do something bipartisan

707
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,799
it does happen i know sometimes you

708
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:00,559
don't think it does in the bipartisan

709
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:02,480
commission on biodefense is something i

710
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,240
studied but i was i was reintroduced to

711
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,640
recently by by the amazing nina ali the

712
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,640
executive director of this forum and you

713
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,799
know here's a little bit of what's going

714
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:12,000
on i'm going to talk about some of the

715
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,320
recommendations if i didn't mention it

716
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,240
um i know this will be on youtube but

717
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,240
the actual deck most of these graphics

718
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,520
are hot linked so you can go to the

719
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,200
article and stuff like that i couldn't

720
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,320
hot link to the whole movie though

721
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,600
you're going to have to go rent it or

722
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,919
find that yourself

723
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:28,000
so the recommendation's adequate

724
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,600
at a glance so here's a whole list of

725
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,280
them let's talk about two recommendation

726
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,360
six improve the management

727
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,280
of the biological intelligence center

728
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,400
enterprise so this is better

729
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,640
surveillance surveillance and monitoring

730
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,159
online activity are things that hackers

731
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:41,840
know how to do they know how to measure

732
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,200
reach they know how to measure breadth

733
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,039
and how to do these things so this is

734
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:47,120
this is a great application recommend

735
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,640
prioritizing orion investments in

736
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,400
medical counter meshes

737
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,840
among federal stakeholders what about

738
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,000
cyber countermeasures right what about

739
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,360
being being able to take down

740
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,919
destructive sites what about ensuring

741
00:23:57,919 --> 00:23:59,840
that positive energy positive

742
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,840
information and important sites stay up

743
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,200
if they're protected and they can't be

744
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,360
hacked so let's let's talk about

745
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,039
recommendation eight for cyber

746
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:09,279
countermeasures

747
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:11,919
recommendation 12 is to involve others

748
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:14,159
beyond um just the federal government so

749
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:16,000
what about we heart hackers which

750
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,760
already works with the fda already works

751
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,159
with industry rds and why why do we not

752
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,960
have weak heart hackers biodefense that

753
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,480
works with federal

754
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,679
entities on biosurveillance

755
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:29,760
provide emergency service providers with

756
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,960
the resources they need to keep

757
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,960
themselves and their families safe we've

758
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,400
seen this right i talked about we needed

759
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,320
a medical troll army in my last talk

760
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,320
what about simply keeping these people

761
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,200
safe

762
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,559
from being attacked what about making

763
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:42,000
sure their families are okay what about

764
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,760
making sure their internet stays up what

765
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,440
about making sure that their phones work

766
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,039
right can't can't we form a protective

767
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:48,640
circle around people that are on the

768
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,200
front lines

769
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,559
and they're and you know and can we be

770
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,559
smarter i mean you know there's redouble

771
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,080
efforts to share information with state

772
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,440
local tribal partners you know there's

773
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,760
something called a a certified social

774
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,679
engineering prevention specialist there

775
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:04,880
are specialties now all across

776
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,120
information science and communications

777
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,120
and library science and people that

778
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,760
really know how to measure things how to

779
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,080
say things how to determine impact and

780
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,360
you know shouldn't we have more people

781
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,720
certified like this shouldn't there be a

782
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,960
biodefense certification specialty for

783
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,760
something like this

784
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,600
um develop and implement medical

785
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,080
countermeasure response framework

786
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,080
topic of my talk two years ago a jam

787
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,919
article that rob calef and i did about

788
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:32,559
having cyber um techniques as part of a

789
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:34,480
countermeasure response framework so

790
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,240
link to that paper there definitely

791
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,919
think we should do it

792
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:39,679
and then harden pathogen and advanced

793
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:41,520
biotechnology information from cyber

794
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,880
attacks well this is exactly what the

795
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,200
biohacking village and and partners have

796
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,640
done so well for the medical device

797
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,640
industry and why medical device makers

798
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,960
bring bring their new newest highest

799
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,120
potential devices to defcon hoping to

800
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,039
have them tested by the best security

801
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:56,400
specialist right

802
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,760
isn't this a great expansion of the

803
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,200
mission for biohacking village or

804
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,919
something similar

805
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,360
implement military civilian

806
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,279
collaboration for biodefense one of the

807
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:09,039
things that i think is

808
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:11,039
tough about government is that it kind

809
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:12,880
of has always been somewhat siloed and

810
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,640
if you say the word defense

811
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,880
as in biodefense it immediately means

812
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,320
you're you're in the defense industry

813
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,919
you're talking to defense contractors

814
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:22,240
well what about biodefensive health so i

815
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,000
so i think the idea is you know should

816
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,159
we have we heart hackers collaborations

817
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:28,720
specifically for medicine with the dod

818
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,159
in a similar way that they have on with

819
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:32,400
fda and there of course there are

820
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,840
hacker collaborations with the dod but

821
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:34,960
i'm talking specifically about

822
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,600
biodefense

823
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,039
prioritize innovation over

824
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:41,600
incrementalism in medical countermeasure

825
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,919
development um

826
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:44,960
you know as somebody who's been a

827
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,000
federal cio i i can tell you that the

828
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,520
the procurement process from the federal

829
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,799
government it makes it very hard to

830
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:52,400
implement uh to innovate

831
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,440
it makes it hard to innovate and

832
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,279
implement and that you've got this this

833
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:56,960
you know these large beltway bandits and

834
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,279
these huge contracting rules and you

835
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:00,880
know i don't like that google cloud

836
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,159
didn't get picked for this i'm going to

837
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:04,080
sue and all that type of stuff

838
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,440
i think they should come to defcon i

839
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,640
think they should work with individuals

840
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,919
i think they should work with cottage

841
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:09,679
industries and small businesses and i

842
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:10,640
think that's where they'll find the

843
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,919
innovation and the progress that they

844
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:13,600
need

845
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,039
i recommend lead the way towards

846
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:17,279
establishing a functional agile

847
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:18,559
global public

848
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:20,880
health response apparatus we need one

849
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,880
that's secure we need one that's safe

850
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,880
and we need one that's trusted again

851
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,399
something that the experts in this room

852
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:28,960
know something about

853
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,080
so

854
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,840
and bottom line we really can no longer

855
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,200
afford a public health system that's

856
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,960
ultimately a silly movie about people

857
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,440
behaving badly uh we just didn't get it

858
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,559
this time and a lot of people died

859
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:39,840
because of it but we can learn from it

860
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,279
and we have to

861
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:43,039
so in closing you know we need to apply

862
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:44,480
we heart hackers to pandemic

863
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,159
preparedness and biodefense including

864
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:48,320
public-private partnerships formally and

865
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,320
informally hardening our defenses of

866
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,159
biotechnology and pandemic information

867
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:53,120
systems

868
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,120
collaborating with the medical and the

869
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,120
scientific military

870
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,799
we must find a way to coordinate

871
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:01,360
messaging and amplify messaging on the

872
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,799
internet popular that aren't

873
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:04,799
self-inflicted wounds like we should

874
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:06,799
have boosters we don't need boosters we

875
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:08,960
have to stop that we must improve

876
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,399
surveillance and be willing to deploy

877
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:11,679
cyber counter measures when we know

878
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:13,279
there's something wrong you know with

879
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:15,360
this thing with the biden you know by

880
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,559
talking about misinformation everybody

881
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:17,840
kept talking about these eight channels

882
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,279
of these 11 channels and all i got to

883
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:20,960
say is if you can prove it why are they

884
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,159
still up

885
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:23,679
and then lastly we need the equivalent

886
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:25,360
of certified social engineering uh

887
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,360
prevention specialists and such frequent

888
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,320
for disinformation for making this work

889
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,159
thanks for having me today i enjoyed

890
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:33,440
giving this talk hope you enjoyed

891
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,440
hearing it now i look forward to taking

892
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:39,720
your questions thank you very much peace
