1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,520
right hi everybody welcome to our talk

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,080
building an ics pie range in our kitchen

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,520
sharing our journey in lessons learned

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:08,880
so you don't have to

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,200
we have roughly 30 minutes to introduce

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,240
you to our

7
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,080
little project and give you some of the

8
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,679
details and

9
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:17,119
most importantly also of course the

10
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:19,039
challenges and difficulties we had along

11
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:19,680
the way

12
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,119
of building a firing range um

13
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:25,760
just wanted to take some time before to

14
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,480
introduce

15
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,679
myself and mort's here next to me

16
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,920
and also at the company i'm starting

17
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,520
with myself my name is nico

18
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,960
i've been working in the i.t security

19
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,399
for 15 years

20
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,399
um and now i'm the penetration testing

21
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:42,840
and red team lead for enviso in

22
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,320
germany hi my name is thomas

23
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,320
i've been with eviezo for over a year

24
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,719
now and i've been mostly involved in

25
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:51,760
this

26
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,840
r d project that we are going to present

27
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,399
today right

28
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,160
a few words about nviso as a company

29
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,239
and was originally founded in in belgium

30
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:04,640
in 2013

31
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,360
and then in 2018 we opened the offices

32
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,520
in germany in frankfurt in munich

33
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,400
and currently we're counting over 100

34
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,000
specialized security expert

35
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,280
from all areas of id security really um

36
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,280
and one point i wanted to highlight here

37
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,640
is the involvement in

38
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,799
research and development projects so

39
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:23,759
from the

40
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,400
annual revenue of the company we invest

41
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,360
roughly 10

42
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,920
into rd projects which is relevant for

43
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,600
this project because it's been partly

44
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,400
funded

45
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,920
as well by this of course and it helped

46
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:36,479
us a lot

47
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,040
to develop as well and try out some

48
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,720
things and make sure that they work as

49
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,040
we

50
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,560
as we wanted them to be

51
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,840
and this is how it all started was what

52
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,040
made us um

53
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,079
what motivated us to to build the ics

54
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,040
firing range

55
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,079
as it is nowadays it all started

56
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:58,399
towards the end of last year where we we

57
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,079
did some external trainings on ics

58
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,280
security or

59
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,840
dt security and we realized that there

60
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,040
is an abundance

61
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,080
of of skills and knowledge that we we

62
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,520
need to acquire and also to share

63
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,038
internally in the team

64
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:14,160
um for our pentester and red teamers

65
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,840
most of them of course they come from

66
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,360
from being coming from

67
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,840
the i.t world so they they don't have

68
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,560
any

69
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,200
didn't have any exposure to ot

70
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,239
environments and ics systems so far

71
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:27,760
and as you can imagine there are

72
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,280
differences between

73
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,879
for example doing pen testing against

74
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,480
iot systems

75
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,360
and ot systems so different requirements

76
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,000
in either

77
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,879
case so there was a really really um a

78
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:39,920
strong requirement

79
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,080
for our team to to get trained in that

80
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,080
respect you know to develop that

81
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,360
level of awareness in 4it

82
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,840
environments so we we thought about you

83
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,120
know what's the best way to do it

84
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,440
um to maybe develop a lab that we can

85
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,040
use internally where we do have a couple

86
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,560
of ot components

87
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,159
where people can try out different

88
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:59,599
techniques and just see how they

89
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,440
they react how they react in that

90
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,720
environment

91
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,560
so that was one of the main reasons and

92
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,000
of course having a lab um

93
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,080
once that is already built we can use it

94
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,680
for research and development where we

95
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,080
evaluate specific protocols for example

96
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,360
or components

97
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,040
um but also we can use it for testing

98
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,599
itself so if we if we're engaged in ics

99
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,360
security testing we can maybe isolate or

100
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,440
t components and test them

101
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,599
in our lab that would be then ready for

102
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,040
that purpose

103
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,080
the first concept idea was building

104
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,080
a water treatment plant that is

105
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,000
comprised of a three-stage water

106
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,319
filtration system where water is left

107
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,720
with three stages until it is then

108
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,360
then cleaned that of course is all

109
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,040
driven by pumping stations

110
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,400
for the various filtration system stages

111
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,000
and in the back we will have a fully

112
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,159
virtualized i.t network to also

113
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:51,200
simulate the enterprise part um

114
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,360
that you would find in a water treatment

115
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,879
plant

116
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,560
this is how it first looked like on the

117
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,640
left-hand side you see the schema of how

118
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,480
the filtration would work so the water

119
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,360
runs through

120
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,000
all the three stages and then ends up in

121
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,920
that quality assurance part

122
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,840
on the right hand side where we do have

123
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,920
sensors to measure the quality of the

124
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,640
water

125
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,319
and if we determine that the water isn't

126
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,319
clean yet then we would

127
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:16,959
go send it back to the first

128
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,160
refrigeration stage and

129
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,720
let it run through it again and we did

130
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,079
for the proof of concepts

131
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,800
we did that with food coloring i also

132
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,240
had food colored water send it for the

133
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,199
stages and then

134
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,600
in the end it would be clean um or not

135
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,199
and then it would reiterate

136
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,440
through the stages as well on the right

137
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,160
hand side you see the basic setup of the

138
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,560
ot components as well that are included

139
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,479
in that model so we do have a plc a

140
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,639
siemens plc that is specifically

141
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,720
but we also have a couple of raspberry

142
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,720
pi's running quarters to simulate the

143
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,520
plc's

144
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,600
that we might have in addition to drive

145
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,960
the pumps for example

146
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,000
for the qa control and so on

147
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,199
and i'm showing you that that first

148
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,360
prototype of an ics firing range i'm

149
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,800
just going to show you this

150
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:11,840
video very briefly

151
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,120
once we were in progress of building

152
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,720
that lab i think we were pretty much

153
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,240
halfway already you've seen interests in

154
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,120
action now

155
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,720
uh we were contacted by one of our

156
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,800
partners that's cwd

157
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,360
in the netherlands and they got to talk

158
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:35,840
to

159
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,840
alex batastadt which is the ministry of

160
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,440
infrastructure and water management

161
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,919
in the netherlands and they they

162
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:43,360
required

163
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,400
a a model or a lab environment for their

164
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,240
forensics team to

165
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,560
to train their techniques and also you

166
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,759
know develop some of the

167
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,600
the skills that they need in their field

168
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,440
of expertise one of the things they do

169
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,199
in the netherlands is operating

170
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,680
basket bridges for example so this was a

171
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,960
prime example for us

172
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,600
um to to use as a as a model because

173
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,000
it's something that um

174
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,759
i think we can get an idea of how it's

175
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:12,639
working it's maybe something that can be

176
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,280
simulated and it's also very very

177
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,319
visible

178
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,800
then as well their requirement is trick

179
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,240
requirements were

180
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,680
having a mobile solution because they

181
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,280
wanted to move it between sites

182
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,160
and then of course come with a workshop

183
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:26,880
that is

184
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,600
a scenario base so the basket bridge

185
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,400
that we

186
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,280
were meant to build that should be

187
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,400
should be used in a way that is

188
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,080
versatile enough to run different

189
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,000
scenarios for different

190
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,120
forensic teams for example and this is

191
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,800
where the journey began

192
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,199
of building this bridge and most is

193
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:46,800
going to run you through the concepts

194
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,880
and the details of

195
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,400
how we came to the model that we

196
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,240
currently have so right

197
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,080
um as nico said we now changed from

198
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,520
the the first contacts that we had in

199
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,440
the first scenario water treatment plant

200
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,759
to the basket bridge and it just turns

201
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:02,960
out that this is

202
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,639
of course part of critical

203
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,639
infrastructure and it's not that easy to

204
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,880
get good information about this online

205
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,960
so i would like to give a very short but

206
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,800
brief and very nice shout out to the

207
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,720
lovely folks over at the florida

208
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,319
department of transportation

209
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,560
which were nice enough to make a bridge

210
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,319
maintenance reference manual privately

211
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,639
and freely available

212
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,160
and this really contained a lot of

213
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,759
useful information so thanks to those

214
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,039
guys

215
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:29,440
and here you can see our first 2d

216
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,120
concept drawing that we came up with

217
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:31,919
right

218
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,479
so here you can see we basically have

219
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:34,960
two

220
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,240
sides of a bridge they both have a leaf

221
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,120
and a counterweight on the ground and on

222
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,000
top of the road

223
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,080
we also have some traffic indicators we

224
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,440
have a traffic light

225
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,720
and we have also roads barriers

226
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,520
that then should actually block some

227
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,520
cars removing right

228
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,840
so we had this idea and we then

229
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,800
transferred it

230
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,680
to a 3d concept so how were we going to

231
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,960
build this

232
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,160
you can see a very brief a very very

233
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,039
short and

234
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,520
simplified representation of our 3d

235
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,479
concept

236
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,720
so here we got an aluminum frame on

237
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,479
wheels basically

238
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:15,039
it's divided divided into two parts in

239
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:16,479
the front you have the o2

240
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:19,840
ot components mounted onto a steel

241
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,479
plate and in the back there are some

242
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:23,840
some black wooden panels

243
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,160
now but in the back there's space for a

244
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,720
virtualization server that we can use to

245
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,720
host uh different networks and different

246
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,000
systems on

247
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,559
and on the top there we have our 3d

248
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,120
model

249
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,599
of our scenario those bridges that we

250
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,039
transferred from the 2d

251
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,240
concept drawing well we had this

252
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,560
but we wanted to build it right so we

253
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,600
did this

254
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,240
using the lovely magic of 3d printing

255
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,200
and

256
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,040
due to covet we couldn't do this in the

257
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,560
office and

258
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,720
we wanted to do quick iterations though

259
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,839
so we had to do this

260
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:58,720
at home and uh in my kitchen actually

261
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,240
much to the dismay of my wife to be

262
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,120
honest

263
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,600
it was noisy it took up a lot of space

264
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,560
but it was

265
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,319
worth it to be honest it was really cool

266
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,880
so what did we do with that um well we

267
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,760
started working

268
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,920
on the mechanical challenges here we can

269
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,880
see a

270
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,000
a very simple axle holder right

271
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,800
here we got a bearing that is mounted

272
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,680
between

273
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,080
a clamp more or less and that's fixed

274
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,519
with some screws

275
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:27,200
here are actually two iterations of the

276
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,480
same part and this actually

277
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,440
represented some challenges to us um one

278
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,200
of those being okay if you want to use

279
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,080
screws um

280
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,800
how big should those holes be because

281
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,519
you don't

282
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,760
want the the screw to just fall out

283
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,120
again because it's not tight enough but

284
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,080
you don't want to

285
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,839
have the plastic brake because it's too

286
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:47,120
tight right

287
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,200
um also you need to find out okay how

288
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,600
can we hold other parts with 3d

289
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,240
with 3d printed parts so we had to

290
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:54,880
figure this

291
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,600
this out but once we did figure this out

292
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,959
and we're satisfied with the

293
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:01,600
results we can then just proceed with

294
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,959
other challenges so

295
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:05,839
how would we use two of those axles and

296
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:06,240
do

297
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,680
and then so how would we print two of

298
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,279
those axles and connect those to

299
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:12,880
something in between that

300
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,200
can actually make use of this axle so

301
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,720
what you can see here is

302
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,480
more or less the center part of a bridge

303
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,240
leaf and then we

304
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,880
also want to control this right so we

305
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,839
have to attach

306
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:25,600
some kind of stepper motor to it and

307
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,519
then you have to engineer some gears

308
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,040
that you attach to it

309
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,200
and let me tell you this took quite some

310
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,720
iterations but we

311
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:37,839
kind of got it really really nice um

312
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,640
so but when you when you 3d print you

313
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,000
will run into problems

314
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,320
and so did we of course one of our

315
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,600
problems was just the

316
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,240
infamous spaghetti print this is just a

317
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,160
result of very poor bed adhesion as we

318
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,120
learned

319
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,600
and we just solved this by using a

320
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,360
mirror as a print bed and turns

321
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,760
out that this greatly increases bed

322
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,040
adhesion

323
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,240
another problem was warping so uh here a

324
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,920
3d printed part just cooled down

325
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,240
mid-print and then it came loose and

326
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,079
went places it turns out if you

327
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:12,880
make sure that you maintain a steady and

328
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,680
constant

329
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,000
temperature in the environment this will

330
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,519
probably not happen

331
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,880
so what we did was just get a nice and

332
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,279
big

333
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,320
enclosure for this for this 3d printer

334
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,040
and we also did some tests with abs and

335
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,240
pla

336
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,240
and found out that if you especially if

337
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,320
you mix between and change between those

338
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,399
filaments that you will run into

339
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:35,680
problems with your nozzles

340
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,320
so just changing them may help um

341
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,560
mitigating the problem of

342
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,680
of irregular extrusion of filament and

343
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,320
this was really a problem

344
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,600
um but yeah eventually eventually we got

345
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,720
to a point

346
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,160
where we could easily and and

347
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,399
steadily print new parts and here you

348
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:57,600
can see our

349
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,079
cad model of our vision of what the

350
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:01,279
bridge should look like

351
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,680
and actually some printed parts of it so

352
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,320
those were

353
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,320
very nice wins once we had those and

354
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,000
once we could assemble those to a full

355
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,560
model

356
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,079
and this actually is our full model but

357
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:13,839
what do you do when you have this full

358
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:15,360
model of course you have to put it all

359
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,320
together right

360
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,160
and that's what we did so we got this

361
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,079
full model actually we built two and we

362
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:21,920
printed two which took hours and hours

363
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,760
and hours

364
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,760
but then of course we we had to assemble

365
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,880
it into a

366
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,040
into a finished and then complete and

367
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,519
then and then also usable and mobile

368
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:34,480
ics lab so what you can see here is our

369
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,240
aluminum frame structure with the

370
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,040
metal plate for the ocs components built

371
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,160
onto it

372
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,560
and then of course we installed the ot

373
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,959
components onto it with an awful lot of

374
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:48,000
awful wiring to be honest

375
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,079
then we just installed the 3d models on

376
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:51,120
top of it

377
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,040
using some spaces that we printed and

378
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,240
designed

379
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,800
and bolting those to the to the wooden

380
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,399
plank there

381
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:01,279
and you know just for fancy points we

382
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:02,399
added those panels

383
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:03,760
also that you cannot reach into it

384
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,519
during operation of course but it looks

385
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:06,079
fancy

386
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:09,040
in my opinion um and of course you need

387
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,079
some lighting right

388
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,079
because if it's not very very very

389
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:13,680
bright inside

390
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,360
then you also want to have some lighting

391
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,720
in there so you can actually take a look

392
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,760
inside

393
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,839
or else it's really gonna get really

394
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:21,360
dark in there

395
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,760
and then well lastly we did a lot of

396
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,480
debugging

397
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,560
a lot of software debugging and hardware

398
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,600
debugging and this ate up a lot of time

399
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,519
so really so if you want to build

400
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,360
something something similar something

401
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,079
like this

402
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,920
just plan ahead of time that you will

403
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,320
use a lot of time for debugging stuff

404
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,160
will break and this will take a lot of

405
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,880
time to fix

406
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,880
but let's go into detail about the

407
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,800
components that are in there right

408
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,360
so first of all maybe most importantly

409
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,680
we got the hmi for the bridge control

410
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,839
um this actually represents all the

411
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:56,160
movable and controllable parts

412
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,440
of the bridge model on top right so for

413
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,600
everything like the lights and for the

414
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,000
movable

415
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,760
parts like the bridge leaf and the

416
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,120
barriers you've got

417
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,880
individual controls that actually

418
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,040
display their current status

419
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,319
color-coded text

420
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:14,079
so that's nice to have and actually we

421
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:16,399
pre-programmed it so that you can

422
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,320
tap onto them and control the whole

423
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,120
setup using just the hmi

424
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,959
of course this needs to be powered right

425
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:24,880
we got power supplies for

426
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,519
5 volts 12 volts and 24 volts these

427
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:29,360
power then are plc's

428
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,720
here we got a big s7 1500 plc

429
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,079
that coordinates the other plc's um

430
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:38,959
we got the s7 1200 plc's that drive the

431
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:40,560
drive all of the motors

432
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,920
and the s7 300 plc the legendary plc

433
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:44,880
that

434
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,480
controls the lights and of course

435
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,320
an awful lot of the wiring was due to

436
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,920
the motor drivers for the

437
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,760
leaves and barriers and if you could see

438
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,360
the insides of those cable tunnels you

439
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,279
would be shocked to see how much cable

440
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,360
fits into such a small place

441
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,360
last but not least we also got some

442
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,760
raspberry pis for the cctvs that are

443
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,040
mounted on top of the

444
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,680
bridge model

445
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,639
now having the 3d model printed and all

446
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,160
the writing done already with the ot

447
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,360
components the next

448
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,360
step in that process would be the entire

449
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,279
entire ide infrastructure

450
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:21,920
in the back as you remember so the idea

451
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,320
of of this lab is also to have it

452
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,720
for for workshops specifically for

453
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,839
forensic workshops

454
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:30,079
so we do need that simulation of an

455
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:31,519
enterprise network for example in the

456
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:32,880
scada network

457
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:37,279
to realistically work on

458
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:38,959
attacks that might have happened against

459
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:40,880
a basket bridge

460
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,000
to then investigate what went what was

461
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,120
going on

462
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,399
in that case um so um on that in that

463
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:48,800
model

464
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,399
um there is space for virtualization

465
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:51,839
server

466
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:55,199
and what we did is deploy

467
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:56,959
this infrastructure on it for that it

468
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:58,480
infrastructure part so comprised of the

469
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,079
enterprise network where we do have a

470
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:01,360
domain controller

471
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,360
we also have office workstations and a

472
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,519
visualization server which

473
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:07,680
then gets its data from a historian that

474
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,360
is running in the scada network and in

475
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,480
the top of this

476
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,600
this slide here um in in the scada

477
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,160
network

478
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,160
as well we have the operator workstation

479
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,279
where we can

480
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:19,839
observe and supervise the the bridge and

481
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:20,959
check the status of

482
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:23,600
of the the plcs for example but also

483
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,320
control it

484
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,680
remotely via the hmi we get access to

485
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,720
the camera feeds of the cctvs

486
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,240
next to the operator workstation we do

487
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,440
have the engineering workstation where

488
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,240
we have

489
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,600
tier deployed

490
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,320
the tool to then deploy the ladder logic

491
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,240
to the plc's

492
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,440
but also maintain the dot components

493
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,199
as such from there on

494
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:52,079
we connected we are connected to the

495
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:53,440
lower levels of the the bridge

496
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,040
infrastructure so this is not

497
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,639
virtualized anymore that is where we

498
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,160
actually have connected the

499
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,680
plc's um with the centralized

500
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:05,199
plc in the area supervision control

501
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:08,319
level including the hdmi that you did

502
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,319
see on the screens before for the manual

503
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,919
but also automatic control of the bridge

504
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:12,959
components

505
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,520
we do have the cctvs which are

506
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,039
essentially just pi cams

507
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:19,119
connected to the raspberry pi's of that

508
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:20,559
model

509
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:22,400
and then on the lower levels we have the

510
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,480
three different pcs to control the

511
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,319
barriers but also the leaf

512
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:30,160
motors to get the to change the lights

513
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,440
from green to red and so on this entire

514
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,240
mit and ot infrastructure then serves as

515
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,240
the basis for a scenario that we carry

516
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:38,799
out

517
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:40,960
in preparation for a for example for a

518
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,799
forensics workshop

519
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:44,559
the idea was really that we we go

520
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:45,919
through all the levels of the purging

521
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:46,880
model

522
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,799
to simulate an attack as it would most

523
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,720
likely be in a real life scenario

524
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,640
so you can assume that for example a

525
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,400
workstation in the enterprise zone is

526
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,360
compromised

527
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,280
through an email where then the

528
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,480
attackers

529
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,799
deploy beacons that communicate to a c2

530
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:01,520
server

531
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,160
somewhere outside then at some point the

532
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,400
attackers

533
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,000
once say they got that initial photo

534
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,600
they they probably they escalate the

535
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,520
local privileges

536
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,600
do some credential harvesting too funny

537
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,120
then get access to the scada network

538
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,559
where we do find the

539
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:18,720
operator's workstation but also the

540
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,320
engineering workstation with the

541
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,919
tier portal on it assuming that maybe

542
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:25,120
it's not fully patched

543
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,960
that could be one of the scenarios then

544
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,400
we can exploit some vulnerabilities

545
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,080
against the engineering workstation

546
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,240
gain access to it gain also access to

547
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,840
the leather logic we can then

548
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:37,280
deploy any arbitrary code

549
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,919
really on the plc that might cause some

550
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,160
disruption to the bridge operation

551
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,720
but also maybe severe harm to actually

552
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,480
the the people using the bridge so

553
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,720
just imagine that if cars are driving

554
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,320
over the bridge you you slowly

555
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,320
lift the leaves so there might be

556
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,520
accidents happening then

557
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,559
in that case that's the um

558
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,880
that's the scenario idea of our ics

559
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,720
firing lab so really

560
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,640
that's an attack that already took place

561
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,400
and then in the next step the forensics

562
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:04,960
team

563
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,320
would get their hands on the lab and

564
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,320
would need to investigate what happened

565
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,679
there

566
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:12,240
and so much talking now we're going to

567
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:12,960
show you the

568
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,000
the lab now um in the demo so the real

569
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,360
app that we actually built

570
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,679
and just give you a few ideas on what's

571
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:24,559
going on there

572
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:28,080
this is the complete 3d model now with

573
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:28,720
all the ot

574
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,720
components connected you do see once

575
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,600
it's powering on you see the hdmi

576
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,240
turning on you see the plc's already

577
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,200
blinking

578
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,200
they're also booting up they're all

579
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,880
connected by ethernet

580
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,520
together so they um also with a with a

581
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,559
server

582
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,400
behind the uh the steep plate that you

583
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,039
see there now we should see

584
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:52,559
the hdmi ui also being displayed in a

585
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:53,840
second there it is

586
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,360
and this is now where the bridge

587
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,280
automatically starts into its cycle so

588
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,000
that is just

589
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,160
sort of for demo purposes right now we

590
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,000
just cycle through the entire process

591
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,360
every 30 seconds

592
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,640
starting with the leaves lifting

593
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,960
and then the the lights going on for the

594
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,480
the ships and boats to pass with the

595
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,280
bridge

596
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,520
uh you can see in the in the hmi on the

597
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,799
left-hand side

598
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,640
that this is now green so that means the

599
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,000
leaves are open

600
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,240
the traffic lights are green so the

601
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,600
ships can pass

602
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,000
and soon the the lights will go red

603
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,200
again the leaves

604
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,200
lower and once they have done that

605
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,840
and in a second we'll see the barriers

606
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,200
go up just any second now

607
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,880
the barrier is going up you can't see

608
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,320
the lights for the cast unfortunately

609
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,679
but you can see it in hdmi that they

610
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:41,280
switch green as well

611
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,360
um and now they're the cars can drive

612
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,960
this is the automatic mode

613
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,760
you can at any time go into the the

614
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,200
manual mode

615
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,600
and then operate any of those components

616
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,200
manually really so you can just

617
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,760
lift one of the leaves or the other one

618
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,039
and then it varies

619
00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:02,080
in whatever sequence you like

620
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,919
so let's get to the lessons learned

621
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:05,840
because there were quite some few

622
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:06,799
lessons to be learned

623
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:09,039
to be honest well let's start with the

624
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:10,240
ics lab setup

625
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,400
um to be honest designing this stuff

626
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,240
yourself you have to account for

627
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,159
the assembly of how you're going to

628
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,880
reach parts of how you are going to

629
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,159
to connect them how to put them into

630
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:22,960
place

631
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,840
we didn't really take this into account

632
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:26,880
and then had some

633
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,440
some problems some issues with really

634
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,080
complex

635
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,600
assembly it just took a lot of time

636
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,120
maintenance was hell

637
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,679
don't do this think of this ahead of

638
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:36,960
time this really

639
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,840
pays this is really good during research

640
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,039
of course we had to find

641
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:44,000
out then which hardware um has which

642
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,600
dependencies and which uh

643
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,280
compatibilities

644
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,600
this really required a lot of digging

645
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,799
through data sheets

646
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:52,400
uh you have to acquire those you have to

647
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,000
read those you have to understand those

648
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,280
you know if you're not an expert and we

649
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,440
have by no means

650
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,559
experts in this field this will take

651
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:01,200
your time

652
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,679
take this into account too and of course

653
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:05,360
if you want to use industrial hardware

654
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,240
you will

655
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,600
have to pay for licenses right

656
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,480
especially the the ides they come with

657
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,320
with heavy licenses

658
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,480
um and the practical issue just was that

659
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,280
we managed to kill two stepper motors

660
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,240
by overheating we supplied too many amps

661
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:22,799
and

662
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,799
did not really get rid of all the heat

663
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:26,080
we didn't manage to dissipate

664
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,280
at all and they just died on us and

665
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,360
this this was really really bad because

666
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,720
then you have to order new ones and you

667
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,480
have to install those again and

668
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,799
you know as i said the the assembly was

669
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:38,000
not really straightforward

670
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,840
so this just took a lot of time was

671
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,320
unnecessary but hey this happens

672
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,280
uh regarding 3d printing well as i

673
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,880
pointed out earlier

674
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,520
there will be mechanical design that

675
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,480
will be challenging

676
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,080
if you're not a mechanical engineer and

677
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,320
again by no means we are we are

678
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:57,360
mechanical engineers right um what you

679
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,120
saw in our setup was

680
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,440
not very very very complex i mean it was

681
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,799
just an accident right and

682
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:05,200
and two gears that drove this axle you

683
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,960
have no idea how long it took to just

684
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,799
build this and to test this out until it

685
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:10,640
just worked so if you're not very

686
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,440
familiar with it

687
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,640
again i think of it ahead of time

688
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,200
also if you want to iterate quickly you

689
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,799
have to take into account that printing

690
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:20,960
is really time consuming

691
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,880
overall just one side of those bridges

692
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,960
took multiple hundreds of hours to print

693
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,440
like they were about 200 hours to print

694
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,559
just one side

695
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,799
so the whole setup was about 400 hours

696
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:32,159
of printing time

697
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:34,480
so this is insane for quick iterations

698
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,400
well print small parts and test them

699
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,360
right

700
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,320
um also if you're not familiar with cad

701
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,120
yet

702
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,760
well um i suggest you will because this

703
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,360
is really the preferred

704
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,799
choice uh you can parametrize everything

705
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:51,679
and you can make quick but very

706
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:53,679
consistent changes to your designs

707
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:56,480
you can just iterate better with this um

708
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,360
in my opinion it's better suited than

709
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,159
let's say creative software like blender

710
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:04,640
for 3d modeling because this will give

711
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,520
you other problems right

712
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,640
and to to to add some numbers to our

713
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,520
uh to our project well we started in

714
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,880
january 2020

715
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,440
and we invested more than 1 000 hours of

716
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,000
manual work

717
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,400
into this and more than 900 hours of

718
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,400
printing time into this

719
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,600
well i just said we it took about 400

720
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,640
hours of

721
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,720
printing all the components that make up

722
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,559
our bridge scenario right

723
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:31,840
well of course we had to do a lot of

724
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,880
prototyping i have a huge box of failed

725
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,039
prints or prototyping prints

726
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:38,799
uh still in my kitchen laying around

727
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:40,559
there

728
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:43,600
taking up space again but anyways um

729
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:47,039
we also processed about

730
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:50,480
15 pounds of filament so take this into

731
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,919
account

732
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:54,080
as i said the software licenses are kind

733
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,679
of pricey well they are

734
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:57,840
we used the tia portal first for the

735
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,120
siemens plcs

736
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,440
which cost us in total three and three

737
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,039
thousand five hundred us dollars

738
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:06,000
um all the hardware combined cost

739
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,200
roughly

740
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,400
well 14k us dollars and you know for all

741
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:10,799
the

742
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:13,200
the coffee that we that we just consumed

743
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,159
during this this

744
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:16,480
project it was roughly about 570 us

745
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,159
dollars i know it's highly specific but

746
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:18,799
just rough

747
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:21,520
estimate right um and then of course we

748
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,159
broke stuff

749
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:24,400
as i said we broke two stepper motors we

750
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,440
actually managed to

751
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,159
break one plc and today just i'm so

752
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:29,760
today i'm not quite sure how i managed

753
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,240
to do this but this happened

754
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,159
after i replaced it everything was okay

755
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:35,600
so i think that's nice

756
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,080
um one motor driver died in the process

757
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,200
due to

758
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,400
wrong wiring but hey that happens and of

759
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:42,799
course

760
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:44,960
at several occasions we just lost our

761
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,520
sanity on the line right so

762
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,760
if you're going to go into such projects

763
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,440
and work on those and you are

764
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,279
not that familiar with all the technical

765
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:54,559
aspects

766
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:56,880
well uh you will have problems and you

767
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,320
will pay with your sanity

768
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,840
i hope that you got a good idea of of

769
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,840
what we had to go through in the past

770
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,159
six or seven months um and i hope that

771
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:09,600
you found this interesting and maybe

772
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,360
there's something for you as well to to

773
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,640
take away from it

774
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,039
um in any way if you are interested in

775
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:15,919
in this process

776
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:17,679
project specifically or if you are

777
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:19,279
working on a similar project and just

778
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:19,840
you know

779
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,720
do some follow-up questions uh feel free

780
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,320
to reach out to other

781
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,360
modes myself anytime also i wanted to

782
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,400
point you

783
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,120
at the musical region to ics security so

784
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:31,840
we do have that

785
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:35,279
that ics page there please have a look

786
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:35,840
at it

787
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,679
and maybe there's something else for you

788
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:40,400
there and again reach out to us

789
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,880
if there's more you want to know about

790
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,799
and last but not least

791
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:46,559
we do have a couple of blog posts coming

792
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:48,240
out um for this

793
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,799
ics firing range um so we want to go

794
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:52,400
more into detail of

795
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,799
of how the development went show some of

796
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:56,080
the close-ups maybe some of the

797
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,400
schematics and how the wiring works

798
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,760
and more specifically how the attack

799
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,440
scenario that we envisioned

800
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,799
comes together in that lab and also with

801
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:07,279
some more detail describe the the actual

802
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:08,640
uh difficulties

803
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,440
we had just forever to see and share

804
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,120
with the community as well

805
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,080
um thanks very much for joining and have

806
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,159
a great

807
00:27:17,159 --> 00:27:20,159
day
