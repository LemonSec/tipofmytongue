1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:03,040
hi my name is and i'm going to tell you

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,359
a bit more about fortifying ics

3
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:07,600
environments by applying harding and by

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,599
performing security testing

5
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:11,519
on those environments on those hardened

6
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:12,639
environments

7
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:15,200
um first little bit things about me i'm

8
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,239
active within uh

9
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:18,560
information security since 1998 and

10
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,160
within ics security since

11
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,199
uh almost uh 2008 so

12
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:25,920
mainly i'm doing uh or challenging ics

13
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,439
vendor solutions

14
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:29,279
to verify cyber security settings and

15
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,039
i'm also assisting in performing

16
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:33,280
security effort and start testing

17
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,520
for those vendors or for more and

18
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,040
customers

19
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,160
i'm also assisting end customers by

20
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,840
applying harming to those environments

21
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:42,960
or applying

22
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,680
harnett to the vendor solutions they

23
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,239
bought or they have

24
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:49,920
now a little bit more about fortifying

25
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,920
ics system systems so

26
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,320
it's also known as harding of course is

27
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,600
actually the process in which the

28
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,520
balance between usability and security

29
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,399
of a system is researched and enforced

30
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,000
so why would you think of doing harming

31
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,479
on ics systems first of all well

32
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,560
the more the systems are interconnected

33
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,520
the more

34
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,200
there are potentially attack factors of

35
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,640
those systems so

36
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,479
hardening is the process in which we can

37
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:16,080
try to reduce the attack factors of

38
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,200
those systems

39
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,520
uh we can try to reinforce the exposed

40
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,439
systems if there are any

41
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:24,840
and also securing our mode axis or

42
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,080
limiting

43
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,280
user access or verifying or

44
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,920
making operator jail protections more

45
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,280
foolproof

46
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,840
so that i cannot escape from the

47
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,360
operator gels

48
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,439
in question um when would you do harming

49
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:42,159
well

50
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,159
during projects of course when there's

51
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,280
new systems applied

52
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,840
or when there's refurbished systems um

53
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,600
into the environment

54
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,520
or when you're upgrading or applying or

55
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,720
installing

56
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,640
a new software component or hardware

57
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,119
component to the environment

58
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:58,640
most of the times if you cannot do it

59
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,240
during projects you can

60
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,759
try to do it at the next maintenance

61
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:04,159
stop but then you'll probably

62
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,560
have to have done some hardening

63
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,959
verification before that

64
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:10,399
as most of the times the next

65
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,080
maintenance stops are

66
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,120
sometimes too limited to perform the

67
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,720
proper hardening and testing of the

68
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,640
harmed environment

69
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,319
another reason why would you or when you

70
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:21,920
do harning is to close identified

71
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,959
security weaknesses

72
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,319
so if you perform security testing

73
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,000
within your environment

74
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,080
you often almost always you often find

75
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,040
security weaknesses

76
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,720
to close those identified security

77
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,959
weaknesses sometimes patching

78
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,200
can be insufficient or not possible and

79
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,800
that's the time when you would

80
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,720
apply harding to those systems as well

81
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,640
how would you do harming of course while

82
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,000
performing hardening can

83
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,800
can be done in three big different ways

84
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,400
so manually first applying

85
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,239
every single setting by manually so

86
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:57,760
changing register keys

87
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,640
removing software applying other

88
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,599
settings to your

89
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,920
system or you can create scripts to do

90
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:04,879
so

91
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:07,519
to assist you in doing your harding or

92
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,200
you can use group policies that can be

93
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,120
either local group policies or

94
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,440
uh central uh control group policies if

95
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,680
you have for example an active directory

96
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,360
so that's the the main difference

97
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,640
between domain join systems and

98
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,959
non-domain join systems

99
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:22,800
but in both occasions you can use group

100
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,040
policies either locally or

101
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,799
centrally um and a big question now is

102
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:30,239
how not to perform learning well

103
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:30,799
actually

104
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:32,799
harming is not a click and play

105
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:34,319
configuration so

106
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:37,920
you cannot just take a script run it

107
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,440
and hope that everything still will work

108
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,680
that's something that some of the

109
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,360
vendors i've been working with during

110
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,400
hiring processes

111
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,799
are doing it wrong they just take the

112
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:49,519
scripts that

113
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,239
were published for a certain hardening

114
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:53,439
guideline

115
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,360
but they didn't look at any setting

116
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,720
within the harming guidelines so they

117
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,159
failed to understand

118
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,480
what settings were applied or going to

119
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,480
be applied by using the script

120
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,360
so an example here is that a hardening

121
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,959
guideline i created for one of my

122
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:08,879
customers

123
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,840
was for a completely isolated system and

124
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,040
the vendor

125
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,640
was applied to that harding guideline

126
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,880
and the accompanying script

127
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:21,120
but that was for a connected system so

128
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,400
he applied the

129
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,400
completely isolated harming script to

130
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,160
the connected system

131
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,840
resulting in a loss of connection of

132
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,840
that system so that's why i mentioned

133
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,440
harming is certainly not a click and

134
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,280
play configuration

135
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,240
type approach that's sometimes works but

136
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,520
in most cases you'll

137
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,280
run into problems um before we continue

138
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,160
further you should

139
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,759
ask yourself your question so what is

140
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,440
your actual hardening strategy

141
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,840
so what systems or environments will you

142
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,759
harm

143
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,560
what systems or environments will you

144
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,000
harm first

145
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,240
so those are questions that need to be

146
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,759
answered before you

147
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,560
dig into the further harming process

148
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,160
there's also a list of potential

149
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,400
problems that you can run into

150
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,400
during the harning a lot of things can

151
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,840
go wrong for example

152
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,840
and the whole list here is no more

153
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,520
access to user interfaces no more access

154
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,520
to file shares printers so

155
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,960
no more access to file shares is

156
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,800
actually one of the most

157
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,000
um occurring issues

158
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,680
that that run into during harning

159
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,120
because well

160
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,840
they want to have file shares of course

161
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,919
hmi applications can stop working or

162
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:29,919
your system application can crash

163
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,280
even sometimes you can run it to domain

164
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:33,680
wide

165
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,880
problems so the domain can get down or

166
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,400
something like that

167
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,479
um another thing that to keep in mind is

168
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,840
that time difference with

169
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,800
time differences between systems uh need

170
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,400
to be sorted out properly as well

171
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,840
uh certainly if you if you're using ics

172
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,479
applications or hmi applications

173
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:55,360
the time need to be almost you know

174
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,039
completely the same actually

175
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:00,960
to prevent information and data loss

176
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,960
you can lose touchscreen functionality

177
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,240
if you disable the

178
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,720
use the touchscreen functions in the

179
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,479
operating system of course

180
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:12,160
and operators can lose access um so

181
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,240
the whole list of things that come wrong

182
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,680
is the key is here

183
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,360
that you should solve that problem that

184
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,520
particular ident isolated problem

185
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,039
or you should revert to a known good

186
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:23,600
state before

187
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,960
you start applying the harding

188
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,280
sometimes you have to live with some

189
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,039
settings that

190
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:34,080
are not as strong as they

191
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,400
should be for a particular environment

192
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,600
so sometimes you just

193
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,759
can't do anything else by accepting

194
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,840
those settings

195
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,520
so what's less likely to be hardened

196
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,440
well more and more black box systems

197
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,160
because

198
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,840
because those are often used as

199
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,360
guarantee buy-ins or lock-ins so the

200
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,800
vendor lock-in here

201
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,919
is uh can cause guarantee issues if

202
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:01,280
you try to touch or even change settings

203
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,960
on a black box system so

204
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,440
that's uh something to keep in mind so

205
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,160
the

206
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,800
the best thing to do then is try to

207
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,000
mitigate the

208
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,440
potential issues of that black box

209
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,280
systems in another way but we'll come to

210
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,039
that later on

211
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,720
other systems that are less likely to be

212
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,440
harmed as um office clients

213
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,800
because they need to be able to do

214
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,639
anything right

215
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:25,680
um by using legacy systems um it's often

216
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,720
the case that

217
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,400
people are really reluctant in touching

218
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,360
legacy stem systems because they do not

219
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,319
know the system

220
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,599
they cannot predict uh

221
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:39,360
what's going to happen if they don't if

222
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,880
they confront something on the legacy

223
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,280
system

224
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,360
here's the little flow chart that i

225
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,639
created um

226
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:49,120
for potential problems during hiring so

227
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:49,840
what

228
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,639
if you cannot perform the harding well

229
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:53,440
you have

230
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,000
at that stage an insecure system you

231
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,440
cannot do the harming so

232
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,840
then first thing to check is can you do

233
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,360
an upgrade of the system

234
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,319
if you can do well fine you'll end up

235
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,240
with a secure control system

236
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,400
if you cannot upgrade you might want to

237
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,800
look at if you can replace it or not

238
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,639
if he cannot replace it well then you

239
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:15,039
have to investigate if you can isolate

240
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:16,720
the system

241
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,879
but if you cannot do anything of those

242
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,560
so no hardening no upgrading no

243
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,759
replacing

244
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,840
no isolation well the thing is then uh

245
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,560
what

246
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,479
could go wrong well a lot of things can

247
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:30,879
go wrong of course

248
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:33,919
so what things would you harm uh you

249
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,839
have identified

250
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,120
that you want to do horny you have

251
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,479
identified the systems that you want to

252
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:39,519
do hardening

253
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,599
when you will do the harming and why you

254
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,800
will do the harding but now

255
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,959
the things that you want to do hardening

256
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,279
for so what

257
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,920
you have to define those as well so

258
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,800
actually

259
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,399
all things that could pose a risk to a

260
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,720
system are candidates for potential

261
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,640
harming meaning software

262
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,399
all installed software packages not only

263
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:03,920
the operating system software

264
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:08,160
but also additional packages services so

265
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,720
it's not only enough to

266
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,760
stop the service but it's also key to

267
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,120
investigate when uh it or if you can

268
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,360
disable services so that they cannot

269
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,160
start up again

270
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,200
after you have launched something else

271
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,600
so account policies user rights and

272
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,760
permission onto the operating system

273
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,920
network interface settings that is very

274
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,519
often forgotten about

275
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,600
that a lot of network interfaces keep

276
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,120
their default

277
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,800
bindings that's more on windows systems

278
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,880
of course there are default interface

279
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,800
bindings enabled

280
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,680
even if they do other style harning

281
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,760
those bindings are

282
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,800
left left present

283
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,560
remote administration solutions if there

284
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,480
is um

285
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,519
not fdp that's used often you have

286
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:56,240
erratman

287
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,519
you have teamviewer or other solutions

288
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:00,640
out there

289
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,320
teamviewer might not have been the best

290
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,800
example i gave but let's say cannot been

291
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,399
well it's often the case that

292
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,640
default erroratment installation it

293
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,839
might change already

294
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,399
but default uh configuration is not

295
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:13,440
always the best uh

296
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,160
configuration for your environment also

297
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,079
not to forget as peripheral port access

298
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:21,440
so usb ports serial ports

299
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,680
whatever ports there are there that are

300
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,480
not used

301
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,519
should be disabled of course

302
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,640
if you don't need for example usb data

303
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,040
storage you should disable usb desktop

304
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,279
data storage if you do not need

305
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,920
to install additional usb drivers for

306
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,680
keyboard mouse or

307
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,519
ethernet dongles or whatever disable

308
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,360
that possibility

309
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,600
just to prevent people from attaching

310
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,399
other usb devices that get

311
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,480
recognized on the system that you can

312
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,519
get access to the system by using those

313
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,000
um operating system access by using

314
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
operator gels

315
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,120
gave a talk on that a few years ago in

316
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,480
stockholm

317
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,839
but operated jail escaping is always

318
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:13,040
almost always possible but it depends on

319
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,959
the service account or user account the

320
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:16,640
application is running with

321
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,399
that will determine your access to the

322
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,079
further operating system

323
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:24,320
below so that's why applications should

324
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,160
first of all never run as administrator

325
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,880
access for example we insisted used to

326
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,160
need administrator level access so that

327
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:32,800
was a problem

328
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,560
already but by further protecting the

329
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,240
operator jail so by limiting

330
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,240
what the operator can do onto the

331
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,600
operating system

332
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,120
will further limit possible attack paths

333
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,320
into the system now

334
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,720
the learning process first of all you

335
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,000
begin with choosing

336
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
the right operating system for job

337
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,320
yeah normally you would have been able

338
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,360
to

339
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,120
select a good operating system based on

340
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,120
what the functionality needs

341
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,079
for the system but very often you are

342
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:08,079
forced into certain operating systems

343
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:10,480
based on what the vendor solution

344
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,600
requires

345
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,800
so today this is unfortunately very

346
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,279
often windows based operating systems

347
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,480
although the last versions are getting

348
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,800
more secure

349
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,560
which is good of course um

350
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,079
using custom operating systems

351
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:33,360
well that's problem when those systems

352
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,560
have a lot of functionality embedded

353
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,440
which are not always uh disabled by

354
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,079
default

355
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:42,480
so that's why we do the hard right and

356
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,600
of course sometimes you have to

357
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,880
sometimes you have to live with

358
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,720
using obsolete operating systems and

359
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,079
software

360
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:52,079
so sometimes you cannot do anything else

361
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:54,240
besides just putting the system onto

362
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,839
another environment

363
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:57,920
and making sure that nothing else can

364
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,839
happen to that system

365
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:01,440
one thing that you should not forget

366
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,040
before doing the harning is

367
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,279
taking backups and of course testing

368
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:06,079
those backups

369
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:07,839
to make sure that if you have done the

370
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,440
harding and something else wrong during

371
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,200
hardening you can revert to a known good

372
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,079
state

373
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:15,839
as i showed a few slides before

374
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,839
after you chose your training system

375
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,440
it's a good thing to analyze the

376
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,040
necessary functionality and the current

377
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,880
security of the system

378
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,240
if you have an up-to-date operating

379
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,920
system the current security of the

380
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,720
system without the application installed

381
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,160
should be pretty much okay

382
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,240
but still might need some additional

383
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,680
hardening so additional security

384
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,200
settings depending on

385
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,720
the location and the criticality of the

386
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,600
system but as you will introduce pro

387
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,160
potential applications uh hmi

388
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,399
applications dcs applications whatever

389
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:47,600
application is required for the

390
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,360
functionality of the system

391
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,120
you will have to recheck the

392
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,560
functionality and recheck the current

393
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,399
security of the system

394
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,000
recheck the operating system

395
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,519
applications what data flows are

396
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:59,600
required what sources are needed

397
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,839
and then of course you can try to

398
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:03,199
determine what can on

399
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:06,320
or should be hard so this

400
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,120
of course depends on the identified

401
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,120
security issues if there are any

402
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,600
identify on what's needed for the system

403
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,480
um

404
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,199
if there's software that's installed you

405
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:18,320
should check

406
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,320
if that software needs to be removed or

407
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,160
upgraded before you do any harding to

408
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,199
make sure that

409
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:25,760
you have a on software aspect and the

410
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,279
pre-system aspects

411
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:30,320
the last updated environment

412
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,399
for uh your your software set

413
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:36,800
then of course do the hardening it's

414
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,880
often in a trial and error

415
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:43,839
style approach because in most

416
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:45,920
or in a lot of occasions you will not be

417
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,440
able to determine

418
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,199
uh what things or the vendor might not

419
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:50,720
be able to determine exactly what's

420
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,600
needed for

421
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,279
the horning and how for the environment

422
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:55,120
and what not

423
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,560
i've been in that situation when i

424
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,639
helped harning

425
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:01,680
for a solution vendor it was done

426
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,000
through gpos and we had to change gpus i

427
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,440
think five or six times because the

428
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,040
vendor even didn't know

429
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,240
his environment properly um

430
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,399
after you do the hardening after

431
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:13,760
everything is running

432
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,440
first thing is of course verifying the

433
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,959
functionality of the system making sure

434
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:18,000
that everything

435
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,240
is running properly is working properly

436
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,519
but then it's also

437
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:24,079
key to verify residual risks of the

438
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:25,600
systems after you have applied the

439
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,000
harning

440
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,519
to making sure that after harming the

441
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:30,320
system is good

442
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,399
is secure or as secure as possible

443
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:38,399
and try to identify what you can do

444
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,880
with those remaining risks after the

445
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,120
harming

446
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,440
a big thing to understand is that

447
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,480
whenever there's major system changes

448
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,199
to the harm system you have to verify if

449
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:51,680
you

450
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,079
do not have to reapply hardening after

451
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:54,880
that

452
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,240
because in a lot of occasions installing

453
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:58,720
patches

454
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,839
installing operating system patches or

455
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:03,360
application upgrades

456
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,079
some settings might have to be reapplied

457
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:06,720
or

458
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,720
might have to be added to the hardening

459
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,199
set to make sure that the

460
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:14,000
known secure state stays as secure as

461
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,160
possible

462
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,759
sometimes of course it's necessary to

463
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:19,360
revert changes

464
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,600
if the hmi or the dcs or the hardened

465
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,519
systems run into problems or something

466
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,519
doesn't work and you cannot solve it

467
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,759
by just changing one single setting in

468
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:28,720
the harning

469
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,120
you might have to restore or revert

470
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,639
changes

471
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,399
so there's a few options there first

472
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,240
restoring the image well that's full

473
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,320
recovery so there's no more hardening

474
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,800
present on the system the second choice

475
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,320
is restoring a snapshot

476
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,560
this will only do a full or partial

477
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,480
recovery depending on the

478
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,600
applications that are installed and as

479
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,360
also depends on when the snapshot was

480
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,040
taken of course for the image

481
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,639
restoring the image it also depends when

482
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,560
their image was taken

483
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,880
and you can as a third option uh choose

484
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,240
to restore only

485
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,240
some saved settings that's only a

486
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,039
partial recovery and a partial hardening

487
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:07,839
remains of course

488
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,559
in this case if you need to restore or

489
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,319
revert changes it's

490
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:15,359
important to verify the or re-verify the

491
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,359
analysis phase to make sure

492
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,439
that you haven't missed anything to so

493
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,919
to be able to restart a hardening

494
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,240
if you're allowed to from your customer

495
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,359
or

496
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:28,479
vendor position line

497
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:32,240
this slide shows you some uh indicators

498
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,080
in the iec six two four four three

499
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,080
and where harning as mentioned first of

500
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,919
all in the dash 2-1

501
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:40,000
of course in the dash 2-4 because that

502
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,200
talks about

503
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,400
requirements for iacs suppliers and of

504
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,840
course during system and component

505
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:46,720
there's also

506
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,520
mentioning of hardening um for having a

507
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,559
secured installation

508
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,080
now uh this was the hardening part um

509
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,559
we can also fortify ics systems by

510
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:00,000
performing security testing by

511
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,919
knowing your weaknesses and then of

512
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:03,360
course depending that we can do

513
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,400
hardening

514
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,000
after knowing those weaknesses or not

515
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,480
fortifying by testing is first of all

516
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,919
verification of what needs to be

517
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:12,960
hardened

518
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,520
before doing a harding verify

519
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,520
verification of what has been harmed

520
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,360
after hardening of course and

521
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,559
identification of

522
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,960
any other security issues and residual

523
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,919
risks

524
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:25,679
so you can do that by doing regular

525
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:27,600
cybersecurity testing if you are allowed

526
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,840
within your environment of course

527
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,600
or by doing cyber security fat and

528
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,200
self-testing in

529
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,240
projects actually cyber security fat

530
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,039
testing is

531
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:41,120
one of the few times in the in an ics

532
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,320
environment where you can do

533
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,919
when you can go all the way with your

534
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,760
skip testing because it's an

535
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,320
isolated test environment and then you

536
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:48,799
can

537
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,880
do full-blown cyber security testing at

538
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,840
will

539
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,400
so cyber security fatsar testing is the

540
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,000
cybersecurity validation of new

541
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,559
upgraded systems new or upgraded systems

542
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:01,280
and solutions within your environment

543
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,200
why do we would you ever do cyber

544
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,200
security testing within

545
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,960
with an ics environment first of all as

546
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,520
i said already verifying cybersecurity

547
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,440
second one is verifying compliance to

548
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,880
cybersecurity

549
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,520
or project or user requirements but you

550
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,360
should not stop there

551
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,440
because by doing testing you also at the

552
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,880
same time create awareness

553
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,960
with your vendors operators with inc

554
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,080
people

555
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,240
and you are making sure that most

556
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,520
cybersecurity issues

557
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:31,280
are known um and are candidates to be

558
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,000
solved before you go into commissioning

559
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,600
so cyber2 testing together with harning

560
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,840
to together with fatal sat site testing

561
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,840
will gradually increase your security

562
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,400
within your environment

563
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,880
when would you do cyber security testing

564
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,200
well for every new system or solution

565
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,160
for every updated system or solution of

566
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,919
course during project fossil testing

567
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:55,120
cycles in which

568
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,720
you have certainly new systems or

569
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,559
ability systems

570
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:01,280
certainly or during regular cyber

571
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,480
security evaluations

572
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,840
if you're allowed within your

573
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,480
environment

574
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,120
so this is a timeline in which the

575
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,000
requirements

576
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,360
for testing and residual risk

577
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,799
determination is shown

578
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,280
hopefully within projects at your

579
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,080
organization

580
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,720
or your customers they said cyber

581
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,320
security requirement

582
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,919
cyber security requirements upfront with

583
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:28,320
the during procurement

584
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,679
together with the doing a risk

585
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:31,919
assessment to identify

586
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:33,520
potential risks to your environment

587
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,679
before running into cyber security fat

588
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:38,159
and self-testing

589
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:40,080
i put cybersecurity fat subtesting on

590
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,600
the construction phase because actually

591
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,400
that's

592
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,120
at the vendor side during construction

593
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,120
during test environment

594
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,240
um you can choose to do that before

595
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,960
during or after functional uh cyber

596
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,640
functional fat testing

597
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,320
and the same with the subtesting

598
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,919
cybersecurity subtesting that's during

599
00:20:57,919 --> 00:20:59,440
commissioning and you can choose to do

600
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,159
so

601
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:02,880
before during or after functional start

602
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,000
testing

603
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
um it is sometimes very interesting to

604
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,360
do functional

605
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,600
testing and cyber security testing

606
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,919
during fat or sat at the same time

607
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:15,200
because then operators i see people even

608
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,480
a vendor will

609
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,760
see how the system reacts

610
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:23,440
on the cyber security testing events

611
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,960
during a real scenario

612
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,640
what should you test and verify well

613
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,720
first of all everything on the network

614
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,080
everything on the system everything on

615
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,600
the physical site and everything on the

616
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,559
application side

617
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:37,039
that's in a nutshell but on the network

618
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:38,159
you have the ports network

619
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:39,120
vulnerabilities

620
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,840
traffic encryption is firewalls used on

621
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:42,880
the system you have system

622
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,960
vulnerabilities configuration issues

623
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,480
not only in the operating system but

624
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,480
also for additionally installed

625
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,760
applications

626
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,760
you also have system physical security

627
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,440
and so on as well

628
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:57,120
so you have the list complete list there

629
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,080
the main thing is that harmon harding

630
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,080
bass lines or harlem guidelines

631
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,919
if there are any should be used to

632
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:05,200
verify against

633
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,919
uh super used to test against but you

634
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:10,559
should not stop

635
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:13,600
there you should verify if those

636
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,120
hardening guidelines and security

637
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,960
testing checklists should not be updated

638
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,720
with specific test requirements

639
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,520
specific project information or vendor

640
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,640
specifications

641
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,080
so your standard checklist should be

642
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,640
updated regularly

643
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,320
and you should not forget that you

644
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,039
should verify logical physical and human

645
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:32,400
aspects

646
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,080
of the to be tested environment

647
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:40,159
do note that testing of hardened systems

648
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:42,400
might require temporarily reverting

649
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,240
certain settings

650
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,159
if you for example do harding on windows

651
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:48,000
systems

652
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,600
some things that you will certainly do

653
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,559
is disabling the remote registry service

654
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:54,640
if you disable the bindings on the on

655
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,679
the interfaces

656
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:58,799
and you enable the firewall and so on

657
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:00,400
and so on those are all things typical

658
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,440
things that you might

659
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,440
have to temporarily disable or

660
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,400
deactivate before being able to do some

661
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,679
authenticated

662
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,360
vulnerability scanning on systems

663
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,880
depending on the vulnerability scanner

664
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,919
that is used of course

665
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,640
another thing that's important next to

666
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,120
the hardening strategy is creating

667
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,280
security testing strategy so cyber

668
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,039
security testing should be embedded

669
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:27,200
embedded within quality assurance

670
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,320
processes

671
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,320
cyber security's testing should also be

672
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,520
embedded within

673
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:35,440
project processes so regular testing

674
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,960
uh fat cell testing um those are all

675
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:39,600
things that

676
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,919
uh that's as important to keep in mind

677
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:43,760
but also having some

678
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,760
own testing equipment or adversary

679
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,520
emulation

680
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:51,520
solutions at hand to be sure that

681
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,760
you are able to test everything if you

682
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,120
don't have that capability you can

683
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,039
always outsource that capability to

684
00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:00,240
trusted parties of course

685
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,480
but you should always include logical

686
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,400
human and physical elements within cyber

687
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,600
security testing

688
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,240
and play the what if game so what

689
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,200
happens if i

690
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,279
plug in my usb to ethernet download for

691
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:12,240
example

692
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,039
what happens when i click on this button

693
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:17,760
when you do operator jail protection

694
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,240
checks and all that kind of what if

695
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,120
questions

696
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,880
can pop in your into your mind when

697
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,960
doing testing on or when

698
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,520
trying to define uh harding's and

699
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,360
testing strategies

700
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,279
and last but not least is a cyber

701
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:34,000
security fatsat reporting

702
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,520
so security assessments is nothing with

703
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,080
it

704
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,400
without a decent cybersecurity test

705
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,080
result report

706
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,480
but here in this story and then

707
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,080
fortifying ics

708
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,320
so you should use the cybersecurity test

709
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,279
results

710
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,760
to adapt your hardening strategy and in

711
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,760
the end also your testing strategy

712
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,080
to make sure that you are able to cover

713
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,679
everything

714
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:00,240
so thank you for your interest and
