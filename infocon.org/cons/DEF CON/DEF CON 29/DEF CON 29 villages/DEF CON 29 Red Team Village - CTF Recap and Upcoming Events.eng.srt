well hello and welcome everyone you know

3
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,560
i hope that you had a really good

4
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,480
defcon and you enjoy all the activities

5
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,238
in the red team village that we actually

6
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:35,680
had at def con with me i have the

7
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,600
red team village core team

8
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,520
and without any further ado i'm actually

9
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,440
going to pass it right to west to go

10
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,320
over

11
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,079
an overview you know of the ctf and what

12
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:45,440
actually took place

13
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,960
in vegas

14
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,280
virtually not only in vegas

15
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,680
thank you omar for the uh intro there uh

16
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,120
for the calls i'm actually gonna turn it

17
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,800
over to barry let him kind of talk a

18
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,160
little bit through of uh you know some

19
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,000
of the amazing work that our team did on

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
the on the calls and then i'll jump into

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,199
the finals a little bit later

22
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,000
first off i just want to thank the team

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,680
that put it together uh there's a lot of

24
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,840
work that we put into it uh there's over

25
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,799
a dozen folks that help contribute to

26
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,680
the qualifiers as well as the the final

27
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,960
scenario last year was full remote so we

28
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,080
put together a uh a fairly immersive

29
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,400
scenario based around an old movie

30
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,200
called office space and then this year

31
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,880
we had two networks for every single

32
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,200
team in finals and the two uh the two

33
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,680
themes there was silicon valley and the

34
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,400
office and so this year we knew we had

35
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,040
to run a hybrid event and so we knew the

36
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,280
assets were going to be up in the cloud

37
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,840
but we had a lot of logistics in terms

38
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,240
of having an area there on the contest

39
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,240
floor we would interact with uh with

40
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,600
players we knew that a lot of our

41
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,280
players were international and weren't

42
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,119
able to travel because of those

43
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,119
restrictions so we wanted to make sure

44
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,119
that that it was accessible to everybody

45
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:02,640
across the board

46
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,240
this year we had a qualifying event that

47
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,399
started the the friday of defcon and

48
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,000
then rolled into

49
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,280
into saturday um the the break that we

50
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,800
had in the middle there we you probably

51
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,160
wouldn't do that in the future just

52
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,879
because it was a little bit of a um uh

53
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:21,360
it was it was hard schedule wise but we

54
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,080
had a lot of players play that uh i felt

55
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,760
like our infrastructure was good we had

56
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,440
all pretty much all new challenges

57
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,319
except i know that we used these older

58
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,319
uh beginner challenges that we've done

59
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,760
they're not really worth a whole lot of

60
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,599
points but we'd like to have a have

61
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,440
something for everybody uh on the

62
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,319
qualifier we took those top 20 teams we

63
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,400
announced who was progressing uh forward

64
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,480
into finals we took a one-hour break

65
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,560
which may have not been enough time for

66
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,400
everyone to recoup and then we went

67
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,120
right into finals and we had 20 teams

68
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,519
advance so we actually deployed 40

69
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,599
networks out to out into aws

70
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:00,319
we we really loved the feedback we got

71
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,480
from the players in the defcon discord

72
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,640
channel it was great to actually meet

73
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,480
some of the players that were there uh

74
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,800
in in vegas i know that uh there's a

75
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,640
couple of folks from um

76
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,640
uh from different teams and finals that

77
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,159
we've only talked virtually in so it's

78
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,400
great to put a face to a to a name or to

79
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,000
a handle and so that was that was

80
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,159
awesome and then uh and then we left

81
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,280
that network uh open overnight uh you

82
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,519
know different teams were were fighting

83
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:26,879
their way through the two different

84
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,760
networks in the end though ai generated

85
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,720
uh came out ahead they uh they secured a

86
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,640
lead in the front they were able to get

87
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,440
past that initial fish uh take uh uh

88
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,280
execute the supply chain attack the

89
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,879
software supply chat

90
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,879
software supply chain attack that then

91
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,799
took them down into the other network

92
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:46,799
and for anybody who wasn't able to get

93
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,319
eyes on those networks we're actually

94
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:49,840
show the network map and i'm going to

95
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,280
hand it over to wes now and he's going

96
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,200
to talk through the scenario what we

97
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,399
built and and why

98
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,840
thanks barry so yeah definitely you know

99
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,000
as asberry was discussing a lot of

100
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,480
similarities to uh last year in regards

101
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,560
of you know the finals round uh you know

102
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,400
on a few repeat teams uh so that was

103
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,519
really nice you know having that

104
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,000
familiarity uh of those teams kind of

105
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,280
coming back to us and understanding what

106
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,560
that challenge is

107
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,040
uh so with that you know with the finals

108
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,120
uh you know depending on uh you know

109
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,639
what perspective you had and how your

110
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:21,839
team divvied it up you know you probably

111
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,280
saw a few different things so what i'm

112
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,320
going to show here is actually the

113
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,000
network map and to kind of give you an

114
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,160
idea of how we kind of designed this so

115
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,880
this isn't uh the final map but this is

116
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,400
pretty close to

117
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,720
uh what we came up with and then went

118
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,280
into uh actual you know devin this out

119
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,040
and building this out and some kind of

120
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,280
tweaks on here so you know some of some

121
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,080
of the uh names you know like the final

122
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,479
challenge or whatever uh you know

123
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,160
we obviously figured that out so we'll

124
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,080
go through here uh at the beginning you

125
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,880
know there's a lot of uh issues on the

126
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,560
uh you know getting your payloads to

127
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,080
land and execute and not getting caught

128
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,040
by defender so that was uh you know i

129
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,919
think a learning event for everyone

130
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:03,360
and then

131
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,360
with that uh once you know if you're

132
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,039
able to get actual foothold and get

133
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:09,360
going with actual payloads

134
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,759
we disabled defender on that

135
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,120
but once you get that initial foothold

136
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,160
then you're kind of in that network and

137
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,759
then you're able to start poking around

138
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,039
so we had quite a few different things

139
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:19,600
on there we tried to uh you know litter

140
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,120
the box with kind of clues as you go

141
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,639
along through the scenario try to

142
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,320
understand some of the different pieces

143
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,680
as you kind of move through that human

144
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,280
resources you know there's a few little

145
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,639
side quests as far as picking up some

146
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,479
additional information

147
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,759
going off um you know there's emails

148
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,039
different traffic like that to kind of

149
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,320
get some of the clues on where you

150
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,600
actually you know whether it's

151
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,520
credentials to be able to log into boxes

152
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,120
a little later on

153
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,400
but with that

154
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,160
you eventually move from that uh you

155
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,479
know human resources department cut over

156
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,479
into the developer section that's where

157
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,880
we actually ended up having a

158
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,960
couple like a windows box and a mac box

159
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,039
and with that with those two we just

160
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:56,639
wanted you to kind of see

161
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,039
part of the uh the source code you know

162
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,759
some teams obviously saw it and then uh

163
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,360
i think that you know definitely gave

164
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,960
them a leg up as they moved on to the

165
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,960
next box but there's quite a few teams

166
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,720
who just kind of burned through uh

167
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,919
especially on the back box kind of

168
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,840
missing some of that source code so they

169
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,199
had a lot of troubles as they're like

170
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,360
interacting with that's the icd pipeline

171
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,199
uh you know trying to figure out what to

172
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,039
actually kind of enter uh what's changed

173
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:21,600
kind of live on there and

174
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,880
uh that was definitely a challenge for

175
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,039
some folks we saw you know some teams uh

176
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:26,479
kind of brick the service that was doing

177
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,400
some of the deployments

178
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,520
so it's definitely super interesting to

179
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,560
kind of watch the teams as they kind of

180
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,639
move through what decisions they made

181
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,360
what kind of um

182
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,400
you know

183
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,080
kind of payloads they put in there and

184
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,440
what they had going

185
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,680
uh so it once you're kind of successful

186
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,680
and you're able you know to get a ci cd

187
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,240
actually deploy and go through with that

188
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,240
you'd landed that dunder muffin uh

189
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,199
network

190
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,720
uh in that regard you know you can kind

191
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,840
of see some of our support boxes for smb

192
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,000
window shares things like that

193
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,440
uh but again you know kind of moving

194
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,880
that through we had some internal kind

195
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,319
of web services

196
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,319
uh with that like creed thoughts going

197
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:03,919
through there

198
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,319
some internal blogs things like that

199
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:07,440
um

200
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,039
and with that you could be able to

201
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:10,880
actually get a back door get into like

202
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,319
the shipping department kind of

203
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:13,919
warehouse area

204
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:14,800
um

205
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,479
and from there you know each step you

206
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,479
know we're laying the kind of groundwork

207
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:19,680
a lot of the clues kind of laying you

208
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,160
through like where to go what's next

209
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,160
uh trying to litter it through so uh i

210
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,280
think this is where some of the larger

211
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,039
teams struggled and definitely where we

212
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:28,240
had a lot of the

213
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,520
you know kind of clues and hints and

214
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,880
points of

215
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,039
uh you know hey we just don't not sure

216
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,120
like how to do this next thing or you

217
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,199
know we're obviously missing a piece uh

218
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,160
we think there probably should be

219
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,080
credentials to this but we can't find

220
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,120
them and a lot of it is just you know

221
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,479
going back kind of communicating with

222
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:43,440
the team

223
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,879
understanding what they found where and

224
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,879
where they found it

225
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:48,720
so with that uh they're able to kind of

226
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,000
move it along

227
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,080
go in through the sales department

228
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,680
there's you know a vulnerable internal

229
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,960
kind of sales website they're able to

230
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,280
kind of move along

231
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,879
and then definitely uh another couple

232
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,240
internal websites

233
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,520
the final piece though is when they got

234
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,960
into accounting

235
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,720
there there's a website where you'd uh

236
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,039
essentially do some privilege escalation

237
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:08,000
uh

238
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,440
get you know remote code execution on

239
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,759
the website so as a local user once

240
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,800
you're there there's uh we had a binary

241
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,160
uh where you could get you know your

242
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,919
actual privilege escalation there get

243
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,199
the final flags

244
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,240
uh definitely you know some great

245
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,520
feedback from some of the teams out

246
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,960
there of how they kind of solved that

247
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,560
last challenge you know maybe not our

248
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,759
most intended one uh

249
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,919
so with all that though like i know not

250
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:31,840
every team was kind of successful uh

251
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,360
getting through this but number of teams

252
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,039
at least you know they got that foothold

253
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,240
they kind of enumerated that first

254
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,640
network you know uh a decent portion of

255
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,240
them kind of made in that second network

256
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,440
so that's why we just kind of wanted to

257
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,360
talk a little bit at that high level

258
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,000
kind of see you know here is i would say

259
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,320
most of the boxes and to include support

260
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,640
boxes that we kind of needed to build to

261
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,040
kind of make the scenario happen

262
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,399
so uh with all of that you know uh

263
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:57,920
please we love the write-ups we love

264
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,440
seeing the feedback we love seeing how

265
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,200
you solve this uh you know definite

266
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,640
lesson learned uh you know there's

267
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,480
there's a prevest we missed

268
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,880
uh that we thought we were patched on

269
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,399
and uh we weren't so we were a little

270
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:09,920
disappointed that you know we kind of

271
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,240
missed out on one piece there but uh it

272
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,600
was definitely fun uh our team

273
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,959
definitely had fun watching all the

274
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:16,800
players go through and uh you know kind

275
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,560
of seeing that different perspective of

276
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,920
how the players looked at it and kind of

277
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,040
troubleshooting things that we went

278
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,040
through uh so

279
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,640
with all that i'm gonna turn it over to

280
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,399
savannah she's gonna kind of go through

281
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,240
uh a lot of kind of like the stats and

282
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,800
numbers of uh everything that we did

283
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,200
uh yeah so hi everyone so for uh the

284
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,480
quals we had 600 over 600 teams and over

285
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,480
2 000 players that play the quals and

286
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,200
then 20 teams for the actual finals

287
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,040
itself and we actually have a few of the

288
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,519
players from the finals team so we have

289
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,680
the ept team and then we also have

290
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,440

street boys we particularly

326
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,200
play capture the flag events and try to

327

enhance our skills through these

328
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,680

and can you tell us a little bit you

373
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,160
know how big was your team

374
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,199
you know your strategy

375
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:36,000
we were originally 10 people

376
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,279
uh

377
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:40,480
but ended up with nine because one had

378
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,760
to

379
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:46,120
uh go play the main.com

380
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:50,240
nice and and you guys won last year you

381
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,399
were first placed last year

382
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,959
so this makes two yeah yeah we

383
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,959
yeah we did although i wasn't there for

384
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:00,639
the win i all enjoyed this year

385
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,560
it was a lot of fun playing with with

386
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,720
everyone uh

387
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,160
i got up to finals last year too uh

388
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,639
this year's network was also a lot of

389
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,880
fun playing

390
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,320
but there were some oversights with some

391
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,600
unintended which

392
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,519
kind of allowed us to

393
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,680
speed through some of the boxes

394
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,639
but

395
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,320
overall it was a

396
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,639
nicely designed network and really

397
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:32,880
enjoyed it

398
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,440
nice i love hearing that

399
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,519
if i would ask a question to all of you

400
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:39,199
you know what was the

401
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:41,600
the favorite part of the ctf for you

402
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,680
like the favorite challenge or the most

403
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,479
challenging one or

404
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,040
anybody

405
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,040
man when everybody goes on

406
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,320
when i start picking on people so it's

407
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,199
like my keeper

408
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:00,800
yeah uh

409
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,360
at least for me uh the whole supply

410
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,839
chain attack part with the cict blocks

411
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:07,199
was

412
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:09,519
very interesting and

413
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:12,240
we spent a while on it uh partially

414
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,079
because of the broken bot on the other

415
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,240
network which uh

416
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,560
yeah there was a lot of debugging on on

417
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,720
the box we

418
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,519
that we had to do

419
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,480
to figure out what was wrong but

420
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,279
uh it ended up working after all

421
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,160
so

422
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,320
yeah it was a

423
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,800
very nice part part of the sdf

424
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,639
very cool how about you hi till

425
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:41,600
um

426
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,000
the supply chain attack as well uh it

427
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,240
was very interesting for us

428
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,880
and coming from a blue team background

429
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,519
it

430
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:52,000
it's actually my first time to actually

431
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,040
um

432
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,480
experience it

433
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,920
like first hand

434
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,680
um and

435
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,639
so so we ended up with like uh blue team

436
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:03,600
skills too in order to debug why it was

437
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,079
working and why it wasn't working so we

438
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:09,279
had we we relied heavily on tcp though

439
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:11,199
in order to check if if the binaries

440
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:13,839
were getting uh downloaded or not

441
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:17,040
um so yeah yeah uh it was really really

442
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,720
fulfilling and um challenging for us

443
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,759
very cool

444
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:27,199
yeah same for me um we had particularly

445
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:29,600
challenges when uh we were doing the

446
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,279
cicd um supply chain attack so

447
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,920
just to mention that we enjoyed it a lot

448
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:39,120
uh those uh struggles and obstacles uh

449
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,800
we learned a lot and one of our

450
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,279
teammates hawk curry actually created a

451
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:46,800
light up on the supply chain attack

452
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,600
because we enjoyed it a lot and it was

453
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,360
quite a struggle to answer it but it's

454
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,279
quite interesting

455
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:58,079
how the infrastructure was set up and uh

456
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:01,279
it's really a unique experience

457
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:03,519
oh very cool and i'm gonna try one more

458
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:04,880
time ept

459
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,000
let's see if

460
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,280
your audio is coming through now

461
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,919
yeah we can try one more time do you

462
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:14,319
hear me better now

463
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:17,879
we can hear you

464
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:20,720
no

465
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,439
at least for two seconds

466
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:26,720
one of the members of the team of the

467
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,240
colleagues in

468
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,200
one and

469
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,280
one company in norway

470
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,080
and as as the other had said we had a

471
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,200
lot of fun doing this so we

472
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,520
we ended up

473
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,600
hiring a cabin so everybody joined in

474
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,600
the same

475
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,600
time it was quite fun and we had a lot

476
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,480
of fun with the challenges

477
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,120
so and and we had the same kind of big

478
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,440
challenge with the the supply chain

479
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,840
attack

480
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:59,520
and so that's gonna that was really nice

481
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,640
i think we went a real big detour in

482
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,039
owning and rooting the

483
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,440
box

484
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,440
we were root on it

485
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,960
the build server before we

486
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,640
and as a matter of fact i'm showing a

487
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,720
picture of that cabin right

488
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,160
yeah that's the

489
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,360
picture of one of them

490
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,520
yeah that's the cabin that was the

491
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,280
conference room between the two cabins

492
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,080
that were built together like one big

493
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:32,159
cabin so we had yeah it was quite fun

494
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,280
that was very cool i'm jealous

495
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,960
we definitely uh took some inspiration

496
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,679
from you you all uh last year because we

497
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:41,120
saw the cabin and we were doing it all

498
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,960
remote and we're like you know we need

499
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,880
to come together and do this all

500
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,280
together and not spread out next time so

501
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,039
we're super excited we got that airbnb

502
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:50,640
kind of off the strip and kind of two

503
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,799
twofold purposes all the streaming that

504
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,280

505
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,960
together uh let's kind of take a cue out

506
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,720
of your playbook uh and do all the

507
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,000
logistics and everything and you know

it like twice this fun

513
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,000
remotely separately so

514
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,440
if you're sure just do it

515
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,400

520
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,360
oh uh so

521
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:38,199
the players uh read over 2000 players

522
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:46,080
oh we're good we're good i think it's

523
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,720
over to me now i think uh maybe uh

524
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,360
i

525
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,679
i just had i had one comment um we

526
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,120
really love the fact that everyone liked

527
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,880
that supply chain attack uh when we

528
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,240
started coming up with the scenario it

529
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,720
was right when the solar winds came out

530
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,960
and uh and right around that time those

531
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,520
maybe four or five pretty big uh supply

532
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,200
chain attacks that happened and so we're

533
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,559
like oh this is great we'll do this

534
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:08,400
theme and we thought when we started

535
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,240
then that that would still be the hot

536
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,080
topic by the time we got to defcon

537
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,280
little did we know that there was going

538
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,120
to be massive ransomware attacks that

539
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,640
you know took over the news before we

540
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,039
got to defcon but uh but yeah we're we

541
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:20,799
were hoping that uh that was enjoyable

542
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:23,360
that uh you know just just how easy it

543
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,000
is to to uh do that supply chain uh

544
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,360
interdiction especially when it's

545
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,600
software driven and it's uh and it's

546
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,159
really hard to uh hard to detect and so

547
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:33,679
for anybody out there who didn't see it

548
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:35,360
the way we had it set up was it was a ci

549
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:39,039
cd pipeline that would uh generate uh an

550
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,919
installer for this this fake software

551
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:44,720
and then in the other network we had a

552
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,720
script that exactly like a bot it would

553
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,039
go and it would check uh periodically

554
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,280
for any updated software and then if it

555
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,720
got that software if it saw that there

556
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,760
was an update because it was doing a

557
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,919
hash match then it would download and

558
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:58,480
execute it

559
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,280
so great to hear the feedback

560
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,400
um

561
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,240
and have any other questions for for the

562
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,200
