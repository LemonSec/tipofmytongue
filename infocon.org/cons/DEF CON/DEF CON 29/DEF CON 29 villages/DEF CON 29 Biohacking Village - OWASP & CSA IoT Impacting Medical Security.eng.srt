practical iot hacking is the latest

17
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:50,800
publication released in march of this

18
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,239
year 2021 although right on its hills is

19
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,239
bug bounty boot camp which is soon to be

20
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:59,280
released in the coming months

21
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,680
in practical iot hacking you will find

22
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,360
some medical device oriented

23
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,000
attack techniques for network protocols

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,320
such as dicom

25
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,000
so make sure to check them out i will

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,080
promise you you will learn a thing or

27
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,399
two

28
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,880
so really happy to be here

29
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,600
you know presenting on you know owasp

30
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,119
and cloud security alliance i will first

31
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,040
you know talk about some of the the hats

32
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,880
that i wear right multiple depending on

33
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,240
the day

34
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,079
and uh we'll get started with owasp for

35
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:36,159
those who don't know uh for those who

36
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:38,320
have who are familiar uh you may have

37
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,159
come across oh wasp if you are trying to

38
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:42,720
remediate a software security

39
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,479
vulnerability

40
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,200
but for those who do not know

41
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,479
o wasp is a an acronym for open web

42
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:54,679
application security project

43
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:57,680
is a non-profit started in uh started up

44
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,759
in 2001

45
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,280
and it's actually

46
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,240
the 20th anniversary this year so it's a

47
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,399
big milestone

48
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,560
oh wasp has great uh very smart uh

49
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,720
experts from all paths around the world

50
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,480
there are region regional and global

51
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,800
events and what i mean by events is

52
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,000
conferences and hackathons

53
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,480
so there's global apps like usas

54
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,120
europe apac

55
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,480
latin america

56
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,280
but also regional and and states you

57
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,519
know uh chapters right like upset

58
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:35,280
california is one that is near and dear

59
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,360
to my heart and and one that i help

60
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,640
organize

61
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,440
you know pre-pandemic at this point

62
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,280
but essentially owasp is an

63
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,879
authoritative source

64
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:48,160
for software security

65
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,560
so if you get a chance check out the

66
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,519
owasp flagship projects

67
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,200
won't be a waste of time

68
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,040
you might be surprised and find a thing

69
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,519
or two that you didn't know before

70
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,920
whether it's a piece of knowledge or a

71
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,200
tool

72
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,839
or guidance

73
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,319
so i'm here to talk about the owasp iot

74
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:13,280
project internet of things

75
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,800
this project was founded in 2014

76
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,640
and designed to help manufacturers

77
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,400
developers and consumers better

78
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,200
understand iot security issues

79
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,680
and now the idea was to kind of cast a

80
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,400
net wide and apply our knowledge and

81
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,080
education

82
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,200
you know to as many as many paths and

83
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,280
areas and audiences

84
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,319
uh so

85
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,319
that's the way we've kind of approached

86
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,400
uh some of our projects with uh what

87
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,480
projects our tools and guidance and best

88
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,760
practices

89
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,200
and when you think about medical device

90
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,159
security right medical device security

91
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,000
you know the platforms that they run on

92
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,120
it could be

93
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,319
embedded linux it could be uh windows it

94
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:57,120
could be bare metal meaning you know

95
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,200
microcontrollers without operating

96
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,560
systems

97
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,439
and software is controlling right is the

98
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,920
crux of of controlling that the

99
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,480
functionality of those devices

100
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,519
and uh what the iot project is is you

101
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,040
know some of the projects that we work

102
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,000
on is you know to help the you know the

103
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,199
security and the awareness aspects of

104
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,120
of of uh you know developing and

105
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,720
deploying right and building

106
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,840
so we've been cited and numerous

107
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,040
publications and information security

108
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,479
standards

109
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,000
the most recent one that i've stumbled

110
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,560
upon was the ftc

111
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,800
had cited us for

112
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,720
building security into internet of

113
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,759
things

114
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,080
in 2021

115
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,759
to our surprise which is which is

116
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,040
awesome

117
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,639
um we collaborate with the like

118
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,960
organizations whether that's a nisa

119
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,520
cloud security alliance uh you know

120
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,120
other other companies you know around

121
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,320
the world

122
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,600
you know we're looking to collaborate

123
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,360
more gsma

124
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,360
other folks in the space

125
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,680
especially in the medical right

126
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,520
we'll talk about you know some of the

127
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,359
the work in the medical space obviously

128
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,680
so the project we've broken it up into a

129
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,680
couple of different categories

130
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,520
namely seek and understand that we'll

131
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,199
talk about today

132
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,039
and uh

133
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:20,320
we'll also talk about the the validation

134
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,320
and so seek and understand uh we have a

135
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,400
couple couple projects that we'll we'll

136
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,680
talk through today the uh top 10 the iot

137
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,560
top 10 and iot goat

138
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,560
and to make the iot top 10 kind of more

139
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,639
applicable for some groups so we created

140
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,479
a mapping project and mapped them to a

141
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:37,840
number of sister projects in the

142
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,320
industry

143
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,080
iot top 10 this is essentially our

144
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,720
flagship project

145
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,600
it's

146
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,400
meant to uh you know create the

147
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,360
awareness and supposed to be you know

148
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,440
top 10 things to avoid when building

149
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,639
deploying and managing iot systems

150
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,039
and when we develop this list you know

151
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,199
we have a methodology to which we use

152
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,280
and uh you know we gather data from

153
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,800
different sources right and we look at

154
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,479
sister projects

155
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,880
and the theme was simplicity again

156
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,319
casting that net wide to you know

157
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:18,960
manufacturers

158
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,120
consumers

159
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,960
at the enterprise as well who are who

160
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,600
are using these devices in their network

161
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,280
and we wanted to to highlight

162
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,520
essentially what are the highest

163
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,800
priority issues you should be aware of

164
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,240
now the list isn't necessarily ranked

165
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,520
from the most uh critical to the least

166
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,720
critical

167
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,160
um although

168
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,960
from the prevalence you'll notice um you

169
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,960
know the you know ranging from one how

170
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,960
common and pervasive some of these

171
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,080
issues are and the impact that

172
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,479
attackers can

173
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:57,520
can gain uh and and and you know once

174
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,280
exploit once exploited into an

175
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,960
environment and when talking about

176
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,199
medical that gain could be someone's

177
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,000
life right

178
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,840
iot goat

179
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,319
what is iot goat

180
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,720
iot goat is a deliberately vulnerable

181
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,800
firmware and what we did is we based it

182
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,520
off of open wrt and openwrt is a is an

183
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,720
build system

184
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,319
and what build system is it makes it

185
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,120
easy easier essentially to

186
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,080
to compile and build firmware

187
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,080
and it does that in a way right that's

188
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,919
that's open source and and which is why

189
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:37,919
we chose openwrt

190
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,560
uh the other reason why we chose openwrt

191
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,479
is its

192
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,479
compatibility with

193
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,800
old devices that you may have

194
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,360
uh let's say laying around old routers

195
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,440
or old networking equipment or you know

196
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,120
devices that are compatible with open

197
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,120
wrt and give you that flexibility to

198
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,080
flash

199
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,280
iot go

200
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,240
and to practice finding and identifying

201
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,160
and exploiting vulnerabilities within

202
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,639
firmware

203
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,879
so when we developed iot code we

204
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,639
incorporated

205
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,039
as much as we could of the iot top 10

206
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:14,000
and when i say as much as we could

207
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,759
i mean

208
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:19,039
everything aside from the hardware

209
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:21,360
and and uh

210
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,280
kind of process base well actually

211
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,639
everything aside from the hardware and

212
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,039
that's actually in our roadmap as well

213
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:30,400
and so we what we wanted to do is is use

214
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,159
this vulnerable firmware as a you as a

215
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,080
learning platform

216
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,240
for professionals researchers software

217
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,519
developers

218
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,919
anyone who is looking to get into for

219
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,320
more hacking iot hacking

220
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,959
and and give him that playground to

221
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,680
let loose and to practice and to level

222
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,599
up and gain that confidence

223
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,560
if you've ever gotten started into iot

224
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,360
hacking i'm sorry uh firmware hacking

225
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,760
uh it's it's a it's a tall it's a tall

226
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,480
order right uh if you have no previous

227
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,279
exposure or visibility

228
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,920
and so again this is meant as as a

229
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,800
platform to help enable

230
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,120
folks you know get more confident and

231
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,959
and familiar with

232
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,040
the types of vulnerabilities that are

233
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:17,920
within

234
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,920
firmware

235
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,680
so i'll show

236
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,519
a few screenshots

237
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:28,240
here's the the login page

238
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,680
by the way this is iot go is up on on

239
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,080
github if you want to have a play

240
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,839
you're more than welcome to

241
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,320
here is the secret developer diagnostics

242
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,680
page

243
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,480
you'll find these somewhat common or

244
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,839
uncommon maybe left over from debug code

245
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:50,800
for it from devices usually right it is

246
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,399
not a good sign when you find these

247
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:55,200
types of diagnostic pages that allow

248
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,560
access

249
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,320
uh you know by other means that you know

250
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,279
elevated access

251
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:04,240
so we've developed challenges to to walk

252
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,600
you through

253
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,120
how to find the vulnerabilities

254
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:10,640
and

255
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,399
part of a road map is how to fix the

256
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,279
vulnerabilities as well

257
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:18,000
what you see here on your screen is the

258
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,560
back door for iot go

259
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,040
essentially a a service that is running

260
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,519
on startup

261
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:28,079
and you can connect to that particular

262
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:29,519
service

263
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:30,640
and

264
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,680
get root access

265
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,480
and

266
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,519
practice

267
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:38,959
post exploitation if you'd like

268
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,000
meaning

269
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,640
going from device to device inside of a

270
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,399
network

271
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:48,079
or keeping it simple um

272
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,680
simple is always the best right

273
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,640
especially when you're getting started

274
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,600
this screenshot here is the

275
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,200
listening

276
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,320
network services from nmap and you'll

277
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,040
see you know the common http

278
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:07,040
upnp as well as a couple of services

279
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,760
that run on high ports that are unknown

280
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,320
which might be fruitful if you poke at

281
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,760
them and you find out what they're

282
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,720
running

283
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,200
who knows you may get access to a device

284
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,240
you may

285
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,360
exploit a vulnerability

286
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,519
so good luck have a play

287
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,800
again iot code is is there is there as a

288
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,680
resource for you all

289
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,360
and we'll talk a little bit more of you

290
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,720
know what

291
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,880
what you can use in conjunction with iot

292
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,710
go next

293
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:41,789
[Music]

294
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
our other category

295
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,880
is validate and test

296
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,480
talked about seek and understand this is

297
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,800
validate and test an invalidating test

298
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,440
we have the iot security verification

299
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,639
standard

300
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:57,040
firmware security testing methodology

301
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,480
and bytesweep

302
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,800
which is a tool a firmware analysis tool

303
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,320
from our security testing methodology

304
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,519
was meant to

305
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,440
lower the barrier of entry

306
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,600
for iot hacking including medical

307
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,240
devices right so this is

308
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,160
this could be used hand in hand with

309
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:26,639
iot goat and the idea is to enable more

310
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,959
uh professionals or more more folks who

311
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:31,279
are interested in getting into

312
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:33,440
firmware hacking and providing those

313
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,040
guide rails

314
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,800
and providing the guidance and kind of a

315
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,639
systematic

316
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:41,040
you know in a systematic way all in you

317
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,240
know one resource

318
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,639
and if you're like me uh you know you'll

319
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,480
you when you get started in firmware

320
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,920
you'll be like ah there's so much going

321
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,760
on i don't know where to start this is

322
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,160
this this might be for you

323
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,320
uh and like any other methodology right

324
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,639
you can jump from step to step

325
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,480
and what we've done is we broke it down

326
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,160
into nine steps

327
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,480
right and the nine steps again depending

328
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,680
on your your scope and your expertise

329
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,279
and and the foothold you may already

330
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:10,240
have

331
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,920
you know you can jump around as

332
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,240
mentioned

333
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,079
we've went ahead and provided

334
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,959
tool usage examples uh walkthroughs

335
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:21,839
right again to be able to sh to to help

336
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:24,320
and and show and teach

337
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,000
uh essentially you know the common

338
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,320
techniques the common tools

339
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,639
um and and what we've done is

340
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:33,040
create a companion uh virtual machine

341
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,880
with pre-loaded tools

342
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,440
vulnerable firmware such as you know iot

343
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,639
go but also a few others um that the

344
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,800
industry has provided and even some that

345
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,800
have known vulnerabilities for for

346
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,680
products and manufacturers out there

347
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,600
you know zipped up and you know trying

348
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,760
to keep the space minimal

349
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,320
so again really trying to

350
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,160
try to enable more folks

351
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,560
uh to get going and and get some help

352
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,720
with with firmware hacking and

353
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,839
start poking around into you know iot

354
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:07,600
devices medical devices right

355
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,440
iot security verification standard

356
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,320
isvs

357
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,079
so isbs what it consists of is is three

358
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:23,920
verification levels

359
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,959
and we have five chapters or if you want

360
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:28,720
to call them domains

361
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,760
with a total of 138 controls don't pay

362
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,839
attention to the control so much

363
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:36,560
uh but the the the aim of the project is

364
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,560
to create a basis

365
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,639
for it for testing

366
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:43,600
iot applications software and and their

367
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,720
technical controls but also to develop

368
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,800
contextual requirements

369
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,079
for secure development and design

370
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,079
so you can use it as as part of the

371
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:56,240
hardware design for medical devices you

372
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,160
can use it as a set of product security

373
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,240
requirements to be included

374
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,959
into product requirement documents prds

375
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:05,199
if you're a manufacturer

376
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:07,120
if you're buying devices you can use

377
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,079
them for procurement of medical devices

378
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,000
developing medical device security

379
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,680
training

380
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,600
assess the security posture of a medical

381
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,360
device

382
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,920
and provides a basis right to define

383
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,160
verification levels

384
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,440
based off of the medical devices risk

385
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,800
you know today

386
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,480
there isn't uh you know a

387
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,040
a standard to help normalize

388
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,399
you know the coverage of how well my iot

389
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,240
device my medical device

390
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,000
has been has been tested it's

391
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,240
essentially you know tribal knowledge or

392
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,519
maybe there's a

393
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:46,320
an overview of a methodology

394
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,560
but this this this aims to plug those

395
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,519
gaps

396
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:50,880
and and help

397
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,199
clear the ambiguity there

398
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:56,480
and so we we followed our sister sister

399
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,920
projects within oh wasp the asvs is for

400
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,240
the web the m-a-s-v-s

401
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,680
for mobile and the sc vs for software

402
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,680
composition think about it like supply

403
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,120
chain and building

404
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,320
building uh software

405
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,560
so this project is still i'm sorry is in

406
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,399
release candidate stage

407
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:19,759
it's been a rough year

408
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:21,680
but we are hoping to get it out fairly

409
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,839
soon for you all and we're just tidying

410
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:24,959
things up

411
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:27,839
so we are open to additional con

412
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,160
feedback and contributors and we'll

413
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,000
we'll get to how you can reach us later

414
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
on

415
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:39,680
some honorable mentions that that affect

416
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,560
the you know medical device security

417
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,079
the embedded application security best

418
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:45,199
practice

419
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:46,800
best practices

420
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,920
uh were previously released around 2016

421
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,199
time frame

422
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:54,320
and we are doing a refresh with newer uh

423
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,519
newer techniques newer guidance

424
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:59,199
different formatting

425
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:00,720
right now we have a base set of seven

426
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,160
that you see on the screen here with

427
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,600
sensitive data management down at

428
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,119
cryptography

429
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,119
initially we had 10

430
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,319
and again this is still a work in

431
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,520
progress

432
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,439
right and then and if you notice the

433
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:14,079
octo and open wrt these are

434
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,319
these are very popular uh embedded build

435
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,880
systems for for devices

436
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,160
so likely

437
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,679
you know your medical device that you

438
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:23,439
that you purchase

439
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:26,720
if it has a linux operating system

440
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,240
is built with one of these one of these

441
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,880
build systems here

442
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,679
and the hardware security testing

443
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,039
methodology

444
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:39,120
is something that is that is a work in

445
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,880
progress

446
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,960
and again you know kind of taking that

447
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,240
that that step even even lower from

448
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,200
firmware or actually stage lower

449
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,080
right uh where you you have the hardware

450
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,919
uh and uh

451
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,160
let's say you need to pull the firmware

452
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,919
and to find vulnerabilities and then

453
00:17:57,919 --> 00:17:59,200
exploit them

454
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,520
this hardware methodology testing

455
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,200
methodology

456
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,360
will help you in that endeavor when

457
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,720
you're embarking on those types of

458
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,039
assessments those hardware analysis the

459
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:11,280
tools you'll need to have in your

460
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,880
toolkit

461
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,480
the the techniques you'll have to keep

462
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,600
in mind when to try which technique

463
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,520
and again it's it's for those for those

464
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,840
folks who again need that that guy a

465
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,000
little bit of a kickstart or something

466
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,160
to you know kind of keep you honest and

467
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,799
reference as like hey you know

468
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:31,520
i am ensuring i'm covering these certain

469
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,919
areas for these vulnerable hardware

470
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:36,080
debug interfaces these

471
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,400
uh these uarts these serial interfaces

472
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,240
these jtags

473
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,480
how do i connect to these what do i do

474
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,880
afterwards how do i

475
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,480
gain root access

476
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,440
and gain persistence

477
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,200
so we hope these resources will be

478
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,880
helpful to you all

479
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,600
but you might be asking this is owasp

480
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,080
these are obas projects

481
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,039
why is owasp involved in iot and in

482
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,240
hardware

483
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,880
and an embedded

484
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,120
well

485
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,799
the end of the day

486
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:11,039
everything is software right

487
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:13,120
without software hardware would not be

488
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,320
able to function

489
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,760
firmware would not be able to talk to

490
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,080
the hardware the drivers right

491
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,200
wireless protocols

492
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,600
all software

493
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,840
zeros and ones right if you want to take

494
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:29,280
it down even to the slowest

495
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,679
switching hats now

496
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:37,440
to my cloud security alliance hat

497
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,360
a brief intro about cloud security

498
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,480
alliance

499
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,080
it's a global organization with a

500
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,720
similar structure than owasp

501
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,400
free to join and participate

502
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,240
resources best practices and and events

503
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,320
as well

504
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,080
i guess that the large the larger

505
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,240
differentiator would be

506
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,080
the cloud security certifications that

507
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,880
they offer and oh wasp is

508
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,799
does not offer such certifications they

509
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:05,520
are

510
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,480
501 3c

511
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,320
both great groups i give

512
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,360
100

513
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,120
of credit to to both of these

514
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,799
organizations

515
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,440
and where i'm at without either these

516
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,440
organizations i would have not had

517
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,919
opportunities to edit

518
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:26,000
books and write a book

519
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,880
um so keep that in mind as as you're

520
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,960
pondering whether i should get involved

521
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,840
throughout this presentation

522
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,760
so the cloud security alliance iot

523
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,360
working group

524
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,120
i've been a part of this group since

525
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,320
since the beginning and it was

526
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,120
originally part of the mobile working

527
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,840
group in

528
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:51,120
2014 uh when we spoke when we spun off

529
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,120
we've also you know worked with with

530
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,760
industry regulatory and corporate

531
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,760
and corporates as well you know from

532
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,720
from the collaboration perspective and

533
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,720
we've been lucky enough to be incited in

534
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,200
rfcs and different standards as well you

535
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,200
can see a couple of screenshots there

536
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:12,600
with uh one of our rfcs rfc 8576

537
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,320
we've put out a number of different

538
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,840
publications throughout the year

539
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,880
specific to industries specific to the

540
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,080
uh to the enterprise right um and

541
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,880
you know two two medical

542
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,480
publications

543
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,480
have been publi have been released and

544
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,000
we're working on a third which we'll

545
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,440
we'll talk to talk about today

546
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,200
so i guess you know with the

547
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,760
collaboration in mind

548
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,159
you know o wasp and cloud security lines

549
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:48,000
work together to

550
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,240
release the secure medical device

551
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,159
deployment standard

552
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:53,440
if you may be wondering so there's a lot

553
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,120
of cross-pollination again we're all

554
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,280
saying the same thing and we should all

555
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,600
be working together so if you all are in

556
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,039
similar groups and you want to

557
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:02,240
collaborate

558
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,880
let's do it

559
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,080
the iot controls matrix

560
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,960
this is the flagship project for

561
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,720
our iot working group

562
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,039
it is modeled after the cloud the cloud

563
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:20,240
control matrix the ccm

564
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,720
there is 165 controls aimed at

565
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,679
enterprise iot that incorporate multiple

566
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:27,600
layers of connected devices

567
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,520
cloud services and networking

568
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,200
technologies

569
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,400
so we have 21 domains security domains

570
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,559
and that's ranging from asset management

571
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:38,400
like you have to know what you have to

572
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,440
get started from governance

573
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,360
even legal

574
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,760
down to vulnerability management

575
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,559
and security testing activities

576
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:50,320
whether that is web application security

577
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,400
testing firmware

578
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,640
bug bounties even included so it's

579
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,440
really holistic

580
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:00,159
so it should be a helpful resource for

581
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:02,080
helpful uh health wear i'm sorry

582
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,400
healthcare delivery organizations

583
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,880
and any organization deploying connected

584
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,080
devices in their networks

585
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,720
so how we're revolving the iot controls

586
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,080
matrix is

587
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,960
we want to glue the process policy

588
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,480
infrastructure

589
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,039
ecosystem controls with the device

590
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:26,960
itself

591
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,039
and you know part of that is you know

592
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:30,640
the industry is changing we have you

593
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,159
know zero trust

594
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:34,799
zero touch provisioning you know supply

595
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:37,039
chain issues are you know i don't want

596
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:39,200
to say at its height but it is it is up

597
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,799
there and it is on top of everyone's

598
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:45,120
minds especially in 2021 and the day

599
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,120
in remote working now

600
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,279
right and people are sending these

601
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:50,720
appliances in their networks and these

602
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,559
iot devices and they're just connecting

603
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:54,320
to corporate environments

604
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,799
and you know managing and and you know

605
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:58,159
the whole complexities that come with

606
00:23:58,159 --> 00:23:59,039
that

607
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:00,559
and so for the next version we're

608
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:03,039
looking to not only evolve and refine

609
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:04,400
our controls

610
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,520
but introduce a shared responsibility

611
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,360
matrix

612
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,679
tailored towards iot

613
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:13,679
and again to kind of expand the

614
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:15,120
applicability

615
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,200
we create mappings to

616
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,679
either sister projects such as you know

617
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,039
anissa's

618
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:23,440
iot you know baseline security baseline

619
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,400
and the variousness standards out there

620
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,000
and of course

621
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,440
cloud security alliance projects like

622
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,440
ccm

623
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,960
as you may have noticed securing iot

624
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,960
is not an easy task

625
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,279
right medical device manufacturers must

626
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:46,400
trust their supply chain partners and

627
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,919
the supply chain partners must do their

628
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:50,400
due diligence and that cascades down

629
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,360
right

630
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,080
even further to the enterprise and

631
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,159
consumers which they must trust the

632
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,559
connected products that they meet you

633
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,240
know minimum minimum standards and

634
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,640
controls

635
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,400
and typically this trust is obtained

636
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,320
through you know a series of

637
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,080
questionnaires and back and forth the

638
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,960
interaction with with each group or each

639
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:11,840
party

640
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,640
or some or a sort of trust portal that

641
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,240
satisfies

642
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,760
uh procurement requirements so when

643
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,000
you're purchasing things

644
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,159
but at the end of the day right

645
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:25,039
given the complexity of iot and the the

646
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:26,159
scope

647
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:28,720
right there is not one size fits all

648
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,880
solutions and controls must be

649
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,720
interoperable

650
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,840
it must provide automation to scale

651
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,600
and they have to be validated right

652
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,440
there has to be you know internal and

653
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,440
external validation to ensure these

654
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,320
controls are are working and that the

655
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,400
lights flicker you know the alarms the

656
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:51,320
alarms are going off when they should be

657
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,200
so an ongoing project is is zero trust

658
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,480
for iot

659
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,880
and this this is really important for

660
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,120
those medical devices that you may be

661
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,039
plugging in and hey now all of a sudden

662
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:09,279
they are paired and they are working

663
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:12,240
they are on boarded with you know uh

664
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,279
again zero zero zero trust or or uh

665
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:17,360
touch i guess you can say

666
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,080
and uh you know there's there's

667
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:23,279
a methodology to the architecture

668
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:24,960
in which you know we'll break it down

669
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,039
from the onboarding the authentication

670
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:28,640
the authorization

671
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,480
and then how you monitor those types of

672
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,720
devices and the different policies you

673
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,480
want to employ

674
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,240
and then you know if there is a route of

675
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,000
trust hardware route of trust how do you

676
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,480
leverage those for that kind of secure

677
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,679
identity

678
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:43,520
otherwise you know if the added identity

679
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,480
could be

680
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,440
tampered with uh so could that trust

681
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,440
right

682
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:56,799
the cloud security alliance medical

683
00:26:56,799 --> 00:27:00,400
device incident response playbook

684
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,640
the goal of this project is to establish

685
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,120
the best containment eradication and

686
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,159
recovery practices for for each category

687
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:09,760
while minimizing the risk those

688
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,799
practices have on patient care

689
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:15,520
so we've modeled this playbook after you

690
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:20,039
know the nist sp 861r2

691
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,880
but we created our own kind of

692
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:26,080
differentiators here in the sense of

693
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,720
you know we're defining incidents

694
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,440
in this context as a vulnerability

695
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:35,520
disclosure and one or more cves

696
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,679
affecting medical devices within a

697
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:39,600
health healthcare delivery organization

698
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,960
inventory

699
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:41,919
or

700
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:43,919
the discovery of malware

701
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:45,360
ransomware

702
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,520
or loss of availability of a medical

703
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,840
device

704
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:52,399
so this might sound all too common

705
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:54,320
you you may have heard all the

706
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,840
vulnerabilities reported for medical

707
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,880
devices in the past

708
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:02,399
or what about the novel uh wannacry

709
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:03,919
a few years back

710
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:06,000
three four years back now which took

711
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,520
down a number of hospitals and was

712
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:14,399
devastating for some and cost cost lives

713
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:16,480
so this playbook is supposed to be used

714
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,320
as a basis

715
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:22,640
as a starting point to incorporate into

716
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,799
a an hdo a healthcare delivery

717
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:26,720
organization's program

718
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,559
and so we we've defined these seven

719
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:30,880
clinical scenarios

720
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:34,080
and these clinical scenarios range on uh

721
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,159
based on the the

722
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:38,880
the types of devices that are being used

723
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,600
so for example uh

724
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,600
number one would be you know if it's

725
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,760
safe to connect from the patient and the

726
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,520
network

727
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,520
is it safe to connect from

728
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,320
uh

729
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,520
is it safe to disconnect from the

730
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,918
network

731
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,640
can the devices be shut down safely and

732
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,360
removed from the patient

733
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,240
is the disconnection possible

734
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,600
but with clinical impact

735
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:07,520
so we'll we'll go through a couple of

736
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:10,080
these or i'll just show you the

737
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:13,039
the workflow that example workflows

738
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:14,480
again these will be contextualized or

739
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,159
should be contextualized to internal

740
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:18,000
processes

741
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
but what is always step one with an

742
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,159
incident response right you can see you

743
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:24,240
can see the uh

744
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,840
the list here right the the five phases

745
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,279
the most important one of the most

746
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:30,399
important

747
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:31,279
is

748
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:33,360
is to prepare

749
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,440
right and and we've helped we've helped

750
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,120
kind of shape you know high level

751
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,120
activities that

752
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:43,199
that medical facilities can can employ

753
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:47,039
you know kind of expanding on on some of

754
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:48,480
these activities

755
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,840
you know again you have to know what you

756
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,640
have so starting with inventory

757
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,880
classify the clinical impacts

758
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,679
and the data impacts what happens when

759
00:29:57,679 --> 00:29:59,360
you know patients are affected devices

760
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,360
are affected

761
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,880
creating a you know a list of

762
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,480
stakeholders

763
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,720
not only within the medical facility or

764
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,480
health delivery organization but also

765
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,880
with the device manufacturers and anyone

766
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,120
else

767
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,520
but also you know backing up and

768
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,960
monitoring

769
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,559
so on and so forth

770
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:19,440
so

771
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,799
check out the playbook we have some

772
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:23,520
great details in there

773
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,360
so after preparing

774
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,399
right you have to be able to detect

775
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:31,440
analyze and contextualize

776
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,720
you know and and

777
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,960
within within this phase you'll have to

778
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,640
maintain a number of different

779
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,960
initiatives and programs

780
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,559
what i mean by programs are your threat

781
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:42,559
intelligence programs

782
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:44,320
communication and relationships with

783
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,000
information sharing and analysis centers

784
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,559
icesax

785
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,279
vulnerability management program

786
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:53,039
how do you find vulnerabilities how do

787
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:55,440
you how do you remediate vulnerabilities

788
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,720
internally and externally are you

789
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,720
asking for software building materials

790
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,880
for devices for devices to understand

791
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,399
their software composition what they're

792
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:06,799
made out of their essential

793
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:09,440
essentially their nutritional facts

794
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,320
you get their versioning information and

795
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,550
and compare them to

796
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:14,640
[Music]

797
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,919
databases

798
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:16,840
cve

799
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,200
databases so you can understand the risk

800
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,880
that they're they're introducing into

801
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:21,600
your network

802
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,039
[Music]

803
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:25,120
other considerations for programs are to

804
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:28,640
maintain a catalog of iocs indicators of

805
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,279
compromise

806
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,760
and having a sim and monitoring for for

807
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,640
security events using that sim

808
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,840
and incorporating a behavioral profiling

809
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,320
mechanism whether that is something that

810
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,760
a vendor provides or something

811
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,760
internally

812
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:48,880
but it is it is it is needed

813
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,399
and this is this is part of detecting

814
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:52,880
analyzing and contextualizing according

815
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,799
to

816
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:57,600
your organization

817
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,240
contain eradicate and recover

818
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,000
so the activities in in this phase of

819
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,279
the ir process are dependent on a set of

820
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:11,200
incident response classifications

821
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,600
so these these response classifications

822
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,840
take into account the clinical

823
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,240
considerations associated with the usage

824
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,240
of each device

825
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,080
and you'll understand what i'm saying in

826
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,159
just a moment right so

827
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:27,039
this is the scenarios i was mentioning

828
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:29,200
so safe to disconnect from the patient

829
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,880
and network

830
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,120
so there are no patient safety issues

831
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,880
with immediately removing the device

832
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,679
from the patient or the network

833
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:39,840
an example could be a wireless

834
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:43,639
blood pressure cuff

835
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,080
disconnection from the network possible

836
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,799
but with clinical impact

837
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:52,559
while the device can

838
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:54,559
operate independently of the network his

839
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:58,399
disconnection will have clinical impact

840
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:00,720
a telemetry monitor which is often used

841
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,640
to constantly collect and monitor the

842
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,480
vitals of patients in icus and other

843
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,399
critical units is an example of this

844
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:09,399
scenario

845
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:12,950
[Music]

846
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,290
shut down or disconnect from

847
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:16,559
[Music]

848
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:17,840
from the patient with safety

849
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,519
implications

850
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:21,360
so the medical devices is providing like

851
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,919
clinic clinical necessary functions and

852
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:26,480
the device is required to be online to

853
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,240
performance function

854
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,559
so an example of this could be

855
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:33,440
a ct machine

856
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
right these are very real relatable

857
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,760
maybe you know some you know you or

858
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,919
someone in your family

859
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:41,919
has interacted with these types of

860
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:43,519
scenarios

861
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:46,559
um and one scenario that is near to me

862
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:48,240
and i didn't mention it here is you know

863
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,000
the implantable scenario

864
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,519
you know what happens you know when a

865
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:54,000
pacemaker there's an incident there

866
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,159
um and what do you do and what do

867
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:58,159
clinicians do and and how do they loop

868
00:33:58,159 --> 00:33:59,679
in the third parties the the

869
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:01,519
manufacturers and

870
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:06,200
and uh how do you respond right

871
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:09,760
so i found this this image uh quite

872
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,119
funny

873
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:13,119
you cut a virus from your computer

874
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:14,960
and we had to erase your brain

875
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,679
i hope you've got a backup copy

876
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:21,119
and the in the age of ransomware and the

877
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:22,000
white's

878
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,119
you know exploitation of ransomware and

879
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:27,839
wearables and implantables

880
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:31,520
you're you know it is not possible to to

881
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:34,639
back up right in those cases but you can

882
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:37,280
back up your your it infrastructure and

883
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,800
and and

884
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,560
uh you know telehealth devices or maybe

885
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,918
not even telehealth devices but other

886
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:43,359
devices within

887
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:47,159
a hospital network

888
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:53,199
the next phases

889
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:56,399
are analyze a post incident

890
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:58,560
sharing and updating with

891
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,800
stakeholders and stakeholders could also

892
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,720
be the information sharing groups the

893
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,000
isacs

894
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,359
and then you're looping back around to

895
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:07,119
prepare and incorporating the lessons

896
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:08,800
learned into the playbook into your

897
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,240
processes

898
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,320
and uh helping right with that sharing

899
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,320
part you're helping others learn from

900
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,240
what you learn so that they can

901
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:20,078
incorporate into their programs as well

902
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,000
so these isacs if you're not familiar

903
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,839
they do have you know a sort of

904
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:26,079
confidentiality agreement

905
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:28,160
uh which is which is beneficial right

906
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,960
and in these cases and obviously

907
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,079
probably needed right

908
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:39,920
wrapping up

909
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,079
i wanted to

910
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:46,960
provide a table to to help illustrate

911
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:47,920
medical

912
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,560
device security activities

913
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,240
and applicable projects we talked about

914
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,079
today

915
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:55,839
so securely developing medical device

916
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:57,760
software you can take a look at the top

917
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,400
10

918
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:01,680
isvs embedded appsec best practices

919
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,320
and zero trust for iot

920
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,079
identify medical device

921
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:09,119
vulnerabilities you can use iot goat as

922
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:10,480
as a playground

923
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:13,040
and replicate that into a real device

924
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:16,720
the former security testing methodology

925
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,240
the hardware security testing

926
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,880
methodology byte sweep as the tool to

927
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,680
help you with your firmware analysis

928
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,160
isvs

929
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,000
right to to figure out which

930
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,839
which test cases

931
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:30,880
i should be

932
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,960
incorporating into

933
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:37,200
my workflow into my assessment

934
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:40,000
isbs not i think i may have skipped over

935
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
this it is written in a way

936
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,960
that uh well it is written in and verify

937
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,640
that so every

938
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,079
every uh

939
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:50,720
every control is verified that

940
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,320
obviously verification levels there's

941
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,720
three of them so when you're purchasing

942
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,400
deploying managing and maintaining

943
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,400
connected medical devices

944
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,040
use the iot controls framework

945
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,800
the secure medical device deployment

946
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,760
standard

947
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,520
you can also use the medical device

948
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,440
incident response playbook

949
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,800
because there are some good bits in

950
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,480
there from

951
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,880
the the uh

952
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,320
the kind of

953
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:18,079
managing and purchasing as well

954
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:21,040
from the preparing detecting containing

955
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,720
and post medical device security

956
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,320
incidents

957
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,880
the medical device ir response playbook

958
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:27,760
right

959
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:31,440
uh one that we just spoke about

960
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:36,960
how to get involved hopefully one of

961
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:40,160
these excited you or you've you've found

962
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:43,040
uh that you know there is room where

963
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,359
there is a gap perhaps and some of the

964
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:47,599
the work that that we've performed or

965
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:48,800
you want to be a fly on the wall and you

966
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,320
want to get involved and just listen in

967
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,000
to learn

968
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,160
you were available on slack for cloud

969
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,640
security alliance and owasp

970
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,720
for oauth to get access to slack go to

971
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:02,079
owasp.org and go to about and there is a

972
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:03,040
slack

973
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,560
section there just input your email

974
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,079
you'll get an invite

975
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:07,440
you can also reach out to project

976
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,400
leaders

977
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,800
whether they're active project leaders

978
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,960
or current project leaders like myself i

979
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,200
will help you i will i will help you

980

route you know your route it to the

981
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:20,000
appropriate person if it's not me

982
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,839
we're pretty easy to get a hold of on on

983
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:24,960
socials you can see uh you know my

984

you know linkedin as well

986
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,640
with cloud security alliance we do have

987
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:33,520
a monthly meeting again free to attend

988
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,640
and join

989
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,640
and keep in mind with contributing and

getting involved

991
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,160
it's technical and non-technical

992
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,920
opportunities you don't have to be an

993
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,320
expert you don't have to be a super hard

994
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,760
worker you know a super hacker or

995
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,280
anything like that

996
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:50,160
user experience design format

997
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,079
viewing editing those are all needed

998
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:53,040
skills

999
