1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,480
welcome to my talk on smart meters i'm

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,000
hacking infrastructure

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,759
and so should you in this 25 minute talk

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:09,360
i'm going to walk you through all the

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,639
different things i've been doing the

6
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:12,160
last couple years

7
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,200
to reverse engineer smart meters

8
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,199
particularly the ones made by landis and

9
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:19,840
gear that are used here in texas

10
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,199
by the power provider encore i picked

11
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:24,720
them strictly because they're the one

12
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,240
that was on the side of my house and i

13
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,080
was interested in learning more about

14
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,240
them so nothing in particular about

15
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,439
those two

16
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,079
or the the focus of anything other than

17
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:35,600
it's the meter i have and the power

18
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,600
company i use

19
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,760
you'll see uh all kinds of circuit board

20
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,079
reverse engineering

21
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,520
protocol analysis uh some software

22
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,840
reverse engineering using binary ninja

23
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,120
that i've kind of just

24
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,600
begun recently there's a number of

25
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,760
youtube videos i also have on this that

26
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,320
kind of

27
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,640
was the precursor to this talk and a

28
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,440
wiki

29
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,239
um called richesom and so there's a lot

30
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:01,760
more in-depth data and

31
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,280
in-depth protocol stuff there's a

32
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,360
discord channel that i have so

33
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,880
a bunch of ways if you're interested in

34
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,880
getting involved in this that you can

35
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,640
as a little background i've been into

36
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,400
reverse engineering a long time

37
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,240
so i've watched a lot of talks online by

38
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,560
different people chris tarnowski reverse

39
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,080
engineering silicon

40
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,680
um it's real fascinating to me chris

41
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,159
gerlinski and the work he did reverse

42
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,159
engineering uh cable tv

43
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,280
uh pay tv box that was fascinating um

44
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,200
and travis good speed obviously a ton of

45
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,000
work out there

46
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,680
poc or gtfo um other things like that

47
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,720
that he's done and

48
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,159
and a talk that he gave that was really

49
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:38,640
fascinating to me that was

50
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,520
called in praise of junk hacking and and

51
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,520
the premise of that talk if you don't

52
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,280
watch it i suggest you do

53
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,280
is that you know these critical

54
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,880
infrastructure devices

55
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,640
they all contain off-the-shelf

56
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,399
components and so

57
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:53,759
you know things like the processor

58
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,520
that's used the

59
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,719
transceiver chip that's a cc 1020 made

60
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,719
by texas instruments that's in here

61
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,399
those are all used in other devices like

62
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,320
the girl tech imme

63
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,200
that him and michael osmond worked on

64
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,959
and things like that and so his premise

65
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,360
was if you reverse engineer

66
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,280
things that kind of are in products that

67
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,040
don't matter but they're used in

68
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,200
products that do matter

69
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,040
you're essentially pointing out and

70
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,120
finding flaws in critical infrastructure

71
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,000
or things like

72
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,040
that without um without the undue

73
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,319
attention that comes from reverse

74
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,239
engineering critical infrastructure

75
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,239
and and that talk is uh quite a few

76
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,000
years old at this point

77
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,560
and at the time i think that that's you

78
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,400
know is a really sound way to go about

79
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:36,879
it

80
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:38,319
um and i think also if you just don't

81
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,080
want to attract any attention that's

82
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,400
fine as well but the the challenge is

83
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,640
these devices run you know kind of our

84
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,239
our whole economy and

85
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,319
and with the way ransomware is and and

86
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:49,680
things like that now

87
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,200
you know you used to have to steal

88
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,959
something of value and then sell

89
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:55,440
something of value and and that's how

90
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,879
you made money you know you robbed a

91
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:57,440
bank

92
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,280
you got the money uh you hack into a

93
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,800
place you get the credit cards

94
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,720
what we see now with ransomware and

95
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,080
pipeline hacking and

96
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,319
and even hacking corporations is that

97
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,239
you don't have to steal anything of

98
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:09,360
value anymore

99
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,159
you can just stop someone from operating

100
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:12,640
and

101
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,879
they will pay you a bunch of money uh to

102
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,640
restore their operations

103
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,720
and and so you know that's a big

104
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,000
motivator for me now

105
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,440
looking into these devices and

106
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,040
publishing things openly

107
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,040
so that we're not under ndas there's

108
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,640
nothing stopping us from having a

109
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,319
conversation about these things

110
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,000
all of these have been purchased legally

111
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,840
off of ebay there's a whole market for

112
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,440
this stuff out there

113
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,440
and it's fairly cheap to pick it up and

114
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,640
you'll see um

115
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,120
i've bought a lot of this stuff you know

116
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,200
as we pan around my office here

117
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,120
this is kind of just a piece of it as

118
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,040
well like there's even more devices that

119
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,720
i have because i've been doing it for a

120
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,519
number of years and

121
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,040
it just doesn't cost that much to get

122
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,200
this hardware and it's super fascinating

123
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,439
to try to learn every single piece about

124
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:54,640
it you're going to see that

125
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,400
there's a whole geographic routing

126
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,080
protocol that's used with this it's a

127
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,599
massive mesh network

128
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,680
where all the data hops between meters

129
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,959
and up to routers that

130
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,080
i happen to look like this

131
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,599
and so we're going to look at all this

132
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,280
stuff

133
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,519
i've been publishing it all on on

134
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,760
youtube and and on the wiki as well

135
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,238
and doing a bunch of protocol analysis

136
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:19,519
and so that's what we're going to look

137
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,120
at today for the next uh

138
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,720
however many minutes are left at this

139
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,360
point and so i hope you enjoy it

140
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,440
thanks a lot i encourage you if you're

141
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,040
interested in this step as well join the

142
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,320
discord channel

143
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,639
check out the wiki create an account

144
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,040
contribute stuff that you learn

145
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,759
i think it's a fascinating topic to look

146
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,320
at it's a fascinating device and these

147
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,400
massive networks of you know millions of

148
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,600
devices on

149
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,919
some kind of a 900 megahertz mesh

150
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:47,680
hopping network that you probably

151
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,919
haven't heard anything about and with

152
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:51,600
the advent of

153
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,680
software-defined radios like this hack

154
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,040
rf with a portapak or usrp

155
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:59,360
b200s um even rtl sdrs

156
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,360
you can analyze this frequency hopping

157
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,440
data and and learn more about it and so

158
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,560
that's what you're going to see that's

159
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,800
what i've been doing i hope you enjoy

160
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,320
the rest of this

161
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,919
okay so let's set the stage with some

162
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:12,639
gps coordinates plotted on a map

163
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,560
these are all the smart meters that are

164
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,360
between where i live in downtown dallas

165
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,720
as you drive up and down the freeway

166
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,400
with an antenna on the car what it can

167
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,240
receive the height above the ground is

168
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,840
how long they've been running since they

169
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,039
last lost power

170
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:26,720
so you can see in this there's the meter

171
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,720
id and it's been running for 1767 days

172
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,639
now what made me think that the meters

173
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,560
would even have gps coordinates it comes

174
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,840
from this paper here

175
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,560
that i read i found on the ieee and it

176
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,000
was written by some of the people that

177
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,840
work at landis and gear and it really

178
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,840
outlines the entire system and

179
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,840
how it functions so it gave a really

180
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,880
good framework

181
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,280
as i began digging into these meters to

182
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,560
try to understand

183
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,639
how do they even work and this right

184
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,000
here is the big part

185
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,160
it says there's a geographic routing

186
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,039
protocol

187
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:58,400
and that really struck you know that

188
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,919
peaked my interest like a geographic

189
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:00,960
routing protocol

190
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,960
what does that even mean and so as you

191
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,639
read it there's a piece here i'll look

192
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:05,919
over to the side

193
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:08,080
and read what it says says the rf mesh

194
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,080
system supports peer-to-peer

195
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,080
communication by employing a routing

196
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,639
scheme which utilizes the geographical

197
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,120
coordinates latitude and longitude

198
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,840
of the communicating nodes by nodes they

199
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,759
mean smart meters

200
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:23,759
as you can see here it shows all the

201
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,759
meters they send their messages they

202
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,680
relay in between them so it really forms

203
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,039
a large mesh network

204
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,800
but then it has to get off of that mesh

205
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,560
and it goes up to what they call a

206
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,600
router

207
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,280
like the device i showed earlier that's

208
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,280
actually a collector we'll get into that

209
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,240
in a little bit

210
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,919
then it goes to what they consider kind

211
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:41,840
of a traditional collector this is a

212
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,840
device sitting inside of a substation

213
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,639
usually with a big pole and two to four

214
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,319
antennas on it

215
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,680
now i just want to give you a little bit

216
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,440
of a framework of

217
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,280
how the packets are constructed these

218
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,199
are called five five packets

219
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:56,960
they're basically broadcast once a

220
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,319
minute and they contain

221
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:01,039
some kind of universal information they

222
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:02,720
have what you call a wan id

223
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,560
which in this case turns out to be the

224
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,800
gps coordinates that i'll show in a

225
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,840
moment here

226
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,319
and then the lan id which is the id on

227
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:11,280
the front of the meter

228
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,120
and some other information that comes

229
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,840
across that we've been working on

230
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,440
decoding now hunting online a bit

231
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,520
searching every single document i can

232
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,440
find which there's not a lot it's mostly

233
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,599
on the fcc's website that you find this

234
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:24,319
stuff

235
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,319
there was some really good manuals that

236
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:27,520
gave some information about how to

237
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,120
configure the devices and what they

238
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,080
showed was people

239
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,880
inputting gps coordinates and something

240
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,440
called a color code in the north south

241
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,599
and this kind of information and then

242
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:38,560
the output

243
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,759
would be this other string of hex values

244
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,000
that looks a lot like the wan id the

245
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,840
more i started searching around

246
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,080
so then the hunt was on to figure out

247
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,400
how do i convert this input data

248
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,440
the gps coordinates to that output data

249
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,879
so that i can go back

250
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,199
the other direction so i found eight

251
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:58,400
unique values

252
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,400
and i organized them put them in a nice

253
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,919
little list you see here and organize

254
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,080
them by the latitudes from smallest to

255
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:04,879
largest

256
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,560
and the idea would be to try to look at

257
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,400
the data on the right-hand side the

258
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,199
output

259
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,520
and understand you know if i'm looking

260
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,400
at that data

261
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,759
does it correlate at all with the

262
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,520
smallest to largest you know what what

263
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,800
can i find about it

264
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,680
and it stumped me for quite a while but

265
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,280
like all things i found with these if

266
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,120
you just keep breaking things down from

267
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,039
hex to the individual bits

268
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:26,879
and then look at the bits things start

269
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,319
to become much clearer

270
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,360
and so what we can see here is that i

271
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,120
didn't know much but from reading i knew

272
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,360
that this idea of a color code that i

273
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,839
put a c in front of here that color code

274
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:40,799
was 31

275
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:44,480
32 unique values so five bits basically

276
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,240
and on the right hand side of this you

277
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,920
see that everything's zero

278
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,920
except for one bit that's set there

279
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,040
meaning two

280
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,279
and so i knew probably the last five

281
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:54,880
bits are going to be the color code so i

282
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,560
can kind of strip them off

283
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,080
so now as a matter of just looking at

284
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,080
the rest of the data and then looking at

285
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:00,880
the pictures

286
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,360
that were from the manual to see okay if

287
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,160
i take a bit

288
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,240
for the north-south indicator a bit for

289
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,200
the east-west

290
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,720
what does that leave over for the

291
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,480
latitude and longitude

292
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,399
and then try to convert those values to

293
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:15,040
see okay do they come back to

294
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,959
the latitude and longitude values that i

295
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:18,320
see there and how do i do that

296
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,160
conversion

297
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,760
so it came down to a little bit of math

298
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,519
that i boiled down to a formula right

299
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:23,920
here

300
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,680
there's a much longer video i have on

301
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,440
youtube about decoding the gps

302
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,240
coordinates

303
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,399
so if you're interested in exactly how i

304
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,000
figured all this stuff out

305
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,839
uh feel free to watch it but otherwise

306
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,519
know that the gps coordinates are

307
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:36,720
embedded in the meters they're

308
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,320
transmitted once a minute

309
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,240
and this is how you decode it and all

310
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,240
this data is available on github

311
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,480
in a block that i wrote for gnu radio

312
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,720
so this is the full gnu radio flow graph

313
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,760
that you see here

314
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,040
and i can't show you this without

315
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,200
mentioning jacob gilbert who did a great

316
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,120
presentation a little while back

317
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,720
at the gnu radio conference and he shows

318
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,279
this whole framework this frequency

319
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:01,839
hopping

320
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:04,959
spread spectrum toolkit that they wrote

321
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:07,279
that basically grabs all the individual

322
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:08,480
transmissions

323
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,720
uh packetizes them in what they call the

324
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,839
pdu

325
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,920
and then sends it on and so it's using

326
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,839
this framework that i was able to grab

327
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,560
all these frequency hopping packets send

328
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,720
them into this block that i wrote

329
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,959
and then output the data that ultimately

330
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:25,120
gets sent over to a python script

331
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,440
that decodes and dumps the gps

332
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,480
coordinates

333
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,320
so what you see here is gnu radio

334
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,800
running it's grabbing packets receiving

335
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,200
them

336
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,320
i dump it on this terminal on the left

337
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,240
that's the debug output showing the raw

338
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,959
packets and then i start up the python

339
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:41,760
script

340
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,240
and i basically have it point to a tcp

341
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,440
server that's running

342
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,240
inside of gnu radio in one of the blocks

343
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,200
that's there

344
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,880
and it grabs that data that's coming

345
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,040
across any of the five five packets that

346
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,360
contain that gps information

347
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,279
and then it dumps it and then ultimately

348
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,600
i take it to a csv file and send it into

349
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,000
google

350
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,600
earth which is how it was visualized

351
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,040
so let's switch gears and take a look at

352
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,800
this collector i had owned the thing for

353
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,360
a while

354
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,120
but i literally hadn't even opened it up

355
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,120
i got it i set it on a shelf because i

356
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,120
was so busy playing with meters

357
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,240
and someone tweeted that inside there

358
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,720
might be an ssd drive and you know

359
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:23,839
and so let's take a look inside and see

360
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:25,920
what's there i have a bit of a longer

361
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,160
video that really dives into this and as

362
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:28,959
a reminder

363
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:30,800
this is one of the devices it's like one

364
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,640
that would be mounted up on a pole

365
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,560
that's getting all the the data back and

366
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,800
so inside you see there's a really large

367
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,680
battery

368
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,519
that you know the thing uses when the

369
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,440
power goes out so that it can keep

370
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,000
relaying

371
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
messages back from the power meters they

372
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,600
can also send messages

373
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,160
for you know 10 15 seconds after power

374
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,040
goes out

375
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,720
and so as i pulled everything apart you

376
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,240
see there's one of the radio modem

377
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:52,800
boards

378
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,839
and then underneath this panel right

379
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,120
here

380
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,560
yeah it's an ssd

381
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:08,079
so at this point i'm thinking jackpot

382
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:10,000
and so i pull everything else out you

383
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,200
know i want to do a full teardown

384
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,800
there's pictures on the wiki

385
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,240
of all this stuff that you can really

386
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,079
see detailed shots of the

387
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:17,920
small single board computer they use

388
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,279
it's intel based

389
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,040
and all the other components and this is

390
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,639
really the back plane board that i'm

391
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:23,519
taking out

392
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,440
it has all the power supply components

393
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,120
and also a cellular modem

394
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,600
that's inside of this device that they

395
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,279
use to relay the information back to the

396
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:32,320
power company

397
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,720
so i took an image of that ssd and i

398
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,440
mounted it

399
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,040
in linux and what you see here is the

400
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,519
the thing runs windows if you can

401
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:40,880
freaking believe that

402
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,920
um windows embedded seven the whole file

403
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,120
system's there

404
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,360
um there's a folder called collector

405
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,399
conveniently

406
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:50,079
that has all the files and everything in

407
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:51,839
it and it's all written in dot-net

408
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,040
and it doesn't even appear to be

409
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,360
obfuscated in any way i also was able to

410
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,720
take the same image

411
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,800
load it into a virtual machine and boot

412
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,839
it up and run it

413
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:01,600
and so here you can see that there's the

414
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,360
cellular modem that it's looking for

415
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,639
it's not connected

416
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,480
and you can also see the terminal window

417
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,560
showing the version of windows that

418
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,800
that it's running now after i let it sit

419
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,079
and run for about

420
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:14,399
10 minutes i'd walked away to you know

421
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,560
get some coffee or something

422
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,200
i come back and this program is running

423
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,959
it only seems to run if there's no

424
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:22,880
serial ports attached the minute it can

425
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,639
actually talk to a serial port

426
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,079
it just shuts down and reboots

427
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:27,680
constantly trying to find

428
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,920
probably the modem or the the cellular

429
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,839
modem or the radio

430
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:33,519
that's inside this device and it can't

431
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,600
find either of them so let's pause on

432
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,959
the collector here for a little bit and

433
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:38,480
switch back over to the meters

434
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,839
themselves and take a look at some of

435
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:41,199
the reverse engineering

436
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:43,279
that i've been doing there early on when

437
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:44,720
i started looking at them

438
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,160
i realized i needed to create some

439
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,600
schematics of these so i'd have some

440
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,120
kind of reference to understand where

441
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,320
everything's connected how it's

442
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,040
connected

443
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,720
and where i can supply a power so i

444
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,480
don't have to run them all off at 240

445
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,199
volts

446
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:56,320
so here you can see some of the

447
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,240
schematics that i've created of the

448
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,480
different processors the m16c and the

449
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,680
terridan

450
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,800
if we back out what i did a bit is

451
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,440
i bought a ton of these boards on ebay i

452
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,639
found someone that was selling a bunch

453
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,440
of them that

454
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,079
just weren't in meters and i stripped

455
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:13,760
off all the components on one

456
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,440
so i'd have something to have as a

457
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,600
reference i also took advantage of

458
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,000
having

459
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,519
all these different meters and boards

460
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,440
i've purchased to dump out all of the

461
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,480
rom chips

462
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,320
so that i can compare all the different

463
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,839
files and see

464
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:27,760
you know is there any settings what's

465
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,120
different between them

466
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,360
what can i learn about how these things

467
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,120
function by comparing a bunch of

468
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,399
different data files

469
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:35,920
now i also started looking at these

470
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,240
integrated wingate radios

471
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,519
and there's a bunch of different

472
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:41,440
versions of them but this old one is all

473
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,880
through-hole components

474
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,199
and so it's much easier to analyze and

475
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:47,120
just literally read the firmware out

476
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,399
and there was these jumpers on it that

477
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:49,920
you could set they would put into a test

478
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:50,399
mode

479
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,399
and in that test mode i could see a menu

480
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:53,760
that would show the status of the

481
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,639
jumpers

482
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:57,120
and so on the meter itself i hadn't

483
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,000
found a way to enter

484
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,240
this test mode but someone else had

485
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,320
dumped a memory chip or tried

486
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,480
and erased it on accident and what they

487
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,560
found was that when it booted up

488
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,079
it would actually dump you into this

489
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:09,760
same kind of test mode menu

490
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,399
so i did the same thing and inside there

491
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:14,639
i saw that it would show the status

492
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,839
of the jumpers and so going around this

493
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:19,040
chip with the resistor

494
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,839
and trying to set some pins low i found

495
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,560
the pin 89 on this m16c

496
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,399
would actually put it into test mode

497
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,160
without having to erase the

498
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,800
the flash memory now there's a bunch of

499
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,560
other cool menu entries in here to let

500
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,160
you do things like read out different

501
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,600
parts of the memory and

502
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,279
and test a bunch of things but there's

503
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:38,959
one that i particularly like

504
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:42,240
that lets you receive rf data from

505
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,160
a network around it and so you have to

506
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,839
specify the crc seed

507
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:48,240
which i was able to figure out for the

508
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,399
encore system around me

509
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,160
and some other information like pick a

510
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,160
channel but when you do that

511
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,639
then it receives some data and i don't

512
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,320
care so much about the receiving of the

513
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:58,880
data

514
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,880
because i already built a new radio

515
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,560
thing that that does that

516
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,720
but what's more interesting is how they

517
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,639
organize the data on the screen

518
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,639
and even what is in the test menus like

519
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,639
what are the things that they care about

520
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:12,399
and so that's much more interesting to

521
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,560
me to see the different types of things

522
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,279
they show

523
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,199
and what they're concerned about than

524
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:18,639
the actual data itself

525
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:20,240
which i can just read directly out of

526
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,120
these chips now also a while back

527
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,120
i managed to dump the firmware out of

528
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,720
one of the meters that i have

529
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,759
and so i have this m16c firmware i

530
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:31,360
loaded into binary ninja

531
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,680
and it was a large file and reverse

532
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,759
engineering assembly isn't my uh

533
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:38,079
full-time job you could say but i also

534
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:39,600
managed to get the bootloader out

535
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,839
and the bootloader is only 4k and it's

536
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:43,600
much easier to understand

537
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,199
and so i've been reverse engineering

538
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:47,600
that a bit to understand how they

539
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,320
load the key from memory that they use

540
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,079
to determine whether you access the chip

541
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:52,720
or not

542
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,959
and to potentially look for flaws inside

543
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:56,959
of the bootloader itself

544
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:58,160
so i've shown you a bit of what i've

545
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,000
been working on up until now

546
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,759
let's talk a little bit about what i'm

547
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:03,440
working on in the future and what would

548
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,839
also be interesting to figure out

549
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,359
so you've seen that they use the

550
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,280
frequency hopping pattern

551
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,919
in the 900 megahertz band what would be

552
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:13,599
real interesting is to figure out

553
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,280
well how are they hopping around and how

554
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,439
do they choose what frequency to hop to

555
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:18,319
next

556
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,480
every 700 milliseconds they hop to

557
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,839
another frequency

558
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,760
and i believe it's partially based on

559
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,679
the id of the meter

560
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,359
and some other information and they

561
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,360
discover each other even though they're

562
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,640
all hopping around

563
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,720
on these different frequencies so how

564
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,640
they hop around and what frequency they

565
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,080
choose at what time

566
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,919
would help us lower the cost of the

567
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:39,200
hardware that's needed

568
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,600
to analyze and receive all the messages

569
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,360
on the network

570
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,440
so far everything you've seen is me

571
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,720
receiving data

572
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,640
from the meters and trying to figure it

573
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,799
out but would be real interesting

574
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:53,120
is using the faraday cage transmitting

575
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,320
back to the meters

576
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,720
trying to get them to accept packets as

577
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,360
valid

578
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,440
and see how they respond so not

579
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,400
necessarily just

580
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,400
random fuzzing but actually crafting

581
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,480
valid packets with checksums that are

582
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,039
correct

583
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,679
and also the timing data and this other

584
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:08,320
information

585
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,320
and and really sending it a packet that

586
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,559
it believes is coming from the network

587
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,960
and see how it responds and then change

588
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,559
things about that packet while it's

589
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:16,960
still

590
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,760
signed properly and see how does the

591
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,520
meter react to that

592
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,080
also some of the messages that are seen

593
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,039
on the network

594
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:27,280
start with a d5 i only showed you the

595
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,720
five five packets

596
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,600
the d5 appear to be a routing protocol

597
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,679
for sending messages across

598
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:36,080
where the meter identifies itself and

599
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,919
then identifies the address that it

600
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:39,520
wants the message to go to

601
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,080
across the network what if we could

602
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,440
craft our own packets

603
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,600
and send them on to this network and

604
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,080
travel across it to another device

605
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,799
without ever actually going to the

606
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,559
router into the back end

607
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,880
you know could someone create a message

608
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,200
and a network of devices that ride

609
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,080
on this mesh network without actually

610
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,360
causing havoc or

611
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,000
or doing anything so benignly traversing

612
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:04,880
this network

613
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,679
without actually leaving the local area

614
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,240
up to a router and back to the head end

615
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,440
that's interesting as a thought

616
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,000
experiment also just the process of

617
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:14,720
discovery

618
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,679
so while looking at the different iwr

619
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:20,320
radios the integrated wayne gate radios

620
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,320
i noticed that i actually had five

621
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,000
different or four different generations

622
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,440
of these radios i had

623
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,679
second third fourth and fifth generation

624
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:28,480
radios

625
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,720
and by analyzing the data it's sending

626
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,640
what i noticed is the second third and

627
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,679
fourth generation

628
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:36,480
all use the same sync word that it sends

629
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,640
initially so that other meters receive

630
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,440
that message

631
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,440
and process it but in the fifth

632
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,840
generation they change the sync word

633
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,360
probably so they can add additional

634
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,880
features or to change the

635
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,280
the protocol and the rest of the message

636
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,360
still seem to be craft the same

637
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,840
on the meters around here but the local

638
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,360
meters would ignore it

639
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,520
since the sync vi the sync violates the

640
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,840
start and stop bits that are used

641
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,120
traditionally by the previous

642
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,240
generations

643
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,000
so that tells us that in the fifth

644
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,679
generation fundamentally

645
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:09,760
something changed they added some new

646
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,280
additional functionality

647
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,559
that'll be worth digging into also i

648
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:16,159
didn't talk about this thing much

649
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:17,919
but inside every single meter is the

650
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:20,640
ability to shut off power that's right

651
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,640
they can send a wireless message to any

652
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,960
single meter and shut off power to that

653
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,039
location

654
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:29,120
could we do the same thing you can also

655
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,720
control it through the infrared port

656
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,799
i've seen it in the menu items

657
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:35,760
that show up when i'm logged into the

658
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,240
menu

659
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,559
on the meter itself i haven't tried

660
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:39,760
playing with that yet

661
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,159
but i will in the future but also on the

662
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:43,280
rf side

663
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,960
what kind of packet comes across that

664
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,640
turns power on and off

665
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,159
i've been capturing a lot of data

666
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:49,520
perhaps it's already in there and i've

667
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,120
just missed it and it's waiting to be

668
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,320
discovered

669
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,320
and finally like i said all this

670
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,799
information the new radio block

671
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:59,520
it's on github you can see up here it's

672
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,200
also documented on the wiki

673
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,200
the wiki is always a couple steps behind

674

it and creating videos

677
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,039

678
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,159
