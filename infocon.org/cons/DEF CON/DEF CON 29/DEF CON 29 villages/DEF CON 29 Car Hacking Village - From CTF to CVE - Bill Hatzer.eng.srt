1
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:16,320
thank you

2
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,800
and thanks for coming to my talk from

3
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,400
ctf to cve

4
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,279
and uh going to talk about this uh team

5
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:24,560
we call charity case

6
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,640
and a little bit about how i

7
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,920
accidentally hacked a telematics app

8
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,199
with a little bit of knowledge you too

9
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,399
might find a vulnerability

10
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,239
who am i i'm just some guy named will i

11
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:40,160
i lead a team we call ourselves charity

12
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,280
case

13
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,120
i'm a ham operator and you're going to

14
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,399
know when you meet a ham operator

15
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:45,920
because i guarantee within five minutes

16
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:46,960
of meeting them they're going to tell

17
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,160
you their ham operator

18
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,079
it's it's kind of like an unwritten rule

19
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,559
uh so my call signs kilomike six echo

20
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,239
uniform victor

21
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,399
i am wearing a radio throughout defcon

22
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,160
so if you want to reach out and hit me

23
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:58,559
up

24
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,719
i'll be on two meter call line frequency

25
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,760
you can call my call sign

26
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,320
i'm also a ctf team lead for a few

27
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,360
different years

28
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,360
at def con's car hacking village in 2016

29
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,600
i won a little drone with the help of

30
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,560
one other person

31
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,759
in 2018 a group of people that i

32
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,600
literally met at defcon

33
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:24,159
we all grouped up and uh we won an atv

34
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:26,960
2019 i want a tesla model three and

35
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,880
that's a picture of it right there

36
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,280
if uh if you were here you'll know that

37
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,360
this car was beat up and by the time we

38
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,439
left it had no hood

39
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:38,560
um and that car

40
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,119
also got drawn all over it's been great

41
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:42,479
we've had a lot of fun with it we've

42
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:43,920
donated and done a bunch of stuff for

43
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,920
charity because of that car

44
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,000
29 2020 we won also a trip to 2021 def

45
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,399
con which we are doing in 2022 because

46
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,240
of uh the hybrid nature and

47
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,840
ohio folks not being able to come out

48
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,680
this year

49
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,840
i'm also a car hacker at least i like to

50
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,119
claim i'm one

51
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:03,840
i've got a couple cves you can check out

52
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,560
cve

53
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,080
2017 6052 and two oh one seven

54
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,560
six oh five four both are for the

55
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,000
telematics system we're going to be

56
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,920
discussing today

57
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,040
from a uh we're gonna refer to them as a

58
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,040
oem for the rest of this talk they did

59
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:19,840
ask that i

60
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,280
i don't name their actual name

61
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,120
there's also icsa1711503 which this is a

62
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,120
fun one for bar tricks and other stuff

63
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,599
when people say something unique uh

64
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,840
or if someone says are you on a list

65
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,200
because you're a hacker and i have to

66
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,000
respond i'm pretty

67
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,840
sure i'm on a list but not because i'm a

68
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,040
hacker but because

69
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,800
there's a homeland security article that

70
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,840
references one of my hacks

71
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,599
i used to be a cartooner and i say used

72
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,360
to be because i work infosec full-time

73
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,280
but for a brief part of my life i worked

74
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,519
full-time tuning cars my office was

75
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,120
a car usually a corvette a cadillac

76
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,000
cts-v

77
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,239
a camaro one of those guys something

78
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,400
with an ls powered motor

79
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,840
and i made him go really fast i worked

80
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,480
on a six

81
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,440
second car um i was the main log review

82
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,840
guy for that car and i did boost stuff

83
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,280
and then i had a bunch of other records

84
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,280
i did all by myself such as on the

85
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,319
camaro and the trailblazer ss

86
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,959
and currently i know i say i'm retired

87
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:20,239
from tuning but i still

88
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,159
work on uh the world's fastest kia

89
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,640
stinger and we're running 11s in that

90
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,920
right now

91
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,040
verified at the strip one of the

92
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,280
one of the neat things about that car is

93
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,040
it's being tuned in one of the more

94
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:33,440
hacked

95
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,239
methods i personally hack everything in

96
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,720
my life like everything is a hack

97
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,560
i always like seeing the how do i make

98
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,000
something do what it's not supposed to

99
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,280
do in a weird way

100
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,519
and when we tune that kia that's exactly

101
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,440
what we do we're using piggybacks

102
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,159
and we're lying to the sensors and

103
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:51,519
shifting voltages

104
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:53,519
to make the car think it's doing one

105
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:56,000
thing when in reality it's doing another

106
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,200
um really fun stuff the cartooning is

107
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,000
what really gave me

108
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,920
my first understanding of how can bus

109
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,040
worked in obd

110
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,080
and what systems did inside the car i'm

111
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,840
also really big in the self-driving

112
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,239
stuff

113
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:11,280
uh i drive a tesla not the one you see

114
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,319
in this picture but

115
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,840
a different tesla um i

116
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,478
love fsd though i think elon's a little

117
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,000
bit too aggressive with some of his

118
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,478
stuff

119
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:22,400
uh level five isn't going to be here any

120
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,960
time soon

121
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,840
i also worked on kama ai projects so the

122
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,680
first one i did is i was an alpha tester

123
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,199
on the key stinger stuff

124
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,440
which meant i had to build a harness

125
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,919
with just wires and a soldering iron

126
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:38,960
and i had to reverse

127
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,720
the can bus messages to figure out

128
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,000
certain things like steering

129
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,320
angle degrees and things like that and

130
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,080
we learned things for example the

131
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,600
steering angles are different on an

132
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,880
all-wheel drive versus a rear wheel

133
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,600
drive

134
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,520
so the first time i loaded the software

135
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,280
the car felt like it was drunk

136
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,960
where the other person's settings worked

137
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,560
perfectly fine for him

138
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,400
we figured out what that was with some

139
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,639
can bus knowledge and uh we're able to

140
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:01,680
fix that

141
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,960
i'm currently working on um my wife's

142
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,160
explorer st

143
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,000
she would love to have comma ai because

144
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,199
she loved it in the

145
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,400
kia so we're we're going down that path

146
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:12,960
right now

147
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,560
seeing what we can do there there's uh

148
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,240
some issues we ran into but

149
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,400
apparently a guy has a hack and when i

150
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,919
hear a guy has a hack i'm always on

151
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:20,960
board

152
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,120
um i also did something else that's uh

153
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,080
kind of unique

154
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,160
apparently i i didn't i considered a

155
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,000
python script that just scored things

156
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,520
and learned off of things but

157
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,280
uh if you read the pattern they call it

158
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,560
machine learning

159
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,600
um i i worked on a patent for detecting

160
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,400
bots inside of games based on certain

161
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,680
components

162
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,400
um if you want to read more about it

163
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,919
it's called system and method for bot

164
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:44,880
detection

165
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,680
it was while i worked at the place that

166
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,120
was why i wasn't at defcon

167
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,199
2017 and that's a very important

168
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,840
interlude to

169
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,960
me being autistic and never remembering

170
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,280
which way i'm doing something

171
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,080
uh i am on the spectrum um i would have

172
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:02,479
been

173
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,720
i used to be classified as aspergers but

174
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,960
in dsmb

175
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,319
dsmv it's now autism spectrum disorder

176
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:11,919
and because i'm a high functioning

177
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,800
person and have the savantness

178
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,960
i like to speak for those who can't

179
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,440
because i understand

180
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,000
what the sensory overload is and how it

181
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,479
feels

182
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:25,120
and you know what it does to you so if

183
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,160
you want to help out

184
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,880
if you take a take a picture of that qr

185
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,600
code right there

186
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,600
you get the opportunity to donate via

187
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,400
gofundme and it goes directly to autism

188
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,600
speaks

189
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,919
i'm not taking anything from this i'm

190
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,520
doing it 100 for charity

191
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,440
so we got a word of warning there's a

192
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,840
reason i wasn't at defcon in 2017

193
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,960
and that's because i found a cve um and

194
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,360
and that may not sound like it makes

195
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,400
sense but

196
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,599
here's what happened for me uh and why i

197
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:57,199
have this word of warning

198
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,360
i spoke to my work i told him what i was

199
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,960
working on i told him i thought i found

200
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,440
a vulnerability that could be a cve

201
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,960
and this is before i ever tried to

202
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,000
engage uh the oem

203
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,960
um my work was super supportive my my

204
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,720
boss and my boss's boss were like

205
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,479
yeah awesome fine good bug you know uh

206
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,240
there was like you know congratulations

207
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,240
and things were great

208
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,400
they had one requirement and i stuck to

209
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,759
the requirement which was

210
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,599
they did not want me to speak to the

211
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:27,520
media and i did not

212
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:32,479
at all unfortunately when you do a bug

213
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:35,599
find a bug like this and it's

214
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:38,960
so widely seen and it has such a wide

215
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,400
effect to things that people don't

216
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:40,960
normally

217
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,960
like think about or things that are easy

218
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,240
to make uh

219
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,599
sensational um it's gonna get picked up

220
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:48,639
by the news

221
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:51,840
my event was picked up by

222
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,560
most of the major news articles pc world

223
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,400
tom's hardware it was super neat to see

224
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,599
my name on those sites because these

225
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,639
were all sites i've read for a long time

226
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,280
when that happened the executives at the

227
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,800
work were not happy

228
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,080
at all um very unhappy to be honest

229
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,360
and they took actions against me because

230
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,160
of this

231
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,240
one of the actions was a verbal dressing

232
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,599
down which i didn't enjoy

233
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:19,360
uh the next was

234
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,039
they prevented me from going to defcon

235
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:22,800
and told me if i did go

236
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,319
it would be bad for my career um they

237
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:26,639
were

238
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,319
sure even though i told them that i

239
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,240
wasn't going to they were sure i was

240
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,039
going to give a big

241
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:33,839
talk at defcon and whatever and i i

242
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:34,640
didn't even have

243
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,399
like i hadn't even read the talk at this

244
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,320
point so they were just worried about

245
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,080
nothing

246
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,200
because of all this when i got invited

247
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,120
onto gma good morning america

248
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,839
i was not able to accept because i had

249
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:49,440
agreed not to talk to the media

250
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,279
even though they hadn't kept their side

251
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:53,040
of the deal i was keeping my side the

252
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:53,839
deal

253
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:56,080
so make sure if you're gonna do this

254
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,600
make sure your employee's okay with it

255
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,040
get in writing

256
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,760
you know i can't stress this enough

257
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,480
before

258
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,800
giving your talk make sure the vendor's

259
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,600
okay with it

260
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,800
unless you don't care and you want to

261
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,240
burn bridges i personally don't want to

262
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,920
burn bridges i still have a great

263
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,279
relation

264
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,440
with my vendor i still talk to them on a

265
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,880
regular basis i'm going to be meeting

266
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,680
them for dinner

267
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,120
actually here during defcon i believe

268
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,399
the only reason their name isn't in

269
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,000
there in here is because they asked me

270
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,640
not to

271
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,800
and i kept to that and that way we have

272
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,480
a great relationship if i decide to do

273
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,000
any more research on their cars in the

274
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,600
future

275
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,959
only hack your own cars and items

276
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:35,600
there's a caveat to this you're a defcon

277
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,720
you're in the car hacking village

278
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,000
there's all kinds of things around here

279
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,760
to hack that you have permission to hack

280
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,800
do that and responsibly disclose

281
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,200
so this isn't the don't try this at home

282
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:45,920
warning this

283
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,399
is the cover your butt warning get in

284
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:49,200
writing

285
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,279
make sure your vendor's okay and hack

286
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:54,080
your own things

287
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,720
it's it's inevitable when i tell

288
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,120
somebody i run a car hacking team for

289
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,880
charity they're like look at me crazy

290
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,480
like cars can be hacked and they like

291
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,000
point to some 90s car

292
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,839
and you know i look at it and go yeah

293
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,279
cars can be hacked modern cars are

294
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:08,640
basically uh

295
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,440
alexa with wheels they're iot devices

296
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,000
they've got

297
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,839
networks some of them are interconnected

298
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:15,680
to the internet i mean they're they're

299
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,600
every bit as a hackable device

300
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:22,320
as your laptop some in some ways more

301
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,160
the next question is always why would

302
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,079
you hack a car what's the point

303
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,480
and this one's my favorite because to

304
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,320
make it faster was always my response

305
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,760
back in the day because that's what i

306
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,000
did

307
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,839
when i was hacking on cars i was pulling

308
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,160
the roms out and modifying the ignition

309
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,839
tables and fuel tables

310
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:40,000
and optimizing them for the parts to get

311
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,680
optimal performance

312
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,279
you can also do things like enable

313
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:44,800
hidden features

314
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,240
on dodges for example you can enable

315
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,440
srt pages on cars that are not srts

316
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,000
you can add features let's say you got a

317
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,279
bmw they call

318
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:58,839
coding you could do something like add

319
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:01,519
a radar cruise system

320
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,360
and then you just code the ecu for it

321
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,880
and it works

322
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,920
pretty neat stuff and last but not least

323
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:08,399
is

324
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,399
i like to hack things for the fun of it

325
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:15,200
i enjoy the chase

326
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,320
so i'm going to talk about the attack

327
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,839
surface because i mentioned that

328
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:18,959
attacking cars

329
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,279
is uh actually easier than a laptop

330
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:22,560
because the attack surface is

331
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,240
insane and some of them they never

332
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,920
really thought about security on

333
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,079
so let's start with the obd port the

334
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:29,120
obd2 port

335
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,360
is where you can do data logging you can

336
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,640
check codes

337
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,480
depending on the manufacturer and setup

338
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,000
you can flash modules

339
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,720
you can send can bus messages it depends

340
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,000
on the layout of the car every

341
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,600
manufacturer has a slightly different

342
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,399
setup

343
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,399
um you know you'll have to look into

344
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,000
your specific manufacturer

345
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,680
you can tap into the can bus at

346
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,079
different points in the car for comma ai

347
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:52,079
we tapped into the can bus at the camera

348
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:53,920
that was up by the mirror

349
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,279
on the oem car

350
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,680
usb ports now i'm going to pick on mazda

351
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,200
or mazda was genius

352
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,120
so either mazda did this on purpose or

353
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,120
they just sloppy

354
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,800
but you could basically put some scripts

355
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,240
on a thumb drive and plug it into some

356
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,120
of the mazda

357
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,600
telematics units and you could get root

358
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,440
access and do things like load android

359
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,720
auto

360
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,320
so if they did it on purpose thumbs up

361
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,079
to you mazda if you did it on an

362
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:19,600
accident

363
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,880
improve your security team removing the

364
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,880
ecu this is what i spent

365
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,440
years doing full-time uh flashing the

366
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,720
calibrations

367
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,560
um there you know not just performance

368
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,000
things can be done you can make them

369
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,839
faster but you could also do security

370
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:34,880
implications

371
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,120
for example you've got a new shiny car

372
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,120
that has a transponder based key

373
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,959
and you have an ecu that expects that

374
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:42,560
transponder base key what if you just

375
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,079
turn all those features off and make it

376
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:46,079
so it'll start with any key

377
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:49,200
that's a thing you can do some

378
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,880
manufacturers have been really sloppy

379
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,360
and left

380
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,000
root logins just laying there on serial

381
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,320
ports just plug in support to some ports

382
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,600
on a motherboard

383
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,720
voila here's one of my favorites charlie

384
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,760
miller's attack on jeeps is super neat

385
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,760
that was an attack that took place over

386
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,800
the internet

387
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,399
because of an issue in the uconnect

388
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,079
systems uh i

389
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,399
encourage you to check out everything on

390
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:13,680
that attack because

391
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,639
it sounded like sci-fi the first time i

392
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:17,200
heard it

393
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,519
but the infosec side of me was like nah

394
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:20,880
dude that's totally possible all you'd

395
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,320
have to do is read the first system then

396
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,360
write some pale you know

397
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,880
i was tearing it apart in my head how

398
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,120
they could have done it uh

399
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,399
super fun great read and then today's

400
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,720
less fancy but still fun uh considering

401
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,720
i found this by accident

402
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,480
is the attack on a telematics app

403
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:42,720
how did i get into car hacking well

404
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,920
it's defcon 2016. i'm walking around in

405
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:46,880
the villages i

406
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,720
typically hung out like the lock picking

407
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,240
village and the tamper village

408
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,120
previously

409
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,360
because those were always neat to me and

410
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,959
this year i noticed something new the

411
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,199
car hacking village

412
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:59,600
so i come in the car hacking village i'm

413
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,320
a

414
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,959
car tuner by hobby i'm an infosec

415
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:04,720
engineer by trade

416
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,079
and uh after doing a couple questions

417
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:09,279
once you got a certain amount of points

418
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:10,560
you got a copy of the car hacker's

419
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,440
handbook

420
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,920
uh during that defcon and so i had a

421
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,600
copy of the car hackers handbook

422
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,760
but still which events do i have i knew

423
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,720
from previous stuff that you need a team

424
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,360
um and i've never competed at a level

425
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,600
like this you know i've only done ctfs

426
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,120
for fun at this point and

427
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,720
you know i've i've done them at the

428
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,399
office you know when we would hire a

429
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,360
company to do it

430
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,680
but i had never done anything really

431
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,760
hardcore yet

432
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,320
still i don't have a team so i started

433
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,519
hacking away and

434
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:41,440
there's there's super nice people that

435
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,040
were encouraging me and when i would get

436
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,199
stuck would you know give me hints or

437
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:46,639
sometimes tell me like go check this

438
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:48,800
chapter in the book and things like that

439
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,399
and it really kept me engaged but i

440
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:50,800
still

441
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,800
was by myself and i noticed another

442
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,000
gentleman who

443
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,160
had similar tools to me laying out you

444
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,000
know i noticed the patrick's cable

445
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,839
and some things like that and i'm like

446
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,199
this guy's a tuner

447
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:04,399
well i can talk tuner um so

448
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,160
normally autistic will that doesn't know

449
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,600
how to talk to anybody has the

450
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,680
opportunity to now talk to

451
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,600
people because it's about a topic that

452
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,760
i'm obsessed with cars

453
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,519
i started talking to this gentleman yep

454
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:17,440
he's a tuner he's a

455
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,040
cso for a company um he's he's

456
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,560
definitely in it so we decide to name

457
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,480
ourselves acid fingers and we just start

458
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,240
plugging away for fun

459
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,320
and uh little did we realize until the

460
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,000
last day that we were like in third

461
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,399
place

462
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,639
and we had the opportunity to stay in

463
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,240
third place we actually were in

464
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,079
second at one point and we were close to

465
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:37,440
first and we you know we just didn't

466
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,560
make it but either way

467
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,480
there was great people there we had a

468
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,160
great time and we still

469
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,079
won our first third place win which was

470
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:45,680
the encouragement to

471
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:49,199
continue doing this so if you

472
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:50,480
are trying to learn more about car

473
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,639
hacking check out this book i encourage

474
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:54,560
you to buy it on the no starch press

475
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,240
but there are there is a free copy

476
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,000
available on his site i believe

477
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:04,800
so why do we do it for charity um

478
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,120
really the truth is have you ever tried

479
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,320
to cut

480
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,680
an atv into five equal pieces

481
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,279
you don't get a functional anything at

482
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:15,199
the end uh and

483
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:17,920
this is what happened to us in 2018. we

484
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,320
won the atv with this team that we built

485
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,440
on the fly at def con we were not for

486
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,600
charity that year well i was but

487
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,800
other people were doing whatever they

488
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,199
wanted um and we

489
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:32,880
decided to go at it we we won

490
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,800
but we lost the title we took second

491
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,720
place that year we got the atv

492
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,399
we lost the title and that meant we had

493
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,279
to sell the atv really cheap

494
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,040
uh i told myself never again i'm not

495
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,440
doing this this is frustrating

496
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,240
so in 2019 we decided to go at it way

497
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,040
more intentional

498
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,720
we decided to build a team with the

499
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,160
right skills

500
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,560
that we thought we needed to compete at

501
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,359
a serious level

502
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,800
we also made an agreement with the team

503
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,199
that someone on the team would buy the

504
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:03,759
car

505
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:05,199
and that would give us the money to

506
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:08,640
donate to various charities

507
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:12,319
we ended up donating over nine thousand

508
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,240
dollars just to this school

509
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,480
which is why you see this picture here

510
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,520
we saved art

511
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,280
they were going to cancel art programs

512
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,880
at this local elementary and it does

513
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,760
happen to be

514
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,959
my uh my daughter's elementary but they

515
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:26,079
were going to kill art for the whole

516
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:26,559
school

517
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:29,600
and we figured what it's a local

518
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,160
area let's go at it let's do it so we

519
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,919
found out how much to save art

520
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:35,600
and we made a donation of nine thousand

521
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,960
and one dollars which was

522
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,840
over nine thousand which was the goal

523
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:40,400
and

524
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,120
uh saved art and as part of it we let

525
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,080
children draw

526
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,200
all over the tesla kids got an absolute

527
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,400
kick out of this like they

528
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,160
blew their mind they got to draw on a

529
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,919
tesla and it was all going to stay on

530
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:52,480
there

531
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,240
and it did it's still on there to this

532
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,000
day

533
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,600
2020 we won again uh that that year we

534
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,000
decided

535
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,520
to go ahead and just see if we could

536
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,880
take the toy drive that i've been

537
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,480
running which usually would make

538
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,919
you know a thousand to two thousand

539
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,600
dollars and see how crazy we could get

540
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,880
it if we threw it in

541
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,000
uh our our our about so

542
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,679
when we were all said and done we raised

543
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:16,320
over seven thousand dollars for

544
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,320
charity we ended up donating tons and

545
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,520
tons of toys

546
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,200
uh there's pictures on my twitter and

547
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,799
you'll see that at the end

548
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:25,280
um this year we're taking a break we

549
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,120
want to give other people a chance to

550
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,080
to really explore and we wanted to help

551
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:30,799
out

552
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:33,679
so if you need help we're helping people

553
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,600
out the ctf in exchange for charity

554
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,159
donations

555
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:41,600
let's talk about the timeline of cve and

556
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,679
i i gotta quote golden girls here

557
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:45,520
you know like uh like the old grandma

558
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,720
lady

559
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,919
picture it california 2016. a time

560
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:51,760
before masks

561
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,400
i'm working at a local company in the

562
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,280
bay

563
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,840
i'm leading a security gaming group

564
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,000
basically we did ctfs for fun

565
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,240
and what that entailed was i would do a

566
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,520
ctf

567
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,280
and then other folks from the company

568
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,960
who were not on the security team would

569
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:07,840
come

570
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,600
and they would participate and do the

571
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,280
ctf and they would use me

572
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,760
as their knowledge base so when they

573
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,120
needed to do a man in the middle and

574
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,320
they knew that they needed demand a

575
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,360
middle but they didn't know how to use

576
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,080
burp suite

577
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,679
i was that so what i would do is

578
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,160
practice all the ctfs

579
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,919
at home in my spare time so i could

580
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:25,919
always be up to speed on them

581
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:29,280
so an upcoming ctf i was going to do

582
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,640
needed me to set up some man in the

583
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,480
middle of an android app which is the

584
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,480
setup for all this and how i discovered

585
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,360
it

586
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,520
i had recently purchased the 2017

587
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,679
plug-in hybrid

588
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,679
sedan with a really advanced telematics

589
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:44,080
system

590
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,080
and i'm practicing and i discover a flaw

591
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,520
then 2017 i spent a large amount of my

592
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,080
time trying

593
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,799
to talk to the vendor uh initially i ran

594
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:56,160
into

595
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,919
so much trouble trying to get a hold of

596
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:00,000
anybody i make a phone call the help

597
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,640
desk

598
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,200
would tell me i was like silly and try

599
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,720
to help me reset my username and

600
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,679
password

601
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:07,360
i don't know how many times they offered

602
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,440
to reset my password for me

603
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,799
um initially i tried some emails i found

604
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:14,480
online that didn't go anywhere i went on

605
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,679
linkedin you know

606
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:18,400
i figured i could find somebody there no

607
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,559
one responded to me on there

608
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:22,559
what i learned is responsible disclosure

609
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:24,080
is really hard

610
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,799
really really hard but later you'll find

611
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:27,440
out

612
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,720
how i solved that once once i did get

613
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,520
the event

614
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,000
the vendor engaged they fixed the

615
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,120
problem in three days they didn't even

616
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,320
tell me they had it fixed i just

617
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,679
actually opened my phone that was an

618
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:39,520
update for the app and

619
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,960
as soon as i pulled down the app i

620
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,799
noticed that all of that stuff that i'd

621
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:45,760
previously found was gone

622
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,520
so what's the setup i was talking about

623
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,320
what what led me to finding it so

624
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,679
i was doing man in the middle of an

625
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:53,679
android app so what i would do is

626
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:56,960
build a linux virtual machine with a usb

627
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,120
wi-fi adapter in host ap mode which

628
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,039
basically means that my linux box was

629
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:02,000
acting like an access

630
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,559
point then i would set up some iptables

631
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:05,520
rules to route

632
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,720
all of the common non-ssl web ports

633
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,159
over to burp suite and i would set burp

634
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:14,080
suite up and not intercept

635
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,520
and i can't remember what they call it

636
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,520
passive mode or basically you can

637
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,480
blindly receive

638
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,320
do proxying for you and i had it set up

639
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,720
like that

640
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,720
so i'm i'm in the man in the middle here

641
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,520
i'm testing away on the app for the ctf

642
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,440
you know i'm finding little bugs and i'm

643
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,039
looking at burp suite and seeing what it

644
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:33,600
does

645
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,840
and biology happens you know i'm hungry

646
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,760
and i need caffeine so

647
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,880
close the app i'm working on open up the

648
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:49,280
application for my oem car

649
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,879
and tell it to start

650
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:54,799
cool give the car a couple minutes go

651
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:58,480
outside go to wendy's get me some dinner

652
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,520
i'm back enjoying my dinner and i'm

653
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:01,919
looking

654
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,799
through the logs i realize what the heck

655
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:05,600
there's an

656
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,400
http request going to an ip address just

657
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:08,880
one

658
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,360
just one request like this and every

659
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,080
other request

660
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,799
in burp suite was dns so it stuck out

661
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:15,520
like a sore

662
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:20,960
thumb here's the request i see

663
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,400
pretty quickly i was able to look at

664
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:27,360
this and obviously my oem redacted

665
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,719
was the oem's name

666
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:34,960
the next thing i noticed was the 3.94

667
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,960
was the same version as the app on my

668
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,120
phone and

669
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,039
at this point i'm like oh i think i

670
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:43,520
found something strange

671
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,240
at the very least the encryption looked

672
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,280
weak to me

673
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,600
now i'm not a cryptography person to be

674
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,480
100

675
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,360
clear i am horrible cryptography but i

676
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,320
do know

677
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,240
that like there's like the block

678
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,760
stoppers message style there's

679
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,520
different ways you can do it and it

680
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,440
appeared that part of the data above was

681
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,120
definitely being done the same way every

682
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:03,840
time

683
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,840
which led me to believe that it might be

684
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,280
breakable

685
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,559
so my next steps i've got to figure out

686
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,799
how do i replicate this web request i

687
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:16,240
need to make it happen

688
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,280
preferably happen at will next i want to

689
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,960
know about this ip address

690
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,559
what is it like where is it who owns it

691
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:27,840
all that stuff last but not least i want

692
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,280
to understand the app better

693
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,039
and i had previously played with a tool

694
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:32,640
called jx

695
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,400
and i knew i was going to use that tool

696
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,159
for this

697
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:37,440
so let's start with replicating the

698
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,760
request this was

699
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,080
giving me a lot of problems i struggled

700
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,039
um

701
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:45,919
i didn't know why it would happen i knew

702
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:47,679
that it would happen at least once per

703
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:48,240
day

704
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,320
i figured that out over the course of a

705
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,480
week i also figured out

706
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,600
by building my own receiver tool

707
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,320
that if i routed the web request to my

708
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:58,880
my

709
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,120
python script that took the web request

710
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,120
that i could make it download the file

711
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:03,679
but

712
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:06,000
tell it it didn't finish and it would

713
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,840
cause the phone to do it every single

714
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:08,400
time

715
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,159
so at this point i knew that if the

716
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:11,919
phone would open and try to upload the

717
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:13,279
file and fail that it would continue to

718
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:13,679
try

719
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:17,440
every single time it got on wi-fi

720
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,640
um i also knew that on occasion i was

721
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,720
able to make it happen

722
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,200
in certain air scenarios but i i could

723
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,200
not reliably make a new one happen like

724
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,080
i will

725
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:31,039
so in other words i'm stuck like really

726
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:33,440
frustrated and

727
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,400
time for more caffeine so let's look at

728
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,080
the iep

729
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,400
first we try some google dorking not

730
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,200
much there

731
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,279
dump the go every search engine i can

732
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:44,799
think of i hit it

733
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:47,919
um nothing hit it with a browser basic

734
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:49,039
web request

735
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:51,760
i looked at the burp suite logs to make

736
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,320
my

737
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,600
responder tool that we wrote in python

738
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,520
i in map it i want to give a word of

739
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,520
caution here please only in map

740
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,559
with the correct settings don't go at it

741
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:04,400
with dash capital a or anything that

742
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,520
could use

743
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:09,360
harmful nse scripts still nothing i knew

744
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,880
basically that was a piece of middleware

745
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,559
receiving a thing nothing else

746
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:13,440
interesting

747
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,080
what do i do

748
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:20,640
so jadex what is gen x gen x is a java d

749
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,360
compiler

750
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,360
and it does a really good job at most

751
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,960
code i've thrown at it

752
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,440
basically you give it an apk this fits

753
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,720
out some code

754
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,799
won't lie i'm lazy i didn't even

755
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:32,000
download the tool and figure out the

756
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,240
command lines i used a website and just

757
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,080
uploaded the apk file that i pulled off

758
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,679
pure apk

759
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:40,960
and pulled it down the code

760
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,360
why is this useful man plain text code

761
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,799
can tell you a whole bunch

762
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:48,240
what did that what did we find in this

763
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,919
code well the first thing i did was

764
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:51,600
search for that ip since i knew that was

765
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,799
unique

766
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:55,440
and that told me everything i needed to

767
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,880
know at that point

768
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,880
logs it's basically a log handling

769
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,799
system so whenever the system has a log

770
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:04,400
that needs uploaded i learned from the

771
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,360
code that

772
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,960
once per day it will upload the log

773
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,640
when it gets on wi-fi the first time

774
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,240
it will not do it unless it's on wi-fi

775
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,799
i learned what makes the law get written

776
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:20,400
to

777
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,039
basically logging into the app using the

778
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:23,520
app

779
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,960
anything you could do in the app makes

780
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,640
it right to the log so if you use the

781
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,240
app the next day the first time it's on

782
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,360
wi-fi it's going to upload it

783
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,840
next i want to know what is this

784
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,559
encryption

785
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:40,320
pretty awesome right near the code is

786
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,760
the encryption key

787
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,919
and the library name it uses and the

788
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:45,840
method so literally we know everything

789
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:46,559
we need to

790
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:48,080
need at this point to write some java

791
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:51,120
code to decrypt the log

792
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,720
what's in that decrypted log oh my

793
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,760
at this point is when i'm giddy

794
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,679
because i realize this log that they're

795
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:02,000
sending to a random ip on the internet

796
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
which wasn't random i did learn it was

797
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,760
one of their servers

798
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,820
hosted somewhere random

799
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:10,240
[Music]

800
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,159
it's sending a username a password your

801
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:13,919
vin your last location of the card

802
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:16,320
gps coordinates the address of the owner

803
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,679
of the car

804
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:19,679
all the features the car has you wanna

805
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:21,200
know if the car has heated seats no

806
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,399
problem it's here

807
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:25,200
caller make and model everything you

808
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:25,600
need

809
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,080
at this point to take over the

810
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,279
telematics app

811
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:31,120
so i don't even have to like get fancy

812
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,120
and write cool web requests and anything

813
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,880
and send them to a server

814
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,360
i can just launch the app on another

815
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,480
android device

816
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,799
and log in with everything i have here

817
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:43,679
to verify myself

818
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,399
here's the payload i've obviously

819
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:47,760
censored certain things

820
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,200
it's not a big deal i don't even have

821
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,360
the car anymore

822
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,720
but as you can see here my address is in

823
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,679
there

824
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:58,559
it's down the block even more the access

825
00:27:58,559 --> 00:27:59,600
token is here

826
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,600
the client id the client secret

827
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,080
everything you might need to attack this

828
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:04,880
in

829
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,520
multiple ways but why go difficult when

830
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,279
you can just load the app and literally

831
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:11,440
log in as the user at that point

832
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,440
now you might think oh you need to be on

833
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,279
wi-fi blah blah blah that makes this

834
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:16,080
attack not very

835
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:19,120
useful you would be wrong because

836
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,520
if you go to any of the hyundai dealers

837
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,360
that i looked at locally

838
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,200
and a couple that i had a friend check

839
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,600
in another state

840
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,360
they have all have open wi-fi all the

841
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,640
dealers

842
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,559
that that i looked at would have open

843
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:34,880
wi-fi and they tell you to use it so

844
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,559
when you do your first registration of

845
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:38,480
this app

846
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:42,159
it's going to uh be on open wi-fi

847
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:44,320
okay that's not that dangerous is it

848
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,000
well it is because

849
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,080
in for fun and profit i made a version

850
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,799
of this in a out of an

851
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:53,840
access point running on raspberry pi

852
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,960
using fruity wi-fi that basically i used

853
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,799
against myself

854
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:01,360
that would capture the logs when the

855
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,799
user came by

856
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:05,760
so if the user were to be if you were to

857
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,240
put this near a dealer or anywhere else

858
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,919
that there might be a user that would do

859
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:11,600
it malls or if you're

860
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,120
attacking a specific target you could

861
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,640
put it out inside their house

862
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,159
they're just going to end up moseying on

863
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:19,440
to that wi-fi using karma

864
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,200
now we're talking about a wi-fi

865
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,840
pineapple but i use fruity wi-fi instead

866
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,960
but they're going to use karma and

867
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,880
they're gonna get caught on your

868
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,559
your your attack network here and

869
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,640
they're gonna send their data

870
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:33,200
so it did have some danger but at least

871
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,120
it was isolated

872
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:38,158
and had to be targeted

873
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,080
so let's talk about reporting the flaw

874
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,080
this proved more difficult than i really

875
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,520
expected it was so

876
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,320
difficult i was so frustrated the help

877
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,120
desk calls

878
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,720
were really frustrated when i tried to

879
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,159
go karen mode

880
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:55,600
oh that went even worse i had managers

881
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,039
do call me i was

882
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:03,039
mistaken they used much harsher words

883
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:06,399
uh i had managers hang up on me i had

884
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:08,080
managers tell me to stop wasting their

885
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:08,720
time

886
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,039
i had one manager threaten me saying

887
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:12,559
that he would report me if i kept

888
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:13,200
calling in

889
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,880
i'm like i want to speak to somebody and

890
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,880
i was documenting and i wasn't calling

891
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,640
like back to back i was calling

892
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,039
like monday tuesday wednesday thursday

893
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:22,000
friday

894
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,440
um what it goes to tell us being the

895
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,000
good guys

896
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,559
really hard

897
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:32,000
so during 2016's def con i met some

898
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,520
folks from rapid seven

899
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:37,120
who were at the event and uh

900
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,960
i'm super frustrated i don't know what

901
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,520
else to do i ping my guys at rapid seven

902
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,279
and there they get back really quick

903
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:46,399
like yeah we know people at that oem

904
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:48,399
let me uh let me reach out so they

905
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:51,039
contacted the vendor

906
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:52,880
three days later after they they got

907
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,399
engaged and and sent

908
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:56,320
the first example of the payload

909
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,799
decrypted and i sent them their code

910
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:01,760
and showed them where the flaw was um

911
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,720
they had it patched

912
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,080
and that was super cool i thought that

913
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,320
was neat about a week later they did an

914
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,159
enforced patch which they made all the

915
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:11,360
old versions stop working

916
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:14,159
at this point they engage with me one on

917
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:15,440
one and we talk a little bit back and

918
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:15,919
forth

919
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:18,399
and they do some due diligence to

920
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:19,519
confirm that

921
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:21,200
it looked like no one else had done what

922
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,880
i had figured out how to do which was

923
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,640
good

924
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,279
um last but not least the vendor

925
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:28,720
witchery wants to remain

926
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,600
nameless wants me to tell you that they

927
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,840
added a voter disposability disclosure

928
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:34,559
program

929
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,320
so i'm not quite sure why they wanted to

930
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,760
make sure i include that in the talk

931
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,880
when they don't want their name

932
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:44,240
but it's in there

933
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:46,159
oh my god a pop-up during the middle of

934
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:48,559
a talk sorry i can't be team charity

935
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:50,399

is uh the group that's out there helping

947
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:13,360
out they're really

948
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:17,120
a great cause if you can drop some

949
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:20,720
coin to them do so if you can't you know

950
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,760
tell somebody else to do it

951
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,320
all right after that brief interlude

952
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,440
there how can an oem improve

953
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,159
train your staff i can't stress this

954
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:34,480
enough when i'm calling

955
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,279
consistently and telling you that i have

956
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:40,080
a problem that's that's serious

957
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,519
have your staff at least know how to

958
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:43,440
escalate to infosec if they don't know

959
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,279
how to escalate for infosec because a

960
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:47,760
guy's calling in and describing you know

961
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,919
very advanced things to them they also

962
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:50,960
don't know how to

963
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,640
escalate to infosec when they get a

964
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,559
phishing email so

965
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:56,640
to make this clear this is a thing will

966
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,480
help your whole business

967
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,799
publish your public contacts for your ir

968
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:02,559
and security team

969
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:04,000
below you'll see a method that's

970
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,559
commonly accepted please

971
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:08,080
nothing existed if i could have got a

972
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,440
hold of somebody on the security team

973
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,080
this could have been

974
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:13,600
solved in three days not almost three

975
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,200
months

976
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,120
participating bug bounty programs i have

977
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,640
personally

978
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,880
led bug bounty programs for places i've

979
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,080
worked and they've

980
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,240
always been beneficial um for us car

981
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,760
hackers that are amateurs out here

982
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,559
having fun

983
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:28,000
we love to look around and find bug

984
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,399
bounty programs last but not least

985
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:32,399
participate in the car hacking village

986
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:34,159
and i'm gonna pick on tesla a little bit

987
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:35,760
here just because i like picking on

988
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,279
elon's company

989
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:40,320
and i'm a fan um

990
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:43,279
don't be tesla in 2018 tesla brought out

991
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:44,320
a

992
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,880
tesla to look at they also banned me

993
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,640
from touching the tesla when i started

994
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,360
poking it

995
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,440
and trying to make it join my wi-fi and

996
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,399
do things

997
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:53,600
so if you're going to bring a car in

998
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,039
here understand that people want to poke

999
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:56,159
it and explore

1000
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:58,080
so be a good vendor there's been great

1001
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,840
partners there's lots of great partners

1002
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:00,480
in this

1003
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:03,279
corps that bring cars and even bring

1004
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:04,320
like tesla

1005
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,640

1016

i didn't expect to win in 19 i expected

1017
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:31,359
us to do a good job

1018
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:34,239
but so my plane flight was back i was i

1019
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,839
was already on the airplane at this

1020
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:36,480
point

1021
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,520
and pictured here as wilson

1022
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,839
who is uh we were we were super excited

1023
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:43,839
to have on our team he actually competes

1024
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:44,800
on the rpi

1025
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:47,040
main defcon ctf that year they ended up

1026
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,280
not qualifying so we got to steal him

1027
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,000
in the back is eason he's super cool he

1028
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,280
drives this car around

1029
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,879
and it looks not like that the hood's

1030
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:56,320
different now with all the writing on it

1031
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,119
instead

1032
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:58,720
because that hood wouldn't stay closed

1033
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,400
we had to take it off

1034
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,800

1035

no hood

1052
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:36,079
and it's a low battery it only gets 140

1053
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:39,119
miles if you put a cardboard hood on it

1054
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:41,520
