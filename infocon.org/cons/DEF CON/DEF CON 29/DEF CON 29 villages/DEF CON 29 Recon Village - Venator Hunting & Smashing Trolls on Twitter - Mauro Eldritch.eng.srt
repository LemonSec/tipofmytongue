i hope our talk is to your liking

36
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,240
so this talk is about trolls how their

37
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,119
tactics work

38
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,520
how to identify them based on different

39
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,400
behaviors

40
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,759
and patterns they show and how they

41
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:34,320
turned

42
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,520
social media into propaganda machines

43
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,600
we will explain a real case of a

44
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,320
propaganda paratu sing from the inside

45
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,000
this is something that we have been

46
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,360
working on

47
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,600
during the previous defcon during the

48
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,799
previous year and we

49
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:50,720
even published it on this same village

50
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,520
in the recon village last year

51
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,159
using a subpuppet account we will be

52
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,200
able to profile

53
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,159
and analyze different members of this

54
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:01,920
propaganda paratus

55
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,680
and show its results here we will also

56
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,799
try to profile

57
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,720
ongoing campaigns that just happened

58
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,959
some days ago

59
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,080
we will show different tools not only to

60
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,680
analyze but to combat

61
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,800
these trolls and among those tools there

62
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,520
will be

63
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,840
venator our tool

64
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,280
just uh a little disclaimer all the

65
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,319
information that

66
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,360
you will see here was obtained via

67
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,640
legit means via ocean

68
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,760
and all the accounts which are going to

69
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,239
be displayed during this investigation

70
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,920
are anonymized so no real uh usernames

71
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,000
will be displayed even if those belongs

72
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,800
to a troll account to a faye account

73
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,840
or whatever and obviously we were not

74
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,560
involved in

75
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,400
anything illegal so

76
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,319
now my partner santiago is going to give

77
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,760
you a brief introduction

78
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,400
on the core concepts that we will use on

79
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,319
this talk and

80
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,800
then we will be able to further advance

81
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,400
and to

82
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,800
see this propaganda paradox from the

83
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,040
inside and start analyzing it

84
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,840
so santiago please go ahead

85
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,360
introduction first of all let's talk

86
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:19,840
about

87
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,040
what propaganda is it is known

88
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,000
as the set of means methods and

89
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,599
techniques by means

90
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,879
of which a message is made noun

91
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:33,519
disseminated or disseminated with the

92
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:34,319
aim

93
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:37,599
of attracting followers or followers

94
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:40,720
for its cause or influencing people's

95
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,799
behavior as such propaganda has been

96
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,640
used for primarily political religious

97
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,080
social or even military purposes

98
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,000
throughout history it is an important

99
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,879
weapon

100
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,799
of ideological struggles that uses

101
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,000
all the media that we are within its

102
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,200
reach

103
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,360
from the traditionally to the

104
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,640
non-traditional

105
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,480
it differs markedly from advertising

106
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,840
and tries to push an agenda

107
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,959
in this talk we will tell you how we use

108
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:19,918
it

109
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:23,919
daily in politics what do drugs

110
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:27,120
do and what are they

111
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,120
the objective of the troll on the

112
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,639
internet is to

113
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,840
show discord create confrontation and in

114
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,479
general i know it by diverting

115
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,360
the conversation from other users and

116
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,320
attracting

117
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,919
attention to him how do you do that

118
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,000
leaving comment where you want to create

119
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,120
conflict

120
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,560
it can be in social network web page

121
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,000
or blogs that download allow comments

122
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,080
forum etc any online site where they can

123
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,840
make a comment or whatever chat live

124
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,720
as in an online game is a trolls

125
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,000
playground

126
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,919
all you have to do is make a comment

127
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:09,120
provocative

128
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,080
enough that another user responds in a

129
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,440
similar tone

130
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,440
and follows the conversation on that

131
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,360
line

132
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,800
in the end the issue is distorted

133
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,000
and the troll has achieved his goal

134
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,080
which is to have been the center of

135
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,919
attention and cause it

136
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:31,199
an argument trolling can be more

137
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,759
directed towards an entity such as

138
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:34,800
company

139
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,759
or company or a brand or towards a

140
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:38,479
specific

141
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:41,440
person in this particular case we are

142
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,880
going to show you

143
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,199
how the trolls act in favor of the

144
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,120
political apparatus

145
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,440
that is closely linked to a particular

146
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,880
political party

147
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,919
or idolatry and the trolls

148
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:57,360
can live in spain comets phantoms

149
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,800
are only any other material that would

150
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,000
alter rapidly could turn the tree

151
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,639
into something unbearable to follow for

152
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,560
legend commentators

153
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,680
okay how to detect them or how to spot

154
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,720
them it's simply you just have to use

155
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,400
benator now like it's just a joke

156
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,600
or maybe not the first thing we should

157
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,080
look at

158
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,960
an account is its profile picture if

159
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,319
it's incredible

160
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,479
yes it's really is that the person who

161
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,319
claims to be

162
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:33,280
then the numbers and the end of the its

163
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,160
user

164
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,360
yet yes it is not exactly

165
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,720
long and substantial

166
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,840
if what you post has cover coherence

167
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,360
or simple publishes phrases or political

168
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,759
attack

169
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,880
if you participate in discussions where

170
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,240
controversial

171
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,160
or trending hashtags are used

172
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,360
behavior is fetal a decide in the

173
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,160
presentation

174
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,720
this type of stroke never work alone

175
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,440
so i'm rehanging they never come along

176
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,160
because

177
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,599
he he works at groups

178
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:17,039
what is a propaganda

179
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,599
is a system in detail created for a

180
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:20,880
political

181
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,160
social etc what seeks

182
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,199
to try to convince a sector

183
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:30,479
that the new is true or simple

184
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:33,759
to try to persuade that something

185
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,199
is wrong and a simple missing form

186
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,800
throughout the use of social networks

187
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,680
or another type of communication channel

188
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,720
in this case we have come to talk to you

189
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,680
about the program propaganda devices of

190
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,520
social networks

191
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,360
particularly in the social network

192
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,360
twitter

193
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,879
as is publicly known this is network

194
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,639
excluded with trolls and boots

195
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:07,440
to fulfill different purposes or

196
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,479
missions

197
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:11,680
that are are a signal to it

198
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,960
that are single treated at a certain

199
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,240
time to try

200
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,639
to make a train in a particular country

201
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,160
um depending on the country how long

202
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,199
it takes to become a trend

203
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,560
these devices are made up of real

204
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,839
people trolls and bots the best known

205
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,799
cases are the glove set in russia the

206
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,080
5th decent party

207
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,200
in china the united front department in

208
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,559
north korea

209
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,880
the bolivarian army of trolls in

210
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,000
venezuela

211
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,600
under cyberka in argentina

212
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,640
the apparatus propaganda apparatus is

213
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,560
quick and massive interaction leading to

214
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,640
fabricated trends

215
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,680
and depending of the country

216
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,640
how long it takes to become a truck why

217
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,040
are

218
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,320
social network use because

219
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,760
it is easier to visualize

220
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,880
you can write a message from any device

221
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,160
which has the internet

222
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,680
the ability to lead a propaganda machine

223
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,200
from within arms reach without even

224
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,040
taking five minutes it's simply

225
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,440
one of the greatest advantages that this

226
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,560
type of people

227
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,719
who are dedicated to this runway

228
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,399
you can easily automate and delegate all

229
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:38,880
kind

230
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:43,279
of functions within the trending topics

231
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:46,000
it is not expensive to maintain or

232
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,279
create

233
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,000
but the only cost it has will be that of

234
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,320
the

235
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,680
international service to access

236
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,519
an account and give orders or simply

237
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:00,880
execute them to meet your daily

238
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,240
object the big question do

239
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,000
social networks authorize these types of

240
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,320
accounts and behaviors

241
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,720
follow me and i will tell you in more

242
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,600
detail

243
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,240
on the next slide in this slide we can

244
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,040
see which

245
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,120
are the countries that suffer the

246
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,959
greatest attack

247
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:26,640
from the propaganda apparatus which have

248
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,399
chosen to block ips there be

249
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,200
causing the trolls to be censored in

250
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,800
some way

251
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,320
thus avoiding to a large extent degraded

252
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,040
dimension

253
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,160
of attack of this nature

254
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,360
these countries include russia china

255
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,680
iran north korea syria and pakistan

256
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:54,399
it doesn't mean that other countries

257
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,000
do not do it as well but

258
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,600
that these are the countries that use it

259
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,519
most frequently here we can see how

260
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,160
the peroneus party created a social

261
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,279
network

262
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:12,000
to try to fight against impelling and

263
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,200
establishment

264
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,920
but in reality it is an organizing

265
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,560
network

266
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,680
of attack with votes and troll

267
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,519
that focuses on social network such as

268
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,560
twitter to launch its attacks

269
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,680
heavily mission

270
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,040
but the most surprising of all is that

271
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,320
they coordinate

272
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,519
from this type of social network to make

273
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:41,519
more effective and massive attack

274
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:45,519
thus pretending to fulfill its objective

275
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,560
and task worst of all

276
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,600
this type of propaganda apparatus is

277
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,519
endorsed by argentina's

278
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:57,040
minister of culture

279
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:01,040
where only its military participates

280
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,000
summarizing all these we can see what a

281
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,880
propaganda

282
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:09,120
apparatus was which are trolls and bots

283
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,200
where they come from and what they are

284
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,639
using for

285
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,040
i hope you dropped your own conclusion

286
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,639
to continue with the talk

287
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:19,680
and to be able to understand even better

288
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,120
this next stage of it so your country

289
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,639
has a propane apparatus

290
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:29,120
yes okay let's take a look inside

291
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,519
so trucking trolls in this new chapter

292
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:32,720
we are going to

293
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,880
analyze at last a real case of a

294
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:39,279
propaganda paratus

295
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:42,639
so a real case here is the cyber k or k

296
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,200
troop group this is an investigation

297
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,880
that started last year

298
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,399
and we luckily we were able to present

299
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:51,920
it here at the recombilash

300
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:55,760
last year so we don't want to repeat

301
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,639
content from that previous talk so in

302
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,560
the next slides in the next few slides

303
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,519
we are going to

304
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:05,600
summarize a whole year of investigation

305
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,000
so try to work with us because we are

306
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
going to be a little bit uh fast-paced

307
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,279
here

308
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:14,800
but the idea is to give you a context on

309
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,959
how we got here what are we doing

310
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:18,079
actually here

311
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:21,360
on this exact spot so

312
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,639
that context is needed in case you want

313
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:25,279
to

314
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:27,120
see every detail every single

315
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,040
communication we had with this apparatus

316
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,160
every single

317
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,959
thing we did you can refer to our

318
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:33,839
previous talk

319
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:37,040
from the previous year it will be linked

320
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,320
on the github repository for this talk

321
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,320
so you will be able to fetch all the

322
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,760
information you need from there

323
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:49,760
this propaganda apparatus is argentinian

324
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,240
so obviously all its communications are

325
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,399
in spanish

326
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,240
as a native spanish speaker i have

327
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,240
translated all the communications in

328
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,199
english so

329
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:02,800
you don't have to worry about that part

330
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:07,359
and aside from being

331
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,320
a propaganda paratus based on the

332
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,959
spanish language it has

333
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,120
another thing that makes it that makes

334
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,399
it very particular

335
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,959
which is that this propaganda apparatus

336
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,399
is

337
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:24,800
composed of uh real users real people

338
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,279
bots there are mostly twitter bots

339
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:28,320
dedicated to

340
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,560
retweet and to spread to broadcast

341
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,760
certain accounts and trolls

342
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,240
these are fake accounts puppets and so

343
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,480
on

344
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:43,680
this propaganda apparatus is used to

345
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,360
publicly retweet

346
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,440
its leaders and to promote different

347
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,399
hashtags that they have

348
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,880
some legit users on twitter reported

349
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,680
that

350
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,920
they have received invitations to join

351
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,000
these apparatus

352
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,959
so that rang up all on our heads and we

353
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:02,720
say okay

354
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,279
how can we get that invitation for

355
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,560
ourselves

356
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:10,480
how can we be invited there

357
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,320
so we decided to create a puppet account

358
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,000
to get an invitation to get this

359
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,560
invitation

360
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:23,519
the sock puppet was created by hand

361
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,440
we had we we have only used

362
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,360
social engineering so far we haven't

363
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,279
used any tool

364
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:33,680
we based our sock puppet on pure

365
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,720
observation

366
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,000
we just started looking at their

367
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,639
hashtags at the most promoted hashtags

368
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,600
on the politics side of things so we

369
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,800
created a fake

370
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,279
profile imitating the accounts that

371
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:51,199
started broadcasting those hashtags

372
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,680
so we decided basically to be able to

373
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,560
to subtly merge between those accounts

374
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,880
so we try to imitate them to mimic them

375
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,120
as much as possible

376
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,920
we used a really particular

377
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,399
configuration for this account

378
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,759
for example for the profile photo

379
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:14,959
we chosen a really popular picture of

380
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:16,880
president fernandez and vice president

381
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,480
fernandez together

382
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,040
most accounts on these propaganda

383
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,160
paratus

384
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,199
featured that very same picture so we

385
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:27,920
say why not

386
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,360
about the cover photo while most of the

387
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,240
accounts

388
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,519
involved in these hashtags did have not

389
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:39,440
no no cover photo

390
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,320
we decided to pick one for ourselves but

391
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,000
most of these accounts didn't feature

392
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,279
one

393
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:47,440
so we chosen one of vice president

394
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,399
fernandez

395
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:50,480
from a couple of years ago when she was

396
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,920
a president

397
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,759
giving a speech at the belles stadium

398
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:57,600
we started following the president

399
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,279
obviously and some minister

400
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,600
and a few pro-government accounts that

401
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,079
were run by real people

402
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:06,000
some of them or most of them were

403
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,919
journalists or different

404
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:11,039
political analysts from different

405
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:14,799
tv programs or talk shows

406
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,000
and on the description field on

407
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,959
our own tweets we started imitating

408
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,000
their a specific language and symbolism

409
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,400
that they were using we are not uh

410
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,720
specialists on linguistics or anything

411
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,160
we only used the tutor api to monitor

412
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,160
all the tweets or the hashtags and

413
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,840
extract the most repeated words

414
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,880
forming a word cloud which you can see

415
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:45,600
here most of these words in spanish

416
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,799
are pejorative terms to refer to

417
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:52,400
the opposition or to certain

418
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,520
opposition leaders

419
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,400
so during the first hours

420
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,679
of this sub puppet account

421
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:06,880
we raised around a hundred followers

422
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,000
in just a couple hours

423
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,280
we were only tweeting about

424
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,000
their hashtags and using as much as

425
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:16,880
possible

426
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,320
the very same words so

427
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,520
in order to generate some

428
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,960
how to say in order to generate

429
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,840
serotonin affinity

430
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:31,039
after three days somebody

431
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:35,360
sent me a dm and that was our invitation

432
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,480
and i have it here as i said before

433
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,280
all the accounts those that represent

434
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,160
real people

435
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:47,280
or not will be anonymizer no matter what

436
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,240
this person says hey buddy we are making

437
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,000
twitter groups to install hashtags

438
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,160
do you want to join and i'm going like

439
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,400
okay hey buddy sure what i'm supposed to

440
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,080
do

441
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,799
basically you have to tweet the hashtags

442
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:02,240
that we sent to the group

443
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,440
and that's more or less that's it

444
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,400
i was added to the group number 300 and

445
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,320
something of soldiers of the national

446
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,840
project

447
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,080
this group contained 50 people this is

448
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,039
an important detail

449
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,840
on that group people started talking

450
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,200
about different things

451
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:25,120
but mostly there were briefings

452
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,160
about a specific situation and a hashtag

453
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,039
to broadcast regarding that specific

454
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:32,400
situation

455
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,200
for example this person say hears hey

456
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,440
guys ariel garvers is asking us to use

457
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,120
laretta is responsible so

458
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,559
as you can see on the picture on the

459
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,400
left there is a briefing

460
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,200
on this picture on green with spanish

461
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:47,679
text

462
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:52,320
it says a small briefing um

463
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,400
finally it proposes a hashtag to be

464
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,440
broadcasted

465
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,400
to install this trend this uh this is a

466
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,720
trending topic

467
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,400
narita in this case is the mayor of

468
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,240
buenos aires city and it's a member of

469
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,320
the opposition

470
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,799
ariel garvas as we discussed in our

471
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:10,240
previous talk

472
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,559
is the leader of the propaganda

473
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:14,720
apparatus they don't hesitate on

474
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,400
addressing him by his real name

475
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,240
as you can see here and this is from a

476
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,640
neutral source

477
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,640
getdatetrends.com

478
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,360
there were two hashtags proposed in that

479
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:33,199
group the number two and number four

480
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,760
both of these hashtags are fabricated

481
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,760
trends proposed on these groups

482
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,600
as you can see in the picture in the

483
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,760
previous picture

484
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,799
and they made it to the top five trends

485
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:49,679
in my country

486
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:52,320
now taking a look at another third-party

487
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,320
source by trending alia

488
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,360
we can see that both these trends lasted

489
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,480
for at least

490
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:03,280
12 hours straight this allows us to say

491
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,919
and to state that these interventions

492
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,760
are highly toxic

493
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:12,879
they remain for almost half a day

494
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,360
now another person goes like this i will

495
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,080
translate

496
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,200
once again with ariel karvaars

497
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,159
remember the leader of this propaganda

498
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:25,919
paradise

499
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:28,320
we formed a group where he's the

500
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,280
administrator

501
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,760
and tells us what to publish and at what

502
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,679
time so we can get our trend to

503
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:37,200
always be on first place once again you

504
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:37,840
see that

505
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,520
they already assume

506
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:45,679
what the consequences is going to to be

507
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,679
so they are already sure that they will

508
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:48,720
install

509
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,760
this as a trending topic

510
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,320
and another one goes like okay yeah it's

511
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,320
like you say we used to do the same long

512
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,400
ago with the k dude

513
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,440
the k youth it's the prototype of what

514
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,120
is now the

515
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,240
k troop or the cyber case it's

516
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,480
it's part of the same group of people

517
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,159
and they say okay you have to sit a day

518
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:10,880
and a time

519
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,000
and it's the best so

520
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,919
they are really used to do this thing

521
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:18,240
it's not something they are

522
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:22,000
newbies at once again certain slogans to

523
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,679
be spread

524
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:25,840
as you can see in the blue picture and

525
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:26,960
the

526
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,679
purple one

527
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:34,720
and then whatsapp chat it's shared

528
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,520
obviously we entered to see how it's

529
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,520
going to be like

530
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,080
but before jumping into the whatsapp

531
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,440
part

532
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,200
this is a screenshot from one of our

533
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,480
twitter accounts

534
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,280
take a look at this

535
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:53,120
we have according to our latest group we

536
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,559
found we have found

537
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:01,840
350 propaganda groups on twitter alone

538
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,360
as you can see in this picture on the

539
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,440
left we were invited

540
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,120
twice to different groups so they

541
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,280
do not have a real tight control on

542
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,640
who's on

543
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,480
on who belongs to each group

544
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,960
each one of these groups holds 50 users

545
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:19,760
49

546
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,960
plus one admin and

547
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,200
we can say that the total number of

548
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,679
users in those groups

549
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:32,720
is a little bit more than 17 000

550
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:37,840
that's quite a lot of users

551
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,200
and now jumping into the whatsapp site

552
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,080
as you can see

553
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:46,320
what the person sending the hashtag here

554
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,520
saying okay at half past seven

555
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:53,279
we are going to to use this next hashtag

556
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:56,480
dollar withre the person sending this

557
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,480
message with the phone ending in eight

558
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,159
five five four it's a real garbarce

559
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:02,480
itself

560
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,880
as we can see in this group name all

561
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,200
groups are numbered

562
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,240
this is the seventh group so there are

563
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:10,799
at least

564
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:14,240
six more each one of these groups is

565
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,200
already full

566
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:20,240
and it has at that time 255 users

567
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,480
without taking their administrator into

568
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,159
account

569
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:26,880
so if we multiply these users we have

570
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,600
almost 2000 new users

571
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,559
and if we wrap up all the users into a

572
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:34,080
single

573
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,200
operation we have almost 20 000

574
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,520
users but note that some users may be

575
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,240
present

576
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,360
as it is our case in different groups at

577
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,000
the same time

578
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,120
so there are maybe repeated users this

579
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,080
is an

580
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,720
estimated like number so we can say for

581
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,960
sure

582
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:59,600
now you might say okay uh 20 000 users

583
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,200
now that's a lot to

584
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,720
fight back yeah it's not easy but there

585
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,559
are some tools

586
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:09,120
not provided by twitter sadly but

587
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,120
provided by third parties

588
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:14,960
that will allow you to block massively

589
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,080
certain accounts or

590
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,840
for example an account and all its

591
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,360
followers

592
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,080
or all people that have interacted with

593
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,679
a certain tweet

594
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:28,960
for example liking it and so on we have

595
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:29,440
these

596
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,240
three alternatives that are pretty good

597
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,440
actually

598
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,480
sadly a blog together is running i don't

599
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,200
know if it's

600
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,240
running out of business or

601
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,840
simple the project is going to be

602
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,080
abandoned i'm not pretty sure

603
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:47,200
something that it's happening just uh

604
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:51,279
as we speak i think um

605
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:53,919
mega blok for example that says okay

606
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:56,240
we'll let you nuke a tweet it would

607
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,279
allow you to

608
00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:00,480
block not only a person

609
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,600
giving or writing a specific tweet

610
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,679
but all the people that interacted with

611
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:06,880
it

612
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,200
also twitter blockchain which is a

613
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,240
third-party chrome extension

614
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,600
works on a similar way but

615
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,480
again there's nothing natively provided

616
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,240
by twitter aside from the silence or

617
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,240
blocking functions

618
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:25,520
and they are used one by one so you

619
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,760
can block or silence one account at a

620
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,279
time

621
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:31,760
so unless you're pretty good with the

622
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,400
api

623
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,080
and you know what your way around and

624
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:37,039
you know exactly what you're doing

625
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:38,400
yeah it's going to be a little bit

626
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,039
complicated

627
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:46,320
so back to analysis remember that we

628
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,760
have this account

629
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,720
which was invited and with this

630
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,320
invitation we're going to two

631
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,960
main things first we're going to need

632
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:55,840
access to the group

633
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:59,200
chats which means that we have early

634
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,000
access to

635
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,600
the threads they are trying to install

636
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,320
and on the second hand we have access to

637
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,320
higher ranking profiles

638
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,520
that otherwise we won't we won't be able

639
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,159
to

640
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:15,360
see why because these

641
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,480
higher ranking profiles in these groups

642
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,240
are not involved in tweeting are not

643
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,720
involved in broadcasting these hashtags

644
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,840
in spreading this misinformation they

645
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,720
are involved

646
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,520
only in coordinating the actions so you

647
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,200
will never see them tweeting about

648
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,559
something

649
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:34,880
they will propose the hashtag but never

650
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,120
say it aloud

651
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:40,240
so having discovered this i think that

652
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,159
it's time to fit all this data into

653
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:44,159
benator

654
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:46,720
at last binator hunting and smashing

655
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,000
trolls as we promised

656
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,000
it binator is our open source

657
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
tool to triage different

658
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,200
accounts on social media

659
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,960
and when we started this investigation

660
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,080
on last year the original venator was a

661
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,520
lua script

662
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:11,039
which was really rigid really hard to

663
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:12,399
maintain

664
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:16,080
um it was a tool for which any

665
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:20,159
change that we needed must be

666
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:23,600
done multiple times in the source code

667
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,640
we didn't have

668
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:28,880
anything quite uh tidy quite organized

669
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,640
because we thought that binator will be

670
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,399
something disposable

671
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:35,760
something that we were going to use once

672
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,720
or twice or that will be bundled inside

673
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,919
something

674
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:41,679
something else maybe a framework or

675
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:43,440
maybe another tool

676
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:47,200
but in the end the reality is that

677
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,559
we we found ourselves using binator on a

678
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:52,000
daily basis

679
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,880
so we agreed that we had to rework all

680
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,360
of this application from scratch

681
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,000
so this cli tool that you see here

682
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,039
became

683
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:04,240
binator rv which is written in ruby

684
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,640
and this newest release features web

685
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,360
interface

686
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,480
and api access and

687
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,360
since this one uses a database backend

688
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,559
we are able to keep

689
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:18,080
track over the time for changes on

690
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,480
different reputation triashes that we

691
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,799
are carrying on different accounts

692
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:26,159
and also it helps us to make formulas

693
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:28,880
more elastic

694
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,279
we are going to use this tool binator to

695
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:35,919
profile one of the cyber case campaign

696
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:37,760
that is actually

697
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,240
ongoing as we speak as we are recording

698
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,279
to stock

699
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,360
this campaign just happened a couple of

700
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,399
hours ago

701
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:47,440
so this is pretty fresh pretty hot too

702
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,720
so

703
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,399
our idea is to keep um to keep an

704
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:55,840
eye on the most recent

705
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:59,840
campaigns that we can share with you so

706
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,640
this happened on august 2nd and 1st it's

707
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:05,120
pretty much this week

708
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,600
we are going to follow three hashtags we

709
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,200
are i'm not going to take the time

710
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,320
to explain in each one of them because

711
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,200
there are

712
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:17,120
there's a long story of

713
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:20,640
political uh rivalry here so it's pretty

714
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,559
hard to explain

715
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:25,919
these are one-sided hashtags

716
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:29,039
this uh these are going from

717
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:31,679
the official propaganda paratus against

718
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:33,440
the opposition

719
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,080
and are the following iglesias

720
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:36,880
misogynist

721
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:40,320
which is illesias is a parliament member

722
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,720
the fugitive and the stranded which are

723
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,440
references to two politicians

724
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:49,440
and pro-smugglers pro it's

725
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,799
an old political party from the

726
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:53,120
opposition and they are calling them

727
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,840
smugglers basically

728
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,880
so we have selected 70 accounts which

729
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,679
are the first 70 ones to engage with

730
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:04,799
all the proposed hashtags or at least

731
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:08,320
one of the proposed hashtags given

732
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,679
that no other account

733
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:13,760
is there to fill this number to fill the

734
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:17,200
70 ranks that we need

735
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:20,080
so before starting feeding this

736
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:20,960
information

737
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,279
let's try to do some awesome some open

738
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:26,000
source integrations over those hashtags

739
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,720
how it started let's go with iglesias

740
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,000
misogynist

741
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,279
it's number three and look

742
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:35,519
at the graph on the graphic you can see

743
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:37,120
that it's making a plane

744
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:40,720
it just rises skyrocketed and then

745
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:43,519
it maintained a certain number of

746
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:46,090
interactions over the time

747
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:47,279
[Music]

748
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:49,279
here you can see it with more detail it

749
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:51,519
started skyrocketed

750
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:54,000
and started trying to and struggle a

751
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,200
little bit

752
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,440
after a couple hours to still remain

753
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,880
between the most ranked

754
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,840
trends

755
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:05,760
now how is it going look at this trend

756
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:09,600
don't you see something strange trends

757
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,720
do not normally skyrocket 10

758
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,519
fall down abruptly something is amiss

759
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:17,120
here

760
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:20,799
this indicates clearly that there was a

761
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:22,559
coordinated action

762
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:25,440
because it skyrocketed at first it

763
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,679
struggled to be maintained among

764
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:30,000
the most high the highest ranks of the

765
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:30,960
trending topics

766
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,039
and also it reached the num the place

767
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:36,480
number one as you can see here

768
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:40,159
and after a couple of hours it just

769
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:45,039
fell it just absolutely felt abruptly

770
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:47,840
so this is a good indicator that

771
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,440
somebody say okay

772
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,600
start with this and that also somebody

773
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,960
say okay

774
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,519
cut it out finish finish with this we

775
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:57,919
are done with this

776
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:02,320
and it lasted for a good couple of hours

777
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:06,640
now what about the other trends

778
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:09,760
they were just bite and switch they just

779
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:10,799
started

780
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:14,158
and automatically fell

781
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:17,360
look about the other this is the pro

782
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,279
smugglers one

783
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:22,640
look at the fugitive and the stranded

784
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:25,679
it lasted for a couple of hours

785
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:28,559
a little bit more than the last one but

786
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:30,480
it was more like a python switch

787
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,720
they started and automatically dropped

788
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,880
it

789
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:40,240
now this is an analysis from binator

790
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:43,279
we are interested in those trends that

791
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:45,039
have the inspect button in red

792
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:47,200
because those are the market hashtags we

793
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,120
want to follow

794
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:52,320
melissa's misogynist has almost 2 000

795
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,760
interactions

796
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,720
and it's number first in the threads but

797
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,640
look at number two

798
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,600
that means in spanish the life we want

799
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,279
it only has a hundred

800
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:06,799
ten why so much difference

801
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:09,760
remember that we have uh only subscribed

802
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,800
70 users to venator

803
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,679
so are you going to tell me that 70

804
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:16,800
users just

805
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,480
shared iglesias misogynist

806
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:24,320
two thousand times that's pretty weird

807
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,440
now what about the pro smugglers 60

808
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,639
this means that a couple of this account

809
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:35,280
haven't engaged in that hashtag

810
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,119
now take a look at the other one the

811
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:39,199
stranded and the fugitive

812
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:44,639
21 interactions that's pretty few

813
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:48,239
and remember that

814
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:51,679
users tend to tweet

815
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:54,719
these hashtags more than once

816
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:57,359
so there's a high chance that a lot of

817
00:34:57,359 --> 00:34:59,040
people

818
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,359
are just alone tweeting and retweeting

819
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:02,160
this hashtag

820
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,000
and this doesn't represent for example

821
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,880
21 real users here

822
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,079
this can belong all to the same account

823
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:14,240
so as you can see most of these

824
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:18,400
hashtags these strengths are politically

825
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,920
motivated

826
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,359
but we can stop due to a time constraint

827
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:25,040
we can't stop to analyze each one of

828
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:25,440
them

829
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,640
so let's keep going let's see this

830
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,400
details and distribution this is a

831
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,320
blacklisted hashtag i've liked

832
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:35,760
it myself in order to binator to be able

833
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,280
to analyze it

834
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,720
it was seen almost 2000 times as i say

835
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:44,240
on 70 users and these are the users that

836
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,240
share this hashtag the most look at the

837
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,880
count columned

838
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:54,000
one of them shared it 136 times

839
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,839
other people shared it almost a hundred

840
00:35:56,839 --> 00:35:58,079
times

841
00:35:58,079 --> 00:35:59,839
now go ahead and tell me that this is

842
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:02,800
not a coordinated campaign

843
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:06,560
let's go ahead now vinator identifies

844
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:09,760
this user with this avatar

845
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:13,119
that it's a fake one now i will explain

846
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:15,760
identify this user as the top

847
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,640
distributor

848
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:19,200
and then other distributors follow him

849
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,680
or her

850
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:25,359
let's take a look at this user

851
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:29,280
but first before making accusations so

852
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,560
lightly

853
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:33,920
let's do a fast rewind and let's try to

854
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,400
remember

855
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:38,079
how to spot those trolls i told you

856
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:40,160
back then that this information will be

857
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,359
important later

858
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:45,119
so now's the time default settings

859
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:46,960
remember this if you like a profile

860
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,960
picture or if you're using a fake or

861
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:49,760
stock one

862
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,480
or if you are using one that represents

863
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:52,960
a

864
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,079
celebrity or something else

865
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:58,560
be network will take that as a negative

866
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,960
score

867
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,800
lots of numbers in your handler for

868
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,079
instance if i had

869
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:08,400
recombilage278878

870
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,520
won't like that if you have a lot of

871
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,520
numbers that's probably means that you

872
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,480
haven't changed

873
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:17,119
your default username given by twitter

874
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:17,920
the platform

875
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,079
if your if your selected name is not

876
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:22,160
available will give you one

877
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:25,759
followed by a string of numbers

878
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,880
remember that trolls share a common

879
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:29,520
language

880
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:32,400
common themes and phrases so if you

881
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,040
tweet

882
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,359
like a troll binator will trade you like

883
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:37,520
one

884
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,119
remember that they agreed to a common

885
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:40,880
version to answer debates

886
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,400
so again treating specific things

887
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,960
will make venator create a relationship

888
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:47,839
between you

889
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:51,520
and the malicious hashtag and the strong

890
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,240
behavior

891
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,720
remember that they never come along

892
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,880
that's why binator has

893
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:00,240
a blacklist user follow check you can

894
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:03,280
blacklist different users and with it

895
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,000
we did blacklist the leader of this

896
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,560
propaganda paratus arielgarbars

897
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:11,760
so if an account is following him this

898
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,200
will take away points

899
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,240
from the from its reputation that's the

900
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,200
idea to

901
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:21,599
start generating a network to see

902
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:24,160
what are different aspects that can be

903
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,839
dangerous to this social network that

904
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:26,800
can be toxic

905
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:31,200
that can be part of a collective effort

906
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:36,400
to to spread this toxicity

907
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,680
so let's check this user

908
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,839
automatically you can see that this

909
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:43,040
avatar

910
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,920
belongs not to this person the person

911
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,520
depicted here is the vice president

912
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,640
fernandez

913
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:52,079
with a political slogan then the rescore

914
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:54,320
rises to the max highly suspicious

915
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,520
behavior but why

916
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:58,839
just because this person thinks

917
00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:00,800
different than other

918
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:05,119
people no it's not because it's because

919
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:08,160
all of this take a look

920
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,320
this person has joined it three years

921
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:14,240
ago so that's okay for pinata

922
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:17,119
it has more followers than followers

923
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:17,520
this

924
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,920
doesn't takes a lot of score from its

925
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:20,880
reputation

926
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:24,560
but if you have for example 5000

927
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:25,440
following

928
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,720
and 0 followers it will definitely

929
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:31,839
take some score risk it will absolutely

930
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:34,800
add some risk to your score

931
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,680
if you divide the quantity of tweets by

932
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,200
the quantity of years

933
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,839
this account has been active it gives us

934
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:43,760
the idea that it has little activity

935
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:46,800
this won't take away score but will

936
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:47,680
raise a batch

937
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:50,560
at the end to notify this this is a

938
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,079
non-verified user this

939
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:54,839
doesn't affect the final score has no

940
00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:56,400
activity has

941
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,240
it has been involved in dangerous

942
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,560
activity why

943
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,560
because it has malicious hashtags and it

944
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,640
has tweeted them

945
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,800
more than the normal you can have

946
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:07,680
twitter

947
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:11,040
once using a hashtag market as malicious

948
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:14,560
twice or even three or four times

949
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:17,520
but going beyond that number would

950
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,920
trigger veneto to start counting

951
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:23,119
malicious attempts and adding different

952
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:27,040
um and sorry i'm taking

953
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,040
different numbers of reputation from

954
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,240
yourself

955
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,880
also this user follows our blacklisted

956
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,720
user

957
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:37,440
so obviously all of these are is really

958
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,240
respectful

959
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:41,759
and doesn't seem normal at all

960
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:45,440
now let's take a look at another profile

961
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,200
the number two

962
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:51,040
so this will be the the last one was the

963
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:54,960
top top distributor this will be the

964
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,880
second one

965
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,599
it has obviously a fake profile this is

966
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:00,960
diego maradona the

967
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:04,839
soccer player the risk score is fairly

968
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:06,400
high

969
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,720
and it's treated as malicious because

970
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:09,599
this

971
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:13,680
user has an outstanding activity if you

972
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,520
take a look

973
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,240
it was it is an all account four years

974
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:18,640
old

975
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,560
it has little difference between

976
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,839
following and followers

977
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:25,119
but the account if you divide this

978
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:25,760
number

979
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:29,200
seventy thousand tweets on four years

980
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,520
i can guarantee this give you a lot of

981
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:34,720
tweets more than the normal

982
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,960
more than the average joe will do it on

983
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:39,359
a normal day

984
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:41,760
so we have outstanding activity and this

985
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,839
outstanding activity

986
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:47,119
it's it's tired

987
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:49,520
to tweeting malicious hashtags so this

988
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:52,160
is obviously a malicious effort

989
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,319
again we can easily see that this is not

990
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:56,240
a real account

991
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:59,680
now a third one as you can see this lady

992
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:02,960
here is our vice president once again

993
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,560
i think this is from a couple of years

994
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:07,440
ago so the risk score again

995
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:12,160
is highly suspicious but why

996
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,319
look at this this is an account that was

997
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:16,000
recently created less than a year

998
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,200
ago or not a couple yeah

999
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:22,399
i think it's uh yeah

1000
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:27,680
so it was recently created

1001
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:30,560
it has just a few more following than

1002
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,640
followers so this is not making up this

1003
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,240
score

1004
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:38,240
but once again it's using

1005
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,760
this account for tweeting in an

1006
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,160
outstanding way it has an outstanding

1007
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,680
activity

1008
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:46,079
in less than a year this person treated

1009
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:47,200
14

1010
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:50,480
000 times that's a lot

1011
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:54,079
i also reduced different

1012
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:57,599
hashtags that were writes adobe

1013
00:42:57,599 --> 00:42:58,800
suspicious

1014
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,440
in this case he treated only once our

1015
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,520
blacklisted hashtag

1016
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,920
but it also has a suspectful handler

1017
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,440
this means that it has a couple of

1018
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:09,200
numbers

1019
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:12,400
and it was recently created so the score

1020
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:15,680
tries it and actually vienna was right

1021
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,599
this is not or not this is not a real

1022
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:21,040
account this is not a real profile

1023
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:24,400
going to the next one the fourth one it

1024
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,400
says in spanish

1025
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,720
something like always by your side and

1026
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:31,359
again this is vice president fernandez

1027
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:33,680
so risk scores fairly high again it

1028
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:34,880
should be around the

1029
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:40,079
in the order of the 6070 i think

1030
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:43,920
sorry so uh this account is 11 years old

1031
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:46,079
this definitely looks like a legit

1032
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:48,720
account but the photograph

1033
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:52,480
is not real take a look at the batch

1034
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,560
below it says default pictures

1035
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:57,839
this means that either there's no

1036
00:43:57,839 --> 00:43:58,880
background picture

1037
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:02,720
not no profile picture or a default one

1038
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:06,079
or a picture that was marked by

1039
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:07,280
ourselves as

1040
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:10,640
a stock stock picture or fake picture

1041
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:13,520
or celebrity picture so this will be

1042
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:15,280
automatically rendered as

1043
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:17,200
default picture it will receive the same

1044
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:19,839
score penalty

1045
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:22,319
this is the first case where the account

1046
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:24,240
has more followers than following

1047
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:26,640
and that looks normal to venator

1048
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,240
nevertheless the score

1049
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:31,599
won't go down tweets

1050
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:34,880
again an outstanding activity but

1051
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:38,000
only one of these uh hashtags

1052
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,880
were malicious

1053
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:44,800
so moving forward and here we have the

1054
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,880
best camouflage award

1055
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:50,000
this is the not my damn job award

1056
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,960
from this year this guy absolutely

1057
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:53,839
didn't

1058
00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:57,760
give any single f

1059
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:00,240
he only left the default profile and

1060
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:02,800
started tweeting

1061
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:05,920
like that so

1062
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:07,920
i would like you to take a last look at

1063
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:09,280
this

1064
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:12,000
at all this profile and this fabricated

1065
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,599
trend

1066
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:16,160
add all these fabricated users and now

1067
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:17,760
tell me again how much you trust

1068
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:19,920
information on social media

1069
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:23,599
especially on the politics side

1070
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:27,919
okay it's time to say goodbye sadly

1071
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:31,359
conclusions are that even if it seems

1072
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:33,359
obvious always inform yourself through

1073
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:34,160
professional

1074
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:37,040
and verified sources i know that they

1075
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,400
are not always available

1076
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:42,400
and they are not easy to get but try

1077
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:45,760
and just because a word or a phrase

1078
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:48,720
are trending it doesn't mean that it is

1079
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:49,520
for real

1080
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:51,440
or that it represents the thinking of a

1081
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:53,920
majority

1082
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:56,400
remember that every day somewhere and

1083
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:57,920
sometimes people

1084
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:00,319
pay for this groups of people and

1085
00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:02,720
machines work together to install biased

1086
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:03,200
thoughts

1087
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:07,200
and debates in society so

1088
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,520
that's why you should really choose

1089
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:11,440
verified sources

1090
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,200
because if you haven't seen before in

1091
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:16,319

1092
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:19,359

1093
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:21,680
