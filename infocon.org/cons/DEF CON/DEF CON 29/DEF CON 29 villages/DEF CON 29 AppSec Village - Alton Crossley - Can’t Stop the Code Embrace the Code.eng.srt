1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,839
what up hackers we doing some sci-fi

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:02,960
stuff today

3
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,440
thanks for having me i'm glad technology

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,359
has brought us together and for those of

5
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:10,240
you who are in person at the con i hope

6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,040
if you see me you say hi

7
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,280
if you're developing software you likely

8
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,760
have a complex dependency graph there's

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,480
simply no way to do what we do without

10
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,800
the work that has come before us

11
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,840
so how do we deal with the swell of low

12
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,160
quality insecure code that is just

13
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,560
waiting to be plucked in your project i

14
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,520
say embrace the crazy world of unchecked

15
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,079
unsecure code and help it grow

16
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,559
let's talk about why and how

17
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,000
okay

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,120
let's level set we all stand on the

19
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,000
shoulders of giants

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,120
whether or not you're developing

21
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,320
software

22
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,800
you are using software that is either

23
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,280
open source or has open source libraries

24
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,559
in it

25
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:00,239
and some businesses market themselves as

26
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:03,280
defenders against they defend you

27
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,920
against open source

28
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,479
so it's really hard though to imagine

29
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:11,680
where we'd be without the sharing of

30
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,640
code

31
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,920
and of that knowledge

32
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,439
and in fact some of your employees

33
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,040
whether you know it or not may be

34
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,600
contributing to open source on their own

35
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,720
time

36
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,600
and

37
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,640
as a business it may not seem obvious at

38
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,920
first but this is definitely a win

39
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,119
and we can talk a little bit about how

40
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:38,079
you can bolster value in this

41
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:40,400
relationship that some of your employees

42
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,600
may have with open source

43
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,360
we'll talk a little bit more later about

44
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,280
bolstering that relationship

45
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,159
and

46
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:50,079
leveraging the value there

47
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,520
but for right now we'll talk about

48
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,280
security because that's why we're all

49
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,880
here right

50
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,560
in the past infrastruct professionals

51
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,799
have had to

52
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,360
act like mad dogs to get traction with

53
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,360
securing important shared computer

54
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,840
resources in some ways this is carried

55
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,200
over into

56
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,758
modern day application security through

57
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:11,599
a dogmatic approach to software

58
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:12,879
development

59
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,959
this has left some newer security

60
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,400
professionals with a myomic myopic take

61
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,120
on software development

62
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,319
are you

63
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,720
affected by this myopic

64
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,239
attitude

65
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,879
let's test it out if i was to say

66
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:34,640
not all code needs to be secure

67
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,480
what comes to mind do you instantly

68
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,200
think ant wrong or we can't even

69
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,920
consider that to be the case or don't

70
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,120
tell developers that for heaven's sake

71
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,800
if you thought

72
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,040
something like this or

73
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,000
anything in the realm of this this talk

74
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,280
is for you

75
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,280
i would like to talk about things that

76
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,959
can be overlooked

77
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,599
we'll talk about how vendors prey on

78
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,840
this dogmatic approach

79
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,840
and

80
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,080
we'll uh see how it's to the detriment

81
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,080
of you and them

82
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,680
also you may be

83
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,440
leaving free knowledge on the table if

84
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,959
you have this attitude so

85
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,040
let's get grounded

86
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,959
let me be clear if the internet can

87
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:20,959
touch an instance of it it better be

88
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:23,440
secure i'm not trying to be bombastic or

89
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,440
create click bait

90
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,840
by saying not all code needs to be

91
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,400
secure i'm not saying that all codes

92
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,640
should be insecure that's simply not the

93
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,799
case

94
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,280
what this statement is

95
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,080
meaning is that third-party code may or

96
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,000
may not fit your application threat

97
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,680
model

98
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,920
by assuming all software should be

99
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,640
secure you shift your ownership of some

100
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,400
of your some portion of your threat

101
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,159
model to an unknown party

102
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,640
and that unknown party you will probably

103
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,040
blame later when things go wrong let's

104
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,840
be honest

105
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,159
so who am i that i'm saying all this

106
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,760
stuff why should you listen to me how do

107
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,000
i know what i'm talking about

108
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,200
well

109
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,439
you may already recognize me as being

110
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,280
unleashed

111
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,079
remember this one good times

112
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,918
i

113
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:19,759
professionally worked my way into

114
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,918
network engineering from frontline phone

115
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:25,120
support role at an isp in the late 90s i

116
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,360
moved into software engineering after i

117
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,280
found out i enjoyed working on software

118
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,080
and later i made the steps to actually

119
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,720
get better at software engineering i've

120
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,639
been a professional developer for nearly

121
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,080
20 years now

122
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,120
and i've always been a a

123
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,880
community wallflower

124
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,560
in the last couple years i have been

125
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,880
trying to go legit as some can attest

126
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,520
this is difficult

127
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,560
also

128
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,040
hire me i specialize

129
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,040
in a particular platform

130
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,600
and you can find out more on my linkedin

131
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,800
profile

132
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,680
tell me you saw this

133
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,160
over the years i have been involved in

134
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,639
various developer ecosystems

135
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,360
i've watched some ecosystems mature

136
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,720
and then fracture and some of them die

137
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,400
some i watched

138
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,120
just totally fail i was involved when

139
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,520
some large enterprises responded to the

140
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,919
epiphany that open source works

141
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,000
and then the awkward efforts that they

142
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,199
made to make it work for them

143
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,520
so i've seen

144
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,720
good decisions i've seen bad decisions

145
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,520
and

146
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,560
i've witnessed breaches

147
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,960
supply chain attacks have recently been

148
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,560
the talk of the town

149
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,880
are you tired of hearing about it

150
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,639
but it is important

151
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,320
you should probably check out some of

152
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,400
the other talks given at conferences

153
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,440
around

154
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,360
and i think there was one just earlier

155
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,000
in our very own apsec village

156
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,199
supply chain attacks might be simply a

157
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:04,639
suspect chip

158
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,520
on a circuit board or more likely a

159
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,039
compromised build server injecting

160
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:12,400
malware or it could simply be a private

161
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,479
package name on a public package

162
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,960
supply chain attacks aren't new

163
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,000
and you may remember the lifepad debacle

164
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,240
just a couple years ago or maybe some of

165
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,800
you remember some older examples

166
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,360
some vendors blame it on open source

167
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,800
but if you look closely the most

168
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,039
successful were aimed at proprietary

169
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:36,000
software and used exploits of

170
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,479
proprietary software

171
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:40,000
that is not to say that open source

172
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,479
wasn't involved or that it's not a risk

173
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,199
in some ways there are definitely risks

174
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,840
on both sides

175
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,240
do you understand though what your

176
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,639
software supply chain is

177
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:56,880
and what all is involved

178
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,479
where does your software

179
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:00,720
come come from that you use in your

180
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,639
supply chain

181
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,240
do you know all of your transitive

182
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,599
dependencies

183
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:07,599
those are dependencies of dependencies

184
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:09,440
do you have an inventory of all the

185
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,919
component components of your dev ops

186
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:14,240
tooling that's part of it too

187
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,039
because

188
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:18,319
software supply chain is a complex topic

189
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,479
and we won't fully be able to explore it

190
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:21,919
here today

191
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:23,680
simply reviewing the names of what might

192
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,680
be involved in a kubernetes cluster

193
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,360
would take a whole conference of its own

194
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,960
so

195
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,880
the point is

196
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,840
that to get a handle on software supply

197
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,400
chain in general we need to look beyond

198
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,560
the primary libraries that make up our

199
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,080
apps

200
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,599
because it involves

201
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,280
everything that is involved in getting

202
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,440
our application our code

203
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,080
to production

204
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,560
but right now though

205
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,120
i'd like to talk about some roles

206
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,639
and relationships that can give you a

207
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:03,840
grip

208
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,039
on software supply chain

209
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,440
just like not all dependencies are open

210
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,720
source

211
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,599
not all supply chain issues are security

212
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:14,879
only

213
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:17,759
the first place we should look is at

214
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,440
getting a hook into the developer

215
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,120
mindshare

216
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,840
by understanding a little bit of how

217
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:28,560
they relate to security specifically

218
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,679
whether or not a developer knows the

219
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,640
term they develop under a certain

220
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,360
assumed threat model to a developer

221
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,440
threat is a term that is broader than

222
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,279
security and extends to other

223
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:44,560
undesirable

224
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,560
input output and computational side

225
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,600
effects

226
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,360
generally what infosec refers to as

227
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,160
security is a subset of quality criteria

228
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,080
to a developer

229
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,160
unfortunately some developers see

230
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,560
application security as obnoxious or

231
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,920
paid sometimes hostile qa people

232
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,160
if this is the case enabling some

233
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,760
understanding of the developers

234
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,839
perspective of a threat model can go a

235
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,959
long way to bridging the purpose of the

236
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,360
two perspectives that is the developer

237
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,680
and security

238
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,240
because educational systems often

239
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,240
neglect security

240
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,360
a developer may have a threat model

241
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,760
that has not been

242
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,320
thoroughly acquainted with

243
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,519
some aspects of security concerns

244
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,480
early on it may be mostly influenced by

245
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,360
issues they discovered in the wild

246
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,320
so

247
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,800
how does a developer threat model

248
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,640
develop

249
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,959
that could be a key to understanding

250
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,320
the many aspects of your software supply

251
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,320
chain

252
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,200
for some developing started with

253
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,480
curiosity

254
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,880
how does this thing work

255
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,680
how can i make this thing do that thing

256
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,240
a person will call them alice finds out

257
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,320
that they can use software to make

258
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,399
things happen then

259
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,320
they figure out that they can do other

260
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,399
things by writing software to satisfy

261
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,800
their curiosity

262
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,360
then alice finds another person who is

263
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,800
experimenting

264
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,560
with the same things

265
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,399
that they were

266
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:23,839
we will call

267
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:25,279
them bob

268
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:26,320
and so

269
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,680
they shared code in hopes of

270
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,000
growing and learning from each other's

271
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,160
perspective

272
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,720
and alice might tell bob

273
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,800
don't do such and such because it lets

274
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,120
out the blue smoke monster

275
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,040
alice learn through experience

276
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:43,760
and

277
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,320
experimenting and bob returns the

278
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,519
gesture and tells alice i did this that

279
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:53,040
you said and it didn't work in my case

280
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:57,560
you need to change something different

281
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:01,839
this

282
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:03,839
learning exchange

283
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,680
may or or may not include security

284
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,880
the information being exchanged

285
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,600
is just not considered to be explicitly

286
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,839
security or quality at this stage

287
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,040
the code at this stage is not anything

288
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:25,120
you'd want to put into production

289
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,040
however

290
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,279
someone might come along and do just

291
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:30,160
that

292
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,120
we'll call him elliot

293
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,120
he sees some functionality

294
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,600
and maybe he wants to be the first to

295
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,079
put it into a product

296
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:40,880
so

297
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,680
he plucks it and puts it into

298
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,160
his software running on the internet

299
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,800
and can we guess what happens

300
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,560
he gets hacked

301
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,320
who is he going to blame when it's

302
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,399
clearly his fault for not paying

303
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,360
attention to the code that he picked up

304
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,160
like

305
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,120
chewed bubby bubble gum from a sidewalk

306
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,279
if he complains

307
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,760
and blames them publicly this bad

308
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,839
experience may discourage alice from

309
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,279
doing any more shared learning

310
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:12,480
at best

311
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,600
it's a burden

312
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,360
that they didn't ask for

313
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,000
at worst this threat model could get

314
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,040
personal

315
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,120
and turn into a deal breaker

316
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,959
sending them

317
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,040
looking for a different hobby

318
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,000
and that's

319
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,639
obviously something that we don't want

320
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:29,920
we need more

321
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,279
programmers

322
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:34,240
however elliott sees his mistake he can

323
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,440
responsibly disclose how to enhance the

324
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,079
code and then alice and bob

325
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:42,800
and anyone else joining in later

326
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,800
can see this and learn from it and

327
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,920
create better code for elliott to use

328
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,200
coincidentally

329
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,920
this doesn't need to be so formal

330
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:55,440
but i hope you can draw the lines from

331
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,079
this circumstance or simple example to

332
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:00,720
more formal circumstances

333
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,600
and

334
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,279
perhaps draw ways that you can encourage

335
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:05,200
developers

336
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,839
to increase their quality and security

337
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,680
in the things that they do share in

338
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,240
order for them to share them

339
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,800
in an elevated

340
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,359
context

341
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,200
okay

342
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,600
i know you've been dying to talk about

343
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,040
this

344
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,720
let's talk about that insecure code

345
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,560
for a minute

346
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,399
let's look at code

347
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,800
in this way it can be likened to

348
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,440
clothing in the past i've been known for

349
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,519
going to lots of concerts one of the

350
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,760
things people like to do at concerts is

351
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,160
dress up sometimes they dress up fancy

352
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,160
sometimes they just want to look nice

353
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,600
and appropriate and sometimes they

354
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,920
experiment with more wild clothing

355
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,199
sometimes they just want to get

356
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:50,560
attention

357
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,079
you have probably seen some pictures

358
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:54,079
from burning man or corcella in your

359
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:55,920
social feeds yeah we're talking about

360
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,519
those people some people use these

361
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:00,000
places as a safe place to experiment

362
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,480
and maybe develop their own style

363
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,240
they can get to know what they are

364
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,399
capable of pulling off what looks good

365
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,800
on them

366
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,639
however

367
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:13,040
if you're going to climb mount everest

368
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,360
you should not pick from the outfits

369
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,760
that they wear at coachella because they

370
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,079
do not match the thrift model of your

371
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:21,680
journey

372
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,160
if you expect a summit wearing some

373
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,320
little sparkly fanny pack around your

374
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,240
neck in a swimsuit

375
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,800
you're probably not going to have

376
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,800
success you're probably not taking it

377
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,599
seriously enough

378
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,920
in the same way

379
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,120
you would not choose code that is not

380
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,360
fit for your purpose

381
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,680
if your purpose is a production

382
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,680
application

383
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,519
you would not choose coachella

384
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,560
however

385
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,959
if you want to show the effects of

386
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:59,760
prolonged exposure in sub-zero

387
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,279
temperatures

388
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:02,240
you could

389
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,880
take that outfit and start up mount and

390
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,920
everest

391
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,519
this would be like into

392
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,920
much of what's done here at defcon

393
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,920
you see a lot of this seems like a bad

394
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:15,120
idea let's see what really happens

395
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,040
this is really the only way

396
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:17,839
that

397
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:20,000
bad quality or insecure code should be

398
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,720
permissible in teaching

399
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,639
that is to demonstrate how and why you

400
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:26,720
don't do some things

401
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,360
one of my padded irritations is when a

402
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,120
person teaching

403
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,639
coding says

404
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,720
don't do this in real life and proceeds

405
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,560
to explain a real life scenario with

406
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,839
some code that

407
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:40,480
is sub quality and insecure

408
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,639
the only time the example code should be

409
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:46,160
incorrect or insecure is to show exactly

410
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:46,959
that

411
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:50,079
insecurity or how it's not correct

412
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:52,720
example code should always be secure

413
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,040
it's just like the old

414
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,600
adage if uh the old illustration if you

415
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,920
want to be able to identify counterfeit

416
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,480
forgeries you study the real thing if

417
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,480
you study with a forgery your model will

418
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,880
be inherently flawed

419
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,519
and us technical people in this age of

420
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:12,000
machine learning understand this

421
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,480
if you want to create the hot dog not

422
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,000
hot dog app

423
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,240
you feed your model hot dogs

424
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,279
not everything else

425
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,120
there are some people who love to

426
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,560
experiment

427
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,199
they don't want to code in their day job

428
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:28,639
all they want to do is express

429
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:30,079
themselves and

430
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:32,720
learn something in a stress-free setting

431
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,639
they have no intention of taking that

432
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:36,399
next step to production

433
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:39,759
or to offer their software as a service

434
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:42,160
innovation takes many forms and comes

435
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,920
from many places

436
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,920
sometimes these experiments innovate in

437
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,800
ways that impact privacy or security

438
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,639
but this shouldn't prevent

439
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:53,279
the experiment from happening

440
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,600
how much better when this sort of thing

441
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,160
thing happens this innovation out in the

442
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,560
open where anyone can learn from it and

443
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,560
if need be they can learn how to

444
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,839
mitigate it

445
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:05,679
nearly anyone can place packages on a

446
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:07,839
public feed i should know i have a few

447
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,880
out there

448
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,959
as security professionals we need to

449
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:13,280
recognize that the fundamental purpose

450
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,799
of public feeds

451
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:17,280
is to make experimentation and creation

452
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,520
easier and faster

453
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,000
i've not found any myself but i would be

454
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
interested in hearing about mechanisms

455
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,240
built into package feeds to be able to

456
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,000
differentiate experiments from

457
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,679
production-worthy code

458
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:31,120
many

459
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,320
feeds offer version suffixes

460
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,039
and they've found some adoption but

461
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:38,960
if you're not intending on releasing

462
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,559
your code you're not going to go through

463
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,000
the trouble of putting

464
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,900
beta on it either

465
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,799
[Music]

466
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,600
right now public feeds contain a gambit

467
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,520
of quality and security

468
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,840
the uninitiated developers are likely to

469
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,080
grab any old package from their feed

470
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,919
that makes their job easier

471
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:00,000
if the feed is blocked in some misguided

472
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
attempt to control the flow of outside

473
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,840
code into the application developers

474
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,360
will turn to their favorite community

475
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,679
site blog or even twitter if they're

476
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:08,720
desperate

477
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,880
each platform and framework may have

478
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,360
multiple feeds and sources you can't

479
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,799
block them all

480
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:17,039
so how do we manage even if we come to

481
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:18,960
grips with the fact that insecure code

482
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,640
needs to exist

483
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,480
what can we do to keep our own software

484
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,960
supply chain up to our standards of

485
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,600
quality and security

486
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,360
so let's review some of the things that

487
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,799
everyone is doing

488
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:34,559
or should be doing

489
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,000
the fundamentals

490
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,480
update often automate scans run them

491
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,200
often code review pen test work to

492
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,440
remediate quickly

493
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,679
maybe an internal package feed is a good

494
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:47,520
way to stay on top

495
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,440
of your dependencies

496
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,520
i've seen a process implemented around

497
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,280
the process of getting new packages into

498
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,280
the internal feed the package being

499
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,520
approved by a qualified developer then

500
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,760
all builds are forced to use only the

501
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,600
approved feed and anything not approved

502
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,600
breaks the build and usually prevents

503
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,720
the merge

504
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,280
it seemed to work out pretty well

505
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,559
one place i worked at

506
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,400
someone thought that it was a great idea

507
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,919
to package name camp on the public feed

508
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:17,679
buy me a beer later and we can discuss

509
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:20,799
all the ways that that can go wrong

510
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:22,320
another place i worked for bid their

511
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,360
developers from any outside code

512
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,000
and this created an issue with learning

513
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,880
and problem solving and in just regular

514
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,280
flexibility it was really a pain to

515
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,200
block all the outside code and so you

516
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,799
know eventually it failed sometimes you

517
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:39,039
just need to look at the documentation

518
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:40,880
what about forking a project to preserve

519
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,120
its state this is no different than up

520
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,520
never upgrading a package the risk is

521
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,799
high that you'll just get stuck with

522
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:49,520
flaws and vulnerabilities don't do it

523
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,080
if you can get your static analysis

524
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,840
security testing software composition

525
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:54,960
analysis

526
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,640
and everything from the same vendor some

527
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,080
people feel that having it all in one

528
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,120
package

529
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,720
is all that they need to cover all their

530
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,760
bases

531
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,559
and

532
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:03,760
we've talked about some of the ways that

533
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,760
that's not the case something that's

534
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,440
often overlooked though when you get

535
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,440
things from a vendor is and it's rarely

536
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,760
reported on is how the vendor treats

537
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,720
open source if they are doing scanning

538
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,919
and they find a flaw are they

539
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:17,919
responsibly disclosing or are they

540
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:19,679
secretly passing on a patch to their

541
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:22,320
customers and never giving back to that

542
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,400
project this by the way may be in

543
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,559
violation of some open source licenses i

544
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,480
don't know i'm not a lawyer but it's

545
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,960
just kind of a jerk thing to do

546
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,039
when a library gets a flaw are you more

547
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:34,559
likely to abandon it instead of

548
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:37,600
responsibly disclosing the flaw

549
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,039
we might be able to work with

550
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,480
communities and

551
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,120
develop a rapport and fast turnaround in

552
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,919
order to satisfy some of those needs

553
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:48,000
according to github's 2020 state of the

554
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,640
octoverse vulnerabilities often go more

555
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,360
than four years before they're disclosed

556
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,440
so maybe if we disclose them more often

557
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,600
ourselves we'd be doing the responsible

558
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,200
thing and we could

559
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,840
improve that

560
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:04,240
statistic not every issue needs or gets

561
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,480
a cve sometimes the only place you can

562
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,120
know of a security issue is in the issue

563
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,159
check tracker on the project itself

564
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:14,159
with open source you can watch these

565
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:16,000
although it might become quite a chore

566
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,159
to keep up on all those packages how

567
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:19,919
many packages do you have in your feed

568
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:21,520
again

569
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,400
so

570
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,840
do you ever feel like the kaiju just

571
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,919
know your name and are coming for you

572
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:28,000
sometimes trusting just seems way more

573
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,320
simple so maybe how can we do some of

574
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,559
that

575
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,960
phil hacked a former github employee

576
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,120
outlined four questions to ask to

577
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,840
establish authorship in a post entitled

578
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:45,200
trust and nuget back in 2013

579
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,600
it asked

580
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,039
who is the author

581
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:51,440
is the author trust trustworthy

582
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,760
do i trust that

583
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,600
this software really was written by the

584
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,640
author

585
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,640
is the author's means of distributing

586
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,000
software tamper resistant and verifiable

587
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,600
phil has written several times about

588
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,080
package management security i suggest

589
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,919
you take a look at his blog even

590
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:10,880
outlines some suggested steps to change

591
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,960
maintainers

592
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,080
such as consider a change of ownership a

593
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,400
simver breaking change on popular

594
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,200
packages upper offer reputation

595
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,440
information about the new owner

596
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,440
work with open source foundations to

597
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,360
find and vet maintainers

598
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,200
don't leave the burden on the maintainer

599
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,200
or they might just delete it and walk

600
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,320
away

601
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,000
you may think that just paying for a

602
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,240
package allows you high

603
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,760
level of trust

604
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,000
the expectation really is the difference

605
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,559
with a proprietary feed because of this

606
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:44,720
i would still start with the same level

607
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,919
invest of investigative trust as a

608
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:49,840
public feed it would be good to

609
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,360
determine

610
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,440
what would prompt you to revisit this

611
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,640
and plan to repeat it down the road

612
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,480
something that has been suggested by

613
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,600
vendors is rating systems for packages

614
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,919
however one very important thing is left

615
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:06,640
out by those suggesting such a system

616
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,520
no one asked to be rated not every piece

617
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,679
of code is created for altruistic

618
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:13,679
motives or even to be consumed on

619
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:15,360
enterprise products

620
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,039
i'm not sure if you noticed but people

621
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:19,120
really don't like to be labeled

622
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,360
so here are some guidelines if you want

623
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,799
to start a rating system

624
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:31,440
a rating system must be opt-in

625
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,280
if you start slapping labels on

626
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,440
unsuspecting code you are telling them

627
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,679
that they have no choice but to maintain

628
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:39,280
your standards

629
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,440
ratings must be simple i shouldn't have

630
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,679
to do math or look it up on a matrix to

631
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:45,120
make sense out of it

632
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,120
be specific about flaws flaws and

633
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,200
vulnerabilities and link off to owasp

634
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,720
and mitre descriptions

635
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,720
each site flaws shouldn't

636
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,360
cited flaw should be given a specific

637
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,480
platform standard well-documented

638
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,080
mitigation

639
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,840
also mediation should allow for

640
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,559
explanation and manual approval and the

641
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:06,480
reason behind that is just because you

642
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,840
think it's wrong doesn't mean it wasn't

643
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,159
done on purpose and false positives

644
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:11,279
happen

645
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:14,000
the positive side of open source is that

646
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,960
the source can be examined but how often

647
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,559
is this really done

648
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:20,320
if projects were given the opportunity

649
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,120
to

650
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,919
opt in it would also give us a place to

651
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:26,320
start doing secure code reviews

652
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,240
and testing them for quality and

653
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,150
security

654
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:34,259
[Music]

655
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,960
at the end of the day there are really

656
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,960
only two groups of code

657
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,520
if the maintainer is able to put the

658
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,080
effort in and the project is able to be

659
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,600
publicly approved

660
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,159
proved to be adequately verified we

661
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:49,600
could indicate that it is being

662
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,159
maintained as an adequately verified

663
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:54,480
product avp also by the way my favorite

664
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,000
comic book franchise

665
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,799
this way is it's made explicitly

666
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:01,279
separate from the coachella without any

667
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:03,360
action required on the part of the

668
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,880
experimenters

669
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,960
offering a community a way of

670
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,320
differentiating their product may

671
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,799
enhance the motivation to provide higher

672
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:13,200
quality and security developers may want

673
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,320
to go the extra mile to be recognized

674
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:19,039
feed providers can enable

675
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:20,559
trust building by passing this

676
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:22,880
information on in a simple way

677
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,520
so that perhaps an offering perhaps

678
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,080
offering an avp specific feed even

679
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,919
companies can get involved by offering

680
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:32,159
resources for carrying this out they can

681
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:33,919
offer compute resources as well as

682
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:36,799
reviewers perhaps earmarking time of

683
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:38,480
their developers to devote to the

684
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,480
community

685
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,720
do your appsec personnel

686
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,960
get trained to do secure code reviews

687
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,120
there's no doubt this is a good skill

688
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,480
for them to have

689
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,440
however

690
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,760
i've heard from several that do it that

691
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,520
reviewing all of the code a couple of

692
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,080
times every a year just doesn't really

693
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,279
scale

694
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:03,919
and then if you think about

695
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:05,919
a situation

696
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:08,240
that's like if you

697
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,880
were in some place that you didn't know

698
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,039
the laws and you're being stalked by law

699
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:14,720
enforcement that kept arresting you

700
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,880
without explaining why

701
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,200
the simple solution to reduce your

702
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,120
violations would be to tell you what the

703
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,480
laws were

704
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,760
in the same way

705
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,360
giving developers the chance to have the

706
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:28,320
knowledge that they need makes sense

707
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,400
you can make policies and standards easy

708
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,880
to access even better make them easy to

709
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,440
quote in merge request comments

710
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,679
contrary to many invosex stereotypes

711
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,919
developers like to learn

712
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:41,679
make sure they know where they can find

713
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:44,240
best practices offer to help with

714
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,159
clearing the way to implementing

715
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:48,320
processes to enhance quality and

716
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,799
security and let them own it

717
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:52,480
during one plane trip i sat beside

718
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,039
someone that was criticizing the pilot

719
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:57,039
tell me if i'm wrong but they if they

720
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:59,039
want to have safe pilots they train the

721
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:01,360
pilot not the passengers

722
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,440
so while it seems harsh if you're not a

723
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,520
developer you're not writing code you

724
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,080
are a passenger the highest impact on

725
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,000
quality from training is going to be the

726
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,400
obvious choice of the developers

727
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,480
when they are trained offer to help them

728
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,880
to put the procedures in place to make

729
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,080
them successful with their new knowledge

730
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,840
have you thought about identifying key

731
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,000
people in the open source community

732
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,880
perhaps that you could

733
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,760
identify for sponsorship

734
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,279
you might be amazed by the result

735
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:34,960
when developers learn they often get

736
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,120
excited they might return to the group

737
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,279
start using what they

738
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:41,600
learned and share it with others

739
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,000
but just be careful not to douse their

740
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,360
fire with your grilling

741
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,520
it has never been a better time for a

742
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,440
company to get involved in their open

743
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,120
source communities

744
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,559
it would be great to see communities

745
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:56,240
shift their attitudes about open source

746
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,399
to large-scale commun communal

747
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:00,000
ownerships

748
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,600
managing proprietary third-party

749
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,600
dependencies is different than open

750
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,559
source

751
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:06,480
it is obvious we need to scrutinize our

752
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,960
code dependencies whether proprietary or

753
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,559
open source

754
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:12,880
the key takeaway is to train our pilots

755
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:16,760
how to stay away from coachella

756
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:19,279
managing our software supply chain is

757
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:22,720
just as much about inventory as it is in

758
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,039
participating in its open source

759
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:26,399
communities

760
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:28,320
take the time to understand where your

761
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,240
developers came from and where they're

762
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,559
coming from and enable their ownership

763
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:34,880
of quality and security

764
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,840
and

765
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,159
embrace the crazy because you can't stop

766
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:42,279
the code thank you

767
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,320
you
