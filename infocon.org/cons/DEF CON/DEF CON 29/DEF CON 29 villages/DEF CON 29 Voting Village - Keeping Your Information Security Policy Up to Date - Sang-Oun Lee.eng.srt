1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,639
good afternoon and good evening ladies

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:04,640
and gentlemen

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,440
uh it is my great pleasure to present

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,080
here

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,480
for the second time at defcon boating

6
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,440
village

7
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,639
i am sangwon lee an anti-security

8
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,480
specialist at the city of chicago

9
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,480
leading the cyber security policy and

10
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,400
the compliance programs

11
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,600
today i'm here to share thoughts on how

12
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,000
to update an information security policy

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
specifically from a local government

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,439
perspective

15
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,000
without further ado i would like to go

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,280
through my presentation

17
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,360
today i will start by exploring what is

18
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,440
information security policy

19
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,520
and the peculiarities that makes the

20
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,360
local government different from other

21
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,200
types of organization

22
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,760
second i will go through the aims and

23
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,239
goals

24
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:52,879
for the revision of the policy from the

25
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:54,800
local government perspective

26
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,440
third i will propose the methodology of

27
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,559
the revision

28
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,199
and the actual application based off of

29
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:02,160
the case study

30
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,280
of city of chicago

31
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,520
so what is information security policy

32
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,159
information security policy is the

33
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:13,840
highest directive of cyber security

34
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,560
posture

35
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,880
to formalize the security and internal

36
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,479
control standards

37
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,040
to mitigate security risks to comply

38
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,080
with applicable

39
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,560
external controls and regulations to

40
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,119
define

41
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:27,759
how computing and communication assets

42
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:28,400
systems

43
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,240
and resources should be accessed

44
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,479
configured used and protected

45
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,000
and to monitor activities of

46
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,159
organizations personnel should execute

47
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:36,960
to maintain

48
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,880
the security of the organization's

49
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,640
operating environment

50
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,360
in short to set up a baseline to

51
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,399
maintain

52
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,000
soundness of cybersecurity and provide

53
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
guidance to the relevant stakeholders

54
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,920
including the itscs

55
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,399
and to direct the cyber security

56
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:55,439
programs such as

57
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,520
risk management incident response and

58
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,158
compliance

59
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,079
so what to consider as a

60
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,560
local government the local government is

61
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,479
a multifunctional service provider to

62
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,080
its constituents

63
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,400
with its wide spectrum of functions the

64
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,920
local government engages

65
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,160
residents with various administrative

66
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,040
measures

67
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,280
in other words the audience of provided

68
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,319
services

69
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,800
are the local constituents at the same

70
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,440
time

71
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,040
the local government is technology

72
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,959
laggards the city

73
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,080
is very slow in accepting new technology

74
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,120
i might have to tell my boss to get a

75
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,560
new laptop but

76
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,280
he's even using like a five-year-old

77
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,560
laptop still

78
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,599
so at the same time we have very limited

79
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:42,160
financial

80
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,480
human resources specifically in cyber

81
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,760
security

82
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,599
now we city we're having more than

83
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:52,959
35 000 people employeed

84
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,959
however we our security team is

85
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:58,800
relatively very small compared to our

86
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,120
size at the organization

87
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,360
and i believe this is not only the case

88
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,720
of chicago

89
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,120
because chicago is the one of the

90
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,080
largest city

91
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,280
in the united states and

92
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,879
third is about our static

93
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,800
decision-making process in case of

94
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,640
public grade documents

95
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,400
we need to go through the mayoral

96
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,120
approval and this is not only the case

97
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,640
of chicago

98
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,480
at the same time if something is

99
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,400
approved and implemented

100
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,200
our deliverables are public facing and

101
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,680
open to public

102
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,799
so multi-function means multiple

103
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,319
compliance requirements

104
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:39,040
larger impact by a cyber incident and

105
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:39,840
also

106
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,280
public influence of our documents

107
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,560
and as i just mentioned

108
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,720
we have very slow approvals on new

109
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,480
changes and developments

110
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,120
regardless of how the cyber security

111
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,959
landscape is changing rapidly

112
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,360
so this is the reason why importance of

113
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,000
the policy is even further emphasized in

114
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,760
the local government so

115
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,560
in order to make our government even

116
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,360
more sound

117
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,159
in our cybersecurity postures i would

118
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:13,439
like to deliver

119
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:17,438
the aims for the isp revision

120
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,320
so these are the aims for this revision

121
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,680
first

122
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,199
considering the nature of the cyber

123
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,199
security policy or information security

124
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,160
policy

125
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,199
it is a general document but also also

126
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:30,400
it requires to be

127
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,120
in detail so to cover the wide spectrum

128
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,120
of audience and topics

129
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,759
the general employees would consider as

130
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,040
a general document that

131
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,520
should be followed by every single

132
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,840
business that they conduct in every day

133
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,240
at the same time for the itscs they're

134
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,080
being the direct stakeholders

135
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,960
who should be taking into a

136
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,000
consideration

137
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,680
in detail so in order to satisfy those

138
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,080
two

139
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,680
the policy should be a dynamic document

140
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,000
and living document

141
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,440
second we are

142
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,720
approaching the policy that should be

143
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,800
communicating with the constituents all

144
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,000
the time

145
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,360
so so to actively engage both within the

146
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,320
organization and

147
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,120
to external public the document should

148
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:19,520
be

149
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,680
a consumable document not a stressful

150
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,960
document to

151
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:27,360
go through like 50 or 60 or 100 pages

152
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,280
but it should be more consumable and

153
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,840
more simplified

154
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,360
providing the highest policy statement

155
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,600
from the city or from the organization

156
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,800
third it should be a document that

157
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,880
mentioning about our compliance

158
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,919
so we have federal local regulations and

159
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:49,520
industry standards that we should be

160
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,680
adhered and should be compliant with

161
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,720
and these are the main three

162
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,960
aims of the revision for the policy

163
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,479
so from now on i will directly go

164
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:05,360
through the methodology

165
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,600
to make a dynamic document first i

166
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,000
i propose to address the gaps and assure

167
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,759
the flexibility

168
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,960
to do so we first identify the gaps

169
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,440
second we analyze the current version

170
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,000
whether

171
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,919
it's good or bad or whether it's

172
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,080
sufficient or insufficient

173
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,880
third we develop a new policy if needed

174
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,280
so

175
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,560
to give an example by the increased

176
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,160
usage of social media for

177
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,800
civic engagement by the government local

178
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,919
governments

179
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:38,720
the revised version of the social media

180
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,360
usage

181
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,039
is required for

182
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,840
our policy to maintain our cyber

183
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,840
security

184
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,319
however well the current version in case

185
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:51,120
of the city

186
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,199
is a six or almost six year old document

187
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,639
and that makes our prior version very

188
00:06:58,639 --> 00:06:59,199
weak

189
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,240
in providing sufficient controls

190
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,000
over the social media usage

191
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,160
so that was one example second is about

192
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,160
making a consumable document that i just

193
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,599
mentioned so

194
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,800
in order to do so i v

195
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,039
city is approaching to separate the

196
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,440
policy and the process

197
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,919
for specifically we are planning to

198
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,720
identify which statement is a policy

199
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,280
statement

200
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,479
and which statement is up which

201
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:33,120
statement

202
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,599
is a ticker control and by doing so

203
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:39,759
we can develop a separate process

204
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,039
documents which

205
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:43,280
are mainly referenced by the relevant

206
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,240
stakeholders such as itscs

207
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,280
for each policy topic so this has a

208
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,560
benefit of first

209
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,879
we provide a faster way to reference the

210
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,039
policy and how to implement the

211
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:59,120
sufficient controls that are required by

212
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,160
the policy

213
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,199
second by reducing the actual contents

214
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,039
of the policy itself

215
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:08,240
we are expecting that the

216
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,639
policy can be more consumable document

217
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,280
regardless of what role that you're in

218
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,759
within the local government third is

219
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:17,280
about alignment

220
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:21,759
so we are here to build our new policy

221
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,759
and revise our new policy

222
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:27,120
and we first map the existing policy

223
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,720
with the key controls from both

224
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,039
top down and bottom up level and i will

225
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:32,719
explain this further

226
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:35,839
very soon and second we

227
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,839
analyze the composition and structure

228
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:39,360
and determine which

229
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,958
which part of controls are

230
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,640
underrepresented and which part of

231
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,800
controls are over represented

232
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,920
and by doing so we can determine

233
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,839
and identify the required uh policies to

234
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,399
need for the improvement and by doing so

235
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:55,600
not only by

236
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,519
not only just improving the policy but

237
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,399
also we intend to be compliant with

238
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,000
any compliance requirements that we are

239
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,240
adhering to

240
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,360
so i believe this is not a sufficient

241
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,240
information or sufficient explanation to

242
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,000
understand what the aims of the

243
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,279
methodology is

244
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:20,839
so we will present about the direct

245
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:23,600
application and from the case of city of

246
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,320
chicago

247
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,560
our information security and technology

248
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,760
policy

249
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,040
is okay if you can check here it is

250
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,320
its release date is 2016. so it's five

251
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,160
years old and this

252
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,800
last revision was a minor revision just

253
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,720
changing some departmental names due to

254
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,640
the changes of organizational structure

255
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,839
within the city

256
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,040
so now we are undergoing a process

257
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,959
of revising our own policy to maintain

258
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:53,360
the goals and aims that i just mentioned

259
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,519
before

260
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:58,720
so the current policy as is

261
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,640
is first it's outdated as i just

262
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,120
mentioned the major revision was done in

263
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,480
2016.

264
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,720
it's somewhat under focused or

265
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,600
overreaching

266
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,279
regardless of considering the city's

267
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,200
resources and third

268
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,279
it is mixed up with policy statements

269
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,000
and technical controls

270
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,839
and second is about for the second is to

271
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:21,839
uh go through more about the policy and

272
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,240
control the policy statements are

273
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,440
technical controls

274
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,800
and policy statements and technical

275
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,120
controls are mixed up leaving variety of

276
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:29,760
readers

277
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,279
difficult to digest so for those people

278
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,040
who understand the technology

279
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,279
and people who are directly working with

280
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:38,160
the policy

281
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,519
maybe may feel very comfortable with

282
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:42,800
using that policy

283
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,920
for their daily guidelines however if

284
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,000
this document is released into public

285
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,240
and

286
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,680
it is actually released into public um

287
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,720
and the readers may found very difficult

288
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,519
to digest

289
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,839
so this is the second point of the

290
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:00,640
second uh

291
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,200
prescription of the not perseverance not

292
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,480
prescription but

293
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,399
the identification of our current

294
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,519
problem and third is about compliance

295
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,320
um the initial version of the policy or

296
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,760
the current version of the policy

297
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,320
was built built on the cyber security

298
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,079
considering the cyber security framework

299
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:19,920
and the nist 853

300
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:24,000
revision 4 which is recently revised

301
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,880
and also other industry standards that

302
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,440
we are

303
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,040
adhering to is also revised after

304
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,519
our initial announcement of the current

305
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:34,240
version

306
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,120
so in order to maintain uh in order to

307
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,839
be compliant we need to update this

308
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:42,800
policy

309
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,160
to what to consider about our current

310
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,040
organization

311
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,360
is as i just mentioned we are very

312
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,519
static and slow decision-making process

313
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:52,639
organization

314
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:55,200
and we are we have very large employees

315
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,399
of the organization

316
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,240
at the same time these employees are not

317
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,160
only like the desk workers but also

318
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,040
there

319
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,240
are people who are

320
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,639
responsible for city city

321
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:07,920
infrastructural services

322
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,399
and buildings or like parking

323
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:11,920
enforcement like that

324
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,240
and also we have a police department and

325
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,600
fire department

326
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,000
and those kind of multifunctional

327
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,959
business services

328
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:22,320
are offered by the city and

329
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,920
it's a public document and this is

330
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,480
this document seems to be very specific

331
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,480
addressing very specific issues of the

332
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,360
city's information systems and use of

333
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,000
information systems in the city business

334
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
however this is a public level document

335
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,120
which is open to public and

336
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,680
third it's about cyber threats it's

337
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,279
rapidly evolving

338
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:48,320
and we also have expanded use of social

339
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,040
media

340
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,720
by the city and by the people and also

341
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,360
we have a comprehend the comprehensive

342
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,160
thread with

343
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,440
mass empath so our audience is

344
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,800
not only the city employees not

345
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,000
not only the reason why for us to have

346
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,480
a lot of employees in the city actually

347
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,600
the city

348
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,279
the the paralysis of city

349
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:17,120
business or the in incident which

350
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,600
influences our city business would have

351
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,000
major impact over the residents

352
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,680
so this is the current stage of

353
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,199
our policy

354
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,519
and at the same time this is how the

355
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,800
policy is structured

356
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,519
especially in the city of chicago so we

357
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:38,000
have 15 chapters or 15 policies

358
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,240
regarding our information security

359
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,360
and the each policy has four different

360
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,240
levels

361
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,360
from chapter article clause and item

362
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,920
and if we sum up this number of these

363
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,800
items we have 543 items and this

364
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,920
document is over 80 pages

365
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,079
however this is also mixed up with

366
00:13:58,079 --> 00:13:59,440
policy statements and

367
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,880
controls and some of the technical

368
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,199
controls are not even valid these days

369
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:05,760
because of the technological progress

370
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,240
and as i mentioned before it's

371
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,920
overreaching regardless of

372
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,120
city's personal resources because it may

373
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,800
have some statement like

374
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,279
the policy requires or the information

375
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:19,600
security office where i'm working for

376
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,800
is requiring for the system a to

377
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,760
maintain this

378
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,720
uh stage of b however that stage of b is

379
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,959
already outdated a few years ago

380
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:31,199
that means our last major revision was

381
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:33,040
2016 so

382
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,160
we need to keep updated and for

383
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,440
considering the city's uh approval

384
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,639
structure that

385
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:44,000
is very static and requires a long time

386
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:44,560
to get

387
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:48,240
finally approved and posted to public

388
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,800
we need to provide a room for

389
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,760
flexibility

390
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,600
and that's the one of the reason why

391
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,440
we're trying to separate

392
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:00,880
the controls and the policy statements

393
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,519
so recalling the methodology from this

394
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:05,120
section i will start

395
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:09,279
with how to make a dynamic document

396
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:11,839
so we started from mapping the policy

397
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:12,560
from top

398
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,920
top down so the in the

399
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,680
left hand side of the table there are

400
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,120
two tables here

401
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,839
the left-hand side of the table is the

402
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:22,720
result of

403
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,839
mapping the istp each part for each

404
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:28,320
policies within this control boundaries

405
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:32,160
and the right side is the

406
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,440
number the list of this control families

407
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,399
and here

408
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:39,600
the chapter row means that this chap

409
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,600
this chap like the number of chapter

410
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,959
which addresses

411
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:46,800
this uh control families we

412
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,880
when we are mapping from the top down

413
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,160
level first

414
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:54,079
we did not allow any overlap so we only

415
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:57,120
assigned one control family to one

416
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,079
policy

417
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:00,880
and based on the results we could see it

418
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,759
generally

419
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:03,680
it is generally balanced with missing

420
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,440
control families and those

421
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,480
were missing was a sixth missing control

422
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,680
families of

423
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,959
a t c a i a m a

424
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:17,040
p t n r a bottom up mapping results may

425
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,040
deal with the missing control families

426
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,000
and i will present this right after but

427
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:22,560
and

428
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,759
from here we also thought about consider

429
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:27,600
considering about the rearranging the

430
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,600
policy to make the policy balanced

431
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,040
while building up on the nist 853

432
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,959
so for the city the we are currently

433
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:39,440
approaching

434
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,199
our revision to be based on

435
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:45,839
the newest revision version the revision

436
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:46,320
5

437
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,440
of the news 853

438
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,399
and we also conducted a bottom-up

439
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:53,279
analysis

440
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:56,639
so at here we did as i

441
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:59,839
mentioned before we here it's a

442
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:02,959
it has a policy chapter number article

443
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:03,440
number

444
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,000
clause number and item number so these

445
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,559
are we divided every policy into items

446
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:09,839
and we assigned

447
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,959
every uh relevant control families based

448
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,880
on our policy contents

449
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,760
we have because this it was first done

450
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,079
by

451
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:22,480
myself but because we are um

452
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,760
a human being who makes mistakes i also

453
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,839
we also gone through multiple trials for

454
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:28,960
validation

455
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,200
and within our information security

456
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,559
office

457
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,720
and there there were both

458
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,960
underrepresented and overrepresented

459
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,440
control families on the policy and at

460
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,600
the same time as i just suggested in the

461
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,559
before

462
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:45,039
the slide before there are the missing

463
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:47,760
six control families which i mentioned

464
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,840
from the top-down approach was

465
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,919
reinforced by the bottom-up analysis

466
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:53,760
but still there is a need for

467
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,039
rearrangement to

468
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:58,559
uh split apparently to

469
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:01,520
apparently and clearly identify for

470
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,679
those who are missing

471
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:07,280
and these were the results and somewhat

472
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,280
well i think it's the nature of the

473
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,440
information security policy but based on

474
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,600
what we have here

475
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,320
access control is very over represented

476
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:16,880
while

477
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,080
the ma is very underrepresented and

478
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,240
these are the points that we have

479
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,840
identified and determined to be

480
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,200
reinforced by new

481
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,039
newest revised version of the policy

482
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:31,760
and section is about how to separate the

483
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,400
policy

484
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,840
and policy statement and controls

485
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,640
so this is another worksheet that i am

486
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,000
using right now

487
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,200
and we determine every item

488
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,039
to within the two uh three categories

489
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:47,760
which is

490
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,640
controls and policy and also some of

491
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,240
them were mixed control mixed

492
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,520
statements so we assign

493
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:59,600
we've gone through every 543 items

494
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:03,440
for this process and this was also um

495
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,200
have gone through multiple trials for

496
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,360
the validation

497
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,480
and these are the some of the mixed

498
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,520
mixed statements so if you see here the

499
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,720
technical operations

500
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,559
and enterprise network architecture

501
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:18,480
should ensure that system default

502
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,600
settings are reviewed

503
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,120
with the information security office

504
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,640
before installation to identify

505
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,559
potential security vulnerabilities

506
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:27,360
which is a policy statement however the

507
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,559
contents below

508
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:31,840
is detective control and we intend to

509
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,720
collect all the technical controls by

510
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,039
each policy so by each chapter

511
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:39,360
and then we develop a separate process

512
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,640
documents that are

513
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,840
for the reference of the itscs by doing

514
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,240
so

515
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,720
we are simplifying the policy statements

516
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,840
and making it

517
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,400
as a further stronger message and at

518
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:50,960
this

519
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,960
and we are also crystallizing the

520
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,559
technical control with the process

521
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:55,600
documents

522
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,960
this process not only um

523
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,520
lifts the burden of the reader however

524
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,320
at the same time

525
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,840
it is it allows us to make more dynamic

526
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,360
updates based on uh based on our current

527
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,640
approval process

528
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,080
so the process document we only need the

529
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,280
one we only need a single or two

530
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,760
single or double signatures from the

531
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,640
ciso

532
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,679
and the cio but for the policy to be

533
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,200
revised we have to go

534
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,720
all the way up through the mayor's

535
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,640
office which requires

536
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,880
several months or several weeks in a

537
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,679
good case

538
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:33,360
that's not because they're not they're

539
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,880
not doing their work but there are so

540
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,159
many things to be

541
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:38,400
reviewed by the mirror office so that's

542
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,400
the reason why we are separating these

543
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:40,960
two

544
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,760
to make more um readable document

545
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,000
consumable document at the same time

546
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,520
more of the document as a living

547
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,720
document which can make

548
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,799
uh rapid updates

549
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:57,280
so simplifying the positive document we

550
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,440
assure the room for flexibility discard

551
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,799
the technicalities

552
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:03,280
and we are considering this as a public

553
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,480
grade document

554
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,039
and crystallizing the technical controls

555
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:07,679
we

556
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:10,320
allow more frequent updates with process

557
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,039
documents

558
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,280
simplified approval process and internal

559
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,400
grade document

560
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,440
and this policy intend to be

561
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,799
a consumable policy for everyone and

562
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:24,080
final stages alignment so

563
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,159
to introduce some of the key references

564
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:27,840
then are some regulations that we're

565
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,760
adhering to right now

566
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,720
first it's about this 853 i believe

567
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,679
everyone

568
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:37,039
not everyone but mo this is a very

569
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:39,440
phenomenal document not phenomenal but a

570
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,880
good

571
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,640
cornerstone of the cyber security so

572
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,039
mistake under 53 revision 5 is a

573
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,280
comprehensive catalog of security and

574
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,440
privacy controls for all u.s federal

575
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,559
information systems

576
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:54,159
except those are related to national

577
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:56,400
security so

578
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,080
even though the city government is a

579
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,240
municipal government not a federal level

580
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:00,799
however

581
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:03,919
we are trying our best to maintain our

582
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:06,480
security level at the federal level and

583
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,760
cadrol standard

584
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:12,159
and for the second we are also uh

585
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:15,200
related to the pci dss the

586
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,000
pci data security so payment card

587
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,080
industry data security standard

588
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,080
has the goal of managing the ongoing

589
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,480
evolution of

590
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,600
the security against the payment card

591
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,120
and the car payments

592
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:33,280
and transactions so the city has a

593
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,559
credit card payment environment which

594
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:40,559
uh makes us to maintain our compliance

595
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:41,919
with the pci

596
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:45,919
and we also and we are also considering

597
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:47,520
the newest developments and newest

598
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,159
updates

599
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:52,320
released by the pci and also we are

600
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,679
not a so sorry

601
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:58,799
and also we have we are to

602
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:00,880
adhere and to be compliant with the

603
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,240
hipaa hipaa

604
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,559
is a health insurance portability and

605
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:05,919
accountability act

606
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:08,320
is to modernize the flow of healthcare

607
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,159
information stipulate personally

608
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:11,919
identifiable information

609
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:13,440
maintained by the healthcare and

610
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,039
healthcare insurance industries should

611
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:16,720
be protected from fraud

612
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,520
theft and address limitations on

613
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,679
healthcare insurance coverage

614
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:24,640
so for the nist it is to maintain

615
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,799
resilient city network compatible with

616
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:28,000
the federal standard

617
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,280
and second for the pci is to ensure the

618
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,760
same credit card transaction environment

619
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,080
and hipaa is to ensure privacy and

620
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,159
confidentiality specifically on the

621
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:39,919
protected health information

622
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:43,600
and the days like the times of pandemic

623
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,640
we have the

624
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,880
city is also providing various services

625
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,720
regarding the kobe 19

626
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,320
and in that manner a lot of information

627
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,159
information is categorized as a

628
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:55,679
protected health information

629
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:57,120
and we should be compliant with the

630
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,480
hipaa and this is a federal regulation

631
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,600
so all these are in consideration to

632
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,400
align

633
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,799
as our for our revised version of the

634
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:08,159
policy

635
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:12,080
so i believe this was quite helpful

636
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:15,919
thank you for listening and i will

637
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:18,159

00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:20,080
and if you have any further questions
