1
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:03,760
hello and welcome to recon village my

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:04,960
name is kayla k

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,799
and i will be walking you through a

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:17,920
presentation on ocean for sex workers

5
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,279
so for starters you know 2020 was a

6
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:22,720
strange year

7
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,640
i have a lot of friends friends and

8
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,160
friends who were looking for

9
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,519
alternative ways to make money this year

10
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,079
so obviously you know bands took to

11
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:33,840
twitch to try to do socially

12
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,399
distanced concerts we had people trying

13
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:37,920
to start a podcast

14
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,160
but overwhelmingly the way that people

15
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,680
found to make money was through only

16
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:42,320
fans

17
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,840
or just for fans

18
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,360
so as the person that people know who

19
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,039
does security a lot of people came to me

20
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:51,680
and said

21
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,920
you know how can i stay safe and

22
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,480
anonymous

23
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,920
i thought that made a good idea for a

24
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,680
community project

25
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,239
so i thought about it you know what are

26
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:04,319
some of the limitations to

27
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,760
an entertainer's anonymity so obviously

28
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,040
there's some that are harder to change

29
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,240
than others

30
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,080
you have physical attributes such as

31
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,080
physique tattoos

32
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,840
birthmarks hair and eye color

33
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,400
additionally your location a big scam

34
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,680
that popped up over the year was the

35
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,960
amazon wishlist trap

36
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,600
again promotion was fairly difficult

37
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,759
because there's a huge

38
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,360
conflict between promotion and privacy

39
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,040
they're not mutually exclusive which

40
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,960
i'll discuss but they're not

41
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,840
it's not easy to achieve a balance

42
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,079
either

43
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,119
additionally uh payments there was the

44
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:44,240
venmo trap

45
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,560
so these payment platforms which are

46
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,600
also social media platforms

47
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,360
and again you know stolen images so

48
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,680
finding leaked images and recordings can

49
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,600
be very difficult

50
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,920
and of course you know there's always

51
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,880
data breaches

52
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,880
so there are lessons to be learned from

53
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,240
things like ashley madison

54
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,560
so my general answer was if you know how

55
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,400
to use open source intelligence

56
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,520
you might stand a chance

57
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,680
and i thought in order to explain this

58
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,120
it would be good to create

59
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,160
a sex workers toolkit so

60
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,440
in working with people throughout the

61
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,599
year i did a lot of work to

62
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:28,800
help people understand there's a

63
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,120
difference between

64
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,200
establishing an alias and just picking a

65
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,480
stage name

66
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,480
establishing an alias is much more than

67
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,800
just picking a stage name

68
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,920
also using best practices for privacy

69
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,160
doesn't mean that you can't promote um

70
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,560
but you do have to strike a balance

71
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,319
and you can have a lot of fun with

72
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,319
counterintelligence tactics

73
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,560
and this becomes especially apparent

74
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,920
once you learn how to cyber stalk

75
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,800
yourself

76
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,200
your alias and any counter intel that

77
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,000
you put into the world

78
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,280
so when i say that an alias is more than

79
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,599
a stage name

80
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,200
when you want to be an entertainer an

81
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,720
entertainer you should start by checking

82
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,080
your real identity

83
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,599
and the identity of your significant

84
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,200
others friends

85
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,920
and roommates i usually recommend

86
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,680
starting with thatstem.com

87
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,560
a lot of the services to do this within

88
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,319
the ocean framework

89
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,040
have turned into paid for services but i

90
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,799
wanted to make sure that

91
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:28,959
anything that i talked about within the

92
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,720
sex workers tool kit was free

93
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,000
and available to individuals at no cost

94
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
so um if you were to use that tool

95
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
you'll probably be likely to you'll

96
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,080
likely be dismayed to be honest you're

97
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,720
going to be disappointed because you're

98
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,720
likely to find your home address

99
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,280
your phone number your email address and

100
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,319
social media

101
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:53,120
not just your own but of anyone who's

102
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:53,680
been

103
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,720
physically close to you so this is

104
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,080
problematic because

105
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,480
the process of cyber stalking and

106
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,400
immediate in a world with social media

107
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,720
isn't just about you it's about everyone

108
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,599
who's

109
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:09,360
physically in your orbit or

110
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,760
online in your orbit online as well so

111
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,720
in order to break this out further when

112
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,000
you're establishing

113
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,560
an alias you want to get a dedicated

114
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,440
business phone

115
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,840
there can be no overlap in your phone

116
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,479
contacts or your search history

117
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:29,440
so when you're deciding to go into this

118
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,360
any social media is immediately going to

119
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,639
pick up on your contacts

120
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,199
and start referring people to you that's

121
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,240
very problematic

122
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,360
if you're trying to have a hidden

123
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,199
profile if you're trying to maintain

124
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:39,759
some

125
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,320
anonymity in the world or at least keep

126
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,280
some privacy

127
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,759
from certain people who would normally

128
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:46,320
be

129
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,160
on your facebook instagram twitter

130
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,560
account

131
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,040
um additionally when it comes to

132
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,360
creating a new email

133
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,680
you're going to want to create a new

134
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,199
email and a backup email

135
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,560
you're going to want to make sure that

136
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,320
those have

137
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,240
multi-factor authentication on them you

138
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,120
want to make sure that they have a

139
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,039
secure password

140
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:09,440
and if you can use a system with n-10

141
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,080
decryption

142
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,479
something like protonmail that would be

143
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,800
a big plus when it comes to delivering

144
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,520
private messages additionally

145
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,280
you want to start by creating a virtual

146
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,280
po box with your stage name

147
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,800
and you want to use that fake address

148
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,039
for all of your new accounts

149
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,520
you do not want to create any accounts

150
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,520
on only fans just for fans

151
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,720
cash app or anywhere else until you have

152
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,280
this

153
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,199
step out of the way you want to make

154
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,440
sure that your virtual po box is located

155
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,160
in a different city that you live in

156
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,600
this relates directly back to the

157
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,479
amazon wishlist scam so the amazon

158
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,080
wishlist scam

159
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,919
is that a lot of people will say that

160
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:53,440
they want to buy you gifts

161
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,400
and many genuinely do but as an

162
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,360
entertainer

163
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,120
when someone buys you a gift off of your

164
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,199
wish list they're at least given

165
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,560
your city and your state

166
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,400
where and when you combine that with

167
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,960
information from your pictures

168
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,880
and the social media and promotions that

169
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,720
you put out there you end up with a lot

170
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,400
of identifiable data that could allow

171
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,680
someone to figure out your

172
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,080
geographic location in addition uh

173
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:24,000
there was a scam out there that if you

174
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,600
allowed them to buy you something they

175
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,400
could set themselves up as a third party

176
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,560
and amazon releases your actual address

177
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,800
information to that third party

178
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,360
so scammers would put up the item that

179
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,479
you wanted

180
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,400
pretend that they were selling it

181
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,639
purchase it from themselves

182
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,120
and then they would be given your

183
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,319
physical address

184
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:47,440
and location um

185
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,280
immediately from amazon it would be

186
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,120
released and they would know where you

187
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:51,680
live

188
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,639
this is a huge problem for anyone who's

189
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:55,599
an online

190
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:57,440
in the online entertainment industry

191
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,280
anyone who's working for only fans or

192
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,880
just for fans

193
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,240
the fine line between a parasocial

194
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:04,960
relationship

195
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,880
and an actual relationship is often

196
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,680
blurred it does not help if

197
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,120
those people who don't understand the

198
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,199
difference get your physical address

199
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,000
so i can't understate the need for this

200
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,520
if you're going to have an amazon

201
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,479
wishlist

202
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,720
you can't go back and do this step later

203
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,599
this has to be

204
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,360
one of your first steps that you

205
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,000
actually perform

206
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:30,240
additionally um when it comes to

207
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,919
your social media accounts you're going

208
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,360
to need them to promote you're going to

209
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,199
have to create an instagram

210
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:36,800
you're going to have to create a you

211
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,280
know facebook a twitter whatever

212
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,800
snapchats you know tech talk whatever

213
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,360
it is that you would like to use for

214
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,960
promotional purposes

215
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,599
this has to be absolutely separate from

216
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,000
anything that you've done previously

217
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,759
and the extent to which it needs to be

218
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,000
separate cannot be understated so

219
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,759
i'll go into some of the issues around

220
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,039
photo posting and some of the stuff that

221
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:04,400
you need to do in order to protect

222
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,280
yourself

223
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,280
when i talk about privacy but when it

224
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,800
comes to establishing an alias there

225
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,520
cannot be

226
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,520
any overlap you cannot friend any of

227
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,560
your friends

228
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,919
you cannot share um what you're doing

229
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:17,759
with anyone who's in your social circle

230
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,160
if you hope to maintain anonymity from

231
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,520
everyone

232
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:25,198
else who's in their social circle

233
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:28,160
all right

234
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,640
so moving on obviously when you're

235
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,240
establishing an alias

236
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,479
you want to use a vpn you should never

237
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,799
reveal your real ip address

238
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,958
your real ip address can be geolocated

239
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,679
using open source intelligence tools

240
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,519
this means that someone could figure out

241
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,040
your exact street

242
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,440
address or at least down to a couple of

243
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,720
blocks

244
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,839
for most services just using your actual

245
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:56,560
ip address

246
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,279
additionally um when it comes to payment

247
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:00,800
platforms a lot of people do private

248
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,519
videos

249
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:04,320
outside of only fans or just for fans

250
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,680
they get to keep more of the money that

251
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,560
way

252
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,600
this is problematic for reasons i'll

253
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,240
talk about

254
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,360
later um whether it's legal protection

255
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,240
or

256
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,760
privacy or ability to take legal action

257
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,640
however um it is one of the best ways to

258
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,279
make money

259
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,920
so when you're establishing an alias you

260
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,680
need to set up a cash app

261
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,920
if venmo is linked to your contacts and

262
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,760
social group then you should use

263
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,200
cash up and vice versa if venmo

264
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,040
is not your primary one and you're using

265
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,399
hash app then you need to switch to

266
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,399
venmo for your business account

267
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,680
you should never share the information

268
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,399
between them

269
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,760
you never want to share the social

270
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,440
networks on those two

271
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,360
platforms additionally

272
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,880
when you're creating a alias you want to

273
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,080
create a fake

274
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,680
real you this is for plausible

275
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,440
deniability purposes

276
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,600
you can go on linkedin give them a real

277
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,040
sounding job

278
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,839
you can use the same photoshop filters

279
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:05,040
that you use

280
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,079
on your content for your only fans or

281
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:09,760
just for fans

282
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,920
this gives you plausible deniability and

283
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,959
you can track

284
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:15,120
the people who are tracking that sounds

285
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,079
like a honeypot

286
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:18,000
in order to figure out what your risks

287
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,360
are

288
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,640
so it's a interesting

289
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,399
way to build up your cyber skills

290
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,240
because you know this person isn't real

291
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,440
any traffic that's driven to this fake

292
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,720
real you

293
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,959
is going to be driven by people who are

294
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:34,399
trying to cyber stalk you

295
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,480
so it'll give you a chance to cyber

296
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,040
stalk them back and prove your skill set

297
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,200
and also to see how much interest there

298
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,320
is in you

299
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,320
in this uh you know not so wholesome or

300
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,079
maybe wanted way all right

301
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:52,560
the last item on establishing an alias

302
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,920
is you got to have fun

303
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,600
you should use a mask wig eye contacts

304
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,920
use concealer to cover tattoos moles and

305
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,519
birthmarks this is all part of the

306
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,279
counter intelligence

307
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:06,320
and you can have a lot of fun with that

308
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,600
so counterintelligence will be

309
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,959
any challenges around your physical

310
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:13,120
attributes you can actually address with

311
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,160
those counterintelligence

312
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,440
tactics you can use photoshop to

313
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,880
slightly change your features

314
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,519
you can get tattoos and put them where

315
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:22,959
you don't have tattoos

316
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:25,600
you can cover up the tattoos you do have

317
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,760
you can change your hair color

318
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,000
you can change your eye color and you

319
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,440
can wear a mask

320
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,079
so there are multiple ways to layer

321
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,000
these kind of

322
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,560
counter intelligence techniques in the

323
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:43,839
real world as well as online

324
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,680
so when it comes to using best practices

325
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,720
for privacy

326
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,519
this is a multi-part issue so privacy

327
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:52,240
and promotion

328
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,360
are at odds with each other in concept

329
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,680
so conceptually there's some real

330
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,600
problems there but in practice

331
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,519
some privacy practices are essential to

332
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,120
your safety as an entertainer

333
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,200
so if you want to stay anonymous you may

334
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,720
be less successful

335
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,560
than if you weren't trying to stay

336
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,320
anonymous that's

337
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,360
at this point being quantified it's kind

338
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,279
of a known fact of the industry

339
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,680
um there are phenom of phenomenal

340
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,320
exceptions

341
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,959
but for the most part the more private

342
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:21,839
you are

343
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:23,760
the less promotion the less promoted you

344
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,680
are and therefore

345
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,000
less accessible and you may not get as

346
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,040
big of a following

347
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,440
but if you're interested in striking a

348
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,200
balance between privacy and promotion

349
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,279
there are things that you can do

350
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:36,720
so removing the permissions from your

351
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,560
social media apps on your phone

352
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,040
on your business phone and making sure

353
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,639
to never share your location

354
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,880
is extremely important so i have an

355
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,760
example here of geocreepy.com

356
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,959
you can go and view all of the

357
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:55,279
locations ever associated with someone's

358
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:57,760
social media accounts and in pulling

359
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,639
that up

360
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:01,200
obviously that gives an attacker an

361
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,000
entire

362
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,040
list of places to meet you

363
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:10,079
naturally which is could be unwanted

364
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:13,040
so obviously it's really creepy there

365
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,399
are a lot of tools like this

366
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,160
but this one's very visual i recommend

367
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,760
you go to geocreepy.com

368
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,600
and give it a try i think

369
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,839
when it comes to using practices for

370
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:24,800
privacy

371
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,800
your past social media can be compared

372
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,320
to your promotional media

373
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,639
so to put that in perspective if you've

374
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:31,760
taken a photo

375
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,600
at a location that you love for your

376
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,160
original social media

377
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,600
changing the permissions on your

378
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,120
original account is not enough to

379
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:39,920
protect you

380
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,000
so you can use facebook graph to go

381
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,440
through any picture

382
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,680
whether it's been whether your privacy

383
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,680
settings have been set or not

384
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,240
so just by using facebook's own tools

385
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,240
you're able to see

386
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,199
past items that are in their history and

387
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:57,440
using those past items they may be able

388
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,720
to

389
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,360
see that it was you putting a similar

390
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,800
post at a spot that you love

391
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,720
on your real social media accounts as

392
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,639
well as your

393
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:09,760
obviously promoted um social media

394
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,880
accounts

395
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,639
so this is problematic you should really

396
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:15,440
take into account the physical location

397
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,639
there are a lot of efforts to do

398
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:21,760
geolocation not just through

399
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,839
metadata you should always remove your

400
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:25,519
metadata but

401
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,880
even more uh you know complicated ways

402
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,240
have been used

403
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,680
so as an example you can go to

404
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,320
suncalc.net

405
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,000
or look up more look at more of the

406
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,079
tools on the osimp framework

407
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,560
if you go to suncalc.net it helps to

408
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,360
geolocate

409
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,160
someone according to the sun's

410
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,120
positioning

411
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,920
in a photo so just time of day when

412
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:48,880
posted

413
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,199
uh the way that the sun is reflected in

414
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:52,160
the post

415
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,959
may be enough to help someone figure out

416
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:55,680
where you are

417
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,199
at least to a relative degree

418
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,600
and with additional features that can

419
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,399
help them

420
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,959
stalk you which is not something that

421
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,480
you want

422
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,839
when it comes to keeping your social

423
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:10,000
networks you should also keep your

424
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,199
social events separate

425
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:14,079
so similarly if you go to a special

426
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,760
invite-only event

427
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,680
you should not be taking a picture with

428
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,519
your private cell phone and your

429
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:20,560
business cell phone

430
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:24,079
to promote uh where you are

431
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:25,760
at the same time just by putting those

432
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,360
two things up at the same time

433
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,399
that obviously uh gives positive

434
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:31,839
correlation to anybody who might be

435
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,519
using a tool like facebook graph to go

436
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:35,040
through your historical

437
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,079
pictures and try to figure out if that

438
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:40,480
version of you on facebook matches the

439
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,839
version of you

440
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:46,399
and your uh promotional materials

441
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,399
again um you know facebook's not the

442
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:50,959
only one

443
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:52,959
this can be done with instagram this can

444
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:54,160
be done with tech talk

445
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,199
or snapchat or any of the social media

446
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:58,320
platforms

447
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,480
you want to be really careful to keep

448
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,160
your social networks and social

449
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,279
events separate just even seeing someone

450
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:06,720
in the background of your picture

451
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,759
if that person actually keeps the a very

452
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:10,399
public

453
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:12,880
social media profile they'll be able to

454
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:13,440
find you

455
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,680
through stalking them to a relative

456
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,319
degree as well

457
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:20,959
additionally uh removing metadata from

458
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:22,959
photos before you store or share them

459
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:24,480
is important to ensuring that your

460
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,000
location is not discovered

461
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,959
this is a basic thing but not everyone

462
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:32,160
is aware there are

463
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,120
varying degrees of you know technical

464
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,800
skill sets there are a lot of tools for

465
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,399
removing your metadata

466
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,120
i will say the one thing that seemed to

467
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,800
be the most common mistake in sharing

468
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,000
metadata

469
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,480
was not removing the metadata before it

470
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,360
was stored

471
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,399
so if your icloud account was breached

472
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,399
then they could get all of your pictures

473
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:54,399
which included metadata

474
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:56,639
so you want to go ahead and make sure to

475
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,320
restore your meta you want to remove the

476
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,759
metadata before you

477
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,759
even store it you want to keep a copy of

478
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:04,400
the picture that has no metadata on it

479
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,480
additionally you know a lot of services

480
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,480
remove it but wherever you store it it

481
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,640
can be stolen from that location

482
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,799
um so you want to make sure that you are

483
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:16,400
scrubbing it as soon as the photo was

484
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:19,839
taken

485
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,520
all right so using best practices for

486
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,160
promotion

487
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,440
so not just talking about privacy here

488
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,000
um we have to strike a balance so

489
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,039
there's good news

490
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:35,760
in the ocean world kind of so let me

491
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,440
explain what i mean by that

492
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,200
um you might be grateful to find there's

493
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,039
so many social media management

494
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:44,480
monitoring tools so you have

495
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,880
wiki.kenburberry.com as an example we'll

496
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,360
have

497
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,960
all of these social media and management

498
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,280
monitoring tools many are paid for but

499
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,600
there's still a lot that are free

500
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,640
and you can use uh oh sent on your

501
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,440
competition

502
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,360
so you can create a private list of your

503
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,600
competitors on twitter

504
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,360
no one will know who you are following

505
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,440
so that allows you to know when they're

506
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,400
online know when they're offline

507
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,039
know when the right time to blast out a

508
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:11,840
tweet

509
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,320
knowing how to pick up their followers

510
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,840
you can get a lot of

511
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,120
intelligence off of what your

512
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,440
competitors are doing without them even

513
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,480
knowing

514
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,960
additionally you can use facebook watch

515
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,240
to notify

516
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,480
when they're promoting or going online

517
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,240
similar for ig

518
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,840
you have the same thing for tick tock so

519
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,760
that's another way that you can use osen

520
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,160
to track your competition

521
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,440
and of course you can set up google

522
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,200
alerts to see anything that pops up

523
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,600
about a specific competitor online

524
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,520
the reason why i say this is good news

525
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,760
is you can do it to your competition

526
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,840
but they could also do it to you and of

527
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,000
course an attacker can use this

528
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,400
but this is the level to which even if

529
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,640
you're using good privacy practices

530
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,400
you are still going to have this amount

531
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,720
of information out there

532
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,840
so use it to your advantage um and

533
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:02,480
hopefully

534
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,679
it'll help you with promoting your

535
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:06,000
account

536
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,160
and when it comes to using best

537
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,320
practices for safety

538
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,080
you want to use the platform security if

539
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,240
you're on only fans or just for fans

540
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,280
there are security options there never

541
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,960
start streaming without at least taking

542
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,000
a peek at those security options

543
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,200
probably the most important thing you

544
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,480
can do is use multi-factor

545
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,080
authentication on your email

546
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,559
and all of your accounts you want to

547
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:29,360
make sure that

548
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,360
you never click on links or open files

549
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,799
that were sent to you whether it's in

550
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:34,880
chat or email

551
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,039
you should never open those files

552
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:38,640
there's no need

553
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,799
um and avoid clicking on any links just

554
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:42,559
because they can

555
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,559
um compromise the machine that you're on

556
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:45,840
whether that's your

557
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,559
cell phone or a laptop so you want to be

558
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:49,440
very careful

559
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,640
when you're doing that additionally

560
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,679
platforms like

561
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:55,679
only fans are just for fans tie your

562
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:57,840
real identity to your alias

563
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,440
and there's nothing you can do other

564
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,280
than contact them and ask that they

565
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,280
increase their security efforts

566
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,679
so unfortunately this is the part where

567
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:06,320
i said

568
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,400
if you know ocent then maybe you stand a

569
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,640
chance even if you were to do everything

570
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,200
right

571
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,559
and be very good at what you're doing

572
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:17,200
um you're still at the mercy of your

573
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,320
payment platform

574
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,200
and you're at the mercy of these

575
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,200
platforms that host your content

576
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,799
to ensure that they're actually taking

577
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:26,799
steps to protect your privacy

578
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:29,679
and your safety

579
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,960
so what's next for me over the next year

580
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,280
so two interesting problems relating to

581
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,440
ocean popped up over the last year

582
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,919
um number one banning in accounts not

583
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:45,280
the same as banning a user

584
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,120
making moderation ten times as hard as

585
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,120
it should be i think there's

586
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,440
room to create an ocean tool and i've

587
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,159
been uh

588
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:54,880
working on that with another woman that

589
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,919
i invited to help me with the project

590
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:00,400
and um the second thing is that most

591
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,799
money is made off of private recordings

592
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:04,799
which lack licensing and tracking to

593
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:06,320
prevent piracy

594
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,919
if you have someone who uses fraps to

595
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:12,720
record without your consent only fans

596
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,039
and then upload it to another adult site

597
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:17,919
you can use the only fan lawyers to send

598
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:18,960
them

599
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,840
a notice that to send the platform that

600
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:22,960
they uploaded it

601
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,400
to a notice that it must be removed but

602
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,159
your only ramifications are legal

603
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:29,600
ramifications through the only fans

604
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,159
platform

605
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:33,679
you have no other way to

606
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:35,120
get these recordings off if you

607
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,440
privately provide them to someone

608
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,360
so there's definitely some work to be

609
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,880
done there the biggest challenge is

610
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,400
finding out where your image has been

611
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,520
uploaded

612
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,559
if they didn't specifically use your

613
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,480
alias or your stage name it's going to

614
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,080
be very difficult to

615
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:53,600
find and even if you do find it

616
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,840
obviously you'd have to reach out to a

617
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,840
lawyer or work with someone to get it

618
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,919
taken down

619
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:01,919
this leads to a lot of entertainers

620
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,080
using

621
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,039
watermarks on their videos and

622
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:08,559
watermarks do lead to a lot of

623
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:09,280
complaints

624
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,480
so well there are image recognition

625
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,600
tools

626
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,559
like robo10 out there they're not very

627
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:17,600
good at this point

628
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,520
um there's definitely a lot of work

629
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,799
being done in the space

630
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:24,320
and a lot more that can be done so

631
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,120
i hope to come back with some

632
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,000
interesting

633
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,280
uh tools next year

634
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,280
and in order to help me build those

635
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,600
tools i invited jalen denise

636
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,200
um she's going to be running the twitter

637
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,280
account and she's a developer

638
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,919
she's got experience in the industry and

639
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:43,840
she'll be able to

640
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,760
help me with all of the cyber security

641
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,080
questions that everyone has been sending

642
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:51,280
so you can go to the modestyproject.com

643
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,080
or you can tweet directly at her let her

644
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:54,880
know if you've

645
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,720
uncovered any other scams or have any

646
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,240
other questions

647
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,159
and we hope to speak to you soon thank

648
00:23:01,159 --> 00:23:04,159
