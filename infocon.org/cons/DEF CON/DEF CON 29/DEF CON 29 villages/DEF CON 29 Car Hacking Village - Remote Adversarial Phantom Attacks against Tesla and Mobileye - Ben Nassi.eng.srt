00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,480
hello

2
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,160
and welcome to my talk remote

3
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,760
adversarial phantom attacks

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,800
against tesla mobility

5
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,199
now i will start by introducing myself

6
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:26,560
my name is ben

7
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,640
i'm a computer scientist and a former

8
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,240
google employee

9
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,719
i'm a phd student at bengal university

10
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:33,760
of the negev

11
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,880
and a researcher at cyber at bgu my

12
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,960
research focuses our privacy

13
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,480
which includes side channel attacks

14
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,239
cover channel attacks and tempest

15
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:43,120
attacks

16
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,680
and i also focus on security of iot

17
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,480
devices

18
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,640
mainly on drones and advanced driver

19
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,320
assistance systems

20
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,079
now you can read more about my research

21
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,039
at my website

22
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,000
um this talk

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,320
is based on uh three papers that we

24
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,920
published during the last

25
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,119
two years um one of which was accepted

26
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:07,920
to acm

27
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,720
ccs 2020 the other two were accepted to

28
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,360
autosec autosec21 and you can find them

29
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,920
online now this is the agenda for today

30
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,840
we will start by discussing adversarial

31
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,200
ai attacks

32
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,880
we will then discuss about object

33
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,080
detectors and we will move on to discuss

34
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,960
about split-second phantom attacks

35
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,560
finally we'll see demonstrations of the

36
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,560
attack and we'll end with some

37
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,759
interesting conclusions

38
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,040
about the attack

39
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,240
okay so let's start to discuss about

40
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,320
adversarial ai attacks

41
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,560
and in our context adversarial ai

42
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,119
attacks

43
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:49,360
are physical objects that are perceived

44
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,479
differently

45
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:55,119
by ai than by humans and

46
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:58,000
it was already demonstrated by previous

47
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,040
studies

48
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,600
that object detector

49
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:06,079
misclassified a detected object

50
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:09,840
if attackers add physical artifact

51
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,760
to the object now for example the

52
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,680
physical object can be stickers it can

53
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,720
be gravity

54
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,680
it can be even printed blood colors and

55
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,560
all of which

56
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,440
caused object detector to misclassify

57
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,560
the road signs

58
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,040
for example the stop sign as for example

59
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,080
a speed limit

60
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,640
or to misclassify this specific speed

61
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,400
limit as another type of

62
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,040
speed limit and this was all done again

63
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,959
by adding some physical architect

64
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:37,120
either stickers gravity or even blood

65
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,599
columns

66
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,720
now the area of adversarial ai

67
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,959
is actually exists for i would say

68
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:48,959
about six seven years something like

69
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,440
this and many works have been published

70
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,959
in this area

71
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,040
and i would say that on a monthly basis

72
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,480
we continuously hear about new type of

73
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,519
adversarial ai attacks

74
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,640
that's demonstrated by uh

75
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,440
guys from academics and an immediate

76
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,640
question that arises

77
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,239
is why haven't adversarial attacks

78
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:16,720
been observed in the wild given that we

79
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,560
are continuously here about them in the

80
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,440
last few years

81
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,560
now um the several ai attacks

82
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,120
have many disadvantages and and they are

83
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,319
the reasons why

84
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:33,120
um these attacks were demonstrated in

85
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,400
the wild

86
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,959
for example one major disadvantage is

87
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:37,840
the fact that

88
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,879
these types of attacks require the

89
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:43,280
attacker to approach their toxin

90
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,760
now from an attacker's perspective this

91
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,440
is actually something that

92
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,040
he would like he or she would like to

93
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,720
avoid because they would like to stay

94
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,760
anonymous

95
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:56,159
and not approach that vaccine

96
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,319
another disadvantage is the fact that

97
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,879
some of the attacks can only be applied

98
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:04,799
by skilled attackers some of the attacks

99
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:09,200
are required to train an adversarial

100
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,200
network the adversarial neural network

101
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,239
in order to

102
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,799
create or to produce the adversarial

103
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:15,920
instance

104
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,639
and bear in mind that the set of skills

105
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:19,839
that require

106
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,240
to create or to train the adversarial

107
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,360
network to produce

108
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,919
under several instances is somehow very

109
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:27,440
different from the set of skills that

110
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,520
the average or the standard

111
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,520
hacker basically holds

112
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,600
also some of the attacks demand full

113
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,320
knowledge

114
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,040
of the attacked model in our language

115
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,400
they called the white box

116
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,600
white box attacks uh they require

117
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,680
the attackers to extract the algorithm

118
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,560
that is used by the ai in order to

119
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,360
attack it

120
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,400
and as a result they have somehow very

121
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,960
i would say tough preliminary stage in

122
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,560
order to start

123
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,320
at the beginning to start

124
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,120
the attack

125
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,560
also some of the attacks leave forensic

126
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,479
evidence at the attack scene now bear in

127
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:13,039
mind that

128
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:15,840
maybe the gravity the way the gravity

129
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,720
was painted

130
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,560
or the stickers or the way that the

131
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,600
sticker was printed uh may

132
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,800
even uh help investigators

133
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,240
find uh that tackle so they have some

134
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,479
disadvantage in terms of the forensic

135
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:33,919
evidence that is left

136
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:37,520
in the scene and also some of the

137
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,320
attacks require complicated preparation

138
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,720
bear in mind that uh training a neural

139
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,759
network

140
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,080
is what in my definition is a

141
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,919
complicated preparation because it takes

142
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:49,120
a lot of time

143
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,759
it may takes a lot of resources in order

144
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:52,960
to do so

145
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,880
and this is something that may be a

146
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,719
limitation for some of the attackers

147
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,360
okay so we understand what disadvantages

148
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,840
uh adversarial ai attacks have

149
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,400
let's try to understand how object

150
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,280
detectors

151
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,160
which are the target of the adversarial

152
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,360
ai attacks

153
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,360
work so first of all object detectors

154
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,479
are algorithms which are used to

155
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,240
identify the location

156
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,120
of instances of objects of a certain

157
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:27,520
class

158
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,840
now for example this can be pedestrians

159
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,440
these can be road signs

160
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,440
this can be even and

161
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,560
object detectors receive frames as

162
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,000
input and output a set of bounding boxes

163
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,639
with the classifications of associated

164
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:47,120
objects

165
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,440
now here you can see for example in the

166
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,479
left side

167
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:52,800
uh a pedestrian detector you can see a

168
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,400
bounding box

169
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,759
across the pedestrian in the middle you

170
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:58,479
can see

171
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:01,759
a car detector you can see how each and

172
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:02,000
every

173
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,199
car is actually uh have

174
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,800
bounding box around it and also

175
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,240
in the right side you can see roadside

176
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,400
detector which you can see how each and

177
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,880
every old sign have

178
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,759
a bounding box across it and this is

179
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,160
what

180
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,720
object detectors intended to do

181
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,880
now object detection starts with

182
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,160
a video stream basically

183
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:35,520
frames and each and every frame is being

184
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,759
received as an input to the object

185
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,039
detector

186
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:45,840
now the object detector

187
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:49,360
um now the object detector actually find

188
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,400
the boundaries

189
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,360
of objects uh basically boundaries of

190
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,639
objects are detected

191
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:57,199
and suppressed and when i mean surface

192
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:58,000
it means that

193
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,120
uh duplications uh being identical uh

194
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,520
of the same of the objects of the same

195
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,039
object that are being identified

196
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:06,080
multiple times

197
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,599
are suppressed to a single detection and

198
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,720
at the end of this stage we will have

199
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,440
this

200
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,759
nice picture basically you can see how

201
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:17,039
four pedestrians

202
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,560
are being detected by the object

203
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,039
detector however

204
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:24,160
there is also an additional component

205
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,440
which

206
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,520
i call a persistency function a

207
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,800
persistency function

208
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,759
is actually an interesting component

209
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,679
that is being added to real-time

210
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,958
object detectors and a persistency

211
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,479
function

212
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:40,799
mainly used to decrease false positive

213
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:41,919
detections

214
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,320
by verifying the existence of a detected

215
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:44,959
object

216
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,040
in a few consecutive frames which

217
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,160
corresponds to

218
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,279
an appearance pressure now a resistance

219
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:52,800
function works as follows

220
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,680
it receives an object and accepts the

221
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,560
objects

222
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,279
if the appearance duration of the object

223
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:00,320
is greater

224
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,360
than a preliminary predefined

225
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,600
appearance threshold otherwise it

226
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,480
rejects

227
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,560
the objects and consider it as a false

228
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,040
positive

229
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,680
now a persistency function have one

230
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,720
constraint

231
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,720
because you can understand that by using

232
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,560
a higher appearance threshold

233
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,200
it will result in a lower false positive

234
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,000
rate

235
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,399
and to the object detectors it means

236
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,720
that an object detector with

237
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,680
a higher attendance threshold will yield

238
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,680
a lower false positive rate which is

239
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,040
good for the overall system

240
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,160
however in terms of uh

241
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,560
real-time driving we have an additional

242
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,680
constraint

243
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,040
which requires that objects for example

244
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,519
the objects can be pedestrian

245
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,680
need to be detected as quickly as

246
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,959
possible

247
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,920
so the car can immediately react to the

248
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,279
detected object

249
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:00,399
so in on the one on in

250
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,160
on one hand you have a constraint which

251
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,079
required which you want to

252
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:06,880
um basically set a higher appearance

253
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,600
threshold

254
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,760
and on the other hand you have a

255
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,120
constraint which

256
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,200
requires you or you want where you want

257
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,320
to

258
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,279
set a lower appearance threshold and as

259
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,200
a result you have a trade-off point

260
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,519
where the appearance threshold is set by

261
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,200
the manufacturer

262
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,600
uh by taking both constraints into

263
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,000
account

264
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:29,680
now the appearance threshold must

265
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,360
decrease the false positive rate

266
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,240
basically it needs to be the sweet spot

267
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,440
that decreases

268
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,880
the false positive rate but also

269
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,920
should be short enough to detect objects

270
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,160
and in our case it should be

271
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,519
milliseconds for

272
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,839
driving cars in order to detect the

273
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:50,000
object and in order for the car to react

274
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,279
to them as quickly as possible

275
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,440
now as a result the appearance threshold

276
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,399
actually

277
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:02,079
creates very interesting uh i would say

278
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:05,360
reality where objects only objects that

279
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:05,839
appear

280
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:08,399
for a period of time greater than the

281
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:09,760
appearance threshold

282
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,079
are considered by the persistency

283
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:13,120
function

284
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,120
in objects otherwise they are completely

285
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,279
undetected to the

286
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:18,880
to the persistency function and to the

287
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,000
object detector as well

288
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,600
so here is a question which will uh

289
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,560
introduce us

290
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,560
the split second the motivation for the

291
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,320
speed second phantom attack

292
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,480
can we apply a split second phantom

293
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,000
attack

294
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,120
that appears in the detected area

295
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,240
but it is still imperceptible to the

296
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,360
human eye

297
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,839
and this is what actually takes us to

298
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:45,279
the next section which is the split

299
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,839
second phantom attacks

300
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,320
now let's try first of all to understand

301
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,000
what split second phantom attacks are

302
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
and let's discuss about the threat

303
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,240
now speed second phantom attacks are

304
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,519
basically attacks

305
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:00,480
where the attacker presents a phantom

306
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,760
object

307
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,200
to a car for a split second and

308
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,440
this object actually triggers an

309
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,160
undesired reaction from the cow

310
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,279
and this can be done by attackers

311
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:15,519
by for example hacking a digital

312
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,760
connected billboard

313
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,040
and embedding a phantom object into

314
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,480
an existing advertisement um

315
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,240
this is defcon and basically i think

316
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,680
that some of you are familiar with the

317
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,639
attacks that were

318
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:32,000
already demonstrated in defcon um

319
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,720
it was already demonstrated in defcon

320
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,279
how

321
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:38,399
uh easy this type of billboards

322
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,320
uh can be uh hacked um

323
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,399
you can find them there's an interesting

324
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:45,680
lecture uh talk

325
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,399
a few years ago that uh was demonstrated

326
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:49,120
uh

327
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,560
by uh that was demonstrated by a hacker

328
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,440
that uh

329
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,120
investigated what exactly need to be

330
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,600
done in order to uh for example

331
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,440
attack an internet connected the digital

332
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,680
billboard however there is another way

333
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,720
to apply the attack

334
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,200
this is by projecting a phantom object

335
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,560
from a drone

336
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,160
okay in both cases the phantom is uh

337
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,639
appeals only for a split second which

338
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,480
should be somewhere in the undetected

339
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:14,959
area

340
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:21,600
for the human but detected for the car

341
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,880
now let's try to understand the

342
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,880
significance of split-second phantom

343
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,240
attacks with respect

344
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,440
to uh previous adversarial attacks

345
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,839
now as opposed to the adversarial

346
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:33,680
attacks that require the attacker to

347
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,079
approach

348
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,320
the attack scene split-second phantom

349
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,920
attacks can be applied remotely either

350
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,079
by hacking a digital billboard or using

351
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:41,519
it wrong

352
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:42,959
also as opposed to the previous

353
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:44,959
adversarial attacks that rely on skilled

354
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:46,000
attackers which

355
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,240
maybe even data science with data

356
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,839
science capabilities

357
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,160
split second phantom do not require any

358
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,680
spatial expertise

359
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,680
as i will show you in a few slides

360
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,560
also as i mentioned before some of the

361
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,000
other serial attacks

362
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,880
uh are white box uh attacks which means

363
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,560
that they require the algorithm

364
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,959
in order to apply the attack the the

365
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:10,320
original algorithm that is being

366
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,120
attacked

367
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,040
uh split second phantom attacks on the

368
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,720
other hand do not rely on

369
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,480
white box approach they completely wear

370
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,040
black box

371
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,519
as opposed to the previous of the serial

372
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,760
attacks split second phantom attacks

373
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,560
do not leave any forensic evidence at

374
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,519
their taxi

375
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:31,120
at all they do not use any stickers

376
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,760
or gravity or things like this that can

377
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,160
help investigate us to find or to locate

378
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,519
the

379
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:41,519
attacker also as opposed to the previous

380
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:42,959
adversarial attacks that require

381
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,959
complicated preparation

382
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:46,480
split second phantom attacks do not

383
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,240
require any complex preparation at

384
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,760
all again i will uh discuss about it in

385
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,519
a few slides

386
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,079
and also as opposed to the previous

387
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:58,000
adversarial attack that exploits

388
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,880
the space domain split second phantom

389
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,279
attacks exploit the time domain

390
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:05,440
and this is somehow very interesting

391
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,560
property that they exploit

392
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,720
now um some of you probably wonder why

393
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,720
does a commercial advanced driving

394
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,480
assistance system

395
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,199
detect a phantom as a real object and

396
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,279
here is an experiment that we did

397
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:23,199
we took a picture of a road sign and

398
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:24,399
projected uh

399
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,680
the picture on the tree

400
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:31,000
and here is an interesting fact mobile

401
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,560
630

402
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,279
considers the projected road sign a real

403
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:36,399
speed limit

404
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,240
and this is despite the fact this is

405
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,000
completely uh

406
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,680
um as you can see project a projection

407
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,160
that

408
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,519
basically was projected on a tree

409
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,440
now some of you probably are not that

410
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,959
surprised by this result

411
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:54,320
because mobilize 640 consists only of a

412
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,600
video camera

413
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,240
so doesn't have any other type of sensor

414
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,480
which can be used to maybe identify an

415
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,360
object however here is another

416
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,000
interesting experiment that we did

417
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,120
we took the picture of mr elon musk and

418
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:13,199
projected it on a road and we placed

419
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:16,399
tesla in front of this uh as you can see

420
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:19,440
uh projection of a pedestrian

421
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,839
and here is another interesting fact

422
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:24,000
tesla model x

423
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,320
considers the projected pedestrian a

424
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,839
real pedestrian

425
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,560
despite the fact that the skull is

426
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,440
equipped

427
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,560
with radar and ultrasonic sensors now

428
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,160
bear in mind radar and ultrasonic

429
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,279
stencils

430
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:40,079
are sensors that intended to detect

431
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:41,199
death

432
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:43,680
and this is a projection completely

433
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,560
deathless

434
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,680
which is being identified by a system

435
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,199
that have the needed or the required

436
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,759
sensors in order to know this type of

437
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,360
projection

438
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,040
now some of you maybe again i'm not that

439
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,120
surprised because

440
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,399
um i would say that

441
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:05,919
pedestrians have i would say lower uh

442
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:09,119
cost radius uh section or radio

443
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,240
signature

444
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,520
than for example cars and as a result

445
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,559
a system which basically consists of

446
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:19,679
video camera a set of

447
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:24,720
ultrasonic sensors any radar may follow

448
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,439
the video camera instead of relying on

449
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:28,400
the

450
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,280
radar or ultrasonic sensor for the case

451
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,000
of pedestrian

452
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,039
detection however when it comes to

453
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:38,400
for example cars uh the case is somehow

454
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,240
very different because cars

455
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,880
have i would say very strong radio

456
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,320
signature that can

457
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,240
be used to identify them and here is

458
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,559
another experiment that we did

459
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:52,000
we actually took a picture of a car

460
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,960
as you can see here projected it again

461
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,240
on a road

462
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,600
and as you can see tesla model x

463
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,559
considered the projected car a real car

464
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:03,840
again despite the effect

465
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,880
is completely deathless and

466
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,240
the system which is tesla model x uh

467
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,440
consists of the needed sensors

468
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,640
to detect this type of object

469
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,880
uh which have uh much stronger

470
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,640
uh radio uh value cross

471
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,640
signature than for example because

472
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,320
signature of the pedestrian

473
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,160
so again despite the fact this is

474
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,919
completely deathless

475
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:35,120
and the tesla consists of the sensor

476
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,000
that can

477
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,720
for example uh be used in order to

478
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,320
cross-correlate the data that is

479
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,000
obtained by the video camera

480
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,799
with the data is obtained from the sense

481
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:45,600
from uh

482
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,000
from the radar from ultrasonic sensor

483
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,200
despite respect

484
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,559
it is still being uh considered this

485
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:56,240
uh projected car a real car and this is

486
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,240
somehow a very interesting fact

487
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,320
i think that you will agree with me that

488
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,320
there is a perceptual challenge

489
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,960
in this case there is a difference

490
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,080
between

491
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,760
what an advanced driving assistance

492
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,320
system thinks it is

493
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,400
and what is actually there and this is

494
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,840
actually demonstrated

495
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,360
in this three pictures that you can see

496
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,000
in this line

497
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,880
now um i i uh

498
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,240
do not consider phantoms as bugs

499
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,400
uh they are not the result of poor

500
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,320
security implementation that can be

501
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,440
attached with the

502
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,600
writing the most secured code now for

503
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,440
example an sql injection is something

504
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,840
that can be prevented or mitigated by

505
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,200
uh using uh i would say by programming

506
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,720
the code with security in mind how

507
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,799
this is not the case for phantoms

508
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,480
phantoms exploit the fundamental

509
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,840
inability

510
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,720
of object detectors to distinguish

511
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,919
between a real

512
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:01,039
and fake object and as a result

513
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:07,200
we consider phantoms a scientific gap

514
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,880
so why are phantoms a scientific gap

515
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,799
so uh object detectors

516
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,640
are basically the output of a long

517
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,360
training process

518
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,960
uh previous studies have already

519
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,799
discussed the implications

520
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:24,799
of using the training of a training

521
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:26,000
process to create

522
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,960
artificial intelligence they discussed

523
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:29,520
about

524
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,640
the high level of computing capabilities

525
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:32,880
that

526
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,039
are needed in order to train or to

527
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:36,320
create

528
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,880
an artificial intelligence they also

529
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,120
discuss about the energy consumption

530
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,280
the high energy consumption that the

531
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,000
training process

532
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,039
costs they already they also discussed

533
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,640
about the high cost

534
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:55,039
uh that uh required to uh train

535
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:58,720
in to train a model and artificial

536
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,240
intelligence to create it

537
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,080
finally they also discussed about the

538
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,919
long training time that it takes to

539
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:06,640
train

540
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,080
a model however it seems

541
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,720
that the training process despite all of

542
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,799
these disadvantages

543
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:18,640
are able to create robust ai models

544
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,840
that even function better than humans in

545
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,120
real life

546
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,640
now you can see this is a by the way

547
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,760
taken from about two years ago

548
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,480
where tesla tesla claimed that its

549
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,480
autopilot

550
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,240
is almost nine times

551
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,120
safer than the average driving so it

552
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,880
seems that the training process

553
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,840
despite the disadvantages create robust

554
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,360
ai models

555
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:49,200
however we try to ask a different type

556
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,320
of question

557
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,280
what object detectors don't live and as

558
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,520
you can see from the following

559
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:59,520
pictures is isn't taken into account by

560
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,960
object detectors

561
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,640
you can see how unrealistic objects

562
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,000
despite the fact that they are

563
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,919
completely unrealistic are being

564
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:08,799
identified as real objects you can also

565
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:09,679
see how

566
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:12,480
color in some cases isn't taken into

567
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,360
account

568
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,480
this entire road sign is made from gray

569
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,440
used

570
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:21,120
and uh is being identified by one of the

571
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,559
state-of-the-art

572
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:25,679
object detectors which is again

573
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:29,120
found online also as you can see

574
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,559
in our case texture uh basically either

575
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,880
whether it's a transparent or skilled

576
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,679
object

577
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:38,159
isn't taken into account and as a result

578
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:40,000
transparent and skewed objects

579
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,320
are being identified as a real object

580
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,760
despite the fact that that completely

581
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,240
phantoms

582
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,240
and we would like to mention that object

583
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,159
detectors are essentially feature

584
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:53,280
matures

585
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,039
they lack the ability of humans to

586
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:56,400
ignore fake

587
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,880
objects

588
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,840
so let's try to understand how this

589
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,679
effect can actually be exploited by

590
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:04,880
attackers

591
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,960
and the first thing that need to be

592
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,320
determined by

593
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,520
attackers is the appearance pressure now

594
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,640
in order to basically determine what is

595
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,240
the appearance threshold that is needed

596
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:16,640
to

597
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,840
project or to uh basically

598
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:23,760
um present fenton

599
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:27,440
we perform an experiment a black box

600
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,600
type of experiment where we place

601
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:33,360
um tesla with hardware 3

602
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,400
and mobilize 630 in front of

603
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,760
uh of the wall and we use a projector

604
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,799
to project on the wall

605
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:45,919
and for tesla we projected the stop sign

606
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:47,440
that you can see in the left side and

607
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,440
for mobilei we projected this

608
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,080
nice speed limit and we actually

609
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:52,960
projected

610
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,159
this type of uh phantoms for various

611
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:57,279
durations

612
00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:00,320
and we tested how the system actually

613
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,080
identified them the success rate in

614
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,840
terms of identification or

615
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,159
detection of this uh speed limit of

616
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:08,400
these several signs

617
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:12,240
now we found that mobilize 630 detects

618
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,440
a phantom that appears for i would say

619
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,400
above

620
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,679
at least 125 milliseconds

621
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:22,400
for 100 of the time it means that if you

622
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,000
project a phantom for 100

623
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,640
for 125 milliseconds it will be

624
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,600
identified by mobilize 630.

625
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,360
now the case for tesla is a bit

626
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,360
different tesla for example

627
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,480
detects a phantom for 100 of the time

628
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,840
if it appears for at least 460

629
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,600
milliseconds

630
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,840
and you can see that results in the

631
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,080
graph

632
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,799
on the right side

633
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,039
now with that in mind you can actually

634
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:53,840
uh

635
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:57,440
use a drone by mounting the projector to

636
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,320
a drone

637
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,039
and fly drone as you can see in this

638
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:02,640
video demonstration

639
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,600
and to project for example in this case

640
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,480
uh

641
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:10,559
a road sign on a structure

642
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:13,679
that is located nearby a road

643
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:16,960
and caused this specific uh uh

644
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,000
car which equipped with mobilize 630

645
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,480
to consider this road sign is railroad

646
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,039
sign

647
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:26,159
despite the fact it is completely

648
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:29,279
a phantom this is not what this is not

649
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:30,880
the speed limit that uh

650
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,200
allowed in this specific code it was by

651
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,000
the way

652
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,880
uh was taken in our university which in

653
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,600
this case

654
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,480
you can uh drive only uh up to 30

655
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,880
kilometers per hour you can see how

656
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,520
this is identified by the specific cow

657
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,960
as 90 kilometers per hour

658
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,159
okay now here is another interesting

659
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:54,559
experiment that we did

660
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:56,799
we took a picture of a pedestrian and

661
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:58,080
projected it

662
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:01,520
uh on a road and we engaged

663
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,240
uh tesla in cruise control and the

664
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,159
cruise control was set to 18 miles per

665
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:06,880
hour

666
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,200
and you can see how tesla approaches the

667
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,480
projected pedestrian

668
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:14,240
detects it and immediately reduces

669
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,240
the speed of the car from 18 miles per

670
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,400
hour to 40 mice per hour

671
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,799
as a result of the detected pedestrian

672
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:21,760
and again

673
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,840
attackers can as a result trigger an

674
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,120
undesired reaction

675
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,719
from a driving car

676
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:32,400
now however in terms of uh

677
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,240
this specific threat model whether you

678
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,159
need to use a drone in order to project

679
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:36,960
a phantom

680
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,840
on the road this is what i call a

681
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,640
semi-remote

682
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,360
type of attack uh because attackers

683
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,600
still need to be within the flying range

684
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,559
of the drone

685
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:48,320
now bear in mind that most commercial

686
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,200
drones um

687
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,360
the limit is somewhere between seven and

688
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,640
eight kilometers

689
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,600
so it means that ideally attackers need

690
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,200
to be within this range

691
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,919
in order to apply the attack against uh

692
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:03,200
a location that

693
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,400
should be uh located in this specific

694
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,520
range so you can understand this type of

695
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,559
attack

696
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:13,039
cannot be applied from a rival country

697
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:14,559
for example because

698
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:17,520
again it requires somehow the attacker

699
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,640
to be

700
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,480
i would say in the books the

701
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,320
approximation of

702
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:25,039
up to seven or eight kilometers from uh

703
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:26,320
taxi

704
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:29,679
so in order for example for attackers to

705
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:30,799
apply the attack

706
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:33,679
from a rival country they can use uh the

707
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:34,000
second

708
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,399
type of the second flat model which is

709
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:38,320
uh exploiting

710
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,039
the digital uh internet connected

711
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:41,600
billboard

712
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,520
and let's discuss about this type of

713
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,440
model now

714
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,720
so um as i mentioned before

715
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,760
this specific uh flat model is more

716
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:52,720
interesting

717
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,200
and this is because uh digital

718
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,440
billboards are located near

719
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,559
uh roads also they

720
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:03,360
are somehow easier to attack than you

721
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:03,919
might

722
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:07,039
uh think of and

723
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:09,679
also we will show you that attackers can

724
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:11,600
actually exploit them in order to apply

725
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,000
this attack over the internet from an

726
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,720
even level company and

727
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,440
in order to do so they can even do it

728
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,799
with uh

729
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:25,520
instead of projecting the specific uh

730
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:28,960
uh object the specific phantom

731
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:32,240
for uh on their uh advertisement they

732
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,240
can actually manipulate

733
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,720
an existing advertisement by embedding

734
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,240
the existing advertisement

735
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,360
phantom inside of it and in order to do

736
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,919
so they can find what i call a dead area

737
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:45,360
which won't be identified

738
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:49,679
even by a person that maybe sits inside

739
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:52,480
the driving car for example in the case

740
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,720
of a semi-autonomous

741
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,080
now here's an algorithm for embedding a

742
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,520
phantom in advertisement

743
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,720
uh basically an advertisement

744
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:06,159
uh consists of a set of frames and

745
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:08,880
in each and every frame we compute a

746
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,919
local score

747
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:13,360
for each and every block in a frame and

748
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,760
the local scope is completed as follows

749
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,720
key points

750
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,840
are extracted from the frame you can see

751
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,120
the key points

752
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,440
on the right side they are marked with

753
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,320
the

754
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:28,240
with blue and the skull for a block beam

755
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,640
uh in this frame is computed based on

756
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:33,279
how much a dead area the block is

757
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:37,120
with respect to the key points extracted

758
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:40,640
it means that uh for blocks

759
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,640
that are located uh that are more

760
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,240
distant from the

761
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,279
uh this set of

762
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,000
key points they will receive a higher

763
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,919
score because they are considered more

764
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:55,440
a dead area inside this specific

765
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,000
now however i discussed before about an

766
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,279
appearance threshold that

767
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:01,120
for example in the case of mobilize it

768
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,840
need to be 125 milliseconds

769
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,399
now this is actually may correspond to a

770
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:07,760
few consecutive frames

771
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,399
maybe even four frames so we need to

772
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:10,960
take the

773
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,440
time domain into account and in order to

774
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,080
do so

775
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,159
we compute the global scope for each

776
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:17,440
block uh

777
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,880
by computing its

778
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,919
score with respect

779
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:26,320
to the scores in the uh subsequent

780
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,600
consecutive frames

781
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,960
now it means that if you have for

782
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,320
example uh you know that the

783
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:35,760
mobilia threshold was set to 125

784
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,159
milliseconds which corresponds to

785
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:40,720
four uh subsequent frames in this

786
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,159
specific advertisement

787
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:44,080
what you need to do is to compute the

788
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,799
global scope of each and every block

789
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:49,120
uh with respect to its uh full

790
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,399
consecutive frames

791
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:54,080
and by doing so you can locate

792
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:57,039
the best uh block that can be used to

793
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:58,559
embed a phantom

794
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:02,320
inside of it now here is just an example

795
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,360
for

796
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,200
an advertisement that we took and we

797
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,440
embedded the uh a stop sign in order to

798
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,320
attack tesla

799
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,919
on it it's a mcdonald's advertisement

800
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:13,919
that we took from the internet and

801
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:17,279
just to demonstrate it we um embedded

802
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:18,720
the

803
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,640
the stop sign for 500 milliseconds in

804
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,919
order to attack a

805
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:25,679
tesla because tesla have a pressure of

806
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:29,279
460 milliseconds

807
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:33,919
okay and here is the demonstration um

808
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:35,600
in this demonstration you can see how

809
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,360
tesla's autopilot

810
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,519
automatically triggers the car to stop

811
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:40,559
when

812
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:45,200
the car is approaching to the uh

813
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,720
presented the advertisement that i

814
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,600
showed you in the

815
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,519
slide before we actually took this

816
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:53,840
advertisement and presented it

817
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,799
uh on a digital billboard and when the

818
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:57,440
car

819
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,480
approaches this specific uh digital

820
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,279
billboard it

821
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:02,880
immediately identifies the stop sign

822
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,120
which was embedded for 500 milliseconds

823
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,279
and as a result you can see it right now

824
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:09,279
on the dashboard in the left side

825
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:12,880
it triggers an immediate stop of the car

826
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,000
so a phantom that was added to an

827
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:16,559
existing

828
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:19,440
advertisement caused the tesla's

829
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,320
autopilot

830
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:23,279
to trigger an automatic stop in the

831
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:28,720
middle of the road

832
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,600
okay so we have a few conclusions that i

833
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,200
want us to discuss

834
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,480
and the first conclusion is that sensor

835
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,200
attacks

836
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,760
are a very dangerous type of attack they

837
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,519
are not easy to counter

838
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:43,679
and they exploit the gaps between a

839
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:47,200
human and machine perception

840
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,919
now the commonly used approach to

841
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:51,760
counter sensor attacks

842
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:55,519
in the case in where you have

843
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:58,159
additional sensors is to apply a

844
00:32:58,159 --> 00:32:59,200
multi-sensor

845
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,799
fusion policy or approach however in the

846
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:03,679
context

847
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:06,640
of semi or fully autonomous cars this is

848
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,760
a bad solution

849
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,799
and i want us to understand why this is

850
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:13,600
a bad solution

851
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,679
now first of all in some cases

852
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:17,600
multisensor fusion is not effective at

853
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:21,039
all now for example some objects

854
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:23,760
can only be detected by a single sensor

855
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,279
for example road signs

856
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:27,360
and lanes can only be detected by a

857
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,720
video camera

858
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,440
as a result

859
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,919
the existence of this specific phantom

860
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:38,399
cannot be dismissed by applying

861
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:41,439
multi-sensor fusion

862
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,080
in other cases some areas are covered

863
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,919
only by single sensor

864
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:51,039
for example you can see how uh this

865
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:52,320
specific area

866
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:55,440
uh of the tesla uh

867
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,640
which is uh only covered by a single

868
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,519
sensor

869
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:03,440
um won't be able to detect

870
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,679
this type of phantom which may appear in

871
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:07,200
this specific area

872
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,719
because it is only covered by one sensor

873
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:11,599
so

874
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:13,119
it cannot be dismissed by applying

875
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:16,159
multi-sensor fusion

876
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:21,359
now in some cases multisensor fusion

877
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:24,079
can be used to detect the existence of

878
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:24,800
an object

879
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,280
now this is for example the two cases

880
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,879
where multi-sensor fusion

881
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:31,199
can be used to detect a pedestrian and

882
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:33,040
can be used to detect

883
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:37,839
this projected car however

884
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:40,399
if you were a car manufacturer would you

885
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:42,719
program the car to ignore a detected

886
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:43,839
object

887
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:46,480
if the object was identified only by a

888
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,520
single sensor given that you know

889
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,719
that sensor detection accuracy may vary

890
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:55,440
at adverse or ambient uh it adverse

891
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,119
ambient or weather conditions

892
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:59,680
for example a heavy rain now in some

893
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,480
cases

894
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,400
as a result of this adverse ambient

895
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,839
weather conditions

896
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:06,560
uh some object might be undetected to

897
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,599
one sensor

898
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:10,079
will still be detected to other now with

899
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:11,200
that in mind

900
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,280
how would you program the car to resolve

901
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,400
a disagreement

902
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,200
between the radar and the video camera

903
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:20,079
regarding a detected object

904
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:24,000
now here is another interesting scenario

905
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,079
sensor detection accuracy varies for

906
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:27,200
different objects is

907
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,200
a known fact now for example it is known

908
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,359
that video cameras are more accurate

909
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:34,480
at detecting pedestrians than radars

910
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,960
now in some cases the detection of one

911
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:37,760
sensor

912
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,800
is more reliable than other sensors

913
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,520
with that in mind how would you program

914
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,160
the car

915
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,000
to resolve a disagreement between the

916
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,400
radar and the video camera

917
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:52,640
regarding the detected object so

918
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,400
these are basically questions that i ask

919
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,240
you however

920
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:59,680
the industry takes into account another

921
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:00,480
type of fact

922
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:04,320
which is the damage that may be posed by

923
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,640
uh to uh that maybe opposed to

924
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:07,599
pedestrian

925
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:10,839
drivers and nearby passengers if a real

926
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:12,160
object

927
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:15,200
is ignored due to a mistake

928
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,680
uh that was done by you know configuring

929
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,200
the the car to ignore

930
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:22,320
a specific uh um object

931
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:25,119
if it was identified only by a single

932
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:26,480
sensor

933
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,760
this type of mistake is uh i would say

934
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,040
very risky because

935
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:34,400
it's also i have a great impact uh it

936
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,880
may cause for an accident it may

937
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:40,720
cause a loss of life and as a result

938
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,839
it is better to react to a detection as

939
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:45,119
a real object

940
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:47,599
if the detection confidence confidence

941
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:49,680
crosses a predefined threshold

942
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,599
and this is probably the reason why the

943
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:54,640
tesla in this case uh

944
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:58,000
detects the pedestrian and the car

945
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,359
israel uh objects

946
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:02,560
despite the fact that they are

947
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,400
completely deathless and despite the

948
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,359
fact that

949
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:09,440
they do not have uh any validation

950
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,280
from the data that was obtained by the

951
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,920
radar or from the data that was obtained

952
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:17,359
by the ultrasonic sensor

953
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:20,480
now in practice

954
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,720
phantoms are not easy to counter with

955
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,320
multi-sensor fusion this is

956
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,839
one of the most interesting uh

957
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:27,599
conclusions that i wanted to take from

958
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:28,160
this

959
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:31,760
uh talk in addition

960
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,720
um phantoms as you can see in this

961
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:35,520
pictures

962
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,920
have already appeared in the while you

963
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,520
can see that how physical

964
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,640
uh basically objects cause

965
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:46,079
uh teslas to uh

966
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:48,000
consider them as real objects for

967
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,920
example this was taken from this week

968
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:52,800
where a moon was detected as

969
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,680
a traffic light and well an

970
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,560
advertisement

971
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:00,079
was detected as pedestrian and

972
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:02,240
in the right side you can see how a

973
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,200
bugling sign was detected as a stop sign

974
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:08,960
and again phantoms are not a new

975
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,800
concept they've already appeared in the

976
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,640
wild however

977
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,800
phantom attacks are more dangerous than

978
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,160
this type of phantoms

979
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,480
because they can be applied remotely and

980
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,320
they are not

981
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:23,520
is easy to counter

982
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:25,119
so i would like to thank you for

983
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:27,440
attending this talk um

984
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:33,839
thank you very much and this is it

985
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:49,920
you
