1
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:33,120
good day ladies and gentlemen i'm going

2
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,360
to give you a briefing on the

3
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,440
development of chinese military bio

4
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,480
weapons

5
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,480
as i mentioned my opening soliloquy this

6
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,559
will be a reflection of the chinese

7
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:45,120
communist party as well as the chinese

8
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,800
military jun dway

9
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,640
if you have any questions please ask

10
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,239
those you may not like the answer but

11
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:52,079
i'll give it to you anyway

12
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:53,840
this is being recorded and presented

13
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,160
under traffic light protocol red

14
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,000
and of course chatham house rules if you

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
have any concerns or questions about

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,160
this please stop watching if you're

17
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,680
unfamiliar with chatham house rules

18
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,240
please google that before you continue

19
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,159
so today we're going to talk about china

20
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,000
specifically the military use

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,880
consideration planning and development

22
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:13,920
of

23
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,600
bioweapons as a prescription for

24
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,720
enduring

25
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,560
conflict capacity and defeating

26
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,280
adversaries on the battlefield now as we

27
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,960
go to china you'll note that the middle

28
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,119
of this map represents their view of the

29
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:31,600
outside world everyone is subversive

30
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,680
dominant and less than equal to the

31
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,360
chinese people this is just culturally

32
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,119
the way it is if you're offended by that

33
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:39,360
you know too bad but the chinese are

34
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,200
calling themselves zhongguo which means

35
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,799
literally middle

36
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,920
kingdom jung is middle gua means the

37
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,920
king or queen's riches surrounded by the

38
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,240
four borders of their kingdom remember

39
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,240
the chinese dream and the manifestation

40
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,799
of their culture is one of dominating

41
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,719
others and unfortunately you are if

42
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,240
you're not watching this in our chinese

43
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,840
you're already perhaps curious about

44
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,600
where this is going if you're a

45
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,600
foreigner like me you are subservient to

46
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,200
the chinese domination and that's just

47
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,000
the way it is so this is a third part in

48
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,679
this series that we'll talk about how

49
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,640
unrestricted weapons of war will shape

50
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,800
future conflicts specifically bio

51
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,560
weapons as developed by the chinese

52
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,520
military now the abstract of course is

53
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,840
just to let you know that this is third

54
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,680
in a three-part series examining the

55
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,160
chinese military use of biological

56
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,560
reagents in a kinetic capacity that's a

57
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,400
mouthful isn't it

58
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,920
years one and two presented at the

59
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,599
biohacking village i

60
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,040
suggest that you go back and look at

61
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,800
those on youtube

62
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,440
year one in 2019 essentially predicted

63
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,160
what was going to happen with covid 19.

64
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,080
year two last year essentially

65
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,120
demonstrated that indeed the wuhan virus

66
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,160
or

67
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,000
virus called covid here in the western

68
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,160
world we will not say what uh some

69
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,519
failed leaders have talked about what

70
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:54,319
the

71
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:57,040
cultural attribution of this is really

72
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,959
in year two i demonstrated that it did

73
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:00,800
in fact come out of wuhan

74
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,480
go back and look at that if you'd like

75
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,800
but today we're going to talk continue

76
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,720
to discuss the unrestricted warfare

77
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,360
strategy that goes back to the early

78
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,400
1990s and really defines the military

79
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,280
strategy and initiative including things

80
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,480
such as the supply chain program 863 and

81
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,879
other supporting components that discuss

82
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,560
the chinese military bio weapons

83
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,080
strategy all those are going to be

84
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,319
revealed during this discussion remember

85
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:29,120
this is traffic light protocol red

86
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,959
here's our agenda we're going to take a

87
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,599
look at three basic elements everything

88
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,400
from no hyperbole bio weapons programs

89
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,400
uh the china's chinese communist party

90
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,360
or ccp science and technology programs

91
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,440
and then an examination of future state

92
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,319
and planning using the daim mnemonic

93
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,400
meaning diplomatic intel information and

94
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,440
economic will be the focus for this now

95
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,599
as we go into this you'll note that the

96
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:56,080
biological weapons will have very much a

97
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,319
military flavor last year it was

98
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,000
research from a military civilian

99
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,080
perspective year before that it was

100
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,799
definitely a civilian with a taste or an

101
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,680
hors d'oeuvre of military response to

102
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,280
covet

103
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,200
now we're going to of course talk about

104
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,879
nuclear biological and chemical if

105
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,640
you've served in the us military or

106
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,639
military of any other country when you

107
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,880
heard the words nbc you remember your

108
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,160
gas

109
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,079
chamber training many of us remember

110
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,160
that with such uh rapid abandon it's

111
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,759
like yesterday well we're going to talk

112
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,680
about that from a non-can perspective as

113
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,280
we progress through this now the old

114
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,639
version of china is important to

115
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,280
remember that historically they have

116
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,560
indeed had

117
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,560
foreign troops stationed on their soil

118
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,120
and the response to that occupation in

119
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,720
the 1900s

120
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,600
impacts not only the information warfare

121
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,759
component which i'm known for primarily

122
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,880
but also in this age the bio weapons

123
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,960
capability now we'll talk about why

124
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,560
that's important because the chinese

125
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,280
fear above all the fact that a foreign

126
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,919
power will occupy them again and as you

127
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:01,360
know with some of my previous

128
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,120
discussions the communist party the

129
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,479
current regime

130
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:06,400
historically knows that if the

131
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,479
population is dissatisfied with the

132
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,000
discourse that it is giving from a

133
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,840
leadership and political party

134
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,680
perspective they will rise up and

135
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,600
essentially be

136
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,680
requesting that the ccp step down

137
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,120
communist party will never allow that to

138
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,960
happen as long as they're in power now

139
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,560
when we talk about china you think of

140
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,800
the dragon you think of the red dragon

141
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,880
that's my hacker alias but more

142
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,320
importantly what i would like you to do

143
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,759
is know that china is a major superpower

144
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,800
and as such they believe of course that

145
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,479
under the communist party rule that they

146
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,479
will dominate colonize

147
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:40,320
and otherwise rule the rest of the world

148
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,080
which is their mandate of heaven if you

149
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,199
know your chinese history now some of my

150
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,360
foreign research as you know from other

151
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,919
presentations that i've given has been

152
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,720
redacted removed and cannot no longer be

153
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,000
accessed

154
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,160
in this particular presentation i have

155
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,479
started to make a decision to not

156
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:00,560
include those urls if you want those

157
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,240
urls and you're in a position that will

158
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,560
help your research i ask that you reach

159
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,720
out to me i'll be happy to provide that

160
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,639
i know that this presentation will be

161
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,120
seen by the communist party it will be

162
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,720
seen by my friends at the chinese

163
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,960
military think tank it is not meant

164
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,680
disrespectfully or any sort of

165
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,400
dishonor towards the culture history

166
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,240
of china that is not the point it is

167
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,080
really to educate from a military

168
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,000
perspective what is going on in china

169
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,199
now

170
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,039
that military revolution that you

171
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:31,199
probably heard about the revolution of

172
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,720
military affairs coined by thomas

173
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,039
uh mr thomas down at fort leavenworth

174
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:39,440
really also speaks to the some of the

175
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,479
breakthroughs of biotechnology and how

176
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,240
future war

177
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,560
will be able to use this as a combat

178
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,960
force multiplier and it's interesting

179
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,199
because in the chinese military press

180
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:52,800
they are really researching and trying

181
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,400
to understand this especially in a

182
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,720
post-covet world and i'll tell you about

183
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,319
that in terms of one of the conclusions

184
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,080
is why it's important to listen to the

185
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,039
end

186
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:03,120
now when it comes to chinese military

187
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,520
history and certainly the history from a

188
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,280
cultural perspective of the way that the

189
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,639
chinese view

190
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,479
bio weapons control it's important to

191
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:13,120
revisit the fact that they are not part

192
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,759
of the opcw and hague

193
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,280
while they adhere to it they do not

194
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,120
belong to it in the chinese military as

195
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,280
you can see in this url which has been

196
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,520
redacted i believe uh firmly believe

197
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,599
that while this is necessary for other

198
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:27,759
countries it does not apply

199
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:30,639
to the chinese military and as such they

200
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,800
will prepare vigorously in order to

201
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,800
prevent this from happening now why you

202
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,039
may say are they so aggressive well it's

203
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,319
important to understand that during

204
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,880
world war ii the chinese were

205
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,039
invaded by the japanese here is yet

206
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:44,960
another historical chapter of what the

207
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,080
chinese fear which is foreign domination

208
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,879
and perhaps uh colonization by a foreign

209
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:53,360
force thus there is no love lost between

210
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,199
the chinese and the japanese in fact if

211
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:56,560
you go to beijing

212
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,160
as i have done recently you will note

213
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,520
that there is the

214
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,360
japanese war of aggression museum

215
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,120
outside of beijing it's a

216
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,680
fantastic historical view

217
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,160
of what the japanese military did to the

218
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,720
chinese civilians and military in the

219
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,440
form of biological weapons testing some

220
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,400
very nasty stuff was essentially leveled

221
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,800
against men women and children

222
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,639
the japanese were very brutal and the

223
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,440
chinese remember this as a result they

224
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,120
have developed their own

225
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,280
weapons grade chemical weapons and toxin

226
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,000
agents and i'll give you this as a a

227
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,680
review

228
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,599
in terms of what the chinese military is

229
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,679
doing in the present day in response to

230
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:36,958
what the japanese did to them

231
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,880
historically now you may have seen this

232
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,320
during last year but i want you to

233
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,760
remember that weaponization of

234
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,519
biological agents

235
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,600
really is something that they take very

236
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,920
serious and they look at it from a

237
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,560
intelligence perspective there's no

238
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,959
secret here believe me they want the u.s

239
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:55,360
the main protagonist to know what

240
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,600
they're doing in terms of developing

241
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,360
chemical weapons because they want it to

242
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,839
be a fair and equal round when it comes

243
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:04,240
to war they will basically state from a

244
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,640
military perspective we told you so you

245
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,720
need to be prepared for this now what's

246
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,320
interesting is i will reveal here

247
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,200
shortly they do not only always test

248
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,080
these on military uh troops in order to

249
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,839
prepare for that next level of warfare

250
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:19,680
or unrestricted warfare using bio

251
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,760
weapons but they tested on civilian

252
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,680
populations within the people's republic

253
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,760
of china you may have heard of rest of

254
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,920
xinjiang province and the muslim

255
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,760
population there they are not without

256
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,959
their uh

257
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,959
mistreatment by the chinese

258
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:34,399
military and government this is not a

259
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,320
political statement it just is a fact

260
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,720
and we need to come to grips with that

261
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,959
some of those bioweapon bio weapons

262
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:42,720
development terms as you can see here

263
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,480
include a variety now i put this out

264
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,839
there for the scholars that would like

265
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:47,360
to research this

266
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,120
if you're unfamiliar with the terms in

267
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,120
chinese then certainly this gives you an

268
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,200
opportunity to grab a screenshot again

269
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,200
tlp red and research these on your own

270
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,839
now from a nuclear biological chemical

271
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:01,440
weapon perspective we go into the

272
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,360
military revolution

273
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,360
understanding that bio

274
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,440
technology is really the mainstay of a

275
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,920
future battlefield if they need to go in

276
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,160
the kinetic space and the way that they

277
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,320
are researching this is to integrate not

278
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,560
only academic institutions

279
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,680
military scientific

280
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,440
programs within china

281
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,839
to develop some military oriented

282
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:26,560
initiatives or programs which include

283
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,000
active

284
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,720
aggressive collaboration and procurement

285
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,720
of dual purpose commercial civilian

286
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,800
technologies that can be applied in a

287
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,200
civilian military purpose and you may

288
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,959
say bill yeah we've all heard about ip

289
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:41,040
theft what's new well i was on a

290
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,160
briefing yesterday with the fbi

291
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,560
and i asked them about 863 plan and they

292
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,839
said they would have to get back to me

293
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:50,000
they had never heard about it

294
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,519
well let me tell you with all due

295
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,959
respect to the fbi uh the chinese 863

296
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,399
plan should have been top of the list of

297
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,720
the the discussion from that uh that

298
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,959
agent yesterday uh really this tells

299
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:03,519
about how that dual use technology goes

300
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:07,279
back to the third month of 1986

301
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,519
in terms of the active cyber espionage

302
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:10,880
targets and you may be saying yourself

303
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,279
well bill you've given us the url it's

304
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,360
all in chinese how are we to translate

305
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,880
this well i'll tell you

306
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,720
you can easily do a google translation

307
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,920
as long as these

308
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,320
urls are up but within these active

309
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,920
targetings of all of the areas of

310
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,200
critical infrastructure science

311
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,480
technology and research are indeed

312
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,760
biotechnology and you may have said well

313
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,200
yeah this is nothing new and i would

314
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,320
tell you that

315
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,560
if you're in a counterintelligence role

316
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,399
in the federal government of any country

317
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,480
and you don't know what china's 863 plan

318
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,000
is you should look in the mirror and

319
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,839
fire yourself because this is really the

320
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:44,160
road map in terms of the companies

321
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,440
within china that you should be

322
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,760
targeting uh from an active intelligence

323
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,760
and counterintelligence perspective part

324
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,120
of that of course is the thousand

325
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,519
talents plan and the success here's an

326
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:56,160
example of a gentleman who works for an

327
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,480
interesting institute of zoology as part

328
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,120
of the chinese academia academic

329
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,440
sciences cas

330
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,040
what's interesting is he is really

331
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,959
working on

332
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,920
developing not only biological weapons

333
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,000
but looking at different types of

334
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,639
applications in a military perspective

335
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,160
and one of those is really genetic

336
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,240
weapons and what he talks about is that

337
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,560
these new generations can be made by

338
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,839
modifying

339
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:24,240
the genetic code of disease-causing

340
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,160
microorganisms think of covid for

341
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,040
example use gene editing technology to

342
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,200
find the level of

343
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,560
oh

344
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,720
offensive capabilities from a military

345
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,639
perspective that will affect the enemy

346
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,399
at the genetic level

347
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,000
on the battlefield meaning they can

348
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,519
essentially defeat any nuclear

349
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,440
biological or chemical

350
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,519
weapons training and preparation

351
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,440
therefore giving the chinese military

352
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,959
that first mover advantage and

353
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:52,480
competitive military success that they

354
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,639
so are desiring to enjoy

355
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,480
now of course

356
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,240
not to delve back into what happened

357
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,079
last year certainly with covid but if

358
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,079
you're familiar with a biosafety lab 4

359
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,000
that's the highest level

360
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,160
we have them here in the us and

361
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,440
certainly the one at the woolen

362
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,320
institute of virology was a bsl4 and you

363
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,760
may ask yourself well that's such a

364
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,440
tightly controlled

365
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,680
environment for bio weapons development

366
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,880
and bio research how did the

367
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,720
kovat19 escape that well that's another

368
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,399
lecture from last year what i mean to

369
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,320
tell you is that they are talking about

370
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,639
from these bsl4 these genetic weapons

371
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,880
are going to essentially impact

372
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,720
positively the development of future

373
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,399
warfare planning

374
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,120
capabilities and future acquisition of

375
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,200
technology to help the chinese military

376
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,519
be successful on the battlefield

377
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,600
including a development of a biological

378
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,680
atomic bomb

379
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,480
achieving military goals much like in

380
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,480
the information warfare impromisation

381
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,839
space where you don't need to have

382
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,880
soldier on soldier or mourinho marine

383
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,639
and that they do believe that from a

384
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,720
strategic deterrent role genetic weapons

385
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,399
will serve that purpose now what's

386
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,720
interesting about this

387
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,800
is their national security does face

388
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,040
some of those biotech challenges meaning

389
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,560
that they know

390
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,800
that there are specific biological

391
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,440
weapons and terrorism that can take

392
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,680
place through research methods that may

393
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,920
go awry vis-a-vis may maybe the one

394
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,079
institute of virology but of course our

395
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:20,160
intelligence here in the united states

396
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,600
is working on that according to

397
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,360
president biden's edict so we don't need

398
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,680
to go into that suffice it to say

399
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,639
man-made biological disasters will occur

400
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,079
and they can occur and they have

401
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:32,160
occurred due to careless use this is one

402
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,959
of those national security challenges

403
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:36,560
that really sets the basis for the

404
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,160
development of military-grade

405
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,720
bio-weapons by the chinese military now

406
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,639
the application of this field of

407
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:45,519
endeavor biotechnology has become more

408
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:47,360
and more extensive meaning that they are

409
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,839
integrating not only emerging bio

410
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:52,560
weapons and equipment into

411
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,040
the health of sustainable combat

412
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,440
initiatives but also looking at it to

413
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,440
shape that future battlefield meaning

414
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,839
that strategic and tactical decision

415
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,320
making will focus based on the success

416
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,959
of these bio weapons and of course from

417
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:08,880
that comes the consistent theme of

418
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,920
combat power generation if you can get

419
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:15,120
inside a adversary's uh observe orient

420
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,279
decide an act or ooda loop then you can

421
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:18,959
essentially control the battlefield

422
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,800
produce a strong army using science and

423
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,040
technology and defeat them in space

424
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,160
of course the us military has had three

425
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,000
decades plus of experience in iraq and

426
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,880
afghanistan in the marine corps my

427
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,360
service has never seen the second place

428
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,959
so what that means is the chinese are

429
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:36,880
really trying to use biological weapons

430
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:37,920
in this new

431
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,639
military revolutionary affair meaning

432
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,360
that they are looking for an urgency and

433
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,519
exigent development of bioweapons that

434
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:48,399
will last them from a national defense

435
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,560
perspective over the next three decades

436
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,160
so think about that when you think about

437
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,320
future planning and of course there is a

438
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,519
variety of relationships between both

439
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:59,600
chinese national defense and technical

440
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,600
innovation of course this is in chinese

441
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,040
and i'm sure you can all read this but

442
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,279
i've done some translation for you and

443
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:06,800
suffice it to say that there is a

444
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,320
subjective

445
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,160
nature to this which means that they

446
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,560
know as a chinese military and

447
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,320
scientific world that there is a

448
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,959
significant

449
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:19,360
ecosystem historically where a lot of

450
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,399
these intelligent substances arrive and

451
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,480
arise and originate from that they can

452
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,560
take advantage of but they do know that

453
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:30,160
this complex ecosystem of virology is

454
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,240
incomplete and what it means is that

455
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,160
they can use big data and information

456
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,000
processing and artificial intelligence

457
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,800
to enhance the biological bio weapons

458
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,040
development for the military what this

459
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,040
means then again from a combat

460
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,519
generation perspective is that they can

461
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:47,680
get the full measure of combat power

462
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,399
projection using biotechnology

463
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,480
but that what that means then is that

464
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,480
they need to have security around this

465
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,959
program meaning that it must remain

466
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:00,240
somewhat secret so that other nations

467
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,759
adversaries that they may face on the

468
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:03,920
battlefield cannot realize what is

469
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,919
taking place

470
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:07,280
and of course some of those major

471
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,720
factors as you can see from this

472
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,240
narrative are quite concise and

473
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,319
development of course i don't intend for

474
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,959
you to translate this other than to say

475
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:16,480
that there are a variety of different

476
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,480
factors now it should be no surprise

477
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,880
because as we apply the diplomatic

478
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,559
information intelligence military and

479
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:25,280
economic mnemonic dime you can see that

480
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,799
there are of course political and

481
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:28,640
economic factors meaning they want to

482
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,799
stay in powers the communist party there

483
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,559
are social factors meaning that that

484
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,480
colonization and domination is the

485
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,880
manifestation of the chinese dream

486
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,120
is supplemented by the fact that bio

487
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,320
weapons and biotechnology must enhance

488
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,320
national security and then of course

489
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,080
there are institutional and governments

490
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,039
which means these factors are really

491
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:51,200
tied to the national scientific

492
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,440
national security focus of the people's

493
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,440
republic of china meaning while there

494
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,200
are ethical issues

495
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,880
nonetheless those don't necessarily

496
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,799
apply to the adversaries outside of

497
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:02,160
china remember they are the middle

498
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,000
kingdom and they are dominant and we are

499
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,080
subverted and subversive

500
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,000
meaning they intend to colonize all of

501
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,840
us and bio weapons as a military

502
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,080
projection of power is one of those

503
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,679
institutional governance factors that

504
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:16,000
they consider important now another

505
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,840
series of major factors is to

506
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,679
essentially look at what other countries

507
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:22,000
such as the united states are doing look

508
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,679
back a few years in terms of their

509
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:25,360
development it's all right here in plain

510
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,400
chinese for you to look at however i

511
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,480
haven't taken the uh

512
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,720
largess to translate this for you and of

513
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,559
course there are competitive factors

514
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,160
that the chinese look at from a

515
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,480
biological weapons perspective taking a

516
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,320
look at the defense

517
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,080
advanced research project agency or

518
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,840
darpa in terms of what they have been

519
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,919
doing the chinese military wants to

520
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:48,320
dominate this field of endeavor perhaps

521
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,880
even surpassing those programs of the us

522
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,120
military and what they consider to be

523
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,760
darpa's baby child of course there are

524
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,400
diplomatic factors they do realize that

525
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,200
they cannot just lease or lose these bio

526
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,360
weapons on other countries however that

527
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,039
they do realize that these major and

528
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:07,280
significant changes cannot keep pace

529
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,000
with the diplomatic world when diplomacy

530
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,240
fails of course the projection of force

531
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,160
and power is always necessary from a

532
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,480
military perspective as part of this

533
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,720
indeed will be the fact that the chinese

534
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,640
military will be called to use bio

535
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,360
weapons in order to colonize attack and

536
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,320
make an enemy uh secede to them

537
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,080
now of course there are right to speak

538
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,640
factors in terms of uh what the u.s

539
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,160
intelligence community has talked about

540
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,000
in terms of gene editing and the genome

541
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,400
editing project for example related to

542
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,880
weapons of mass destruction uh the fact

543
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,559
that this is in the open

544
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,320
or in clear text for the chinese

545
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,000
military to pick up is interesting

546
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,160
because this gives them a signal that

547
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,559
indeed they must remain competitive and

548
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:50,640
keep pace with this

549
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,400
and then of course the internal factors

550
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,880
within china include those scientific

551
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,480
and technological

552
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,679
hurdles uh that could impede or delay

553
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:02,640
the progress of biotechnical innovation

554
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,320
but nonetheless it is important to

555
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,760
understand that this model for the

556
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,240
future in terms of bio weapons is a

557
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,320
necessary condition for success of the

558
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,840
chinese military that will be the uh the

559
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,720
arm of diplomatic failure in the force

560
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,320
of power projection that the chinese

561
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,640
military will undertake perhaps in the

562
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,640
future against the us military other

563
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,640
adversaries they may see on the air land

564
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,280
and sea so please don't relegate this to

565
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,360
just a land discussion

566
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,880
and of course this is really interesting

567
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,559
because the evolution of this national

568
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:34,720
tech biotechnology under the chinese

569
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,720
defense act really comes into the way

570
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,039
that there are dual use weapons in the

571
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,039
future being developed and it's

572
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,480
important to understand that when it

573
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,799
comes to biological warfare uh there are

574
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:46,559
major things that are recurring thing

575
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,159
remember i mentioned that there are con

576
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:49,520
arms controls in the international

577
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,760
biological space opcw that i talked

578
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,679
about the chinese observe but don't

579
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:56,000
belong to it they also know that there

580
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,080
are emerging technologies that will lead

581
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,159
to new biological weapons that they can

582
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:01,440
carry out

583
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,600
and of course there is always the fatal

584
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,000
temptation of inception meaning

585
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,480
that uh one must not be reborn in the

586
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,799
image that is one because it may flash

587
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:13,200
back or blow back on oneself

588
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,799
and then of course this leads to

589
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:17,360
avoiding the nuclear trap the failure

590
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,840
that the chinese observe of the russian

591
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,320
loss of the cold war and the nuclear

592
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,080
run-up that the uh

593
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,360
the u.s

594
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,360
faced down russia with they believe that

595
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,360
they as the chinese military and chinese

596
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,840
people will have no competitors in the

597
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,480
bio weapons and defense biotechnology

598
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,240
realm they will control the space and

599
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,760
there's nothing that we can do about it

600
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,120
according to this

601
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,640
now of course 2035 not too far off in

602
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,320
the distant future is going to be a

603
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,400
tipping point for national defense

604
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,320
biotechnology now i certainly hope that

605
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,159
president biden's intelligence community

606
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:52,400
is reading watching and paying attention

607
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,000
to this of course

608
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,159
i've been ridiculed on youtube i've been

609
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:58,159
ridiculed in space but i will tell you

610
00:21:58,159 --> 00:21:59,520
i'm not going to predict this i'm just

611
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,520
reporting on what i see

612
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,200
and i've taken the

613
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,559
opportunity to let you know that when

614
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:06,720
2035 comes around

615
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,880
that development from by the chinese

616
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,559
national defense biotechnology

617
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:12,960
initiatives will be the core product

618
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,799
outside of information warfare for their

619
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:15,919
protection

620
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:17,200
of course they're going to look at

621
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,840
organisms and controlling them micro

622
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,159
ecosystems and essentially looking at

623
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:24,799
ways to operate a

624
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:26,559
biological

625
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:29,600
taxonomy of military biological

626
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,000
organisms from which they can pick and

627
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
really direct at any adversary on the

628
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,200
battlefield

629
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,640
they also understand that there are

630
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,039
national treasure treasures of military

631
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:40,880
technological innovation

632
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,440
meaning they can prevent early strikes

633
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,039
by other adversaries including the

634
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:48,159
united states by essentially creating a

635
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:50,640
very highly maneuverable highly active

636
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,840
responsive reactive reagent that can

637
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:57,360
identify defeat delay degrade destroy an

638
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,760
adversary's capability to control them i

639
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,039
hope you're paying attention out there

640
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:02,799
us government and u.s intelligence

641
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:04,799
community and of course there is the

642
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:07,760
calculation of biological bioinformatics

643
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,840
meaning using biocomputing to

644
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,600
essentially map these genes to the

645
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,840
purpose which is intended for a military

646
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,480
dual use capability

647
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,480
and what's interesting is while there is

648
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,039
information collection that may be

649
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:22,960
needed for retention they believe that

650
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,240
by

651
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,320
examining new different forms of life in

652
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,480
this bioeconomic economic system

653
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,080
preventing those from being shared by

654
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,600
some of the adversaries or countries

655
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,360
that have dominated them they can

656
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,280
maintain that first mover military

657
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,960
advantage and destroy an adversary on

658
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,240
the battlefield

659
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,760
and then of course that gets into some

660
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,799
of the more esoteric origin of life

661
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:45,360
origin of consciousness uh talking about

662
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,679
cognitive memory uh dissonance which

663
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:50,080
hits a little bit uh jean-paul satra for

664
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,760
me but nonetheless it's something that

665
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,120
they're talking about in terms of

666
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,840
synthetic mind control uh certainly

667
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,159
we've seen that in the us military not

668
00:23:58,159 --> 00:23:59,760
meant to reflect anything that has or

669
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,120
has not happened in the past

670
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:04,320
realistically of course then uh

671
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,720
anticipated 15 years on beyond that in

672
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,640
2050 of course it's right here for you

673
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,720
in chinese uh certainly you can read

674
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:14,080
this however i've taken the

675
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,880
the liberty of taking a look at a new

676
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,400
world order

677
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,400
meaning a human machine environment is

678
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,840
inevitable meaning that man society and

679
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,159
integration and the possibility of

680
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,159
eliminating biological warfare through

681
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:30,000
that competitive biotechnology and

682
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,640
national security matrix is going to be

683
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,840
necessary meaning that a calculation of

684
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,760
what will happen in predicting that is a

685
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,039
necessary

686
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:41,120
intelligent attribute of this capability

687
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,200
that they will develop the military

688
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,080
within china will also come combine

689
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,360
bionics

690
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,039
of weapons and equipment meaning that

691
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:51,440
these automated systems will essentially

692
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,480
locate seek and destroy adversaries that

693
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,039
propose a problem to them in the form of

694
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:59,039
third generation weapon system

695
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,559
development

696
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:02,480
and then of course there's environmental

697
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,480
technology making sure that while they

698
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,000
don't necessarily care about destroying

699
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,279
the earth they're going to use it for

700
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:09,279
their advantage now when i say earth i

701
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:10,880
mean air land and sea

702
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,240
and they're going to make sure that if

703
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,760
even if there is a incorrect

704
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,840
interpretation of the united states uh

705
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,080
convention opcw

706
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,640
or the prohibition of biological weapons

707
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,320
uh it doesn't necessarily apply to the

708
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,600
chinese well they are part of the

709
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,600
national security council of the united

710
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,000
nations uh it's certainly something that

711
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,279
they believe that they can be a first

712
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:30,960
mover and write the policy on that as

713
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,159
they have tried to do with the internet

714
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:33,760
control with russia

715
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,760
and then of course cognitive revolution

716
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,080
and human birth uh meaning that there is

717
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:41,200
a way to use nanotechnology in order to

718
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,279
avoid what had happened during the

719
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:48,159
nuclear trap and uh dilemmas of the late

720
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:50,640
uh 60s early 70s into the 90s between

721
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,400
russia and china

722
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,840
and then last but not least here's a

723
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:54,840
little bit of

724
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,279
historical uh trip down some of the

725
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:59,760
military origins of this of course

726
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,720
they've been

727
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,400
they being the people's liberation army

728
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,720
or the pla or june way have been really

729
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,000
focused on the advances of biotechnology

730
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,320
and the way that it can change future

731
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:14,159
conflicts uh in 2010 guajiang wei

732
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:16,159
worked on a significance of impact of

733
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:18,159
biology on the future plans for china's

734
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:20,799
military meaning that over a decade ago

735
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:22,320
they were already looking at this in

736
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,400
terms of future warfare planning

737
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:28,000
five years later major general future

738
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
really started to talk about bio

739
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,760
materials in terms of controlling an

740
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,120
adversary to make them think that they

741
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,279
have been defeated on the battlefield in

742
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:37,039
order to fix them in place and destroy

743
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:39,360
them this sounds pretty far out but if

744
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,279
you think about it there are agents out

745
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:42,799
there that can certainly render a

746
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:44,000
adversary

747
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,240
incapable an incapacity and he was

748
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,080
certainly talking about this from an

749
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,080
academic perspective

750
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,919
and then we have a retired general uh

751
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:53,520
jean-claude

752
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,360
who talked about seven new domains of

753
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,840
warfare including modern biotechnology

754
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,400
development what's interesting meaning

755
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,840
that he believed that the strong

756
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,559
offensive capability could be included

757
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:07,120
with specific genetic attacks that

758
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,360
should be employed now think of the rest

759
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,840
of xinjiang province and there you have

760
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,400
a living battlefield environment that

761
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,000
from a laboratory perspective that they

762
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,120
could use

763
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,360
and then finally signs of military

764
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,799
strategy i've talked about this in the

765
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:23,120
information warfare talks came out in

766
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,600
2017 you can actually get it on amazon

767
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,799
in english

768
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:28,880
really talks about that domain of a

769
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:32,080
military bio weapons capability

770
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,240
making note that this is indeed a force

771
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,600
multiplier

772
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,440
again with an emphasis on specific

773
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,240
genetic attacks uh suffice it to say

774
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,840
they being the chinese have been talking

775
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,159
about this for some time uh certainly

776
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:45,600
hopefully our military and our

777
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,240
intelligence world here in the west is

778
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,480
taking and keeping pace with this

779
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,279
now

780
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:53,279
this gentleman i mentioned him last one

781
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:54,960
it really was on the cutting edge for

782
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,120
the biological frontier and he talked

783
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,520
about confrontation in new methods and

784
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,679
when he met new methods he indeed meant

785
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:03,279
genetic weapons

786
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:05,200
in terms of how this can be done and i

787
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,120
talked about this earlier

788
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,760
vis-a-vis how these new genetic weapons

789
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,840
will affect the chinese use of in

790
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,279
control of

791
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:15,840
future war and really chemical weapons

792
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,440
being the precursor to this the

793
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,039
bio-atomic bomb

794
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:21,520
with a huge lethality imagine a kinetic

795
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,120
atomic bomb and what happened to the

796
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:26,080
chinese cities uh during world war ii

797
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,600
well the chinese believe that this can

798
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,919
be done from a bioweapons perspective a

799
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:31,520
bioatomic bomb

800
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,600
and meaning that

801
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,000
really one soldier does not need to be

802
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,440
placed enough

803
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,559
in the

804
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:40,080
face of war

805
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,679
to achieve military goals that these

806
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:44,320
genetic weapons will play that strategic

807
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:47,120
role to preserve the tactical troops

808
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:50,480
from being essentially pawns in a larger

809
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,279
adversarial role they do not want

810
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:54,880
foreign militaries to face them on the

811
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,480
battlefield and have that first mover

812
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,760
advantage the chinese believe that

813
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,480
indeed they will do that for you

814
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,559
and of course they as you saw last year

815
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:04,159
do train to the same standards that we

816
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:05,919
do it's interesting that this chem

817
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:08,559
biosuit and masks look similar to the us

818
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:09,919
but i digress this is not about

819
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:11,679
intellectual property

820
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:13,600
you should be aware of the

821
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,360
china national gene bank as part of

822
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,799
their initiatives i mean it's right here

823
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:18,880
in english it's right out on the web

824
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,399
certainly you can all read chinese and

825
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:21,919
go to the url yourself but it's

826
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:23,200
interesting because they have been

827
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,320
tasked

828
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,559
with developing some of those genetic

829
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:29,080
resources that will safeguard

830
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:31,679
bioinformatics with a focus on national

831
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:33,520
security

832
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,679
and it's really interesting because

833
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:36,880
you've heard about

834
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,720
seizing strategic commanding heights in

835
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,240
the information or cyber warfare

836
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,320
perspective they believe that in the

837
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,640
military domain of biotechnology that

838
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,880
this company the national

839
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,080
gene bank

840
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,840
will do the same for them it's important

841
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,679
to pay attention to organizations like

842
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:52,720
this

843
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,039
and then of course when we think of

844
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:56,960
military use coming out of gas masks

845
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,440
we've all done that uh in biological

846
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,840
weapons as distasteful as it is is

847
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,399
something we should pay attention to

848
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:06,159
last but not least as i conclude my

849
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:07,760
presentation here are some of the

850
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,640
conclusions uh the dual

851
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,799
chinese military and civilian

852
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:14,640
recollection of japanese horrors of

853
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,039
weapons of mass destruction during the

854
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:19,279
war of aggression world war ii

855
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:21,200
really endures with them historically

856
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,399
they distaste the japanese economically

857
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:26,480
they'll use them but from a military

858
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,039
colonization perspective they hate them

859
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:31,039
they do study the horrors of this and

860
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:32,880
prepare actively for the terrorist use

861
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,480
of a bio weapon as a weapon of mass

862
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,080
destruction

863
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,240
they do believe that dual use civilian

864
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,240
military bioweapons programs is

865
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,799
necessary and they are pursuing this

866
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,640
and they also believe that bioweapons

867
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,559
acts and accidents are inevitable in

868
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:48,480
china via the wuhan institute of

869
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,720
virology and the western world as a

870
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,480
result of that they need to prepare for

871
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,520
war

872
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,120
and then of course similar to what the

873
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,120
foreign military militaries us and

874
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,200
others are doing to prepare

875
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,279
no one wants a war but they know that

876
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:04,000
vigilance is necessary and really when

877
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,760
you look above they don't want to be

878
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,600
subject to any sort of other country

879
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,000
coming in and using these bio weapons on

880
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,200
the civilian or military population

881
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,440
number six of course

882
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,200
bioweapons development and the

883
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,799
procurement of that technology comes

884
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:20,640
under the china's thousand talents plan

885
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,880
if you want more about that uh certainly

886
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,720
come and see some of my presentations on

887
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,000
that in the

888
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,760
cyber warfare information dominance

889
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,760
perspective and load they are using

890
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,120
human intelligence and active

891
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,799
intelligence collection make no mistake

892
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:34,399
about it

893
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:36,799
number seven of course from a china

894
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:38,320
manifest dream

895
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,480
uh world domination culturally and

896
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,000
economic is going to be their goal and

897
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,080
weapons of biological mass destruction

898
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:47,279
will be the military sword uh that will

899
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:49,360
take care of those that do not want to

900
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,399
play

901
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:51,679
and then of course they're actively

902
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:53,600
preparing for weapons

903
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,600
bioweapons deployment in the shadow of

904
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,000
the world's failure to convey co

905
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,760
contained covet i apologize it says

906
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,679
kovic it's not a new acronym it should

907
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:02,960
say covet

908
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,279
that concludes my presentation 32
