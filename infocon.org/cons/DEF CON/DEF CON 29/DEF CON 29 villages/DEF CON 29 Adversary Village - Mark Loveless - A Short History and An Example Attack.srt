[Music]

3
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,720
welcome

4
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:28,080
my name is mark loveless i am a security

5
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,920
researcher at get lab

6
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,160
i'm very pleased to be presenting here

7
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:36,320
at adversary village as a part of the

8
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:38,559
overall def con experience here in 2021

9
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,440
today the topic is advanced persistent

10
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:42,160
threats

11
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,600
otherwise known as apt i know a few of

12
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,640
you out there are probably

13
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,960
hoping to learn a few things

14
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,399
that you can use for red teaming and

15
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,840
penetration testing

16
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,559
so i'll point out some important

17
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,160
differences between those and apt

18
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:58,239
but i know a lot of you are just

19
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,559
interested in the topic

20
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:02,960
i'll discuss how one goes about tracking

21
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:05,439
apt actors over time

22
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,880
i'll cover some elements of attribution

23
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:08,560
although as you will see

24
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,400
in this presentation that's not

25
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,560
necessarily

26
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,159
as important to at least so frontline

27
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,759
defenders

28
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,840
i'm going to cover some technical

29
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:19,600
details from an actual attack

30
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,360
that i dealt with against my home

31
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:24,720
systems from

32
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:27,920
a very uh well-known

33
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,280
apt group and i'm hoping that all of

34
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,439
this information will kind of bring the

35
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,240
entire subject into focus

36
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,280
it should be noted that some of the data

37
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,840
associated with

38
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,600
ip address assignments and domains

39
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:43,520
discussed later in this presentation

40
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:45,840
are no longer current also all specific

41
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,920
data i am discussing has been referenced

42
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,960
in public by other parties

43
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:53,680
or came directly off of my home systems

44
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,399
so i'm not revealing any state secrets

45
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,560
but

46
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,719
first i wanted to give you some relevant

47
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,600
information on my background as well as

48
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:03,040
some

49
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,960
of the history of the term apt

50
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,159
and hopefully all that will give you a

51
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:09,840
little perspective

52
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,840
for the rest of this presentation

53
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:17,040
um a couple of decades ago i formed a

54
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,560
hacking group known as

55
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:22,400
nmrc we did the usual goofy hacker

56
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,400
things but we did have a serious side

57
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,160
when occasionally help out to a

58
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,599
group that needed some technical support

59
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,160
now we were doing this

60
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:31,920
for free most of these organizations

61
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,560
we'd help were involved with human

62
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,959
rights

63
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,080
some were activists who were working

64
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,239
against a repressive

65
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,239
government and other like-minded

66
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,440
activities we didn't make a lot of this

67
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,280
work public

68
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,280
for obvious reasons we didn't want to

69
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,280
tip the hands of these governments

70
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:50,400
nor did we want them to know who we were

71
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,519
doing this work for all right let me

72
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,239
give you a quick example

73
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:56,800
of something that we did that probably

74
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:59,040
got us on the radar i was working at

75
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,000
uh buying view which is later acquired

76
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,599
by semantic

77
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,360
we were developing a web scanner that

78
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:04,159
would look for known security flaws

79
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,200
things like

80
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:08,800
bad cgi scripts and whatnot

81
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,040
we needed to stress test it so we

82
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,280
decided we would try to scan a whole

83
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,200
bunch of websites at the same time

84
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,000
and since china had a fairly poor

85
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:20,239
reputation when it came to human rights

86
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,040
we aimed this thing at the entirety of

87
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,519
china's

88
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,799
allocated ip address space now

89
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,120
technically

90
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:29,599
it was only looking for the existence of

91
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,400
a file on a website not code execution

92
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:34,720
we thought no harm no foul

93
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,400
but when we did scan certain websites it

94
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,360
would occasionally elicit an interesting

95
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,200
response

96
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:42,159
usually in the form of a ddos attack i

97
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,840
mean we weren't trying to really hide

98
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:45,680
where we were scanning from i was doing

99
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,799
this from my house

100
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,959
so after we collected uh

101
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,400
scan results a couple of us had copies

102
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,239
of all this data and we

103
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,799
provided it to those that we knew were

104
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,879
fighting the good fight so to speak

105
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:01,360
mainly repressed chinese nationals who

106
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:04,159
were angry at their government

107
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,799
now in retrospect this was pretty poor

108
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:08,159
opsec

109
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:10,000
on my part i had static ip addresses

110
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:12,000
it wouldn't be too hard to figure out

111
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,200
that this scan led to

112
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,759
this type of an attack etc etc

113
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:20,880
uh and in particular when i started

114
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,880
doing things like uh

115
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:25,360
talking in public about how i didn't

116
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,759
like what the uh the chinese government

117
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,120
was doing as far as human rights goes

118
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:31,120
so it wasn't too hard to be able to

119
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,320
track me down and get my feelings on the

120
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,800
subject now

121
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,680
another area that probably impacted this

122
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,120
uh

123
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:41,840
just as greatly was a my employer

124
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,720
i used to work at mitre corporation and

125
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,720
which is a

126
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,759
basically a us government think tank

127
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,759
where

128
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:50,160
despite my hacker background i somehow

129
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:53,440
managed to get a security clearance

130
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:55,520
which has now expired while i was at

131
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:58,320
mitre i worked on a number of projects

132
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:02,000
including frontline battling of apt

133
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:04,160
attackers against that organization now

134
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,240
because of these hacker activities my

135
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,800
employers a few other issues and

136
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:12,320
scenarios i won't belabor the point with

137
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:14,639
i was on the radar i've apparently been

138
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:18,000
added to a list of assets

139
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:19,120
that some of these apt groups might want

140
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,880
to compromise

141
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:24,400
i have might have access to something

142
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,759
interesting as far as they're concerned

143
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,759
where i may be in contact with someone

144
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:30,880
that they're trying to target

145
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:33,280
uh between direct contact from friends

146
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:35,680
that work in government agencies and a

147
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,280
rather interesting exit debriefing when

148
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,880
i left mitre

149
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,800
i realized that while it's not

150
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,880
life-threatening i was on a list of

151
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,720
potential targets

152
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,400
i'm not saying i'm a special snowflake

153
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,080
by any means

154
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,759
i'm just saying that there are a number

155
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,560
of us that have worked in this arena

156
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:54,479
before

157
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:58,319
and all of a sudden we've become kind of

158
00:05:54,479 --> 00:06:00,160
a target so to speak so in general my

159
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:02,000
perspective in this is a little more

160
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:05,440
than simple curiosity

161
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,400
about the subject so apt

162
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,600
let's talk about the history of the

163
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,639
actual term

164
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,639
itself apt

165
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:22,160
in the 90s the us military used the term

166
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:25,360
advanced persistent threat

167
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:27,680
or apt for short to refer to

168
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,560
small self-autonomous enemy commando

169
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,400
units

170
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:35,360
in 2006 the term

171
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,240
was applied to cyberbase groups where

172
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,240
it's stuck

173
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:41,039
probably because of the similar

174
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:44,240
independent nature of these groups

175
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:46,479
instead of the usual distract disrupt

176
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,800
delay mandate of the commando units

177
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:51,039
the based units were all about

178
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,759
information acquisition

179
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:56,319
at the time these cyber based groups

180
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:59,520
main goal was intellectual property

181
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:01,759
for competitive or military advantage

182
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,520
often targeted were things like defense

183
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,639
plans including details of various

184
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,520
weapons

185
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:09,360
troop operations what projects are being

186
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:12,800
funded

187
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:15,120
certainly any other form of intelligence

188
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,479
additional additionally things like a

189
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,800
network diagrams

190
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,919
software inventory information email

191
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,240
addresses of

192
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:25,039
personnel to further existing and future

193
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,400
cyber based operations were sought

194
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:28,240
basically they would try to gather

195
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,599
information that revealed military or

196
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,680
economic weakness

197
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:33,759
or gave them a military or economic

198
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,840
advantage and gave them a way

199
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:38,639
back into the place that they were

200
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,639
trying to get into

201
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:44,800
so the atp battle plan was roughly as

202
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,520
follows

203
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,039
there would be a fairly detailed

204
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,120
reconnaissance of a target

205
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:52,960
that would include not just what type of

206
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,520
systems the target might have

207
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,199
but also identify some of the people and

208
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:00,240
what their jobs were

209
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:02,400
to help with things like spearfishing uh

210
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,360
they develop an infrastructure for an

211
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,280
attack

212
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,639
such as email accounts to send phishing

213
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,560
emails from

214
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:09,840
uh registered domains and set up

215
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,720
websites or

216
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:14,400
compromise existing ones code up and get

217
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,800
ready to deploy command and control

218
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:19,680
systems and so on

219
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,639
based upon the reconnaissance attack at

220
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,280
that point

221
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,479
using a method that should work on the

222
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,319
target

223
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:29,280
once compromised attempt to move

224
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:31,759
laterally to as many systems as possible

225
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,839
uh back door as much as possible to

226
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:34,880
allow for remote command and control as

227
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,200
well as

228
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,000
potential future entry points in case of

229
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,599
discovery

230
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,479
and being kicked out they could get back

231
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:44,959
in and if this was a return visit to a

232
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:47,680
site perhaps they might be going after

233
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:49,040
specific assets fairly quickly once they

234
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,399
get in there

235
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,080
they would then perform the main

236
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:53,680
objective which it could be to

237
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,360
exfiltrate data

238
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:58,640
or something else such as maybe

239
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:00,959
backdooring source code etc

240
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,560
and then of course they're constantly

241
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:05,360
adjusting things

242
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,080
over that entire time as needed to

243
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,839
maintain

244
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,839
that all-important foothold

245
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,320
okay for some reason attribution has

246
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,440
been

247
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:22,640
a hot topic particularly in the past

248
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,720
uh when this entire apt thing began to

249
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:27,839
be known in public circles

250
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,720
the main argument the main arguments i

251
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,760
should say

252
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:33,680
i heard were the following first

253
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:35,600
an attacker as an attacker who cares who

254
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:38,880
it is just keep them out right

255
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,760
well that's true uh you we should be

256
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,399
doing that

257
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,839
uh in any case but uh that's not the

258
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,440
entire point and we'll get to that here

259
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:48,320
in a little bit

260
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:50,480
um number two consulting companies were

261
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,000
using the term apt

262
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,720
in their marketing to sell goods and

263
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,080
services and so a lot of people just

264
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,880
deemed this to be

265
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,320
uh overblown marketing just some type of

266
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:03,120
weird marketing ploy

267
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,640
uh true that was happening but no that

268
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,720
wasn't uh

269
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,760
that really wasn't the necessarily the

270
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,480
problem

271
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,760
uh the third argument was that the term

272
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,000
apt

273
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,600
advanced persistent threat advanced

274
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,480
being the key word here

275
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,760
was rather offensive to a number of

276
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,760
people

277
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,200
the main argument was that someone read

278
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:26,880
a report from let's say

279
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:28,000
fireeye and see that an attack group had

280
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:31,200
used a

281
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,279
year old bug to gain access to a target

282
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,279
and some people would say things like oh

283
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:36,480
that's not advanced if i if it were me

284
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:40,560
i'd be using

285
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:43,279
zero day not some lame six month old bug

286
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,079
now this last one really pissed me off

287
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:47,120
uh

288
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:49,920
to me uh as a hacker who used to

289
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:52,079
actually break into systems in my youth

290
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,600
i fully understood why you would not

291
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:56,880
want to waste or

292
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:59,279
essentially burn a zero day on a target

293
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,880
unless you really really wanted into

294
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:04,480
that target

295
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:05,120
uh a number of people saying it wasn't

296
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,440
advanced

297
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,399
they did red teaming or pen testing as a

298
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,399
part of their job

299
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:12,839
and they had a different perspective

300
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:15,360
completely different inspector

301
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:19,519
um true attacking

302
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:21,920
truly committing felonies involves

303
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:23,279
cheating for lack of a a better term

304
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,920
when you're pen testing

305
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:28,560
usually for looking for multiple ways in

306
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:31,200
and documenting all of them and

307
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,240
there are some off assets that might be

308
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:36,160
off limits

309
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:38,399
or out of scope and

310
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,760
some techniques might be completely off

311
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:43,360
the table such as

312
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:45,760
denial of service red teaming often

313
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,600
involves testing subsections of the

314
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,480
infrastructure it might start with the

315
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,680
idea that

316
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:53,600
assume we got root on xyz or some other

317
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:55,440
scenario

318
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,440
just trying to test detection systems

319
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,320
themselves there are lots of different

320
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,639
things to go and

321
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,959
go into it in other words there are

322
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:06,240
limitations that are imposed

323
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:09,440
on those groups now with apt

324
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:11,360
there are no limits you can launch a

325
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,360
ddos attack against

326
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,480
one part of the infrastructure or

327
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,639
unleash a

328
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,560
piece of nasty malware just something to

329
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:21,200
keep the admins busy

330
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,560
and then use your crafted attack to slip

331
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,200
by defenses

332
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:27,440
nothing is out of scope nothing is off

333
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,200
limits

334
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,040
i was i'm giving an example of this i

335
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,160
was aware of a very large software

336
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:35,680
company

337
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,480
where dozens of isps in the area of its

338
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,519
headquarters

339
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:42,480
were targeted and

340
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:43,680
the attackers were all looking for vpn

341
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,800
connections

342
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,440
uh from home systems and these large

343
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,279
software

344
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,639
uh this large software company

345
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:53,680
headquarters

346
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:56,480
uh those home systems were targeted

347
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:58,240
and all of these vpns for this

348
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,560
particular organization

349
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,560
allowed for split tunneling which in

350
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,360
turn allowed for the attackers to gain a

351
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,639
foothold

352
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:09,519
in this large software company now

353
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:11,200
apt attackers are in general better at

354
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:12,880
this kind of thing than usual

355
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,920
run-of-the-mill attackers

356
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:17,920
i mean this is their full-time job uh

357
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,600
they're good at it and so this gives you

358
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,839
kind of a rough idea of what i'm talking

359
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,839
about

360
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:30,399
attribution attribution is uniquely

361
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:33,519
identifying a particular apt group

362
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:35,920
in classified are political circles

363
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:37,839
knowing the nation state behind the

364
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,360
attack is important

365
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:41,440
otherwise that part actually doesn't

366
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:44,399
really matter

367
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,199
ttps the tactics techniques and

368
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:47,519
procedures

369
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:49,199
help with this identification process

370
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:52,000
now by gathering

371
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:53,600
ttps and other indicators patterns will

372
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,639
begin to emerge

373
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,800
the more you gather the more defined the

374
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:00,959
patterns are

375
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,639
a set of these highly defined and

376
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:05,440
related patterns

377
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:06,480
uh it's called a campaign and a campaign

378
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:10,560
is basically

379
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:11,040
an apt group now after gathering data

380
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,000
from

381
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,839
dozens of attacks extremely refined

382
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
patterns

383
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:20,480
emerge and one can ask if certain

384
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,639
patterns are similar over time

385
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,639
which could mean a repeat attacker and

386
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:27,360
this is the true

387
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:28,480
reason you do attribution based upon the

388
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:32,240
historical

389
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:35,199
data what is their next move

390
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:36,880
if for example a particular group

391
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:39,839
attacks on tuesdays

392
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:43,120
every four to six weeks with a phishing

393
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:45,199
email from a yahoo.com address

394
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:47,519
you can anticipate that kind of attack

395
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:51,199
and even stop it

396
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:53,120
uh data from launching that executable

397
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:55,040
from the last attack on your

398
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,040
honey net tells you how they move and

399
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:59,360
exploit access

400
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,480
so if they do get in you know their next

401
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:04,000
move that's

402
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:05,519
a big big part of this will they crazy

403
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,120
ivan

404
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,560
if you haven't seen the movie the hunt

405
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:12,320
for red october i

406
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:14,880
highly recommend it now in this film the

407
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,600
enemy soviet submarine would sometimes

408
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,000
stop

409
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,639
and turn to look for someone tailing

410
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,320
them

411
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:23,040
uh typically they'd be looking for the

412
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,240
americans and this was referred to as

413
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:27,199
crazy ivan

414
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,320
by these americans uh chasing these

415
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:31,839
people in their

416
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:33,920
in their submarines so uh some apt

417
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:36,320
groups did something fairly similar

418
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:38,399
uh where they swap out back doors every

419
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,800
week or so

420
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:43,519
some even left a few of the old uh back

421
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:45,120
doors on a couple of computers so that

422
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:46,959
if that particular back door was

423
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,480
discovered

424
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:50,480
and then all of those machines were

425
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:53,279
wiped uh

426
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:55,519
the victim would think they'd cleaned up

427
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:58,079
the the attack and were okay

428
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:58,720
whereas the abt actor was actually still

429
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:00,399
in there

430
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,720
because they were using multiple back

431
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:06,639
doors

432
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:09,920
now tools used to collect this data

433
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:12,639
we can't include honey pots honey nets

434
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:14,399
even honey clients it also can include

435
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:16,480
data from

436
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,920
when you're going through and looking at

437
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:21,199
the remnants of a

438
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:24,959
of a successful attack on their part

439
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:27,839
this data uh gathered is stored at mitre

440
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:29,360
it was done using a software package

441
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:31,440
called crits

442
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,519
which is now an open source project this

443
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:37,120
started uh

444
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:40,399
at mitre who was dealing with this uh

445
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:41,839
a apt data collection and is still

446
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,920
out there and you can still download it

447
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:46,000
and use it uh

448
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,680
data sharing if you want to be able to

449
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,800
share data with others this can actually

450
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,600
help

451
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,639
with others in your industry for example

452
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,519
uh

453
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:56,959
it can be crucial uh particularly if you

454
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:58,480
know your buddy down the street gets

455
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:01,279
attacked on

456
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,480
thursday by you know one particular apt

457
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:04,640
a group then you're going to get it on

458
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,959
the following monday you hear from them

459
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:09,280
that it's thursday and they got attacked

460
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:11,280
monday you know what to expect so that

461
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:14,720
becomes important

462
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:18,240
so that that kind of gives you

463
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:22,240
a a little bit of an idea

464
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,240
about attribution

465
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:30,840
let's talk about an actual campaign this

466
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:34,799
attack was from a group known as

467
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:37,520
apt-18 or dynamite panda

468
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:39,679
i knew them by the name wekby webby is

469
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:42,000
still active to this day

470
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:43,840
this particular particular attack took

471
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,400
place a few years ago

472
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:48,160
i don't know if you remember the company

473
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:52,080
hacking team

474
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:55,360
and the breach they suffered in 2015

475
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:59,280
as a part of that breach they had an

476
00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:00,960
adobe flash zero day which was leaked

477
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:04,000
so it was going to be patched fairly

478
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:08,640
quick now when we saw this breach

479
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:12,400
within days they had launched a campaign

480
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:15,440
with a fully weaponized evil flash file

481
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,960
while it is possible that they managed

482
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:20,480
to get the evil file

483
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:22,480
file working flawlessly uh

484
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,880
without causing a crash and deploying

485
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:27,039
the payload and all this accurately

486
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,160
it is more likely they already had this

487
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:30,799
particular

488
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:32,160
flash zero day and decided now is the

489
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:34,080
time to use it

490
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,520
because all of a sudden it had a limited

491
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:38,799
shelf life

492
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:40,880
they quickly developed a spearfish

493
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:43,600
and i personally received this fish as

494
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:46,720
did other select individuals

495
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:49,840
and various organizations

496
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:52,880
here are the raw headers of the fishing

497
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:56,080
phishing email i received

498
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:58,880
okay so the ttps

499
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:00,240
are in blue and the important data

500
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:04,880
associated with that is

501
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:07,200
in red this shows just some of the

502
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,080
dozens if not hundreds of things that

503
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,200
are collected

504
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:14,400
when doing a data gathering now here is

505
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:17,520
the body of the email there are

506
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:19,840
obvious mistakes in the email probably

507
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:23,039
because webby was in a hurry to get this

508
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:27,919
out the door but the ip address

509
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:31,520
of 137.175.4.132

510
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:34,559
really caught my eye i recognized it

511
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:37,760
immediately thought of wekby

512
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:38,000
i did go and look at the page that it

513
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,039
was

514
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:46,000
pointing to and downloaded the movie.swf

515
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:48,480
file uh the page and the sfvf were

516
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,120
there for maybe three or four days maybe

517
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,679
less

518
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:53,559
i don't know who took them down probably

519
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:57,600
wekby

520
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:58,720
movie.swf had a payload that simply

521
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,760
downloaded insta

522
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:05,679
and installed a remote access trojan

523
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:06,799
also known as a rat so i manually

524
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:09,280
downloaded it

525
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:11,840
and took a look at it the rat was known

526
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:14,000
as ghost

527
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:15,280
and there are ghost variants these were

528
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,600
often used

529
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:22,559
by wekby to use a a ghost variant

530
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:23,200
a bit of analysis on the ip address

531
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:25,360
reveal

532
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:27,120
revealed more information that i

533
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:30,400
remembered as wekby

534
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:33,360
as did the rat including the command and

535
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:37,120
control ip address

536
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:40,320
now ghost is an http browser

537
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:42,799
style rat in that it does periodic

538
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:44,159
queries and it looks for new responses

539
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:46,799
which helps

540
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:49,039
direct the next command that ghost will

541
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:52,480
run on the target

542
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:55,520
in this particular case it's using dns

543
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:59,520
text records for command and control

544
00:20:55,520 --> 00:21:02,720
so ghost traffic looked like dns queries

545
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:05,760
and for a typical victim location this

546
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:08,880
type of traffic would not be blocked and

547
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:11,600
would very easily make it outbound

548
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,320
as you can see there is the potential

549
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,320
for

550
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:16,240
dozens and dozens of different

551
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:18,240
attributes one can use

552
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,400
to track individual attack groups

553
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:24,240
depending upon the campaign

554
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:28,080
i have seen ttps in the hundreds for

555
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:29,840
a single campaign when you compare these

556
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:32,880
for looking for patterns and let's say

557
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:35,360
that you get 80

558
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,799
that are common between a newly

559
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:39,039
documented attack

560
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:39,840
and one that's happened previously you

561
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:42,240
can almost be

562
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:44,320
certain it was the same attacker

563
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:46,799
especially when you consider

564
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:49,840
that maybe the second place contender

565
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:53,760
for common ttps might only have say

566
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:55,520
10 anyway

567
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,960
enough about our attack attempt now

568
00:21:55,520 --> 00:22:01,200
let's talk about some

569
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:01,200
fun facts about apt in general

570
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:09,280
all right some of our fun facts the

571
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:12,320
initial intrusion

572
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:13,440
is going to be the easiest way in for

573
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:16,960
the attacker

574
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:20,480
if sending in an email asking the person

575
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:23,360
to run an attachment called backdoor.exe

576
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:25,200
does the job they'll do that more

577
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:28,640
sophisticated targets

578
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:32,720
might require some more advanced

579
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:36,799
techniques up to and including zero day

580
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:39,919
credentials tokens keys of all kinds

581
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:40,799
are going to be harvested end user

582
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:44,159
devices

583
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:46,480
servers containers are all infiltrated

584
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:49,039
and the more sophisticated attackers

585
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:52,080
will rotate their back doors

586
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:54,080
these are the apt

587
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,440
basics that seem to happen at every

588
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,840
intrusion

589
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,520
the main objectives still happen but the

590
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,280
basics they do seem to be fairly

591
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:04,640
consistent

592
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:07,679
advanced attackers will compromise

593
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:10,720
a target software and their services for

594
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:10,720
downstream attacks

595
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:16,640
the 2001 attack on rsa

596
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:18,320
attributed to wekby by the way was an

597
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,880
early version of this

598
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:23,200
solar winds is a probably a good example

599
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:26,400
of a more recent one of a

600
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,200
kind of a downstream style attack now

601
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:30,000
these

602
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:31,440
supply chain attacks might be cheaper

603
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,080
for the attacker

604
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,360
as there is a lot more bang for the buck

605
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:38,640
so to speak

606
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:41,120
although the risk of detection is higher

607
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:44,080
the larger the spread of the attack

608
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:45,200
uh the more potential surfaces that are

609
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,520
touched

610
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,320
this could result in a breach being

611
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,559
detected

612
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:52,080
and that was the case for example with

613
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:55,760
solar winds

614
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:58,559
um now as far as the nation state

615
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:59,200
themselves uh there are a few big

616
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:03,360
players

617
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:07,120
in this uh that includes china or russia

618
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:12,000
israel france and the usa

619
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:15,440
uh there is also a kind of a next tier

620
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:18,799
group that includes countries like india

621
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:21,840
pakistan iran and north korea

622
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:24,240
now as far as who is best of the best

623
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:26,240
uh that would definitely be i would put

624
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:29,919
that as a usa

625
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:33,840
uh russia and israel hands down

626
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:33,840
they're gonna be the top ones

627
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:39,440
security people do need to understand

628
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,679
these types of

629
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,600
threats they're not common but they

630
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:46,320
exemplify the sharpest

631
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:48,799
attacker that you will ever face if you

632
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:51,360
sell goods or services to customers

633
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:52,320
that are the type of victims that apt

634
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,240
actors

635
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:56,799
are going to go after you can should

636
00:24:54,240 --> 00:25:00,880
consider yourself a target

637
00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:03,360
the rsa attack in 2011 is probably

638
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,480
uh the best example i can think of of

639
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,880
this

640
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:09,360
uh not all of your customers would

641
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:12,320
potentially face an apt threat but

642
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:13,520
some might so just keep that concept in

643
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:16,880
mind

644
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:21,600
over time the tracking of ttps

645
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:23,919
tends to show uh general adaptiveness so

646
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,039
secure barriers go up in one place

647
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:29,039
attackers will try

648
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:32,080
others give me a quick example of this

649
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:35,279
uh spearfishing worked a lot

650
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:38,000
uh for apt attackers and then at some

651
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:39,760
point it wasn't working quite as much

652
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,799
so they would try to become friends with

653
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:44,720
these people on say linkedin

654
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:45,840
and then pretty much is like hey you're

655
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,279
my friend can you

656
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,960
check out my resume and tell me what i

657
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:50,559
need to do i got a job

658
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,880
interview coming up tell me what looks

659
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:54,640
good

660
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,640
sure let me take a look at your resume

661
00:25:54,640 --> 00:26:00,159
okay here you go victim

662
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:01,679
here's a nice zero day in a pdf file

663
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:03,679
that

664
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:04,880
has now owned your system and your

665
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:07,360
organization

666
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:08,720
so that's like an example of how they

667
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:13,679
might adapt

668
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:16,960
to and take on other attack scenarios

669
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:20,000
so just remember that the whole

670
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:22,960
information acquisition mandate

671
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,679
and all of the associated tactics that

672
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,679
are used

673
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:30,559
by apt actors are being adopted

674
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:32,159
by non-apt attackers as well these

675
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:33,840
non-apt attackers

676
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:35,279
say such as ransomware attackers they

677
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:37,919
see what's working and they

678
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:39,600
they'll go ahead and try to use it so

679
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:42,559
defending against a potential

680
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:45,279
direct apt attack does have some

681
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:45,279
advantages

682
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:51,520
all right let's talk about some

683
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:55,120
mitigations

684
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:58,080
the basic security tech we have such as

685
00:26:55,120 --> 00:27:00,000
using two-factor authentication uh

686
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:01,679
automating our patching on endpoint

687
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,799
systems immediately

688
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:07,600
all that helps if i were to go

689
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:08,240
further in general terms i'd say not

690
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,400
using

691
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,600
windows and being an all remote

692
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:15,120
cloud-based company

693
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:18,799
also helps because that's not as common

694
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:21,840
and it creates a much harder target

695
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:24,240
than what the apt actors are going to be

696
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:27,279
used to

697
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:31,919
using uh things like uh google's

698
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:33,919
gcp uh amazon's aws this helps because

699
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:36,240
they've been hit themselves pretty hard

700
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:37,120
in the past and they do a lot of stuff

701
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,919
that happens

702
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:40,399
behind the scenes uh to help secure

703
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:43,200
things

704
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:44,399
so moving to that cloud environment if

705
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:48,480
you haven't already

706
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:51,919
uh is definitely a a big help just

707
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:54,399
for that alone uh get aggressive

708
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:56,320
use your red team and employ outside

709
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:59,840
pentest firms and

710
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:03,200
with extremely broad mandates

711
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:06,240
remember apt attackers cheat

712
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:08,240
and ask these people to cheat

713
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,440
on your systems if they're going to give

714
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:13,440
them a fair

715
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:15,919
shake fix everything they find

716
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:18,000
don't just check off the box of we did

717
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:19,840
the annual test and then

718
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,600
and then wait until next year and do it

719
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:23,679
again

720
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:25,440
uh test frequently with phishing

721
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:27,440
campaigns this is a

722
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,559
i think this is still the number one way

723
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:31,600
that uh

724
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:32,880
apt actors manage to gain a foothold is

725
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,279
through

726
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,640
uh stealing of credentials in some form

727
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:39,919
or fashion so

728
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:44,000
make sure that you do

729
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:46,799
fishing campaigns finally do not punish

730
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,600
users when when you get breached reward

731
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:49,840
them

732
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,880
when they report things even if it's a

733
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:54,240
false positive

734
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:57,360
okay they are not the security experts

735
00:28:54,240 --> 00:29:00,399
we are okay

736
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:03,760
so help them want to help you

737
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:06,320
and that will obviously help in so many

738
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,320
different ways

739
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:10,320
okay that's the end of the presentation

740
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,159
at this point

741
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,520
i want to thank you very much for your

742
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:16,640
attention

743
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:18,480
uh there is contact information uh where

744
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:20,880
you can reach me

745
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,840
and just reach out to me if you have any

746
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:24,640
questions

747
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:27,840
and i'll answer them as best i can and

748

[Music]

750
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:43,079
[Music]

751
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,600
you
