1
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:03,040
hi

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,200
my name is tim yardling i'm here to talk

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,200
about beetlejuice and the lessons that

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,720
we should have learned for ics

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,960
cybersecurity

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,759
so who am i well i'm a principal

7
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:15,519
research scientist at the university of

8
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:17,520
illinois urbana champaign

9
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,320
been in academia for about 14 years and

10
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,119
before that

11
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:24,640
i was in industry my focus is on ics

12
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,320
cybersecurity research

13
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,679
in a variety of different ways so this

14
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:30,960
presentation is going to be a bit

15
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,479
different than many that i give

16
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,480
and it's inspired and leverages content

17
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,440
from a website called screenrant.com

18
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,680
that highlighted the greatest lines from

19
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,559
beetlejuice

20
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,640
i'm going to take those top 15 lines and

21
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,399
relate those to the lessons that we

22
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,000
should have learned in ics cyber

23
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:46,960
security

24
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,079
but frankly haven't

25
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,079
so let's start off with uh with an oldie

26
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:53,600
but a goodie i know

27
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,000
just as much about the supernatural as i

28
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,079
do about interior design

29
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,559
well experts from other fields are

30
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:02,320
always willing to help us

31
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,760
they're always willing to come into

32
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,680
industrial control system security

33
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,520
but they need to be willing to

34
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,960
understand the domain that they're

35
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,640
operating in not just the domain that

36
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,080
they came from

37
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,200
the consequences in it systems

38
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,600
as an example are much different than

39
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,360
those in the industrial control system

40
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,080
space

41
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,920
so for instance in i.t systems where

42
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,320
business operations may be impacted

43
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,520
in ics well all of civilization could be

44
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,600
impacted by a particular attack or

45
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,560
outage

46
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,280
therefore the mindset that's used by the

47
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,119
people that operate in cyber security

48
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:36,799
and that are offering solutions

49
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:38,240
they have to approach the problem

50
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,479
differently frankly

51
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,399
we don't need people showing off we

52
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:44,399
don't need the best and brightest from

53
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:45,840
all over the place

54
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,360
what we need are people that are ready

55
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,439
to listen and understand the problem

56
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:50,240
space

57
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,640
roll up their sleeves and get to work

58
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,880
let's turn on the juice and see what

59
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,000
shakes loose

60
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,680
well here i'm going to relate this to

61
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,439
safety versus security

62
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,600
an industrial control system safety is a

63
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,520
number one priority

64
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,399
security however to many is really an

65
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,399
afterthought

66
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:13,440
well you know in some ways this could be

67
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,239
just that it's a realized danger with

68
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:17,120
safety

69
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,040
for instance blood people dying etc

70
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,800
versus the apparent danger in security

71
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,360
where well an attacker may compromise

72
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,760
something they may do something bad

73
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,519
but uh we're probably not going to lose

74
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,200
life we're probably not going to have

75
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,160
any real

76
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,120
problems overall there's also this

77
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,959
mindset that's conjured up of

78
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,760
well if it isn't broken then why bother

79
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,120
fixing it

80
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,920
well sorry to break this to you but it

81
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,280
is broken

82
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,080
just haven't realized it yet so let's

83
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,640
not wait for the cyber pearl harbor

84
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,959
let's get ahead of it by moving forward

85
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,200
now

86
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,239
it's show time one of my favorite quotes

87
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:01,680
from beetlejuice

88
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,519
well as you uh may recall from the movie

89
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,480
when you summoned beetlejuice he uh

90
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,120
frankly caused more harm than good

91
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,680
so for years industry has been calling

92
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,360
on the government to help

93
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,239
well sort of right so the government's

94
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,040
here now

95
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,640
they have piles of money but guess what

96
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,599
they expect some fast action is that

97
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:26,080
what we

98
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,000
really wanted in industrial control

99
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,840
systems did we want to move

100
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,599
fast did we need to move fast

101
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,560
it's unclear is the government there to

102
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,200
help

103
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,440
yes are we getting more help than we

104
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,879
need more regulation

105
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,799
more spotlights more attention maybe

106
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,280
maybe that's causing more harm than good

107
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,640
maybe that's a distraction

108
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,720
i'm trying to cut down myself well

109
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,879
let's talk about trying to change too

110
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,720
late right

111
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,879
the need for increased cyber security

112
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:03,519
has been pressing for a number of years

113
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,599
right this isn't a problem that just

114
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,920
suddenly appeared and popped up and and

115
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,519
were like caught off guard and have

116
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:10,480
nothing

117
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,519
uh to say for it or do right let's use

118
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,599
the electric sector as an example

119
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,680
we've been working in that space for a

120
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,720
long time

121
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,680
trying to focus on and build out the the

122
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,360
cyber security provisions

123
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,639
the frameworks the regulations etc

124
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,360
to really truly enforce and improve the

125
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,759
cyber security posture of that sector

126
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,759
some sectors like nuclear and the

127
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:35,600
electric sector are quite advanced

128
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,880
already in their

129
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,840
in their security uh awareness in their

130
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,960
security

131
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,639
posture etc why are the other domains so

132
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:45,919
far behind

133
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,560
many of them are not trying to really do

134
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,520
anything in security yet

135
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,759
are they trying to change too late it's

136
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,440
not that the problem's any different for

137
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,040
them

138
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,240
it's not like water isn't important it's

139
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,600
not like

140
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,680
uh manufacturing isn't being targeted

141
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,639
so why are they waiting i've seen the

142
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,680
exorcist about 167 times and it keeps

143
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,560
getting funnier

144
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,600
every single time i see it well

145
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,280
let's continue that quote a little bit

146
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,960
more now

147
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,840
what do you think you think i'm

148
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,680
qualified this is beetlejuice talking to

149
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,000
to him being summoned as an exorcist to

150
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,880
help in

151
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,720
in this scenario well guess what the ics

152
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,880
sector already has what it takes to

153
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,000
succeed

154
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,400
what they need to to increase their

155
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,840
cyber security posture

156
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,720
to defend their systems those people

157
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,680
exist

158
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,600
people that are there already need it

159
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,400
yeah there's training that's needed

160
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,520
yeah change is also needed right

161
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,199
we have to change how we approach the

162
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,120
problem we have to change how we address

163
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,880
things we have to change how we think

164
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,479
about it but

165
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,520
frankly you can do this the people in

166
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,560
the sector

167
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,360
can solve these problems they just have

168
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,120
to put their mind to it

169
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,199
and maybe get a little help on the side

170
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,199
too

171
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,400
i'm the ghost with the most babe well

172
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,120
let's talk about that right anyone that

173
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,520
shows up and spouts buzzwords makes

174
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,600
claims and pitches their solutions as

175
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,720
the one all be

176
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,520
all silver bullet that you have to have

177
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,720
guess what

178
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,360
don't buy into that there are a lot of

179
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,639
steps that you need to do

180
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,280
there is no single silva silver bullet

181
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,000
there is no

182
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,080
one product that's going to save you

183
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,440
there is no one

184
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,680
thing that you can do and all of a

185
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,960
sudden you're better

186
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,120
right you need a broad and comprehensive

187
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,400
approach to security

188
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,840
you need solutions that are

189
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,600
complementary of each other that

190
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,240
integrate together that work together to

191
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:50,639
have

192
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,479
that visibility that you need that

193
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,160
response that you need the detection

194
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,680
that you need etc

195
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,000
and then most importantly you need to

196
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,840
use those tools in the way that they

197
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,080
were intended to be used once you have

198
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,319
them it's not just oh install this and

199
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,080
everything is better if i never look at

200
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:06,639
it again

201
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:09,680
right you have to be able to use and

202
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,400
dedicate

203
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,520
staff and people to being uh to taking

204
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,240
these tools

205
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,400
and leveraging them to to your benefit

206
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,680
never trust the living well

207
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,560
let's talk about trust right consultants

208
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,440
guess what

209
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,639
they can help the vendors they can help

210
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:31,680
the government they can help but

211
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,800
remember you run the show

212
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,520
it's not that they are going to dictate

213
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,960
what you should do

214
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,440
you need to prioritize things you need

215
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,599
to understand what the implications are

216
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:45,520
you need to convey to them

217
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,520
what your priorities are what your needs

218
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,479
are what the business risks are etc

219
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,960
help yourself commit to doing what

220
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,240
you're willing to keep

221
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,479
doing not just what they tell you to do

222
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:58,720
right you need to be sustainable in what

223
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,560
you implement you can't just set it and

224
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,440
forget it

225
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,360
but you have to trust them too they're

226
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,599
not necessarily going to give you

227
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:07,919
perfectly sound advice they're not going

228
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:08,960
to to

229
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,120
as an example a vendor is not going to

230
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,000
try

231
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,560
to sell you some other vendors product

232
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,160
right they're going to pitch their stuff

233
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,199
they're going to

234
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,120
to respond in the way that their

235
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,240
capabilities are

236
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,199
are addressing right so look broader

237
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:24,560
understand what that is

238
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,039
take that as input and then decide from

239
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,840
there what you want to do with it

240
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,440
are you the knight of the living dead

241
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,880
under there well

242
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,240
let's talk about regulation and

243
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,958
compliance right many people hide behind

244
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,640
this regulation of compliance but

245
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,440
frankly

246
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,519
there's the argument that says oh

247
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,360
compliance isn't security

248
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,440
and security isn't compliance etc right

249
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,680
regulation and compliance doesn't really

250
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,720
help you

251
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,480
it does enforcing or

252
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,920
forcing you to do something but

253
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,959
it's not really the the end goal

254
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,279
right it's a it's a stopping point along

255
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:04,080
the way

256
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,600
and let's talk a little bit about

257
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,000
attackers right the bad guys don't

258
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,200
care if you are compliant with xyz

259
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,959
standard whatever that may be

260
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,640
right they don't get scared by that it

261
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,440
doesn't deter

262
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,519
them it actually gives them a bit of a

263
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,760
road map they know what you're required

264
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,000
to

265
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,399
implement and well they can work around

266
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,000
that they can use that to their

267
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,279
advantage in some way shape or form

268
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:32,399
well the other thing is look even if you

269
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,320
are compliant let's use the electric

270
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,320
sector again as an example

271
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,399
the electric sector has regulation

272
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:39,600
called nerc sip

273
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,959
right and that that's great but

274
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,720
that doesn't mean that just because you

275
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,000
are sip compliant

276
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,760
you are impenetrable by an attacker or

277
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,480
that

278
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,720
you're not going to be compromised in

279
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,240
some way shape or form

280
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,959
it doesn't mean that you are secure it

281
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:58,640
means that you've done some of the best

282
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,399
practices you've done the minimum

283
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,079
recommendations to

284
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:03,760
uh that are enforced upon you for

285
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,680
regulation but

286
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,519
everything underneath well that could

287
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,640
still be quite ugly

288
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,000
i'd rather talk about day o

289
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,680
day right so let's let's talk about this

290
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,720
and flip it a bit

291
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,360
let's talk about odays instead of day o

292
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:21,760
right

293
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,040
so the push for finding zero days is

294
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,160
well interesting right i'm all for the

295
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,079
efforts that explore and remediate

296
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,320
vulnerabilities in systems right

297
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,279
be that products be that platforms etc

298
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,200
but does it really move the needle

299
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,240
well let's talk about ics gear right so

300
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,040
it has long patch and service lifetimes

301
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:43,440
right

302
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,120
it's out there in the field for a long

303
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,600
time they don't patch regularly

304
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,440
they can't because it affects the

305
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,360
operations of the systems

306
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,360
not all things either that we discover

307
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,839
are fixable industrial control systems

308
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:57,920
sometimes the the hardware is just

309
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:58,880
physically not

310
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,680
capable of being able to implement

311
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,560
something

312
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,160
more comprehensive than what it does um

313
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,120
to fix fundamental problems that that

314
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,320
are inherent in

315
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,600
the firmware or the boot loader or the

316
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,440
architecture itself

317
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,680
and sometimes these things well they

318
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,800
can't be fixed

319
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,640
so if we find them and publish about

320
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,079
them

321
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:26,079
what impact is there from that well it

322
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,160
identifies a vulnerability but if that

323
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,440
vulnerability can't be fixed in the

324
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,839
products are we really moving forward

325
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:33,680
or are we actually hurting ourselves a

326
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,040
bit more

327
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,160
in my opinion our energy should probably

328
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,240
be more focused on layered defenses

329
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,399
on closing attack vectors on making it

330
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,560
so the attacker can't get into the

331
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,079
system in the first place

332
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:50,160
to hit those end device targets that

333
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,560
you're identifying zero days in

334
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,040
right the other thing is well decreasing

335
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,639
the time to detection across the

336
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:58,079
organization right

337
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,320
so attackers can be on your system

338
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,279
forever

339
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,760
poking around prodding looking for any

340
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,480
potential misstep that that you may have

341
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,079
what if you could detect them sooner

342
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:09,519
what if you could stop them

343
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:12,240
way early on and know that they're there

344
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,800
and eliminate that from happening

345
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,639
to prevent their pivoting from further

346
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,320
down into the system so that they don't

347
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,920
get to the point where they can exploit

348
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,600
those zero days that that are being

349
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,800
found on systems

350
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,560
now i'm not saying that finding zero

351
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,480
days is worthless finding zero days is

352
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,519
very valuable

353
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,600
it's great to have those things fixed in

354
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,639
in the systems

355
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:33,360
it's great to identify detection and

356
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,160
prevention

357
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,760
techniques and and filters and and uh

358
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,320
and

359
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,440
other um mechanisms by which you can

360
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,200
identify these happening in your network

361
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,000
right

362
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,160
but ultimately you have to be able to

363
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,760
stop them you have to be able to patch

364
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,519
them you have to be able to remediate

365
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:50,480
there's all sorts of different

366
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,560
approaches to this right but

367
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,800
first step is well being able to detect

368
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,160
right you can't stop something you don't

369
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,600
know that's happening you can't stop

370
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,560
somebody that you don't know is there

371
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:04,839
i myself am strange and unusual

372
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:07,839
well let's talk about that a little bit

373
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:11,279
right everyone always says that well

374
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:14,399
we're special we're different people

375
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,320
don't understand what it is

376
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,440
right they don't uh they don't get the

377
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,480
domain

378
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,920
or their i.t we're ot right

379
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,399
well guess what you have what it takes

380
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,760
to see through the craft

381
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,680
and solve the problems you don't need to

382
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,200
get wrapped around an axle

383
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,639
arguing about it versus ot or

384
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,800
whose system is more important or whose

385
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,720
policy should be applied right

386
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,399
and there's a lot of experts out there

387
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:41,760
pushing their views

388
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,760
pushing their opinions some of those are

389
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,079
well merited some of those are very well

390
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:47,839
respected some of those are well

391
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:48,720
grounded

392
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,079
but others are not right there are also

393
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:52,959
gaps

394
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:55,199
in knowledge in understanding and in

395
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:56,240
skills in

396
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,120
every sector on both sides of the fence

397
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,959
attacker methodologies are always

398
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,800
changing defender methodologies are

399
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,079
always changing

400
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:07,680
what is possible is always changing

401
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,839
but guess what we can still solve the

402
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,760
problem we can still take steps forward

403
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,600
we can still work on the things that we

404
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,120
need to work on

405
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,680
it's okay right so you take that input

406
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,680
from those experts you ask the questions

407
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,519
that you need to ask that you're afraid

408
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:22,240
to ask

409
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,639
you ask those questions you get them to

410
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:25,600
clarify you

411
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,760
explain what your requirements are what

412
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,440
your risks are the things that you're

413
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,000
worried about

414
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,399
the things that keep you up at night the

415
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,320
things you want to protect against in

416
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,279
your sector

417
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:38,160
the threats that you feel you have and

418
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,240
use them as a sounding board

419
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,240
they may come up with novel things they

420
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,680
may not

421
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,680
but then whatever input they provide you

422
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,440
you need to decide what that means to

423
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,600
you how you want to take that input

424
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,680
how you want to apply it and how you

425
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,680
want to leverage it and use it moving

426
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,079
forward

427
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,560
ah don't mind her she's still upset that

428
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,040
somebody dropped a house on her sister

429
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,399
well guess what

430
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,480
holding on to the past instead of

431
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,240
embracing the future

432
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,360
is all throughout industrial control

433
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,399
systems

434
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:16,000
across the board every domain is digging

435
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,480
in their heels in some way shape or form

436
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,360
and trying to prevent change right

437
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,320
change is

438
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,519
hard but guess what it's inevitable the

439
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:27,600
sectors themselves are changing

440
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,959
digitization modernization demands

441
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,480
changing from users

442
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,120
let's rego to the electric sector 50

443
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,000
years ago

444
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,480
there was no real things such as

445
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,480
distributed energy resources people

446
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,800
didn't have solar cells on their house

447
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,160
and wind turbines

448
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,160
uh deployed across the country and

449
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,000
generators that were

450
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,040
firing up uh in all sorts of residential

451
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,160
neighbors to

452
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,880
neighborhoods to provide power back to

453
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,600
the grid

454
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,759
right it was you had large generation

455
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,279
and it was what it was

456
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,440
but we're seeing that distributed energy

457
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,519
resources are changing the composition

458
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:05,759
of the grid and the grid has to adapt

459
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:09,279
plugable hybrids electric vehicles uh

460
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:11,600
modern electronics all sorts of things

461
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,480
are causing

462
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,680
changes even the mix of what generation

463
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,560
is it used to be

464
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,519
big spinning wheels with all sorts of

465
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:22,000
momentum and energy built up into that

466
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,759
but now you have peaker plants and you

467
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:25,839
have nuclear power and you have

468
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:29,120
you have coal and you have natural gas

469
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,399
and you have wind turbines and you have

470
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:31,440
solar and you have

471
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,279
all sorts of different mixes of

472
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,199
generation sources that are all doing

473
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:37,040
different things

474
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,759
the grid the domain the operating

475
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:40,800
paradigm

476
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,000
how close you operate towards uh the

477
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,199
the peak of efficiency all of that

478
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:50,560
is changing the ability to have

479
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,560
real-time communications

480
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,600
the the um quality

481
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,199
or complexity of of the system

482
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:02,639
itself right let's stop pushing against

483
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,880
that change let's stop pushing so hard

484
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,119
wasting so much energy

485
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:10,559
on trying to change what's coming to us

486
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,959
trying to push it away right and instead

487
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,240
we need to embrace it

488
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,799
we need to look at what it can do for us

489
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,319
we need to understand

490
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:21,039
how we need to adjust our mindset the

491
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:23,599
way we do business the way we operate

492
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,679
to accommodate it because that change is

493
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,679
coming we're not going to stop it

494
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,840
right and then we have to simplify the

495
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,200
approach that we take

496
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,840
we have to take what we look at as this

497
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,600
extremely complex and hard

498
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,080
problem and break it down into chunks

499
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,840
simplify the approach

500
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,120
go towards what we can improve work on

501
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,640
the things that we can do

502
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,960
and then go do it right don't just talk

503
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,240
about it do it

504
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,039
take a step do that one thing that you

505
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:51,440
know

506
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,520
will help you the one thing that you

507
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,120
know will move you forward

508
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,520
and start there and then go to the next

509
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,360
and then go to the next and keep doing

510
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,360
that

511
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,760
thanks i've been feeling a little flat

512
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,480
well

513
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,039
you know what he was run over by a semi

514
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:08,799
right he has the right to feel

515
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:12,240
flat but guess what we're getting run

516
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,400
over by semis every day right you've

517
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,640
seen in the media you've seen

518
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,840
uh all sorts of of reports

519
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:23,440
and and federal spotlights being shined

520
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:23,919
on

521
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:27,280
and on problems and the discussions

522
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,679
about increased regulation etc

523
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:33,520
none of these are really helping you

524
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,480
they're distractions right you know what

525
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,720
you need to do

526
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,640
you know you need your systems to be

527
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,240
more secure you know

528
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,240
that there are problems you know where

529
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,280
those problems are

530
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,919
right you've run these systems for years

531
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:48,960
stay true to that

532
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,200
understand what can impact those systems

533
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,799
and work towards solving that

534
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,360
and guess what it's okay not to be

535
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,559
perfect

536
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:59,520
but we have to move forward we can't

537
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,600
just sit there stagnant we can't dig

538
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,559
in our heels we have to be willing to

539
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:06,880
fix the problem

540
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,960
and so don't worry about what everyone

541
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,160
is yelling at you

542
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,720
right they're not telling you anything

543
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,960
that you don't already know

544
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,080
you just have to react you have to move

545
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:18,799
forward

546
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:22,799
you have to work on those problems

547
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,840
so stay on course work towards those

548
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:26,880
goals that you have

549
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,280
evaluate and assess the goals you've set

550
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,600
and make sure they're set correctly

551
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,760
right it's the worst thing in the world

552
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,360
to be heading towards

553
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,480
a destination and that destination isn't

554
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,000
even there when you get there

555
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,360
right so stay on course but evaluate

556
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,559
where you're going

557
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,320
understand that the world is changing

558
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,919
and make sure that you are working

559
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:51,200
towards addressing that right

560
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,520
and if you're not on course guess what

561
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,559
adapt and

562
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:57,679
adjust based on your priorities on your

563
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:58,160
needs

564
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,760
on your plans on where your domain your

565
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,400
sector

566
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,960
is going

567
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,919
so what about the government right

568
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:09,760
they're dumping a bunch of money into

569
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,240
this

570
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,960
well guess what they want to remodel

571
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:13,360
right

572
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,280
they want to change things a little

573
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,200
gasoline a blow torch

574
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,880
got it no problem right so big spending

575
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,600
is coming to quickly solve the problem

576
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:23,919
but

577
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:26,480
is that what we need do we need big

578
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,559
spending do we need a ton of money

579
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:31,679
well yes cyber security isn't cheap

580
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:34,000
some of these changes are not cheap

581
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,440
right

582
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,440
but we don't need to tear the whole

583
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,840
system down to be more secure

584
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:43,120
we can't just adopt all these brand new

585
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,640
shiny objects that are out there that

586
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,039
are

587
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:48,000
going to solve all of our problems right

588
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,400
just adopting that isn't going to be

589
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,640
secure we're not going to fix the

590
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,840
problem by that

591
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,600
we'll just change the understanding of

592
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,360
the problem more than likely

593
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,720
right so improvement does come with time

594
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,360
right and while there is a time and a

595
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,159
place

596
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:06,159
where we tear things out and we say look

597
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:08,159
i'm putting in this whiz-bang new gadget

598
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:10,320
and it's going to solve all my problems

599
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,000
critical infrastructure really isn't

600
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,480
that right we have to make incremental

601
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,080
improvement we have to use

602
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,640
layered defenses we have to move forward

603
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,159
in a variety of ways

604
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:22,159
and it's not rip and replace right rip

605
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:24,880
and replace is not the solution here

606
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,320
we're not going to knock down all the

607
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,000
walls we're not going to change

608
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,440
everything right

609
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,120
we're going to build upon what we have

610
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,880
and we're going to do it in a smart

611
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,880
and intelligent and deliberate way

612
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,960
what's the good of being a ghost if you

613
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,400
can't frighten people

614
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,400
away well guess what the hackers don't

615
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,080
care about your military grade

616
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,480
encryption your compliance with xyz

617
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,000
standards etc

618
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,559
right using those big buzzwords putting

619
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:56,880
out press releases about all the cyber

620
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,480
security work you've done

621
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,280
etc isn't going to help you it's not

622
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,480
going to scare them away

623
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,039
either right some may take it as a

624
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:06,480
challenge be like oh you think you're

625
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:06,880
hot

626
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,919
well guess what i took you down right

627
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:12,720
so let's talk about what people use for

628
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,240
reasoning right cyber security

629
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,760
frameworks are a good example

630
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,159
they're useful right but they're only

631
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:19,679
useful when they're used in the way they

632
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:20,000
were

633
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,360
intended they aren't solutions

634
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,080
and really what they are is just

635
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:26,880
scaffolding

636
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,440
right it helps you decide what you want

637
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,080
to build

638
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,480
how you want to go about it but you

639
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,640
still have to do it

640
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,640
same thing with with other frameworks

641
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,000
out there that we

642
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
use to reason about what attackers are

643
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,320
doing or how we respond to them

644
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,000
things like you know miters attack

645
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,240
framework etc look if you protect

646
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:46,720
against

647
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,480
everything in mitre's attack framework

648
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,799
are you going to be in a good position

649
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:53,120
probably right but there's all sorts of

650
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,440
things that aren't captured there yet

651
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,679
there are all sorts of things that could

652
00:22:57,679 --> 00:22:59,360
affect you etc

653
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,280
and is it the best way to go about

654
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,360
saying oh well let's reason about what

655
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,760
uh what an attacker can do and

656
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,799
prevent it maybe right you could also

657
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:10,640
look at inl cce

658
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,799
you could look at at all hazards uh

659
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:16,559
approaches you could look at eppery's

660
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,480
approach you can look at all sorts of

661
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,000
different approaches to the problem

662
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,480
but really what matters in the end is

663
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,320
what are you scared of

664
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,320
what impacts your business what impacts

665
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,840
your domain the most

666
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,960
what is your worst nightmare right and

667
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,400
how do you make sure that that worst

668
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,840
nightmare doesn't happen

669
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,440
and then once you know that that one

670
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,440
won't happen let's move on to what's the

671
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,640
next worst thing

672
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,080
right logic will prevail

673
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,799
right we don't need to just invest in

674
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:46,159
whiz-bang gadgets to invest in

675
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:47,279
whispering gadgets

676
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:49,600
we need to understand what our risks are

677
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,279
we need to reason about those risks and

678
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:52,640
that's where the frameworks help

679
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,799
