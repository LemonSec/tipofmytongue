1
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,360
good afternoon my name

2
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,200
is john bambonek here presenting

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,599
virtually adventures in pro bono digital

4
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:16,160
forensics

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,800
cases on some of the cases i've worked

6
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:19,359
on uh

7
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,000
in the last couple of years that i've

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,680
had some time here for

9
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,279
uh to work on some extra things and

10
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:27,760
we'll talk about that here in a second

11
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,359
as you know it's all pre-recorded if you

12
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:30,960
have questions and discord as

13
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,558
as we go along i'm happy to answer them

14
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:34,719
or send direct messages or if you happen

15
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,079
to be in las vegas

16
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:38,320
i want to catch up for drinks or coffee

17
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,840
i am i am available

18
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,520
uh certainly to talk about things that

19
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,800
we're going to get at the very end my

20
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,719
call to action

21
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,640
so a little bit about myself i am

22
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,239
president of my own company bambinac

23
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,160
labs primarily selling

24
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,840
threat intelligence fees but i do some

25
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,840
other consulting as well but it's my

26
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,719
company so i'm

27
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,039
fully independent uh for the time being

28
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:58,399
i am getting my phd

29
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,879
in cyber security machine learning but

30
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:02,640
what's relevant for this talk

31
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,519
is i helped develop a curriculum and

32
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,200
taught for about three years digital

33
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,600
forensics at the university of illinois

34
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,080
i actually don't have any current

35
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,680
certifications in forensics but i've

36
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,479
taught it

37
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:18,159
uh and have used that experience as uh

38
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,479
my gateway into getting judges to

39
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,159
approve me as an expert witness because

40
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:23,520
i've developed curriculum that others

41
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,560
have used and

42
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,720
some of my students have gone on to be

43
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,479
law enforcement officers and

44
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:30,960
how i teach the course actually you'll

45
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,560
see artifacts of how i present

46
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,479
this talk and and what i focus on

47
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,479
so uh as an aside right i am in the

48
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:43,759
lucky position to be self-employed so uh

49
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:44,240
and

50
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,479
basically a lifestyle company uh some of

51
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:47,759
you may be involved with startups

52
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,119
looking for multiples and that kind of

53
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:50,240
thing but you know when you're in a

54
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,600
boutique lifestyle company

55
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,360
it there's a lot of freedom that comes

56
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,600
along with it to pursue things

57
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,640
uh that you find interesting uh

58
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,240
versus things that you just have to do

59
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,079
because your boss tells you to do

60
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,640
so between that and the pandemic i used

61
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,200
to be part of the security vacation club

62
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,360
i'm sure that i've seen some of you uh

63
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,239
participants

64
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:12,160
you know around the united states around

65
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,640
the world uh that we when we used to

66
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,800
do that kind of a thing and not spending

67
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,160
time on planes

68
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,000
especially for international travel is

69
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,640
freed up a lot more time as well

70
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,760
so i have more time to devote to

71
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,840
non-income producing activities

72
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,520
which goes to my last point is that i

73
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,440
think at

74
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,760
this time in our society and the way

75
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,959
things are going

76
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:36,640
that we should get back and to use our

77
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,080
skills there's

78
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,680
we know like there's a cyber security

79
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,440
job shortage and we can talk about why

80
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,800
that is

81
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,239
but more importantly there's lots of

82
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:46,480
things that are lots of people in groups

83
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,000
that aren't getting protected right and

84
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,040
not just even in

85
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,120
the digital forensics or law enforcement

86
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,400
sense but

87
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,360
uh you know i've talked to ptas at

88
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,879
schools of parents who are trying to

89
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,159
protect their kids

90
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:59,920
and they have very little guidance i

91
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,760
mean they can google it uh you know

92
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,319
there's

93
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,480
any number of groups of people who have

94
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,760
cyber security needs

95
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,400
that are going unmet because they're

96
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,760
just folk who don't have

97
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,400
infinite amount of money to pay people

98
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,000
uh and as much as possible we should

99
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,440
give back obviously we have to feed our

100
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,080
families

101
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,640
and work but for the extent that some of

102
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,760
us can do that

103
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,200
i really feel strongly that we should

104
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,519
should do that and a spoiler alert at

105
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:26,720
the end of this talk i'm going to be

106
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,280
asking for your help in some of this

107
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,480
so here's a one-hour talk in

108
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,799
in one comment that really underlines

109
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,480
the premise of everything

110
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,080
uh i don't know if any of you've seen

111
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,440
this before you probably heard the

112
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,319
expression

113
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:41,840
uh i actually come from a family of

114
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,840
lawyers and judges well actually lawyers

115
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,599
judges and petty criminals

116
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,640
so i was built for cyber security but i

117
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,120
also

118
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,760
have a lot of legal uh a lot of inherent

119
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,799
legal knowledge

120
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,840
uh and grew up on lawyer jokes um

121
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,000
so here's an older one you tell black

122
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,280
and white right you know you have a

123
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,640
pretty good case mr pitkin

124
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,760
how much justice can you afford right is

125
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,159
we have a very romanticized idea

126
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,319
of the legal system not just a criminal

127
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,400
justice system but in civil court too

128
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,720
that hey each side can fight it out

129
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,080
they've got their lawyers

130
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,920
and you know you you you get to the

131
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,440
point to see who wins

132
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,759
well there's a lot more that goes into

133
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,839
that right uh you know

134
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,360
my own personal experience of spending

135
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,120
lots of money on lawyers that

136
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,639
um you know a lot of your outcomes

137
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,759
in the court system depends on how much

138
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,680
resources you bring to bear

139
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,080
and how much uh you can spend and not

140
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,000
just in money but in time and expertise

141
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,680
so here's the agenda the talk you know

142
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,800
we're going to talk about the legal

143
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,000
system a little bit

144
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,120
because uh usually what i try to focus

145
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,479
on and really beat home when i teach

146
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:49,440
forensics

147
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,600
is the legal aspects of what we're doing

148
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,800
uh you know if you're using

149
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,919
n case or any or celebrate the tools do

150
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:57,440
a lot of the work for you you need to

151
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,120
understand what they do

152
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,160
but the things that really can

153
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,639
impact the case are things that

154
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,560
don't aren't connected to technology

155
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,680
right there's uh

156
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,840
you know integrity of evidence in chain

157
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,840
of custody uh some of these things that

158
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,720
if you don't get right

159
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,199
is there goes your case right then and

160
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,320
there and then one of the case i'm going

161
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,120
to talk about

162
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,600
does deal with specifically of integrity

163
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,720
of evidence

164
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,880
uh we're going to deal with three cases

165
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,240
specifically that i've been

166
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,080
dealt with in a potpourri of other kind

167
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,479
of matters uh that touched on the legal

168
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:30,960
system

169
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,680
and a call to action at the end as i did

170
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,080
uh

171
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,919
mentioned before so there's a difference

172
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,639
between

173
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,639
incident response and digital forensics

174
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,639
right it's possible to respond to an

175
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:43,440
incident

176
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,360
without really doing the work of

177
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,560
forensics

178
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,960
you know at a superficial level right it

179
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,479
seems the same thing right

180
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:52,479
how the attackers get in how do we kick

181
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,880
them out how do we move forward

182
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,960
the difference between ir and forensics

183
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,280
is there's a lot of overhead

184
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,759
in preparing evidence for use in court

185
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:02,960
now

186
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,120
very few of us has ever been called to a

187
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,479
witness stand

188
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,680
but the key focus of forensics

189
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,319
including the latin origin of the word

190
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:13,280
is

191
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,280
that it's doing the work to prepare for

192
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,039
trials and to prepare

193
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:19,440
evidence which leads to lots of overhead

194
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,240
i i can

195
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,919
i can do incident response without

196
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:23,840
locking hard drives in a safe

197
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,840
um you really can't do that with digital

198
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,199
forensics

199
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,759
uh and like i said a very key point that

200
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,440
deals with some of the imbalances

201
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,360
inherent in the legal system is

202
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,680
um you know for those of you who are in

203
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,199
discord i'd be interested to see how

204
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:38,080
many of you have ever

205
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,319
been on a witness stand after having

206
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:41,840
done a forensic report

207
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,919
you know there's probably a lot of

208
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,680
forensic examiners listening to this

209
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,479
talk

210
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,319
that you know have written tons of

211
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,160
reports but

212
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,759
a lot of our work and a lot of the

213
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,919
criminal matters i work on deal with

214
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:57,199
overseas suspects right we know going in

215
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,440
there probably isn't going to be a trial

216
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,080
um you know i've had clients

217
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,919
and and sat them down i guess i'm not a

218
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:05,360
great businessman in this way where i've

219
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:05,840
said

220
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,440
okay you're dealing with ransomware you

221
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,680
want to sit there and try to do a tort

222
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,960
case to recover

223
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,120
your losses or whatever it's like listen

224
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,800
we can do the overhead of doing

225
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,680
forensics

226
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,479
you know i'll run the clock if you want

227
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:19,599
but bear in mind

228
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:20,960
we might not ever be able to get this

229
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,720
person to trial or probably not so

230
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,160
you're going to be paying me money

231
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,319
but i'm not going to be able to give you

232
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,400
a return on that

233
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,280
um so uh you know there's lots of that

234
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,560
that goes into it

235
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,479
uh a lot of people doing forensics work

236
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:35,759
for large large

237
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,000
ir firms or well-resourced and

238
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,800
enterprises

239
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,720
um you know i'm not sure it wouldn't

240
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,319
surprise me that they're people with law

241
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,160
enforcement agencies uh

242
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,160
that might be listening to this talk but

243
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,160
we have tools right you know

244
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,720
you've got encase or celebrate right you

245
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,800
know kind of the gold standards of tools

246
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,000
you know that you have to work with i

247
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,199
doubt very many

248
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:58,879
there are no forensic examiners in a

249
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,240
small business there probably isn't a

250
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,360
security guy

251
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,199
right you know there isn't there isn't a

252
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:04,639
forensic person you know

253
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:08,400
at your local pta or the

254
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,400
nursing home right the elderly have a

255
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,160
lot of unique cyber threats directed at

256
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,039
them

257
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,199
um you know if you think about business

258
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:16,319
email compromise

259
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:17,440
right a lot of people talk about

260
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,919
ransomware but business email compromise

261
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:20,400
or

262
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,680
more specifically romance scams there's

263
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,520
nobody to protect a victim against a

264
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,680
romance scam or or to do the work to

265
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,280
bring a prosecution

266
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,080
and that's billions of dollars lost from

267
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,320
that

268
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:35,919
and like i said the tools do a lot of

269
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,399
the heavy lifting for us

270
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,599
i think it's important to understand

271
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:40,958
what the tools are doing the science

272
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,958
behind the tools

273
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,800
that certainly is going to help you if

274
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,800
you're ever cross-examined

275
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,040
but it also leads to a degree of

276
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,320
laziness

277
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,880
um at the end of the day like i said

278
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,000
when i produce a forensic

279
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,120
report uh i want to stand by behind all

280
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:57,519
of it

281
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,320
you know not just some of it right if uh

282
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,760
whatever tool i'm using says

283
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,720
x i want to be able to explain in detail

284
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,320
why it says sex

285
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,000
if i'm cross-examined because that's my

286
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,360
credibility on the line

287
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,920
you know i can't say well this tool said

288
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,560
it

289
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,800
um you have to explain and understand

290
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,240
the science behind it we're going to

291
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,519
talk about credibility

292
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,080
a little bit more but this notion is

293
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:20,880
that so

294
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,200
very rarely is our work ever challenged

295
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,399
in court

296
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,640
uh even if even if the matter ends up in

297
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,760
court

298
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,320
there can be a little bit of not

299
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,360
laziness but

300
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,920
uh of kind of rustiness right we're not

301
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,519
used to being scrutinized and when you

302
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:36,399
know things

303
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,720
aren't going to be challenged they're

304
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,320
you're not as on guard you're not as

305
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,200
thinking through

306
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,920
the underlying stuff and in some matters

307
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,800
it might not matter

308
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,560
you know you may have it if you're doing

309
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,480
forensics for an hr investigation of

310
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,760
somebody doing something they shouldn't

311
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,440
with corporate assets

312
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,519
you know but in another subset of

313
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:54,720
matters the outcomes

314
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,080
really do have an outsized impact on on

315
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,399
victims and defendants and we're going

316
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,240
to talk about a couple of those

317
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,560
so in the united states and kind of most

318
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,720
of the british common law systems anyway

319
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,480
have this notion of an adversarial legal

320
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:10,959
system

321
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:13,200
right and that somewhat romanticized

322
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,000
each side presents their case to a judge

323
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,240
or to convince a jury or a judge if it's

324
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,200
bench trial

325
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,600
who is uh the trier of fact will decide

326
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,240
you win

327
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,399
or you win right and both people get

328
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,560
their say they get to call their experts

329
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,320
they get to cross-examine each other's

330
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,079
experts and witnesses

331
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:31,600
uh and they can get court orders to

332
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,279
compel evidence production right it

333
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:34,560
sounds all very fair

334
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,880
right if you're ever uh in a criminal

335
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,720
case you want to do all these things

336
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,720
you know i don't want to just have the

337
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,000
cop say yeah he

338
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,160
he shot that guy i want to be able to

339
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,480
see the body cam footage or cctv or

340
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,920
ballistics reports i want to be able to

341
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,680
get my own ballistics reports

342
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,880
you know we've seen a lot of how this

343
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,720
system works out and plays out and some

344
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,320
of the high profile cases we've seen

345
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,760
with black lives matter and others right

346
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,360
those are probably the most public

347
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,880
trials that we've had in the past couple

348
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,760
of years with

349
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,079
derek chauvin and the like where uh you

350
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:06,800
know the

351
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,240
the police had their experts and their

352
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,839
forensic examiner uh

353
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,160
their uh the coroner who said uh you

354
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,000
know george floyd died for acts

355
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,160
uh others brought in a different uh

356
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,600
corner or medical

357
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,079
medical experts who then uh said no it

358
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:20,800
was why

359
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,920
right so that's a system that

360
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,519
works but only in a certain

361
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:30,320
certain case right the underlying ex

362
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,760
assumption

363
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,399
is that both sides are near parity and

364
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:34,959
it's not

365
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:37,120
money necessarily money is important

366
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,480
that's a component

367
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,800
you know but it's expertise right the

368
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,320
only person who can question

369
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,160
a coroner is another medical examiner

370
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,839
lawyers may be able to ask some

371
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,320
questions but lawyers need to know a lot

372
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,519
of other stuff

373
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:54,079
than just technical areas of specific

374
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:55,519
classes of evidence

375
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,120
right you know there are areas that

376
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,560
lawyers are experts and they should be

377
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,360
experts in

378
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,800
and for that matter there's there's

379
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,800
things police need to be experts in

380
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,320
beyond just the handling of a certain

381
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,320
class of evidence if you think about

382
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,240
what the fbi or police officers or

383
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,440
detectives need to do

384
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,800
there's there's a whole lot that they

385
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,720
need to be trained and experts on

386
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,600
and know natively versus us right who

387
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,680
are experts i can focus on digital

388
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,480
forensics

389
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,399
i can give a talk on it you all can

390
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:21,760
attend to talk on it

391
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,320
right there's lots of police officers

392
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,639
with celebrities and other tools who do

393
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,399
the work of forensics

394
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,720
but don't go to talks like this or don't

395
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,279
have the same professional

396
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:36,720
training and experience that we do

397
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,360
time is a very important component uh

398
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,800
especially when people are on the line

399
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,440
and need

400
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,079
our people's lives are on the line and

401
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:44,480
uh

402
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,000
you know they're looking for certain

403
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,920
results in a certain time frame

404
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,360
um or when the government acts and

405
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,920
you know you're on the wrong side of the

406
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:54,959
the government's

407
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:57,360
law enforcement arm there's also

408
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,639
emotional energy

409
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,959
right is we're going to talk about this

410
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:01,760
briefly

411
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,720
but most cases settle uh before they

412
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,639
ever hit trial you know this is some

413
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:08,079
subset of cases where there's a

414
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,360
defendant so i was like i'm going to go

415
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,360
all the way i want to challenge this

416
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,800
and once they sit in the room and they

417
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,800
see their jury of 12

418
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,639
you know then there's a recess and they

419
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:18,160
settle it right there right because then

420
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,600
it becomes real to them

421
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,200
and that isn't a legal question that's

422
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,639
just an emotional energy question

423
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,800
but really think about just to do with a

424
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,240
money question of what your hourly bill

425
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,000
rate is if you work for an ir firm

426
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,040
or or what you're build out at or if

427
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,240
you're just a salaried

428
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,399
uh person who does ir in a company what

429
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:37,519
you get paid

430
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,240
now think of anybody in your life or

431
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,160
that might have need

432
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,760
for examining or handling digital

433
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,440
evidence or helping with

434
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,040
a cyber crime case could they pay

435
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,639
there's lots of small organizations

436
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,199
charities uh there was a small media

437
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:54,720
outlet that i helped with a ransomware

438
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,399
case so that wasn't forensics that was

439
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,000
that was just ir

440
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
and ransomware negotiation but they

441
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,440
didn't have any ability to pay

442
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,600
and their insurance policy didn't have

443
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,440
any room to pay me

444
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,600
even if i wanted to so there's lots of

445
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,519
people who don't have access to the same

446
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:11,680
money or expertise or time or emotional

447
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,399
energy

448
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:15,360
so the assumption of this adversarial

449
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,000
legal system

450
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,399
where people at near parity doesn't

451
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,920
really often exist

452
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,040
sometimes it does but very rarely

453
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:27,040
does it right and the bad news is

454
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,399
as for those of us who work in for large

455
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,639
companies or law enforcement agencies or

456
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,639
ir firms is we're on the powerful side

457
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,480
of that system

458
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,920
now generally the people we're

459
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,600
investigating with the exception of law

460
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,320
enforcement

461
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,360
is you know we're doing forensics for hr

462
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,320
cases

463
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,160
and it's usually pretty cut and dry or

464
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,160
we're doing forensics for a cyber crime

465
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,440
or an apt case

466
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,600
that'll probably never go to trial right

467
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,880
there's parody there

468
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,360
but that's not all of what exists there

469
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,880
and there's lots of people who are on

470
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,600
the i don't want to say wrong side but

471
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,480
the disadvantaged side of the criminal

472
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,079
or the the legal system

473
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,000
i mean you've got poor they can't afford

474
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,120
their own lawyers they got to deal with

475
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,320
public defenders

476
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,600
who have case loads that if they were in

477
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,360
private practice they'd be disbarred for

478
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,560
having

479
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,079
you've got other disadvantaged people

480
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:18,079
you've got persecuted i'm going to talk

481
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:19,279
about a journalist

482
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:20,639
that the government that a city

483
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,560
government just went after because they

484
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,240
were mad

485
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,079
even middle class people i mean we're

486
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:27,600
all upper middle class

487
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,240
here in this industry um i should say

488
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,360
there might be there might be some

489
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,560
entry-level people here

490
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,519
but by and large right you know uh as a

491
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,120
class people who work in cyber security

492
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,800
you're gonna have a pretty pretty secure

493
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,000
life right we're gonna do okay um

494
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,519
but if you think about it if you get

495
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,360
unjustly charged with a felony

496
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,959
you know a criminal defense could run a

497
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:48,399
hundred thousand dollars

498
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,959
do you have it i don't right you know i

499
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:52,240
said to somebody who's

500
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,920
like i said who had to have a lot of

501
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,440
retainers on lawyers over the

502
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,320
a lot of lawyers on retainers on lawyers

503
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,519
lawyers on retainer

504
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,600
over the years right you know i couldn't

505
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,639
afford that and

506
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,240
those made at least a little easier in

507
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,839
my case is that i have lawyers in my

508
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,440
family that i can

509
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,120
barter you know they do stuff for me and

510
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,120
i do stuff for them um

511
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,759
but the the hourly bill rate for lawyers

512
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,040
for basic stuff is

513
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,759
about 250 give or take right that goes

514
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:18,079
up

515
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:20,079
very you know those bills accumulate

516
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,440
very quickly and that could be very hard

517
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,000
for anybody

518
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,079
to pay and there's lots of matters where

519
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:25,199
you can't get

520
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:28,240
uh free you you aren't

521
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,320
entitled to free legal representation

522
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,839
right in criminal court

523
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:33,759
you need a public defender there is

524
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,560
legal aid for certain classes of things

525
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,720
but a lot of things you you may not if

526
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,839
you don't have the money for a lawyer

527
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:43,279
then you're arguing the case yourself

528
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:46,000
so here's some examples of bad outcomes

529
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,320
like i think generally the fbi does

530
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,360
does a good job with forensics um

531
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,120
you know i have no beef with card

532
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,440
examiners and i said generally

533
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,279
if i were asked to look over the work i

534
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:58,880
would expect that they probably got it

535
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,120
there's lots of checks and balances in

536
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,360
how the fbi does things

537
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,679
but sometimes they get it wrong um and

538
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:07,839
largely like i said it's due to things

539
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,799
prior

540
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:12,079
so this article uh had to deal with with

541
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:12,880
hair evidence

542
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,280
right is that the fbi labs you know did

543
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,919
various forensic examinations of hair

544
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:19,280
and we're able to get

545
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,160
convictions based in part on that well

546
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:22,880
eventually

547
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,039
somebody who's resourced enough hired

548
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:26,240
their own experts

549
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,000
challenged it and found out hey you know

550
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,600
what this

551
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,960
i mean this junk science you know

552
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,360
maybe a step above junk science you know

553
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,880
it ain't forensic science

554
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,640
right it did not have the outcomes they

555
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,039
did but when an fbi expert shows up and

556
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:43,919
says i did this i did this i did this

557
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:46,320
you know they got a badge people take

558
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,280
them at their word

559
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,600
unless there's somebody like me or like

560
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,480
you

561
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,559
who does the work to show that they

562
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:53,760
didn't do it

563
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,799
you know is when the government presents

564
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:58,640
their experts or one side presents the

565
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,000
experts and the other side doesn't have

566
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,520
any it is very very hard to impeach

567
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,480
their work

568
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,039
it really takes another expert um then

569
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:08,799
we're going to keep going to this point

570
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:10,480
in a couple of cases i'm going to talk

571
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,480
about all right

572
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,600
so this is a very bad outcome you know

573
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,679
for a lot of reasons is that one i mean

574
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,200
you had people who are potentially

575
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,960
wrongfully convicted that's bad

576
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,000
right you know but as somebody who wants

577
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,120
the law enforcement

578
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,720
system to work and actually put

579
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,400
criminals behind bars

580
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,919
right there may have been some guilty

581
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:31,440
people who walk free because of

582
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,080
the evidentiary areas made here right is

583
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,919
that i want

584
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:38,000
my my cops and the fbi and law

585
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,039
enforcement

586
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:41,039
to get bad guys i want to get them the

587
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:42,640
right way and make sure that they do it

588
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,679
correctly

589
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:46,000
because the way we've calibrated our

590
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:46,799
legal system

591
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,880
at least in the criminal sense is you

592
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,640
know beyond a reasonable doubt we err on

593
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,960
the side of letting bad guys go

594
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,320
uh and you know versus

595
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,559
keeping the innocent in jail it doesn't

596
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:00,160
always work out that way but

597
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,760
like i said there's a notion oh you got

598
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,360
off on a technicality

599
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,360
well the flip side of the request uh

600
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,280
that that equation is well did law

601
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,480
enforcement do it right

602
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,080
you know they have they have they have

603
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,679
the high bar and they should have a high

604
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:13,919
bar

605
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,160
so there's also lots of other worst

606
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,919
cases that we can point to right you can

607
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:19,280
think of any of the cases that pointed

608
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,960
to the black lives matter movement

609
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,400
and talk talking about a power

610
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,080
differential there right

611
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,880
you know there's an entire project or

612
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,280
there's

613
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,120
lots of iterations of this the innocent

614
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,640
project of looking at people just on

615
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,760
death row

616
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,880
going through the cases with a

617
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,880
fine-tooth comb and seeing if

618
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,960
they're in fact people on death row who

619
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,080
are innocent

620
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,760
um you might you know the outcome of

621
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,000
getting that wrong is irreversible

622
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,840
um and there have been people there been

623
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,360
convictions overturned it turned out

624
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,880
that they found people who were in fact

625
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,440
innocent for a wide variety of reasons

626
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,240
now the downside of this is also that

627
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,120
well i mean

628
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,640
you've been on death row for 20 years

629
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,400
you're free but you don't get your 20

630
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,600
years back

631
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,720
right you know they're not going to

632
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,880
execute you anymore but you've taken a

633
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,400
20-year break from society

634
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,880
right there's no restitution in some

635
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,080
states you can get some money

636
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,919
or whatever but money is a poor

637
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:10,320
substitute for time

638
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,240
um a lot of the times you know the

639
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,840
outcomes aren't just a question of

640
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,559
malice

641
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:16,880
right as local police have to handle

642
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,880
low-end cyber cases right the fbi has

643
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,000
their thresholds

644
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,480
not every cyber case is a federal case

645
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,120
um

646
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,120
you know now they're police officers you

647
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,799
know who who can handle it

648
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:29,039
you know i'm in a somewhat rural part of

649
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,240
illinois where

650
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,840
you know there's a couple of cops you

651
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,840
know who can do celebrate stuff and a

652
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,320
couple of

653
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,159
a couple of other things you know but

654
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:38,000
they have other duties as well

655
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,679
but they've got to handle all that and

656
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:41,039
sometimes you know

657
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,360
things that are complex enough or too

658
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,640
complex for a cop but

659
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,440
not uh reaching the bar of the fbi's

660
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,480
threshold

661
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,440
means things fall through the cracks

662
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,159
right

663
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:54,240
well but those cops are usually you know

664
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,840
not well trained

665
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,360
right you know they're they're cops

666
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,880
first or whatever sometimes they have a

667
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,400
forensic examiner who's

668
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,080
that's their job is to do forensics on

669
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,600
behalf of the police they're not badge

670
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,640
carriers

671
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,120
right um but think right you know many

672
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,280
of you probably invested in a gcfa or

673
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,559
gcfe

674
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:13,280
not cheap right you know uh would you

675
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,400
settle for cop pay

676
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,320
right when knowing your earning

677
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,640
potential is high elsewhere

678
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,039
right the fbi has a hard time retaining

679
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:22,400
cyber agents

680
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,799
because i can spend 10 years and then

681
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:25,679
punch out to

682
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:29,039
to work for mid mid six figures right

683
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:32,480
versus the gs pay scale some people will

684
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,200
still stay in for a sense of civic duty

685
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,039
or whatever and that's great but

686
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:39,280
it's known throughout government that

687
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,640
you know the pay differential between

688
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,840
the public and private sector is

689
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,240
creating some real problems

690
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,919
but i said you know we're on we're on

691
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:47,440
the powerful side of the unbalanced

692
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,280
power relationship and

693
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,360
uh if that makes you slightly

694
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,559
uncomfortable uh

695
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:56,240
that's not a bad outcome uh hopefully if

696
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,760
nothing else you get out of this talk is

697
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,679
the the need to do our jobs correctly

698
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:00,960
and diligently

699
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,320
even though we're probably never going

700
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,880
to be questioned in court

701
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,320
so my first case uh that i wanted to

702
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,200
uh bring up was uh i've started doing

703
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,520
some work for public defenders

704
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,320
i said they have immense caseloads that

705
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,679
wouldn't be tolerated in private

706
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:19,039
practice

707
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:20,720
they've got defendants who can't pay

708
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,559
that's why they have a public defender

709
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:24,159
uh and especially when you get in rural

710
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:26,159
areas there's there's no money for it

711
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:29,520
um so as a personal anecdote the only

712
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,360
criminal prosecution and i put

713
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,039
prosecution in air quotes

714
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:35,840
um uh because i think there's a couple

715
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,600
matters i was an expert witness on but

716
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,280
but by and large it's

717
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,320
uh just helping research and investigate

718
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,760
things and feed it to the bureau for

719
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,240
them to do their thing

720
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,440
but obviously like i said i've fed and

721
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,480
dealt with the fbi uh so it's not

722
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,320
exactly a conflict of interest

723
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,240
than being a defendant against or

724
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,320
helping the defense against the fbi

725
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,960
and it can get kind of weird right but

726
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,240
doing state-level work

727
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,159
uh for public defenders is no conflict

728
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:05,360
because i've never worked with

729
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,039
the illinois state police or state's

730
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:09,760
attorneys to help local prosecutions

731
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,240
not for any reason it's just it's never

732
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,919
come up the kind of things i dig into

733
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:14,640
are

734
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,799
large-scale billion-dollar criminal

735
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:18,559
enterprises so those are inherently

736
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:20,880
federal

737
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,280
um many of these public defenders have

738
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,880
never had a digital forensics

739
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,960
expert before learning their peers you

740
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,000
know so there's lots of things they

741
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,200
didn't know how to handle so it's

742
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,280
kind of talking through okay how to how

743
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,400
to engage and

744
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,440
and you know work with me um

745
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,400
and uh so i got a case right not in the

746
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,000
county i'm in a different one

747
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,799
uh but it was a csam case unfortunately

748
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:43,600
uh

749
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,760
referred to by the national center as a

750
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,200
national center of missing and

751
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,200
exploited children who does a lot of

752
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,720
work finding this stuff

753
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,640
identifying it on the internet finding

754
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,720
who's sharing it who's uploading it

755
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,120
uh and and getting these people uh

756
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,960
brought to justice and rightly so right

757
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,840
it's id no desire to have any of this

758
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,039
material on the internet

759
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:06,240
anywhere in the world right uh and

760
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,279
primarily uh ncmec does a lot of hash

761
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:10,960
matching sometimes actually do

762
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,799
image inspection to actually look at the

763
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:14,480
stuff um

764
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,919
and in this case it was tied to a

765
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:18,640
specific google account

766
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,520
so they were able to inherently trace it

767
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,919
to an individual

768
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:25,919
this because they've never dealt with a

769
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:27,279
private uh

770
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:29,279
digital forensics expert before right

771
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:31,039
this led to interesting questions about

772
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:32,799
evidence handling and you can kind of

773
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:34,880
you know picture the absurdity this is

774
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,159
like you know it's

775
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:37,919
you know all of us doing forensics right

776
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:40,159
now are primarily remote so somebody's

777
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:42,480
sending us evidence right you know so

778
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,000
they're saying oh you know

779
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,400
um you know would you like us to mail

780
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,000
the evidence to you on a thumb drive is

781
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:48,720
like

782
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,720
no no i would not because that would be

783
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,799
a federal crime and you can't protect me

784
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:53,760
from that

785
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,520
and you can't email it either right so i

786
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,960
mean we're you know

787
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,200
you know so they queried it and i still

788
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,960
kind of had a problem with that because

789
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,360
now i have something in my possession i

790
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,200
really don't want to have

791
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,840
but i mean defense are entitled to

792
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,039
defend their clients and they need to

793
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:11,679
see all the evidence and examine it

794
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:14,000
the fbi how they handle this is that

795
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:14,720
that

796
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,720
you know if you've got a federal csam

797
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,080
case and you've got a

798
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,840
defense attorney and defense experts

799
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:20,799
they're just going to have to go to the

800
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:22,720
field office or a residence agency and

801
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,400
look at the evidence there

802
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,640
on an offline on network computer and

803
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,320
that's just that which

804
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,320
is a pain but you know what considering

805
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,440
the subject material

806
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,360
uh the subject matter you know i'm okay

807
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,120
with that right you know if somebody was

808
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,640
making me jump through a bunch of hoops

809
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,440
for

810
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,480
you know some fraud case you know i'd be

811
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,000
irritated in this case it's like yeah

812
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,600
okay i get it right

813
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,960
um and like i said luckily like the work

814
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,480
i would do with this case doesn't really

815
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,080
involve me looking at the images i mean

816
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,520
the metadata the files or whatever and

817
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,760
the network telemetry sure

818
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,679
but they really had no process in place

819
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:56,960
right here to handle it

820
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,480
and i said they're federal questions

821
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,000
right you know is

822
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,720
you know sending it through the u.s mail

823
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,159
it's a federal crime sending it over

824
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:06,000
electronically as a federal crime

825
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,400
you know uh possession in some cases is

826
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,520
a federal crime right

827
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,840
and state can't immunize yourself from

828
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,720
federal charges

829
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,919
right so um kind of talk through that

830
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:17,600
i actually asked the fbi if they had any

831
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,919
you know the one deconflict is like

832
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:21,360
by the way this is what i'm doing this

833
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,039
is why i have it you know

834
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,919
which led to the the federal prosecutor

835
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:27,440
giving the prosecutor a call saying hey

836
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,960
let's not do this

837
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,760
so we'll try to i said make the work of

838
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,360
law enforcement better in a place that's

839
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,200
never dealt with this is saying hey

840
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,720
we need to keep this stuff in an

841
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,480
evidence locker somewhere you know at a

842
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,600
police department

843
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,279
and an offline computer so that if

844
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:43,039
anybody ever needed to look at it

845
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:45,279
to do the work they can but it's just

846
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:46,640
not being

847
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,679
transmitted or shared it's being held in

848
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:51,600
a very controlled way

849
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,799
so even though as a defense expert it's

850
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:55,760
not my job

851
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,080
to make the prosecution better at least

852
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,360
for this it's like

853
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,559
i'm glad we kind of went through this

854
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:03,440
even though it was as a very superioris

855
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,600
way of actually starting the case is

856
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,720
like hey let's

857
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,559
let's make sure we get the process right

858
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:10,960
in this place communicate it out

859
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,440
that way when it comes up later you know

860
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,960
it's handled correctly and it's very

861
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:18,400
important to handle this stuff correctly

862
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,480
so uh the ncmec identified it hashes

863
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,039
with upload events from specific ips

864
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:27,120
uh those were authenticated to a google

865
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,559
account so

866
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:31,440
kind of knew who they were um and as far

867
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,640
as i could tell they just said okay well

868
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,480
you're the only account you're the guy

869
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,159
all right you know off you go hear your

870
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:37,679
cuffs here's the charges

871
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:40,320
gets a public defender uh who then hears

872
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,279
about me and

873
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:44,399
and contacts me so

874
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:46,480
the threshold here right for a criminal

875
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,000
case is beyond a reasonable doubt

876
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,320
right the defendant says hey other

877
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,840
people have access to this

878
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,039
right i'm not the only one with a

879
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:55,120
password i

880
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:58,159
you know that's reasonable people share

881
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:00,960
passwords they shouldn't i mean we tell

882
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:01,440
them

883
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,120
not to but they do um

884
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,799
some of the ip addresses involved or

885
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:08,640
locations not connected to the defendant

886
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,559
right you've never been in that city

887
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:13,760
there was mobile and isp right so it was

888
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,200
kind of easier to

889
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,480
to identify locations that didn't make a

890
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,760
whole lot of sense

891
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:23,279
um but here's an interesting question

892
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:24,640
right is that the goals between

893
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,159
prosecution and defense experts are

894
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:27,120
different

895
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,600
right for a prosecution expert you have

896
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,480
to

897
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,240
collect all the evidence and analyze it

898
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,520
to create a

899
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,840
beyond reasonable doubt scenario that's

900
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,760
actually fairly hard to do with digital

901
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,279
evidence alone

902
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:42,640
for a lot of reasons you know any number

903
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,080
of things could happen to

904
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,240
that computer right you know even if it

905
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,760
was in this guy's house

906
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,760
did somebody else put it on his computer

907
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,039
or as you know

908
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:53,840
into a cloud account uh because i can't

909
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,760
tell that from network telemetry alone

910
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,200
about who's sitting at the computer you

911
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,960
need other stuff

912
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,159
and digital evidence is uh a form of

913
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:03,039
hearsay

914
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:04,640
but there's a couple of exceptions that

915
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,600
apply but can also be circumstantial

916
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,840
right so there's a lot of legal concepts

917
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,440
that come into play

918
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,919
as a defense expert right but just a

919
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:14,720
little bit different

920
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,919
role than i'm i'm used to is well i said

921
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:18,320
i've done

922
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,480
investigations of large-scale crimes

923
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,559
that led to federal prosecutions right

924
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:24,799
of getting to beyond a reasonable out a

925
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:26,320
defense expert i've just got to pick

926
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,159
enough holes to say hey you don't have

927
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:29,200
it

928
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,640
um right it leads to an ethical

929
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,679
ethical question there is you know

930
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:37,120
do i want people to traffic in this

931
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,960
stuff go free well

932
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,720
the flip side of that equation is if

933
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,919
you're going to shoot this shot to

934
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:43,440
charge somebody with this kind of stuff

935
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,880
you got to get the case um you got to

936
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,360
do the work to close all the loops

937
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,000
because

938
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,279
if you're being lazy maybe lazy is

939
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:54,559
unfair in this case

940
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:57,520
but not thorough that opens the door to

941
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,279
innocent people being charged with this

942
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:01,360
kind of crime and it is a life-altering

943
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,320
crime

944
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,440
um uh to be charged with and many people

945
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:05,919
you know

946
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:08,399
even if they're guilty you know plea out

947
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:09,840
because they don't have the resources

948
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,200
they don't have the emotional energy

949
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,480
they don't have the time

950
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,240
uh you know the state overcharges and

951
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,760
offers a deal and says

952
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,279
listen i'm going to put you away for 30

953
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:19,440
years or you can plea out here and take

954
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,320
five

955
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,520
you know what do you want to do do you

956
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,200
want to die in jail uh you know

957
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,880
depending on your age i guess

958
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,200
i'm facing 30 years in jail at my age

959
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,720
that could be an effective death

960
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,520
sentence

961
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,600
or five years where i can get out you

962
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,039
know um

963
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:36,000
yeah i may be innocent but the process

964
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,440
you know

965
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,039
that's the kind of way criminal

966
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:41,520
defendants have to do and it's not uh

967
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,640
it's not as simple as saying you know

968
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,520
what i'm innocent right you know because

969
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,039
everybody's heard horror stories and

970
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:49,360
knows that you know the state wants to

971
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,880
get you often they can and if you don't

972
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,840
have the money to fight

973
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,000
then you you got to take the lesser of

974
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,240
two evils

975
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,120
so um and and sometimes the best way to

976
00:30:59,120 --> 00:30:59,679
make

977
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:02,880
prosecutors and police more effective uh

978
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,720
is to challenge them the adversarial

979
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,240
legal system works

980
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,399
because it makes everybody involved

981
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:09,600
better

982
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,279
right if you're just talking and

983
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:13,679
nobody's actually questioning you

984
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:16,559
or otherwise examining your your

985
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:17,679
findings

986
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:20,000
right you get intellectually lazy not

987
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,240
not in an immoral sense it's just

988
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,640
you know there's atrophy involved right

989
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,440
you know

990
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,519
it's always better to have somebody

991
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:28,559
challenging you

992
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:31,039
i'm challenging your your analysis and

993
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:32,799
your biases and all the things that go

994
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:34,960
into that and the more that i've done

995
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,399
threat intelligence and intelligence

996
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:38,320
work the more that those kind of

997
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,279
dynamics are

998
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:42,399
the forefront of my mind

999
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:45,200
over 90 of cases settle out very very

1000
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,399
few actually hit

1001
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:49,440
hit court of those right

1002
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,720
very few have a defense expert

1003
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,960
on some evidence right like the fbi hair

1004
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,000
evidence

1005
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,679
they're not effectively cross-examined

1006
00:31:57,679 --> 00:31:59,360
you need

1007
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:02,720
you know an expert to question an expert

1008
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,399
you know and i said the system works

1009
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:05,600
where there's near parity it's better

1010
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,960
for all involved because it makes us all

1011
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:07,440
better

1012
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,440
right having me questioning the work of

1013
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,200
police or the fbi for that matter is

1014
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,720
going to make them better

1015
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,240
uh over the longer term right um

1016
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,399
so i i said it's an important that this

1017
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:20,559
system you know works

1018
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:23,679
works as how we idealize it uh not

1019
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:25,440
necessarily works how it does today for

1020
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,080
a lot of people

1021
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,840
so here is actually one of my favorite

1022
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,840
pro bono cases for a wide variety of

1023
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,200
reasons and we're going to talk about

1024
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,240
this

1025
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:37,200
i was a pro bono expert in a state level

1026
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,080
cfa

1027
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:41,840
civil prosecution um so like the federal

1028
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,080
cfa can be used in criminal and civil

1029
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,519
court california has

1030
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:47,760
another version of that uh the case is

1031
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,720
city of fullerton

1032
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,360
uh versus uh friends of fullerton future

1033
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,440
uh you can google that to find

1034
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,039
materials because now that that case is

1035
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:56,559
resolved it was

1036
00:32:56,559 --> 00:33:00,480
fairly public for this kind of case

1037
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,840
defendant was a journalist he was a

1038
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,519
blogger who

1039
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:06,240
exposed municipal misconduct with an

1040
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,919
insecure dropbox account the city had an

1041
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:10,880
insecure dropbox we'll talk about that

1042
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:13,279
i was connected to the case via the

1043
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:14,880
electronic frontier foundation they have

1044
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,880
a co-op text listserv

1045
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,200
where lawyers and others can ask hey you

1046
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,200
know we didn't expert

1047
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,760
a pro bono sometimes paid to help with

1048
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:24,640
something

1049
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:28,559
it's a very low volume list but uh

1050
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:31,600
it's people have nowhere else to turn

1051
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,600
turn to the ff hey i need a technical

1052
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,039
expert for something

1053
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:36,799
uh so it's a good way to to pick up

1054
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:38,399
things every now and then

1055
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:40,000
but the case is kind of the nexus of

1056
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,240
free uh of the free press the first

1057
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:42,799
amendment

1058
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:44,559
version of the free press right uh

1059
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:47,279
publix record law and using the cfa as a

1060
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:48,880
hammer against a blogger right

1061
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:52,000
i'm sorry for the typo um so

1062
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,960
i'm sure that many of you here have some

1063
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,480
feelings about the computer fraud and

1064
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,760
abuse act as do why

1065
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:02,640
so the basics of this case blogger did a

1066
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,399
foia request or documents notice the

1067
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:06,080
dropbox had no access control

1068
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,239
by no access control meaning you go to

1069
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:09,440
the root of the folder

1070
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,000
and walk the entire tree so for foia

1071
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,040
responses

1072
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,639
that doesn't really matter because we're

1073
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:16,079
really talking about public records

1074
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:18,480
they're seeing other people's

1075
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,399
public records requests or the the

1076
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:21,839
responses to other people's public

1077
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:22,800
records requests

1078
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,520
but it's all public records governments

1079
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,560
are very

1080
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,639
stupidly finicky about this stuff like

1081
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:29,918
oh if you request it

1082
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:31,520
then i'll produce this to you but if

1083
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,040
somebody else requests it then we've got

1084
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,000
to go do all this work

1085
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,918
all over again it's part of this stupid

1086
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:38,560
game many government agencies play

1087
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,879
to prevent the public from seeing their

1088
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:41,679
own

1089
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:44,639
government's business

1090
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:47,679
so like many cities this is this is

1091
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:49,280
where we start to get into hilarious

1092
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,079
territory

1093
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:52,639
right you know they produce a documents

1094
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:53,280
hey this

1095
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,879
this guy requested these documents

1096
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:56,480
here's all the documents and the lawyers

1097
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,920
go through and say no you got to redact

1098
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,680
this you can't produce this because this

1099
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,280
exemption in the law

1100
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:04,160
they communicated all of the unredacted

1101
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,040
documents

1102
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,440
to their lawyers using the same dropbox

1103
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,960
account that was unprotected

1104
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,200
yes the communication would be

1105
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,079
privileged

1106
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:17,200
right had they used any mechanism to

1107
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,359
protect the information i mean literally

1108
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:22,720
anything right but they chose not to

1109
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,400
at one point i brought up as like you

1110
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,400
know what this is actually a pretty

1111
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,839
serious violation

1112
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:29,839
of the california bar association's

1113
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:30,960
legal rules right

1114
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,960
because you need to protect privileged

1115
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,480
communication and while your

1116
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,640
client may communicate stuff over an

1117
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,000
insecure channel

1118
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,480
like making things publicly available to

1119
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,280
the entire

1120
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:44,079
planet earth you're you're the lawyer

1121
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:45,119
you should be like hey

1122
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:47,599
no you can't do that we need to come up

1123
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:49,200
with a secure mechanism

1124
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,280
for whatever reason they didn't so this

1125
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,280
stuff was all sitting on the internet

1126
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:56,800
uh freely available

1127
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:00,000
so ferguson uh the guy involved uh

1128
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,520
published many otherwise

1129
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,599
uh redacted or unreleased records on

1130
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:06,000
police misconduct and other matters

1131
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,480
and as you can imagine hilarity did not

1132
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,119
ensue

1133
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:11,599
the city was quite pissed uh there was a

1134
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:13,200
public records lawsuit

1135
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,640
that was about to be filed so they

1136
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,400
retaliated filing a computer fraud and

1137
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,280
abuse act

1138
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,839
accusing him of hacking the dropbox

1139
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:20,720
accounts

1140
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,400
now it wasn't just a lawsuit they talked

1141
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,079
about this in city council meetings from

1142
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:25,520
quite public they were quite public to

1143
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,400
the press

1144
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,160
this guy is hacking our dropbox and

1145
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,760
stealing documents

1146
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,880
very inflammatory defamatory language

1147
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:36,480
uh if it would have gone that way so

1148
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,839
they searched his computers as his

1149
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:39,440
workplace and he's a blogger he wasn't

1150
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,200
he wasn't paid as a journalist

1151
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,599
uh which which led him to losing this

1152
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:45,119
job because i mean you know if the

1153
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:46,400
police come in and start searching

1154
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,599
things because the stuff you're doing on

1155
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:49,200
your off time

1156
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:52,480
employers will tend to frown upon that

1157
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,720
and surely the city knew what they were

1158
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,400
doing when they did that

1159
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,720
uh the city also hired their own uh

1160
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,480
digital forensics expert

1161
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:03,359
uh and i have that in air quotes because

1162
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:05,280
he was the living embodiment of what

1163
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,839
never to do in a digital forensic

1164
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:08,720
examination right

1165
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,640
literally his expert witness testimony

1166
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:11,839
is going to be case studies in my

1167
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:13,040
courses and i'm going to mention this

1168
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:13,760
again

1169
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,760
of what not to do and what not to say in

1170
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,800
court right

1171
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,599
the city didn't want ferguson to access

1172
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:22,560
the docs

1173
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,480
they called it hacking and unauthorized

1174
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,040
access because they didn't explicitly

1175
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:30,079
authorize him to use that part of their

1176
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:33,119
publicly available website

1177
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:35,520
i'm sure that you're all your brains are

1178
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,560
all exploding

1179
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:39,119
right now of this kind of preposterous

1180
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:40,160
druid logic

1181
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,000
a phrase that i tried to include in one

1182
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,680
of my declarations in court

1183
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,359
but the lawyer advised me that was

1184
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:47,359
probably too inflammatory for an expert

1185
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:48,560
witness report

1186
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,480
right it's there's no access control

1187
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,920
everything's live on the internet on a

1188
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:52,880
web page

1189
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,280
right there is no unauthorized access

1190
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,880
because there's no technical control to

1191
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:57,599
stop it

1192
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:01,119
nothing was gone around um

1193
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:02,960
they also argued because ferguson at one

1194
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,320
point used uh

1195
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,720
vpn i forget exactly which one he did

1196
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,079
that anyone

1197
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:10,720
uh using a vpn service no matter the

1198
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:11,520
company

1199
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:14,240
was him any vpn from that provider was

1200
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,040
him

1201
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,839
for some reason anybody who used tor was

1202
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:18,400
him

1203
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,079
and then anybody from outside the united

1204
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:22,000
states was him too

1205
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,560
i mean logical leap to logical leap to

1206
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,520
logical elite

1207
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,560
right so you can imagine i'm kind of a

1208
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,000
i can be level headed but i'm also

1209
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,520
pretty sarcastic i try to be

1210
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,599
level-headed in in court

1211
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:37,040
it was very hard to write my report

1212
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,119
based on how absurd some of these claims

1213
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:40,400
were i

1214
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,079
i don't know if it made it in or not but

1215
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:44,079
i think what no it made the cutting room

1216
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:45,599
floor or went to the cutting room floor

1217
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:46,079
is

1218
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:49,200
you know they they makes the connections

1219
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,480
so tenuous

1220
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:53,440
is connections so illusory they border

1221
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,640
on hallucination

1222
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,920
right they argue vpns are hacking tools

1223
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,760
that if you use nordvpn you're a

1224
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,440
criminal

1225
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,960
they argued in one of their declarations

1226
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,880
i use this as

1227
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:08,160
as my own expert is that i use a vpn to

1228
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,920
access my campus environment when i'm a

1229
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,359
phd student to

1230
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:13,119
access the network as if i were on the u

1231
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:14,800
of i campus i said well clearly that was

1232
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,520
hacking

1233
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,440
even though the vpn was provided to me

1234
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,680
by the university for that express

1235
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:22,320
purpose um this is the kind of arguments

1236
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,480
they were making in court

1237
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:27,440
um they're expert let me let me take let

1238
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,599
me emphasize this point

1239
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:31,359
these were arguments made by their

1240
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:33,520
technical expert

1241
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:36,560
right now who has i.t experience we'll

1242
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:39,200
talk about him in a minute

1243
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,920
here is the worst legal thing they did

1244
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:42,320
the

1245
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,880
absolute worst they produced dropbox

1246
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,560
logs that they got from dropbox

1247
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,240
they put in their filing and said here's

1248
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,599
the proof

1249
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:51,520
they enriched those logs without

1250
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,520
disclosing how why or with what they

1251
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,040
enriched them with

1252
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:57,680
until i basically tried to reproduce

1253
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,760
getting dropbox logs on a new account i

1254
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,119
set up and said

1255
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:03,760
they've added fields where did those

1256
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,920
fields come from

1257
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:09,520
the legal term to describe this is

1258
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:12,160
corrupting the integrity of the evidence

1259
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,680
you can enrich data

1260
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:17,119
right but as a defense expert i need to

1261
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:18,000
know

1262
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,839
and have enough information from your

1263
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:21,119
filings to be able to

1264
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:23,280
reproduce your work i shouldn't have to

1265
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,480
guess

1266
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,400
so when you sign an affidavit that says

1267
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,000
these are true and complete with no

1268
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,440
modifications

1269
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,640
and they're not that's also perjury

1270
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:36,800
um so it got into very legally

1271
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,720
dangerous territory for the expert and

1272
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,240
their case quickly

1273
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,839
because i was able to reproduce and just

1274
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:43,359
like well let's see what access logs

1275
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:45,359
from dropbox look like when i download

1276
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:45,839
them

1277
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:48,240
it's like that's not what they look like

1278
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,760
what are they doing here

1279
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,280
they're adding more information and then

1280
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,640
they tried to play it off to the judge

1281
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:53,359
it's like

1282
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:55,839
well yeah we enrich you you enrich

1283
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:57,200
evidence all the time

1284
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:00,000
it's like yeah you can do that but you

1285
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:00,400
can't

1286
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,480
not disclose it until you called out on

1287
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,480
it that's not how this works

1288
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:08,640
at all so their examiner

1289
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,880
right runs a small msp now i want to

1290
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,960
emphasize there's a missing s from there

1291
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,119
that's not a typo right he is not a

1292
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:16,240
security provider

1293
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:19,280
he manages its and telco and and help

1294
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,240
desk and

1295
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:22,400
nothing wrong with it been doing it for

1296
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,359
over 20 years

1297
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:25,760
must not be terrible you know but he

1298
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,520
runs an msp

1299
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,200
you look at his linkedin profiler

1300
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,720
nothing about forensics in there

1301
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,480
right wrote a bunch of books for john

1302
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,160
wiley there's some network security in

1303
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,119
there but mostly i t

1304
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:37,599
related topics you know but not

1305
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:39,200
everybody who does security

1306
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,520
can do forensics right there's lots of

1307
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:42,319
legal

1308
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:44,800
concepts unconnected to the technology

1309
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,800
that are very very important like

1310
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,200
uh let me think about this integrity of

1311
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,000
the evidence

1312
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,319
right well i said no forensics training

1313
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:53,119
that i could find

1314
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:55,520
is just some guy who knew technology

1315
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,040
were really unclear is how he got

1316
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,240
connected to the case

1317
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:01,599
as an expert but he did so we

1318
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:03,280
read flagged as credentials too and just

1319
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,119
says this guy is not a digital forensics

1320
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:05,760
expert

1321
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,920
right he may know technology but that's

1322
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,400
not enough

1323
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,640
so which brings me to a note about

1324
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,079
training it's like i don't i don't much

1325
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:14,960
care for the

1326
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,400
the gatekeeping that can happen with

1327
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,800
certifications and security generally

1328
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,680
um but it does matter in forensics right

1329
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:22,800
and that df

1330
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:23,920
really shouldn't be an entry-level

1331
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,520
career track because understanding the

1332
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:26,800
technology

1333
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,240
is more important than being able to

1334
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:29,760
click the right buttons and in case or

1335
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:30,480
celebrate

1336
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:33,200
right um the most important part about

1337
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,240
forensics are

1338
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:36,880
are are not the technology that's the

1339
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,560
law right we're not legal experts

1340
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,000
but they're very specific things we need

1341
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,599
to be legal experts on right

1342
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:43,839
evidence handling namely right because

1343
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:45,359
that's that's what we do that's the

1344
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:46,720
service we provide

1345
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:49,040
anybody can punch buttons in n case

1346
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,800
right but it's it's the

1347
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:53,359
the acquisition and analysis of digital

1348
00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:55,680
evidence in forensically sound matters

1349
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,680
and there are legal ways to do that and

1350
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,760
less than legal ways to do that

1351
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:02,079
and i said the tools do the work but you

1352
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:03,599
need to understand the science behind it

1353
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:04,880
and that's a problem for cops is that

1354
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,640
they get to celebrate they get taught

1355
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,480
which buttons to push to to do things

1356
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:09,920
out uh

1357
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,160
and it works okay most of the time but

1358
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,160
they don't understand what's going on

1359
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:15,920
behind the scenes and that's i mean

1360
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,599
that's not a criticism it's like cops

1361
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:19,520
need to know a lot of different things

1362
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:23,119
then sell forensics um you know

1363
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:26,079
but if you're going to engage in high do

1364
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:28,240
high profile criminal prosecution

1365
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:30,079
you know it's not unfair to expect that

1366
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:31,200
you know the government needs to bring

1367
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,359
their a game

1368
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:36,160
the case was dismissed more specifically

1369
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:36,960
the city

1370
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:39,119
paid the bloggers to dismiss their own

1371
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:40,079
case

1372
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:41,520
i don't know if i've ever seen that

1373
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,599
right it is the bloggers

1374
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:45,680
you know we're going to sue just hadn't

1375
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:46,720
gotten to it yet

1376
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,000
you know the city is like we'd like to

1377
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,599
drop this matter and we're going to give

1378
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:50,640
you some money

1379
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:51,760
and we're going to give your lawyer some

1380
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:54,319
money now they couldn't give me money

1381
00:43:54,319 --> 00:43:56,880
uh and this is an important note that i

1382
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,079
probably should mention

1383
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:00,400
right as a digital forensics examiner i

1384
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,960
can do anything pro bono i want

1385
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:04,960
what i can't do is contingency billing

1386
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:06,880
where i say give me 33

1387
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,720
or some percent of the judgment because

1388
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,240
then my judgment

1389
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:12,640
uh and my analysis is tied to a specific

1390
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:13,520
outcome

1391
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:15,599
uh and that creates that that's kind of

1392
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:17,520
known to be a problem

1393
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:19,359
and i said normally they just withdraw a

1394
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:22,160
case but lots of questions about uh

1395
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,160
constitutional on the first amendment

1396
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:26,400
the eff and the media groups

1397
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,319
uh you know got involved in the shoddy

1398
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:30,560
df work led to a very untenable position

1399
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:31,920
for the city to continue

1400
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,839
and like i said i'm using this guy's

1401
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:35,280
expert witness reports

1402
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,280
in a class in classes of how not to do

1403
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:39,680
it you know we have lots of case studies

1404
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,599
of doing it correctly

1405
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:44,640
i've only had theoretical cases you know

1406
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,240
examples of how to do it poorly now i've

1407
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:48,319
got something concrete so

1408
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:51,680
thanks you've improved my training

1409
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:53,200
so don't be lazy in your forensics

1410
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:55,359
reports credibility is your most

1411
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:56,800
important asset right it takes a

1412
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:57,839
lifetime to earn

1413
00:44:57,839 --> 00:44:59,520
and one trash report away from going

1414
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:01,280
away um

1415
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:02,720
you know the only way to question the

1416
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:05,280
expert's work is with another expert

1417
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:07,119
and i said you know the the end day it's

1418
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:08,400
like the city tried to railroad a

1419
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:09,440
blogger

1420
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:10,800
and he didn't have the resources to

1421
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,720
fight back it took a lot of people who

1422
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:16,800
stepped up to do it to help him out

1423
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:20,240
so my third third case is um

1424
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:22,160
if you remember charlottesville there's

1425
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:23,920
a lot of related cases with dino badal

1426
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:25,599
and tanya kirsch with these neo-nazi

1427
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:26,400
groups

1428
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,560
uh that raise money in cryptocurrency

1429
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,800
for legal defense funds

1430
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,400
uh there's several different cases

1431
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,079
involved all torts

1432
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:35,760
you did bad things so you owe the

1433
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:37,440
victims money

1434
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,599
specifically andrew anglin never showed

1435
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:40,960
up the court

1436
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:43,920
which is the first actual testimony i've

1437
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:45,200
ever done on open court

1438
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:48,079
is because he never showed up but he

1439
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:49,920
commented online and fundraised over the

1440
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,280
lawsuit so the court eventually said

1441
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:53,040
even though he was evading service

1442
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:54,640
he says well clearly you know about the

1443
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,640
case and you're just being a dick so

1444
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:57,680
we're going to continue

1445
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:59,040
and if you don't want to show up that's

1446
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:00,400
fine we're just going to have the trial

1447
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:01,839
in absentia

1448
00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:03,520
because it was in absentia though they

1449
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:04,720
needed to go through motions they

1450
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:05,680
wouldn't have gone through

1451
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:08,800
otherwise like you know odds are in

1452
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,480
a trial setting i would have said this

1453
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:12,319
is how i figured out what what he raised

1454
00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:13,119
in bitcoin

1455
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:14,560
they'd examine whether it makes any

1456
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:15,839
sense to hire an expert and they

1457
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:17,040
probably never would have

1458
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,800
because there's no one there to examine

1459
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,960
me actually the judge questioned me

1460
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:24,160
at several points of how i did my work

1461
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:27,280
to come to this so

1462
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:29,680
they needed someone to talk about how to

1463
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:31,680
uh enumerate their bitcoin earnings

1464
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:33,359
uh they also give me financial records

1465
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:35,280
so i was uh an expert for that piece of

1466
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:35,760
it

1467
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,680
and it was based off a twitter bot i i

1468
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:39,680
created several years ago to monitor

1469
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:41,680
neo-nazi fundraising in bitcoin

1470
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:43,200
so some interesting questions how do you

1471
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,599
value bitcoin at the time of transfer or

1472
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:47,359
what it's valued at currently do you do

1473
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:49,200
the judgment in bitcoin or us dollars

1474
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:49,920
this is

1475
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:51,680
all new questions of law and everybody's

1476
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:52,800
kind of looking at me it's like how

1477
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:53,680
should we do it

1478
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:56,079
well i did it at time of transfer in usd

1479
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:58,079
um that was just how i did it i don't

1480
00:46:58,079 --> 00:46:59,359
know what the right answer is

1481
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:01,200
that was just what i thought was best i

1482
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,359
explained it and everybody accepted it

1483
00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:05,440
uh it's always it's in bitcoin it's easy

1484
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:07,760
to get those transactions

1485
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:09,760
and it led to a lot of adversarial

1486
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,280
changes of behavior they're much more

1487
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:12,079
careful

1488
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:14,079
uh and nobody really buys them with

1489
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:15,359
their legal defense funds because

1490
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:18,319
they're not actually hiring lawyers

1491
00:47:18,319 --> 00:47:21,119
so obidala got a four million judgment

1492
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:22,319
but judgments are easy

1493
00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:23,920
right it's collection is the hard part

1494
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:25,119
where you've got to do the work to go

1495
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:27,119
find and take the money

1496
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:28,800
we're experiencing with ways to do that

1497
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,640
in simple matters with bitcoin but it's

1498
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:30,960
still

1499
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:34,960
very disruptive to their finances

1500
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:36,480
but bitcoin is also new there's not a

1501
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:39,119
lot of case law there to work off of

1502
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:41,119
um you know we're trying to create some

1503
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:42,559
new case law uh

1504
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:44,240
based on some technical expertise i

1505
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:46,400
provided and we'll see where it goes

1506
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,800
um and just random aside i was able you

1507
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:50,400
know to take my oldest son

1508
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,160
to drive out to a federal court in ohio

1509
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:54,319
and see what this looks like right so

1510
00:47:54,319 --> 00:47:56,720
um you know it's an opportunity of

1511
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:57,599
seeing the federal

1512
00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:00,000
civil trial uh that uh you know he's

1513
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,520
interested in law and politics so

1514
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:04,720
i you got to see that too

1515
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:06,160
the last matter is potpourri there's

1516
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:07,520
lots of other matters that i'm working

1517
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:09,520
on as cyber stalking sexual harassment

1518
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:11,599
cases some other public defender cases

1519
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:14,559
foia cases i've got a couple of um i'm

1520
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:16,160
getting a lot of trial experience or at

1521
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:16,800
least

1522
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:19,200
producing affidavits for courts but

1523
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:21,280
there's lots of stuff out there

1524
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:23,200
for people who can't pay and it just so

1525
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,400
happens i have time

1526
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:27,839
but there's still more than i can do

1527
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:29,680
which leads me to my call to action

1528
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:31,599
right the system is unbalanced against

1529
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:34,000
those who are not sufficiently resourced

1530
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,319
but there's a huge amount of need right

1531
00:48:36,319 --> 00:48:37,599
cyber stalking alone

1532
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:39,200
there's probably hundreds of thousands

1533
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:40,880
of cases right now

1534
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:42,720
of people who need help right and it

1535
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:45,119
just be locking down cell phones or

1536
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:46,960
uh trying to remove key lockers or

1537
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:48,319
whatever right

1538
00:48:48,319 --> 00:48:49,680
i said if they can't pay they don't get

1539
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:51,119
help and that's diamond there's no money

1540
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:52,559
to be paid with

1541
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:54,079
but we have skills and experience that

1542
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:56,559
can make uh big differences

1543
00:48:56,559 --> 00:48:58,559
uh to these people in a wide variety of

1544
00:48:58,559 --> 00:48:59,599
matters right

1545
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:01,440
and and i said some of these you don't

1546
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:03,040
necessarily need to be you know

1547
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:04,800
a fully trained df person right if

1548
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:06,400
somebody's dealing with

1549
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:08,480
you know cyber stalking or an abusive

1550
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:10,319
relationship right they're resources for

1551
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:11,920
them uh there's the coalition against

1552
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:13,280
soccer wear and

1553
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:15,599
a couple of other resources you know

1554
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:16,640
there's uh

1555
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:18,720
lots of technical help that can be

1556
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:20,079
provided to people

1557
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:22,640
uh to help out uh you know i said if

1558
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:23,760
you're gonna go in courtroom you

1559
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,040
probably want a credential

1560
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:27,680
but to help people uh to make cases even

1561
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:30,079
like cyber stalking or sexual harassment

1562
00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:33,359
it's okay here you often need to have

1563
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:35,119
all the evidence collected to give to

1564
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:36,640
the detective you kind of need to do a

1565
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,000
lot of their work for them

1566
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,599
because they have huge caseloads like

1567
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:41,200
what gets to the top of their pile

1568
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:43,599
versus what doesn't you know if you give

1569
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:44,880
them 99

1570
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:46,559
of a case and say you need to get this

1571
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:48,800
this and this and you'll have it

1572
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:51,359
you know you're much you get a result

1573
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:52,559
much quicker for

1574
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:54,480
uh your clients or the person you're

1575
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:57,040
trying to help

1576
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:59,599
so i'm setting up a 501 c3 called cyber

1577
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:00,720
beast mode because it just happened to

1578
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:01,920
be a domain name a friend

1579
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:04,319
a friend of mine had had to collect

1580
00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:05,680
refer and manage

1581
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:08,319
these cases to help the broader society

1582
00:50:08,319 --> 00:50:08,960
um

1583
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:10,880
you know we'll get the organizational

1584
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:12,960
pieces put together that's fine

1585
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:14,720
in the very early stages of it i need

1586
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,240
people who's willing to contribute

1587
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:18,079
some of their time it doesn't have to be

1588
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:19,839
a lot right somebody could feel the case

1589
00:50:19,839 --> 00:50:21,200
here or there in a city

1590
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:24,000
right there's there's one uh victim i'm

1591
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,119
dealing with

1592
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:28,160
who lives quite far from me where it'd

1593
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:29,599
be very easy

1594
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:31,200
if i were physically there to say okay

1595
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:33,359
let's let's do this this and this

1596
00:50:33,359 --> 00:50:34,720
but you can't really talk people

1597
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:37,119
remotely through securing their digital

1598
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:37,839
lives

1599
00:50:37,839 --> 00:50:40,640
you could do some pieces for them um you

1600
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:42,079
know some might not

1601
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:43,520
need to be formally handled aren't going

1602
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:45,359
to go to you know the criminal

1603
00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:47,359
criminal or civil court it's just

1604
00:50:47,359 --> 00:50:48,480
