1
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:04,400
okay

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,160
let's get started first of all

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,160
thank you for having me as a speaker in

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,480
this village it's my great pleasure to

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,280
give a talk here today i'm going to give

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,640
a talk about

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,080
the basics of adversary infrastructure

8
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,439
tracking

9
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,359
and also how to automate tracking tasks

10
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:26,160
with a tool

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,199
which i'm developing

12
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:31,760
before starting let me introduce myself

13
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,280
i'm ninoseki on

14
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,399
github and twitter

15
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,480
so if you have a question after this

16
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,440
event

17
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,000
please feel free to ask me a question be

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,520
a direct message

19
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,160
and i'm working as a she thought and

20
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:46,800
trust on

21
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,600
safety chain engineer in a japanese

22
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,719
company

23
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:55,039
so i guess you already know that

24
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,079
that english is not my native tongue

25
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,800
and i'm sure that my speaking is not

26
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,520
good

27
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,920
so please be patient with me for a while

28
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,360
and i'm interested in ocean gti

29
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,320
and making things yeah that's all

30
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:19,040
this is the agenda of today's

31
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,080
my presentation i will explain the

32
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:22,960
basics

33
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,960
of adversary infrastructure tracking

34
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,880
and how to automate tracking with a tool

35
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,560
which is named mihari

36
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:38,240
basics of adversary in philosophy

37
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,839
talking stroking

38
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,520
adversary adversaries are

39
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,880
not always but sometimes they are good

40
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,360
friends with bad habits

41
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,479
they reuse source code components and

42
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:00,320
they reuse infrastructures for example

43
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,920
ip address ssl certificate ssh

44
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,119
host key and who is reserved

45
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:10,080
reusing something increases a

46
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,440
possibility of tracking

47
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,080
let's say it's a fingerprint in a crime

48
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,040
scene

49
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,360
you can track a criminal based on a

50
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,840
fingerprint in

51
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,720
jail excuse me

52
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,680
this is a very simplified threat hunting

53
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,879
group

54
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:32,239
you have to do all tasks

55
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,879
in jail to track on advanced track and

56
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,720
adversary but

57
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,800
in this presentation i will focus on

58
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,400
adversary in crossover tracking

59
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,319
it can bring new sheets address

60
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:52,560
new landing page and the new samples

61
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,800
this is my my mind map

62
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,000
for adversary in class of jet working

63
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,879
you can see you can use those

64
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,959
fingerprints for tracking for example

65
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,120
if a host has um ssl certificate

66
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,400
x1 x509 fingerprint and jam

67
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,840
and j3 hash value can be used as a

68
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,159
fingerprint

69
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:21,840
and also if a host has um

70
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,120
http or http service

71
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,560
i mean if it is a website you can use

72
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,000
html javascript style sheet cookie

73
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,879
and the trucker fabicon as a fingerprint

74
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,200
there are two ways to track fingerprints

75
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,040
on the internet

76
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,640
the first one is active tracking

77
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,400
do scanning by yourself by using

78
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,519
admob mascara that map and so on

79
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,760
another one is passive tracking using

80
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,720
third-party services like showdown

81
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,439
census

82
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:08,480
binary edge by aristotle or

83
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,280
possible total

84
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,760
of course there are pros and cons

85
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,199
active tracking can find active targets

86
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,358
but it consumes a large number of

87
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:24,320
computing resources

88
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,240
in positive tracking there is no need to

89
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,560
have your own scanning infrastructure

90
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,360
but you should pay for pay a fee to use

91
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,040
in general

92
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,400
and you may find inactive targets

93
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,479
through passive tracking but

94
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:48,479
in general possible tracking is more

95
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:51,680
cost effective than having your own

96
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,960
scanning infrastructure so

97
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,440
i will focus on possible tracking in

98
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,400
this presentation

99
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,400
let me show examples of fingerprints

100
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,320
taking https example.com as an

101
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,919
example it's a website so

102
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:17,280
it has an html and those

103
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,039
html html hash values can be used as a

104
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,160
used as fingerprints also it has

105
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,360
ssf certificate so it's sheer number

106
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,720
and sha-256

107
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,759
hash value can be used as

108
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:39,840
fingerprint yep

109
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,240
for example

110
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,520
the its html mh3 hash value

111
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,600
can be used for children such and

112
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,880
x509 shear number it's

113
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,400
also it can be also used for short and

114
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,919
such

115
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:06,720
it's sha1 hash value can be used for

116
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,600
census

117
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,840
and sha256

118
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,360
hash value or certificate it can be used

119
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:21,280
all senses such

120
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,840
here is a small chip to take

121
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,919
fingerprints of our website

122
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:29,039
i published a python-based web up

123
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,240
to calculate the basic fingerprints of

124
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,759
our website

125
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:36,800
it is published on github so you can use

126
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,720
it for free

127
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,199
let me show a quick demo of this app

128
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,599
you should put url in

129
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:52,639
form and just push

130
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,800
calculate button then it calculated

131
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,639
fingerprints or example.com

132
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:05,199
dns record with record on the

133
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:09,280
hashes of html unfortunately

134
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,319
it's example.com doesn't have hobbycon

135
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,000
there is no hash of whatcom yeah it has

136
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,120
certificates so these are harsh

137
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,479
hashes or ssl certificate and you can

138
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:23,680
make a search

139
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,479
for example let's make a search on

140
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,840
showdown

141
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,919
like that example.com

142
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,960
example domain also you can make a

143
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:44,319
search based on certificate

144
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:47,280
example.com

145
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,840
and yeah for example you can make a

146
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,039
search on

147
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:55,639
your scan i o based on html's

148
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:58,800
sha-256 hash value example.com

149
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,520
example.com

150
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,840
and let me make another example

151
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:09,440
google.com i believe it has a hobbycon

152
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,520
so yep it has fabicon that i see

153
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,639
also which is a hashes of

154
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,039
public on and you can make a search

155
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:22,878
based on fabicon hash value

156
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,160
yeah this is a you know

157
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,879
google icon

158
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,679
that's all

159
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:40,958
i'd like to demonstrate how to automate

160
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:44,080
tracking tasks with a tool which

161
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,360
is named mihari

162
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,360
mihari is a framework for continuous

163
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,480
based threat hunting it is a

164
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,399
tool to automate partial tracking tasks

165
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,320
it is written in ruby and it is packaged

166
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,760
as a ruby gem so it's very easy to

167
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,040
install

168
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,160
just execute this command jam install me

169
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,200
hari

170
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,240
and just unload me

171
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:21,519
means look out or god in japanese

172
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,800
let me explain how it works

173
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,839
mehari can get input from over

174
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,360
15 services by default for example

175
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,760
showdown senses virustotal positive

176
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,279
total

177
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:39,040
and brever and so on and also it can

178
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,959
integrate custom sources i will

179
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:47,359
i will explain it later

180
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,680
and it me harry can output

181
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,360
findings to a database struck

182
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,040
the hype misp and make webhook

183
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,480
general webhook so

184
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,120
you can get the notification if there is

185
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,560
a new finding

186
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,120
which is matched with a search query

187
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:09,680
then

188
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,040
you can take a look at it

189
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,839
here is a very basic usage of

190
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:21,040
this command makes a search query in a

191
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,240
service

192
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,959
and stores material artworks in your

193
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,518
database

194
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,640
mihari has a built-in web

195
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,680
up so you can check finding spg web

196
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:42,800
up i will do a demo of it later

197
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:45,680
mehari has a dslr to combine a set of

198
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,640
queries

199
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:51,040
as a blue it is inspired by

200
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:56,319
three g7 infrastructure tracking scheme

201
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,440
this is a very powerful method to track

202
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:04,560
adversary so let me explain it in detail

203
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,519
this is me harvey's your schema

204
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:13,120
let me simplify it

205
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,720
required attributes are title

206
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,079
description and queries yep

207
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,560
that's all

208
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,240
for example please remember fingerprints

209
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:30,720
of

210
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,279
example.com this is a rule to find

211
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:40,480
post which sub html same as

212
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:43,839
example.com

213
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,839
mh3h value for showdown

214
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:51,600
and sha one value for census

215
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,120
and sh 256 for

216
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,120
binary edge under your scan so

217
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,600
it means you can combine multiple such

218
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,680
queries in a single rule like this

219
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:12,240
let me explain two practical use cases

220
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,680
the first one is tracking dangerous

221
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,000
password

222
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,480
dangerous password which is also known

223
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,360
as

224
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,639
crypto core we return

225
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:27,760
mimic is an apt group

226
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,240
that targets cryptocurrency exchanges

227
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,480
around the world

228
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,720
sometimes it reuses the same

229
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:39,839
infrastructure for a certain period

230
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,360
for example this is an ip address

231
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,240
used by dangerous password as a running

232
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,680
page

233
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:53,360
you can see it is used for months

234
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,920
so you can know new domains for running

235
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:00,240
pages by monitoring passive dns

236
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,959
i'm using virustotal hunting to find a

237
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:06,240
new dropper that

238
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,800
is used by dangerous password and if

239
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,639
there is a new connecting domain a

240
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:11,920
dropper

241
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,519
i will check or i will check a record

242
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:18,560
of that domain and register it in

243
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,240
mihari do like like this

244
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,360
and then i can get a notification

245
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,920
if there is a new related domain through

246
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:34,959
possible dns

247
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:38,079
the next one is

248
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,639
which is also known as x-radar

249
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:45,519
it is an android malware target south

250
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:46,079
korea

251
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:50,880
taiwan japan germany and so on

252
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,600
this is a mihari rule to track mo khao

253
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,480
landing pages

254
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,480
macau uses a self-signed certificate

255
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,839
for running pages so i use showdown and

256
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:11,199
census to track

257
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,839
track the host which uses that

258
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:16,079
certificate

259
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:18,638
and also

260
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,079
localhost have a very unique web-based

261
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:27,760
pink tracker and it thinks that

262
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,800
ping tracker can be found by an html

263
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,360
hash

264
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,560
or title of

265
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:45,839
an html and combination of open ports

266
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,519
interestingly uses pinterest

267
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:54,959
to broadcast phishing messages

268
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:57,839
it embeds a message in a profile of a

269
00:14:57,839 --> 00:14:59,440
pinterest account

270
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,959
so you can get a new phishing domain via

271
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:03,839
pinterest

272
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:08,880
by monitoring those windows accounts

273
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:13,839
let's automate this task with mihari

274
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,000
in memory you can create create an

275
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,040
analyzer to ingest a custom source

276
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,959
by writing a ruby script

277
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:28,959
this is a part of custom bihari analyzer

278
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:29,839
to track

279
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:32,800
phishing domains in pinterest accounts

280
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,519
so

281
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:36,399
it means you can do more than querying

282
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:41,759
with miari

283
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:45,440
excuse me mihari is written

284
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,480
in ruby so you have to create an

285
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,920
analyzer with ruby

286
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,759
but if you are not familiar with ruby

287
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:59,120
you can make um input via wrestle api

288
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:09,839
let me do demo over me holy wave up

289
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,360
yeah it's a merry rip up and

290
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,279
you can see these artifacts

291
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:22,959
are found by rule i

292
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:26,000
explained before mukha rule

293
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,839
and these ip addresses are matched with

294
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:34,320
uh mokou rule beautiful mock power

295
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,560
and yeah let's take a look at it

296
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:44,240
let's look up it on paris total

297
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,079
and it has many

298
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:53,120
dns records

299
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,279
the macau uses how to say

300
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:00,320
dynamic dna services dynamic dna

301
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,519
dynamic service so it has many

302
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:05,130
domain in general

303
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:08,189
[Music]

304
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:12,400
okay let's let's validate

305
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:19,839
whether it is

306
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,108
let's access this domain

307
00:17:24,108 --> 00:17:26,319
[Music]

308
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:29,919
how has the how do i say

309
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:33,280
it checks user agent so

310
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,639
let's access it be

311
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,559
android android phones ua

312
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,520
galaxy s5

313
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,760
yup it is written in japanese but

314
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:52,400
it impersonates uh how to say

315
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,600
it impersonates a company in japan and

316
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:00,080
it develops apk it's i believe it's an

317
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,440
android marker yep

318
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,720
like that you can combine uh

319
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,520
such queries in a single and track

320
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,080
targets

321
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:15,840
drag on other person like that

322
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,280
yeah i'm using me hari to track my cow

323
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,160
for years

324
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,760
so there are many artifacts

325
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:28,320
like this

326
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,760
also i said that i explained that

327
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:35,520
mihari can make um notification

328
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:39,440
through notification to slack

329
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,360
it's like that

330
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:47,679
it's same value i i demonstrated before

331
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,480
but yeah you can get a notification like

332
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:50,880
that

333
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,240
and you can make uh policy people

334
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,640
on these buttons for example

335
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,679
look upon pirate's daughter

336
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:10,960
or look upon

337
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,840
or senses

338
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,720
i said that mohawk uses self-sign

339
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,160
certificate

340
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,520
this is that one it's very

341
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,760
unique one so it's very easy to track

342
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,960
more call

343
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:33,840
by the way yep okay

344
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,240
conclusion

345
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,960
