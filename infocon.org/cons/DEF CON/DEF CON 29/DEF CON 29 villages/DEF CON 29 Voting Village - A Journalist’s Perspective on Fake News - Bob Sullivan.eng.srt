00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:04,319
hi i'm bob sullivan

2
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:06,240
and you're looking at a picture of one

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,919
of my favorite

4
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:11,280
metaphors the golden spike

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,080
even if you don't remember this image

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,079
it's probably lodged somewhere deep

7
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:16,720
inside

8
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,039
your consciousness at least if you

9
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:22,720
attended primary school here in the u.s

10
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,800
this is a picture of the installation of

11
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,760
the last

12
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,080
railroad tie that connected the first

13
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,000
transcontinental railroad across

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,640
the united states the moment that east

15
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:33,280
and west

16
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,640
coast were connected sort of

17
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,879
it's also a metaphor for projects as in

18
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:39,680
hey

19
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,200
are you done with that last copy edit

20
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,040
that's the golden spike right i can

21
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,520
press publish now

22
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,640
but this moment this image is

23
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,199
not what it appears to be if you had a

24
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:53,199
good history teacher you probably know

25
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:54,320
that too

26
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,800
so why am i showing it how to talk about

27
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,399
fake news

28
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,160
well some people argue that this

29
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,920
photograph was in fact

30
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,360
the very first occurrence of fake news

31
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,400
the modern kind anyway one can argue

32
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,680
that the thing which finally

33
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,880
unified america set the stage for

34
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,520
tearing it apart

35
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,158
let me explain

36
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:21,040
when americans now complain about the

37
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,400
proliferation of

38
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,799
fake news i believe they mean a lot of

39
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,159
different things

40
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,320
the way it was initially used during the

41
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,560
2016 election cycle was to identify

42
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,560
bloggers who were making big money by

43
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,040
writing obvious falsehoods as clickbait

44
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,439
such as pope francis endorses donald

45
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:38,479
trump

46
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,320
push a headline like that out on the

47
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,159
world trick hundreds of people into

48
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:42,799
sharing it

49
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,119
and earn thousands in ad dollars all

50
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:46,079
from a basement in

51
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,520
macedonia great business

52
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,920
today the phrase is often shorthand for

53
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,399
news stories that you just disagree with

54
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,399
and it's a dead end road a phrase that

55
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,640
i'd love to burn from our lexicon

56
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,719
particularly because i think it might be

57
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,079
the single most powerful

58
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,520
phrase in the realm of digital

59
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,119
propaganda this

60
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:07,200
single two-word expression turns off the

61
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,199
minds of otherwise thinking people

62
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:12,000
across the planet now so i think it's

63
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,680
worth talking a bit about its deeper

64
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,879
origins

65
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,959
talking about how we made the wrong turn

66
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,080
that led to this dangerous dead end

67
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,400
in fact the street that led to this dead

68
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,200
end was lined with what could be called

69
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,599
pseudo events 60 odd years ago historian

70
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,519
daniel borstein coined the term

71
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:34,800
pseudo event in a book called the image

72
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,120
it lamented modernity's turn away from

73
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,599
authentic experiences like traveling

74
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,920
which were being replaced by tv programs

75
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:42,640
about

76
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,360
traveling in a way borstein was the

77
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,560
first to cry

78
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,760
fake news in journalism a pseudo

79
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,720
event is pretty easily recognized a

80
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,120
press conference is a pseudo event

81
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,560
most of the time nothing actually

82
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,239
happens at a press conference people

83
00:02:58,239 --> 00:02:58,800
just

84
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,000
talk in front of cameras an event

85
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,720
a real news event is a traveler being

86
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,800
detained at an airport or a person being

87
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,640
laid off a pseudo event is a person

88
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,879
a spokesperson talking about a travel

89
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,879
ban or a commentator talking about

90
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,239
unemployment

91
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,040
or a pseudo event could be a russian

92
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,319
typing facebook comments from moscow

93
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:23,920
smart people marketing types of

94
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,599
companies political handlers

95
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,200
propagandists

96
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,120
figured this out and began to master the

97
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,319
pseudo event

98
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,799
the dog and pony show call a bunch of

99
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:33,920
folks into a room

100
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,519
promise a big announcement hold up a

101
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,680
chart or a sad child or a puppy

102
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,440
and you can dominate the headlines for a

103
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,959
day

104
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:42,640
the real news isn't a press conference

105
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,879
about legislation it's the backroom

106
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:45,360
bargain

107
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,000
that pushes a proposal past 50 votes in

108
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,440
the u.s senate

109
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,360
it's not a ceo promising to reform a

110
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,879
company's misbehaving ways

111
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,799
it's the secret memo from legal which

112
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:56,879
instructs customer service agents

113
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,480
how to continue misleading customers

114
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,599
sudo events aren't necessarily nefarious

115
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,319
they're often the product of mechanics

116
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,319
the golden spike in utah was just such

117
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,080
an event why

118
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,519
taking a photograph in 1869 was hardly a

119
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:14,000
trivial

120
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,160
affair it had to be staged

121
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,320
of course as you'll recall perhaps from

122
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,440
high school history

123
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,080
that photograph suspiciously omits many

124
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,600
chinese workers who did

125
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,440
most of the hard work of laying rail

126
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,520
over the rocky mountains

127
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,720
sudo events therefore are easy to

128
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,440
manipulate

129
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,360
anything that's staged is easy to

130
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,479
manipulate

131
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,120
these necessary mechanics make sudo

132
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,560
events

133
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,759
very very easy to manipulate it should

134
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,759
be obvious that sudo events

135
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,680
rose in power and influence right along

136
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,240
with the rise of visual media

137
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,759
there's a perfectly reasonable

138
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,280
explanation for this

139
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,680
perhaps you've considered it like making

140
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,400
photographs in 1869 making television

141
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,039
is very hard getting cameras set up

142
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:03,280
checking audio levels ensuring clean

143
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,000
clean transmissions i'm just making up a

144
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,960
guess here but

145
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,600
i think it's fair to say that making tv

146
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,880
is often 90

147
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,160
mechanics and just 10 journalism this is

148
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,160
why when you watch cable news

149
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,240
you see almost the same thing day after

150
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,320
day person speaking at podium

151
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,639
person speaking at desk other people

152
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:23,440
talking about

153
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,479
all of this talking that's the easiest

154
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:29,600
and cheapest way to make tv talking

155
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,080
about the unemployment report was easy

156
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,759
going to scranton pennsylvania to talk

157
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,280
to someone who was just laid off

158
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,880
is hard and it's expensive

159
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,720
naturally that means plenty of news

160
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,880
doesn't get covered on television

161
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,919
instead tv is dominated by pseudo events

162
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:46,479
and the

163
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,600
easy visuals they provide this plays

164
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,120
into the hands of folks who are good at

165
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,000
manipulating

166
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,400
easy visuals i'll let you decide for

167
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,800
yourself who those people are

168
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,800
but if you call what you're watching on

169
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,319
tv fake news

170
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,840
i'd like to offer you an alternative

171
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,880
name pseudo events

172
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,880
they're easy to spot as you watch or

173
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,319
read simply ask

174
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,400
what actually happened if it's just a

175
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,600
person speaking

176
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,400
probably nothing has happened or

177
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,520
whatever it is

178
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,160
already happened the back room bargain

179
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,280
was already struck

180
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,080
the victim was already injured one

181
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,000
politician calling another politician

182
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,560
a nasty name that's not news that's the

183
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,039
ultimate

184
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:30,240
pseudo event and of course the ultimate

185
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,919
distraction

186
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,600
but upping the ante on this problem was

187
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,360
the birth of 24 hour news

188
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,000
first on cable and then on the internet

189
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,160
always on news creates a voracious

190
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,080
appetite for pseudo events

191
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,240
there's a massive void in time which

192
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,919
needs to be filled

193
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:49,120
into this void steps power hungry people

194
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,880
who know how to make things sound like

195
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,960
news who know how to mass produce

196
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,319
pseudo events think of pseudo events as

197
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,240
the bug in the software

198
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,639
and politicians or propagandists as the

199
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:01,280
virus

200
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,440
which exploits this bug this

201
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,599
vulnerability

202
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:07,599
a friend of mine lisa napoli recently

203
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:09,280
wrote a great book called up all night

204
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,960
about the birth of cnn

205
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,280
she was there at the time and it's a

206
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,120
great primer on the problem of

207
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,880
hour news when you feel like

208
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,360
all the news you see on tv is commentary

209
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,720
this is why

210
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,000
you're seeing a string of pseudo events

211
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
don't get mad don't get distracted by

212
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,400
the emotional content of this discussion

213
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,319
distill for yourself what has actually

214
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,160
happened change the channel or

215
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,440
read something with actual news in it

216
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,199
just a quick example of how things could

217
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:41,280
be different when i started out as a cub

218
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:41,840
reporter

219
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,680
covering city hall and school boards in

220
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,080
new jersey i made a decision early on

221
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,240
that cost me a few headlines

222
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,960
but i think maybe a better journalist

223
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,080
city council members

224
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,919
love pulling reporters aside and

225
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:56,160
insulting members of the other party

226
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,400
a 30-minute interview might sound a

227
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,319
30-minute interview might include 29

228
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,160
minutes of insults and one mention of a

229
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,160
new road project

230
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,919
initially i did what all young

231
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,360
journalists do and

232
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,840
all teenagers at house parties do i

233
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,680
breathlessly ran to the opposition and

234
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,240
said

235
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,400
did you hear what he said about you how

236
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,919
do you respond

237
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:19,199
and so the cat fight was on my

238
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,000
ink my paper and my words hijacked by

239
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,400
the manipulators

240
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,680
as i grew up and grew into the

241
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,599
profession i learned

242
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,160
to ignore the 29 minutes and get back to

243
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,919
discussion of the road project

244
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:35,360
i was literally no fun some politicians

245
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,599
just stopped talking to me but in the

246
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,159
end i think i serve the readers better

247
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,919
and i've tried to take this lesson with

248
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:45,120
me for the past 25 years or so

249
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,680
insulting someone is just a pseudo event

250
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,959
building a road

251
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:52,480
or building a wall well that's news

252
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,839
these days i think a lot about the

253
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:55,519
impact of technology and

254
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:56,880
what it's the impact it's having on

255
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,959
journalism and on democracy in a larger

256
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:00,000
sense

257
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,440
i'm a visiting scholar at duke

258
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,200
university examining this topic from

259
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,560
many angles

260
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,880
among the most obvious whatever i'm

261
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,560
telling you now about journalism and

262
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,760
pseudo-events

263
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,920
about the role that tv and then 24-hour

264
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,240
news played in fueling studio events

265
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,120
about how easily they're exploited well

266
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,279
that's all exponentially more true

267
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:22,399
about social media facebook's currency

268
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,959
is pseudo events and fake news the more

269
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:25,680
fake the more

270
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,720
pseudo the more algorithmic juice

271
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,279
you all know this you feel it you've

272
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:31,839
seen how

273
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:34,560
years of work by groups like this by

274
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,160
people like hari hirsty to secure

275
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,920
elections and election technology

276
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,560
is being used right now by others who

277
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,360
simply want to

278
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,279
undermine confidence in elections and in

279
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:44,720
democracy

280
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,640
fake news hurts the most when it's close

281
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,880
to home

282
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,600
pseudo events as borstein feared have

283
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,240
replaced

284
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,279
real life for some people there aren't

285
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,440
great easy or obvious solutions to this

286
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,160
problem

287
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,399
but i do believe talking about pseudo

288
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:01,519
events can at least

289
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:03,120
put a seed of doubt in the minds of

290
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,519
people that when what they see on tv

291
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,160
and online not only is it possibly

292
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,600
propaganda

293
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,320
it's almost by definition propaganda by

294
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,040
definition

295
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,920
it's not real a pseudo event if we can

296
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,920
get people to stop watching tv programs

297
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,560
about travel

298
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,399
and start traveling that would be a

299
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,720
great start maybe they can go see that

300
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,920
golden spike in utah for themselves

301
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,519
if we can get people to stop tweeting

302
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,839
and posting and start engaging with the

303
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:31,519
real world over real problems

304
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,079
like roads and immigration and housing

305
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:35,440
and voting

306
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:42,079
well that would be even better thank you
