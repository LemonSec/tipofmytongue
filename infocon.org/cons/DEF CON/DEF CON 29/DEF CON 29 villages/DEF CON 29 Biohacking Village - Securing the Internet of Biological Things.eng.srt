1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,159
my name is tom dickson and i'm the vice

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:03,760
president for the australian institute

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,440
of international affairs in new south

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,960
wales

5
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,400
i'm also the manager of national

6
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,519
security

7
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:11,440
and defence at macquarie university in

8
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:12,880
sydney and it's at macquarie that i'm

9
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,440
undertaking a multi-disciplinary phd

10
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,119
investigating the impact

11
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:18,960
of engineering biology on international

12
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,400
relations security incidents

13
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,080
in this presentation i'm going to

14
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,039
discuss the coming age of robust two-way

15
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:28,240
communication

16
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,599
between living and non-living systems

17
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:33,200
this is something that a co-author and

18
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,880
colleague of mine at macquarie dr john

19
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,399
williams has called the internet of

20
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:39,120
biological things

21
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,960
this is tomorrow's world

22
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,719
a world arising from advances in

23
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,440
optogenetics by electrical and biosensor

24
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,640
mediated communication systems

25
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,160
these are the three increasingly

26
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,600
well-defined substrates through

27
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,600
information management and communication

28
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,360
in living systems

29
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,719
like electricity and chemicals

30
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,800
or perhaps in a more fundamental level

31
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,879
photons electrons and the material

32
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,799
structure matter

33
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,560
let's call them the building blocks of

34
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,880
information's physical instantiation in

35
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,240
reality

36
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,760
and this is what i want to make my own

37
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,360
remarks about

38
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,759
that life is information instant

39
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:18,479
instantiated in reality and therefore

40
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,400
living systems inherit all the strengths

41
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,799
and weaknesses we know so well about

42
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,119
today's digital optoelectronic systems

43
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:28,640
now in part you're watching this because

44
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,200
you already know about these weaknesses

45
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,520
and you know many of the emerging issues

46
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,520
well far better than i

47
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,439
where i want to go in this talk is to

48
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,040
openly discuss the need for applied

49
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,040
force like anticipating emerging

50
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,119
security vulnerabilities arising from

51
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:45,439
this transformative moment

52
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,040
and this is what i mean when i use the

53
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,439
word cyber biosecurity

54
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:50,960
i'm not talking about the protection of

55
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,960
biological information when stored in

56
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,720
inanimate substrates

57
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,200
as important as that issue is rather i'm

58
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,719
focused on the issues that are going to

59
00:01:58,719 --> 00:01:59,680
emerge

60
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,280
from information systems where the

61
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,040
information can transit between a living

62
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,079
organism and an inanimate device

63
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:07,920
where computers can actuate biological

64
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,239
functionality with low latency

65
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:12,239
and where biological organisms can

66
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,640
actuate inanimate cytophysical systems

67
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,520
with similar latency

68
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,959
now i've often heard it said about

69
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:21,120
research interfacing neurological

70
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,080
substrates with opto-electronic devices

71
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,239
that a door once opened can be walked

72
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:27,760
through both ways

73
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,319
my talk today is about that door

74
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,080
and thinking about the impact that door

75
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,760
might have on our world

76
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,400
that thinking has to happen now before

77
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,560
the door has been opened

78
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,239
let me begin by sharing my screen

79
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,760
this is the puzzle

80
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,840
a simplified map of reality that

81
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,599
outlines the issue i want to address in

82
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,840
this talk

83
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,160
this map covers over length scales on

84
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,159
our planet from small to large

85
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:59,599
on the left it captures a small

86
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,040
selection of anima information

87
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,239
substrates

88
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,080
and on the right a small selection of

89
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,159
inanimate substrates

90
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,000
at the bottom is a simplification of the

91
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,319
building blocks

92
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:13,040
in hindsight i would have included rna

93
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,360
dna in humans on the left and i wouldn't

94
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,040
have narrowed the electromagnetic

95
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,280
spectrum to visible light waves but i

96
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,599
hope the image makes its point

97
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,440
there is just as much if not more

98
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,040
information naturally occur on the left

99
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,120
hand side of this map than there is on

100
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,319
the right side and that's the puzzle

101
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:31,920
now if i separate out the concepts

102
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,760
behind the internet of things the

103
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,680
internet of everything and the internet

104
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,760
of biological things this map becomes

105
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,360
quite useful

106
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,760
the potential of two-way communication

107
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,760
between living and non-living systems

108
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,239
mediated by optogenetic bioelectrical

109
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,480
and biosensor-based systems

110
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,319
means that we need to re-evaluate the

111
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:54,080
future of networked information systems

112
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,239
till now information has primarily

113
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,400
traveled one way on this map

114
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,920
information has been extracted from

115
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,799
living systems into inanimate systems

116
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:04,560
where it has been analyzed manipulated

117
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,080
and stored

118
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,159
the security of those endpoint inanimate

119
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:09,680
systems has been a prime point of

120
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,799
concern

121
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,319
no one seriously countenance the

122
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,560
possibility of hacking those inanimate

123
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,720
systems by compromising the living

124
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,238
systems prior to information harvest

125
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:22,160
however it is something entirely more

126
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,759
reasonable to suggest the information

127
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,360
that's about to be communicated from the

128
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,520
right hand side of this map over to the

129
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,960
left hand side

130
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,320
could we compromise prior to transfer

131
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,080
those moments when information is still

132
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,560
digitally instantiated comprise a

133
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,600
potential vulnerability

134
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,800
the mrna vaccines a perfect case study

135
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,720
for this designed in silicon

136
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,960
manufactured by cytophysical systems

137
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,479
injected into humans to patch

138
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,639
vulnerability within the mammalian

139
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,000
organism

140
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,919
though the time scale might be long

141
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,759
compared to digital information system

142
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:58,560
standards the pattern is clear

143
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,240
the era of two-way information

144
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,520
communication between living and

145
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,800
non-living systems has arrived and 2020

146
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,919
marks a point of no return

147
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,320
i think about the mrna vaccination

148
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,240
process as similar to analog computing

149
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,800
engineering prior to the 1950s

150
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,880
it is just the beginning

151
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,960
in the 1940s and 50s how many people

152
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,440
accurately predicted any of the 21st

153
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,680
century's emergent security issues that

154
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,440
have arisen from the progress of

155
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,440
optoelectronic engineering and the

156
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,080
information and computing sciences

157
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,840
we are completely out of our depth when

158
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,280
it comes to predicting anything about

159
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,800
the types of security issues on the

160
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,479
horizon

161
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:37,440
and

162
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,960
these security issues are going to be

163
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,720
specific to bio-informational

164
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,320
engineering that is engineering the

165
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,800
integration of cyber and biological

166
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,520
information systems

167
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,960
hence there is an urgent need for

168
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,280
horizon scanning of a new client on a

169
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,639
new scale

170
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,000
the key question being how do we

171
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,720
anticipate new and novel threats arising

172
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,039
from the internet of biological things

173
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:00,560
especially when we have little to no

174
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,039
idea what an ibt enabled world will

175
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:06,599
actually look like

176
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,400
the canary and the coal mine for this

177
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,319
transition to a bio-informationally

178
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,479
enabled world is the convergence of

179
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,160
synthetic biology and artificial

180
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,600
intelligence

181
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,520
now i'm fascinated by this convergence

182
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,280
because of its value in representing the

183
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,120
current reality

184
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,120
but also because of its symbolic moral

185
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,520
ethical and philosophical value now if

186
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,520
we move past the identification of risks

187
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,520
threats and vulnerabilities for a moment

188
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,039
and consider that new to the world

189
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:36,639
organisms are being designed by

190
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,160
algorithms

191
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,560
what does that even mean

192
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,120
i've closely followed delphi scans run

193
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,240
by the centre for the study of

194
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,520
existential risk at cambridge university

195
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,000
they've run two scans on issues arising

196
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,840
from advances in engineering biology and

197
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,160
i recommend both of them to you

198
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,160
their scanning technique is based on a

199
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,840
model used to identify issues in

200
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,680
conservation and ecology with a decade

201
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,360
of use behind it

202
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,440
and that delta process in turn is based

203
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,039
on a model that was pioneered by us

204
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,840
defense in the mid-20th century

205
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,599
that one was created to anticipate

206
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,919
technological surprise

207
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:13,680
and that's where we are again today

208
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,599
living with an urgent need to anticipate

209
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:19,199
technological surprise

210
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,759
without digressing too far another work

211
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,360
i recommend to you is future shock by

212
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,400
alvin tossler published in 1970 it is an

213
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,639
extremely prescient work

214
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,720
for many the future has arrived too soon

215
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,240
and this experience of the future

216
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,720
arriving unexpectedly is particularly

217
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,479
pronounced among policymakers since

218
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,120
covert 19 reshaped the world

219
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,759
covered 19 was biological and predicted

220
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,759
by a good many experts and pandemics had

221
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:45,840
sat on international and domestic watch

222
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,479
lists for decades yet it still surprised

223
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,360
many when covert 19 occurred and many

224
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,360
are still suffering future shock because

225
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,120
of it

226
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,599
my contention is a simple one

227
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,240
natural origin biological events though

228
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,840
they are the most likely biological

229
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,080
event to cause catastrophes are not the

230
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,960
only type of biological event out there

231
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,039
engineered biological weapons entered

232
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:10,720
the playbook sometime during the 20th

233
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,759
century

234
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,360
and there they have stubbornly remained

235
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,520
as high-risk high-impact low-probability

236
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,639
events

237
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,720
but bio-informational engineering has

238
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,560
the potential to create dozens if not

239
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,319
hundreds of new types of biological

240
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:23,680
events for which we don't even have

241
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,720
words to describe them right now

242
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,800
i would label this black box as an area

243
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,919
of unknown stochastic biological shocks

244
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:33,679
connecting information systems of the

245
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,159
living world to the non-living world is

246
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,080
going to vastly increase the potential

247
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,360
for stochastic biological shocks why

248
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,279
because we're creating closed and open

249
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,120
control loops between information

250
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,959
systems in the biological world in the

251
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,720
digital

252
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,360
as we know all too well from the digital

253
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,480
world

254
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,720
critical issues in information systems

255
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,880
can scale logarithmically

256
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,560
are we prepared for new kinds of

257
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,000
biological shocks to scale

258
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,519
logarithmically throughout the global

259
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,680
biome of course not

260
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,600
i would suggest that we need to urgently

261
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,760
begin preparing for new types of

262
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,839
stochastic biological shocks be they

263
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:11,839
natural accidental or engineered in

264
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:12,959
origin

265
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,279
this means more horizon scaling

266
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,040
constantly iterating innovations in

267
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,200
applied foresight and integrating those

268
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,120
findings into policy and practice in a

269
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,399
preventative manner

270
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,480
on a much faster time scale than occurs

271
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,880
today

272
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,200
now this sketch is of a one-way

273
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,120
information process involving a sentinel

274
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,240
plant

275
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,000
and i'm rather fascinated by sentinel

276
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,440
plants

277
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,640
for those who haven't followed their

278
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,480
development closely they're natural or

279
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,480
transgenic organisms planted among a

280
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,399
crop field and closely monitored because

281
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,160
they provide early warning of various

282
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,240
natural processes being experienced by

283
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,680
the surrounding crops

284
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,680
their heat stress water stress water

285
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,720
stress lack of nitrogen or phosphate

286
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,240
they can also monitor for pest and

287
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,080
blight outbreaks

288
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,760
now at the moment we're going through a

289
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,120
transition

290
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,640
sentinel plants have typically been

291
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,959
monitored by humans or drones at length

292
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:07,600
scales visible to the human eye

293
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,200
with the invention and development of

294
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,040
some next generation chemical detection

295
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,360
systems think diabetic monitors for

296
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,959
plants

297
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:17,040
the biochemical signaling mechanism

298
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,880
mechanisms of a sentinel plant can be

299
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,200
hardwired into cyber physical system

300
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,800
control loops

301
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,120
this is still a one-way loop

302
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,720
but i want to emphasize that over the

303
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,640
next decade sentinel plants are very

304
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,640
likely to be incorporating micro and

305
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,200
nanoscale information export systems

306
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,959
that means signals that aren't visible

307
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,560
on the centimeter scale can be monitored

308
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,160
one of these signals i'm particularly

309
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,240
interested in is the immune system

310
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,360
reaction of plants to unknown pathogens

311
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,040
that might have been transmitted to them

312
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,240
by nearby mammals grazing on foliage

313
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,760
indeed one of the more out there

314
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,440
proposals i've made with some of my

315
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,880
co-authors is that we should consider

316
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,279
using sentinel plants in the wastewater

317
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,600
streams of avatars in order to monitor

318
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,160
for disease x encounters

319
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,760
let's get in front of the next zoonotic

320
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,760
biological event rather than wait for it

321
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,600
to occur

322
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,959
but the second point i want to make

323
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,200
about this control loop is that there

324
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,800
are many different points where the

325
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,480
biological information

326
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,440
is transiting an inanimate substrate

327
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,720
these points

328
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,320
to vulnerable to standard cyber issues

329
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,920
however if the inner workings of the

330
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,600
sentinel plant have been monitored by a

331
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,440
device in a crop field

332
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,680
and that device itself is not being

333
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,079
monitored regularly by drones of humans

334
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:33,760
then compromising the hardware at the

335
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,480
central plan communication system can

336
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,399
offer a pathway into all of the linked

337
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,079
systems

338
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:42,160
i'd rate that as an unlikely event for a

339
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,399
prop field but if we translate the

340
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,440
scenario into a military context

341
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,200
and sentinel plan is monitoring for

342
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,200
molecular signatures associated with an

343
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,279
adversary's troops assets or chemical

344
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,680
biological and radiological weapons

345
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,279
then the risk and consequences of

346
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:58,880
hardware being spoofed hacked or

347
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,839
compromised rises

348
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:03,519
pervasive and persistent living

349
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,680
monitoring systems that target micro and

350
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,760
nanoscale information signatures are a

351
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,839
disruptive

352
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:10,639
technology they're likely to be

353
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,480
disrupted from a military standpoint the

354
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,560
maritime and land domains but they're

355
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,079
also likely to be destructive from a

356
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,000
civilian standpoint

357
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,519
because their proliferation throughout

358
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:22,000
urban rural and wild environments seemed

359
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,279
somewhat likely over the coming decades

360
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:26,639
many environmental monitoring

361
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,720
regulations can be automated by these

362
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,120
systems which may make their uptake by

363
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,720
mining and resources extraction

364
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,880
companies likely

365
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,720
similarly many environmental monitoring

366
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,639
processes in homes and cities can be

367
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,480
automated this way meaning air quality

368
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,240
and the presence of viral particles in

369
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,839
the air can be monitored in close to

370
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:45,440
real time

371
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,680
and even if we remove the plant entirely

372
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,200
the training towards the molecular

373
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,160
monitoring of the planet is on and it

374
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,320
needs to be prepared for

375
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,800
but again this is only a one-way control

376
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,200
loop we're not yet actuating biological

377
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,959
functionality from an inanimate

378
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,959
substrate

379
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,320
now this is a closed loop by a two-way

380
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,560
bio-informational system

381
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,399
my opinion is that innovations in this

382
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,160
kind of system are going to contribute

383
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,639
to scaling up bioreactor base by

384
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,240
manufacturing

385
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,000
there's probably an inherent limit in

386
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,920
how big a bioreactor can get before the

387
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,920
underlying biomass will start to deviate

388
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,079
from its intended functionality

389
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:29,839
but optogenetic and bioelectrical

390
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:32,240
controls may be able to contribute to

391
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,200
increasing the edge of that limit

392
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,360
perhaps more importantly these types of

393
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,440
information based controls are very

394
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,519
likely to optimize production teeter

395
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,440
rates and yields

396
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,600
this is a gateway technology for gaseous

397
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,160
carbon reuse and the inexitable movement

398
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,600
of global manufacturing to a

399
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,639
carbon-negative bioeconomy

400
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,800
this image underpins the potential of

401
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,959
biomanufacturing in the 21st century for

402
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:59,040
me especially when it comes to circular

403
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,639
economy tools for mitigating and

404
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,440
adapting to climate change

405
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,600
however this system is also a textbook

406
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,399
example of a cyberbiological interface

407
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,160
and though it is a closed-loop interface

408
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,240
it is clearly a hybrid surface that

409
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,160
opportunists and advanced persistent

410
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,120
threats will seek to navigate

411
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,480
now i'm not going to recite to you the

412
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,079
anticipated economic bounty of

413
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:22,800
tomorrow's bioeconomy but the forecasts

414
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,560
all point one way

415
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,839
the companies that are going to use

416
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:27,920
these systems or relying on these

417
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,360
systems in their supply chain or in

418
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,519
their waste chain are all going to share

419
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:32,959
something in common

420
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,120
the cyber biosecurity risks that arise

421
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,360
from reliance on cyberbiological

422
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,279
interfaces

423
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,519
now i've gone quite deep quite fast on

424
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:42,880
this example and so i want to reel it

425
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,519
back to a singular question

426
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:48,560
how is a non-technical policy

427
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,880
understand and interact with the

428
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,120
security risks of the system let alone

429
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,880
the economic potential

430
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,959
the answer we need to find a new

431
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:58,639
language for describing the world

432
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:01,120
encompassed by this emerging technology

433
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,519
a language that is sufficiently complex

434
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:05,360
to adequately describe the underlying

435
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,760
scientific and technological reality and

436
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,839
a language that is simple enough so that

437
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:11,440
policy makers can interpret and

438
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,800
understand the opportunities and

439
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,560
challenges at hand

440
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,399
where is that language going to come

441
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:17,600
from

442
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,440
well in many ways i think we can learn a

443
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,800
lot from the path of artificial

444
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,360
intelligence over the past decade

445
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,360
i recall when the ai hype cycle was

446
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,440
really setting off a few years ago and

447
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,959
every second week there was an opinion

448
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:30,560
piece in the content marketing outlets

449
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,560
of the mckinseys and veins of the world

450
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,800
describing how ai was important and why

451
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,519
business leaders needed to pay attention

452
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:38,959
each one of these articles though it

453
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:41,040
didn't contribute that much

454
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,199
refined and guided popular culture

455
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,600
understanding of ai's possibilities and

456
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,519
the language used to describe those

457
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,279
possibilities

458
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:50,959
we need this to happen all over again

459
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:52,560
for the dawning age of the cyber

460
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,959
biological interface because the cyber

461
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:57,279
biointerface is fundamentally different

462
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:59,839
to a cyber physical system

463
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:01,680
now as you know a cyber physical system

464
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,000
doesn't monitor manipulate or interact

465
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,160
with biological information substrates

466
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,680
in the material reality it is

467
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,440
manufacturing

468
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,600
cyber physical systems do not transfer

469
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,959
information between animate and

470
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:14,880
inanimate matter

471
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,199
cyber bio interfaces do

472
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:18,880
and though these interfaces are not all

473
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,040
that common today they do exist and they

474
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,880
are proliferating

475
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,040
cyber bio novelty is going to take many

476
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:29,279
by surprise but it doesn't need to

477
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,839
now before i conclude this presentation

478
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:33,279
i want to make a few remarks on

479
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,199
anticipating cyber biotechnology

480
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:36,720
surprise

481
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:41,600
and the importance of cyber biosecurity

482
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,000
this is my final slide

483
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,720
and i'm going to conclude with it

484
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,480
this is far more than a hypothetical

485
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,880
situation but it is one that we need to

486
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,120
actively prepare for

487
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,360
this sketch is based on a 2016 proof of

488
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,360
concept study where humans wearing e e g

489
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,600
devices linked up to an optogenetic

490
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,559
system

491
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,799
in a mouse model could activate

492
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:08,720
engineered e coli

493
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,559
within that mouse model to express

494
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:11,919
insulin

495
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:15,039
just by thinking about it

496
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:16,839
this is the world of bioinformational

497
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:19,520
engineering we're headed towards where

498
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,760
medication can be switched on by devices

499
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,400
by optogenetic control loops actuating

500
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,559
functionality and engineered microbiomes

501
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:29,039
and this is just one example

502
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,280
i'm sure you can let your imagination

503
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,160
run a little bit wild on how important

504
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,280
it is

505
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,039
going to be to secure this cyber

506
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:40,880
biosurface from opportunists and apts

507
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,559
this is the cyber biosecurity

508
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:44,880
conversation we need to be having

509
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,400
this is the dual use research

510
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,280
conversation we need to be having

511
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,240
perhaps most importantly the med tech

512
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,480
startups of the world that are going to

513
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,559
pioneer this space all need to be

514
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:58,640
brought into a cyber biosecurity first

515
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,960
way of thinking without bankrupting

516
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,720
their limited venture capital runway

517
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,160
now i fully acknowledge some of the

518
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,160
sketches i've shown in this presentation

519
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,559
may never eventuate in reality

520
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,000
but the science and technology has

521
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,200
sufficiently advanced that

522
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,679
bioinformational engineering is going to

523
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,880
begin appearing in commercial

524
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,840
applications over the coming decade

525
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,679
and there is an obvious first mover

526
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:23,840
advantage for those companies and

527
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,400
nations that pioneer this technology

528
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,160
especially from a standard setting point

529
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,520
of view

530
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,600
that includes data standardization but

531
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,200
also the standardization of security

532
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,880
protocols or creating long-term

533
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,039
structural weaknesses in the industry

534
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:39,360
standard security settings

535
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,200
for a bio-informational communication

536
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,200
process

537
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,200
now from my perspective this is what

538
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,600
cyber biosecurity is all about

539
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,520
anticipating and preparing for the

540
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,120
transformative potential of the

541
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,160
cyberbiological interface

542
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,240
and figuring out how to navigate the

543
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,240
attack surface that that is going to

544
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,559
create

545
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,840
it's been an absolute pleasure to

546
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,240
prevent present to you thank you very

547
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,360
much for listening
