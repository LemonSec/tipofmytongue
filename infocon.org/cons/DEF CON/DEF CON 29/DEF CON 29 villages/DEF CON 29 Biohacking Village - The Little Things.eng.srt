hi everyone

4
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:33,679
i missed you

5
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,280
i still miss you

6
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:41,360
and

7
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,480
it's been

8
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,239
been weird

9
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:48,079
for everybody

10
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,960
i know you guys know

11
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,800
and nobody wants to talk about

12
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,559
you know

13
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:02,239
the big thing that made

14
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:03,280
the last

15
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,159
while

16
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,320
real difficult

17
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,720
and i understand

18
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,520
so

19
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,560
i'm not going to talk about that today

20
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,439
and usually when

21
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,280
i do talks and get to see all of you

22
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,320
it's a real celebratory thing and

23
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,240
i get to talk about all the great things

24
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,920
that all the amazing people that i'm

25
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,520
lucky enough to work with have managed

26
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,520
to do

27
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,640
and

28
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,799
they have managed to do

29
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:35,920
a lot

30
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,400
of really amazing things in the interim

31
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,200
but

32
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,360
i'm not going to talk about those today

33
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,759
either we have a lot of announcements

34
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,840
and those will come soon

35
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,439
but

36
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,200
just didn't seem like the right thing to

37
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,320
talk about this time

38
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,960
so often

39
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,960
the things that we work on and the

40
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,799
things that we talk about

41
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,360
are very grand in scale we're always

42
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,680
trying to work on things that have

43
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,399
it's very high impact very

44
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,879
politically controversial

45
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,319
very

46
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:19,280
broadly applicable very macro ethical

47
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,879
but i thought i'd shift gears a little

48
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,800
bit and talk about some of the

49
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,800
microethical things

50
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,280
some of the things that

51
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,959
don't save lives but

52
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,360
get you through the day maybe a little

53
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,480
more some of them maybe save lives but

54
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,280
smaller things everyday things survival

55
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,400
things

56
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,920
because we're all kind of wired into a

57
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,400
bit of a survival trip right now

58
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,879
and there's this

59
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,400
danger

60
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,080
that we're all in

61
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,760
of being in a mode of survival

62
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,640
that we never come out of

63
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,120
if you want to look at some of that i

64
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,400
recommend

65
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,640
the neurobiology of it the human

66
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,400
behavioral biology of it was studied

67
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,120
very well by a guy named robert sapolsky

68
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,920
i'm a huge fan of his and

69
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,440
he

70
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,200
has been generous enough to put all of

71
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,280
his lectures on

72
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,840
youtube in a playlist

73
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,840
i'll try and put those here

74
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,799
so that you can watch them if you want

75
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:28,959
additionally i am so much a fan of that

76
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,400
that i

77
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,159
managed to put together an entire bundle

78
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:35,280
of

79
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,280
all of the books and all of the articles

80
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,879
that he referenced so that if you work

81
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,799
through his course you can

82
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,799
read through them

83
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:43,760
um

84
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,599
i'll try and put that

85
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,040
here

86
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,720
we'll see if that actually works in the

87
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,200
editing

88
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,000
we've all

89
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,959
felt

90
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,439
the impact

91
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,599
things have shifted

92
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,840
despite whether

93
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,840
you've actually been touched

94
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,120
by

95
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,400
the virus in question

96
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,599
we've all felt health impacts

97
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,840
slowing metabolisms

98
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,959
increasing myopia

99
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,519
depression

100
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,000
fitness degradation

101
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,919
all these things happen

102
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:30,240
and

103
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,360
one of the things that's really

104
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,639
disappointing

105
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,639
about

106
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,479
thinking about all the ancillary health

107
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:40,680
effects that have been coming along

108
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,080
including all the secondary outbreaks of

109
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,160
other things that are

110
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,479
also quite scary is that

111
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,880
they seem to get left by the wayside

112
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,560
there's this rather

113
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,960
disappointingly callous approach that so

114
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,000
many people seem to bring of the

115
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
oh but did you die

116
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,800
sort of question and if the answer is no

117
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,800
it's

118
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,639
you're not going to get a lot of

119
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,840
attention or care or

120
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,080
help or solutions or people working

121
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,240
towards those sorts of things

122
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,639
which is

123
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,400
sad

124
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,800
and needless

125
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,440
and disappointing

126
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,840
so

127
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,080
i'm gonna try and talk a little bit

128
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,240
about some of those things

129
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,320
and it's

130
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,600
one of those things that's very

131
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,360
individual it's very personal and it's

132
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,639
personal to all of us and i know that

133
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,280
i have lost a lot of people to

134
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,120
depression

135
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,120
in general and especially during this

136
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,360
era

137
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,520
and

138
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,400
that

139
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,479
the typical advice

140
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:53,840
that

141
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,199
is given in the cases of looking at

142
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,560
things like self-care

143
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,919
is

144
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:03,759
of a very

145
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,000
childish and kind of condescending

146
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,919
nature

147
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:09,759
where

148
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,680
rather obvious

149
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,400
or entirely impossible

150
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,240
or

151
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:21,680
fairly useless things are talked about

152
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,479
the

153
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,560
sort of

154
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,639
you know

155
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,080
have you looked behind the sofa

156
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,880
no no my goldfish are dead

157
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,960
sort of problem that um

158
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,120
is all too common

159
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,120
and

160
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,280
and it's really sad it's really sad and

161
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,360
it's really uh

162
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,400
enough to make you kind of angry when

163
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,319
the same thing is get repeated over and

164
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:55,919
over again oh

165
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,560
well you should drink less you should

166
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,080
quit smoking you should go out and

167
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,360
exercise

168
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,080
there's not a single person

169
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,319
that

170
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:07,840
doesn't think

171
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,599
that those things would be good to do

172
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,360
the very fact that those coping

173
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,599
mechanisms are necessary is indicative

174
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:20,000
of the fact that things are in a much

175
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,039
more dire state

176
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,960
and

177
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,960
there are other people who will sort of

178
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,199
throw out these panaceas of saying that

179
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,360
if you take enough ketamine or mushrooms

180
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,360
that you know everything will

181
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,599
come up roses and of course everything

182
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:37,280
is much more complicated than that the

183
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,120
human psyche is much more complicated

184
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,319
than that

185
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,000
your life is much more complicated than

186
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,840
that everyone's life is more complicated

187
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,759
than that and

188
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,759
that's one of the things that there

189
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,000
needs to be a little more recognition of

190
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,919
for all the great

191
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:53,520
things that

192
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,800
science and western medicine have

193
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,080
managed to unpack about

194
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,199
human biology and

195
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,440
neuropsychology

196
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:08,240
we don't have good fixes for most things

197
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,400
so

198
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,160
i think this is going to be kind of

199
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,520
short

200
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,599
but i just wanted to throw out a couple

201
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,360
of

202
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,440
little fixes for

203
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,840
mostly little things

204
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,199
that don't

205
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:25,360
solve things per se but make them a

206
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,560
little bit better

207
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,599
and

208
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,840
i've found aren't terribly well known

209
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,000
you might know some or all of these

210
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,360
already

211
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,080
but i haven't found a lot or at least

212
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,200
enough

213
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,958
being discussed about most of these

214
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:41,919
things and so

215
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,480
maybe this handful of tricks will

216
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,800
make things a little easier for you or

217
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,640
somebody you know or somebody you care

218
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,880
about

219
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,880
so the first one

220
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,920
is that

221
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,320
i imagine most people

222
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,519
are

223
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,200
probably drinking a little more than

224
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,000
they

225
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,920
used to or maybe a little more than they

226
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,200
should

227
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,880
a little more often

228
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,959
and

229
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:11,360
yeah of course that's another one of

230
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,680
these stopgap coping mechanisms that we

231
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,440
all use it's it's very simple it's

232
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,680
ubiquitous it's legal

233
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,040
almost everywhere

234
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,279
and

235
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,399
there are

236
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,640
repercussions to that of course but most

237
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,200
of them are pretty long term and so

238
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,279
they're reversible if you're careful

239
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,920
but in a more immediate sense sometimes

240
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,160
when you've had a few too many and you

241
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,680
wake up in the next morning you don't

242
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,920
feel very good

243
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,880
and

244
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,959
nobody likes a hangover of course it's

245
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,600
not pleasant and at the same time also

246
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,680
it can keep you from

247
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,720
being very productive the next day

248
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,880
so

249
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,080
there are a couple little things that

250
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,399
you can do to make that just a little

251
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:57,839
bit easier

252
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,080
the first one is

253
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,720
an acetyl cysteine

254
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,200
often abbreviated as nac

255
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,680
it's a simple dietary supplement that is

256
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,920
sold in most health food stores

257
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,959
and

258
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:12,959
it's a free radical scavenger and

259
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:15,920
oftentimes if you take some of that in

260
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,200
the morning when you're not feeling so

261
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,560
great it can help after a little while

262
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,160
and of course if it's a really severe

263
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,000
hangover it probably won't do a whole

264
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,440
lot and you might not even be able to

265
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,000
keep it down but in the case that you're

266
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,600
just feeling a little bit rough and you

267
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,079
had maybe one or two more than you

268
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,920
should have it can take the edge off

269
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,320
another thing that's maybe a little more

270
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,519
serious

271
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,600
it's actually a lot more serious

272
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,360
is

273
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,519
when you take a painkiller you should be

274
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,399
careful about which one you take

275
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:49,760
now

276
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,760
oftentimes when we think of painkillers

277
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,000
they're just kind of different brands

278
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,120
but they have different active

279
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,839
ingredients and there are basically

280
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:00,480
in this particular case kind of two

281
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,120
categories there are the ones that have

282
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,279
acetaminophen in them and the ones that

283
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:08,640
don't and these include

284
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,839
brand names like tylenol or panadol

285
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:14,000
and acetaminophen also goes by a few

286
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,120
other names i'll try to list them here

287
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,399
and

288
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,680
the

289
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,600
brands that have them maybe i'll try and

290
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,560
put over here

291
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,640
these are things you shouldn't take if

292
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,640
you have a hangover and the reason for

293
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,279
that is because

294
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:33,040
they're very hard on your liver now

295
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,440
normally that's not a big deal if you

296
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,040
have some pain you can take something

297
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,800
that's going to be effective

298
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,560
and your liver can do a little bit of

299
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,120
extra work and that's fine

300
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,800
but

301
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,959
one of the things about alcohol is that

302
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,440
it's keeps your liver very very busy and

303
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,360
so if you already have an overtaxed

304
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,560
liver

305
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,200
and then you take

306
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,480
acetaminophen

307
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,480
on top of that

308
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,160
it can kill you

309
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,440
and

310
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,880
this is not something that's even

311
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,639
terribly uncommon this happens a whole

312
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,160
lot more often than usual

313
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,120
in fact

314
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,040
one of the

315
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,040
biggest

316
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:17,040
uh dangers of people using vicodin

317
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,800
is not

318
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,279
the vicodin it's not the opiate inside

319
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:22,399
there

320
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,519
that i believe is uh hydrocodone but

321
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,040
it's the fact that there is tylenol

322
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,399
mixed in there

323
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,079
and i personally know people who have

324
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,079
died who were self-medicating with

325
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:33,519
vicodin

326
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,560
uh not in huge amounts but over a long

327
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,399
period of time

328
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,079
and eventually their liver gave out

329
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,079
and their kidneys gave out and they died

330
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:46,079
and by the time they found out

331
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:47,760
it was too late and they were told they

332
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,200
had three days to live and that was the

333
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,600
end of it and it was really sad and i've

334
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,880
seen that happen

335
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,480
in fact more than once in different

336
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,839
cases so

337
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:57,680
be wary of that and if you are the sort

338
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,720
of person who is using

339
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,000
vicodin

340
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,160
for one reason or another

341
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,079
keep in mind that you can do a fairly

342
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:07,680
simple what's called a cold water

343
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,360
extraction to remove the opiate

344
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,839
and use it exclusively while leaving the

345
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:16,399
tylenol behind you can look that up our

346
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,560
friends over at arrowwood have some

347
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,240
instructions i'll try and put those here

348
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,560
as well

349
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,160
so

350
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,440
just be careful

351
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,200
of course

352
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,399
there are a few other things that you

353
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:30,399
can do for hangover one of the things is

354
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,480
that you sap your body with b12 pretty

355
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,639
strongly so you can get high-dose

356
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,560
versions of that the

357
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,399
methylated versions of b12 are probably

358
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:39,760
a little bit better and you can get a

359
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,920
sublingual form the high dose tends to

360
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,000
be 5000 micrograms

361
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,920
maybe take two in the morning

362
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,839
it'll flush out your system pretty fast

363
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:51,360
one of the magic things that you can do

364
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,560
for a hangover is of course give

365
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,760
yourself a saline iv which is very hard

366
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,440
to get access to depending on where you

367
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,199
are uh

368
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:03,440
the united states centauriously blocks

369
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,079
citizens from having access to saline

370
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,440
which is about the safest thing in the

371
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,639
world but there are ways of getting

372
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,720
around that of course

373
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,959
so

374
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,839
keep yourselves healthy keep yourself

375
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:17,519
safe and try and

376
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,920
be conscious if you have a hangover of

377
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,880
not damage yourself any further

378
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,000
another big one is sleep often times

379
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
people are having a hard time

380
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,680
sleep goes but

381
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,440
it's of course hard to sleep well if

382
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,720
you're not sleeping well if they're the

383
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,160
sorts of things that are affecting you

384
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,600
that you're suffering from bad sleep

385
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,440
then the sorts of things that are going

386
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,519
to be recommended again in this sort of

387
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:45,760
paternalistic condescending way or not

388
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,120
going to be terribly effective

389
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,360
there are a couple of stop gap

390
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,440
treatments i know most people have heard

391
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,560
of melatonin

392
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,639
i tend to

393
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,160
recommend to my friends who are having

394
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,839
trouble sleeping that they

395
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:03,120
do a

396
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,600
dose of three milligrams of

397
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,680
instantaneous release and three

398
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:11,120
milligrams of extended release melatonin

399
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,040
and that can

400
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,959
be sort of a combination one that helps

401
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:16,639
you fall asleep and one that helps you

402
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:19,360
stay asleep

403
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,680
on top of that oftentimes one of the

404
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,360
things that will

405
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,880
make sleep difficult is anxiety and

406
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,399
5 htp which is a

407
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,639
again another supplement available in

408
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,720
health food stores is a serotonin

409
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,560
precursor and it can sometimes take the

410
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,079
edge off a little bit

411
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:39,920
you know 200 milligrams or something can

412
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,160
help

413
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,839
some people even go so far as to take

414
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,440
benadryl and of course it's one of those

415
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,199
things where yes benadryl is not the

416
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:49,040
sort of thing that is going to be very

417
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,720
friendly to your system if you're taking

418
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,519
it chronically repeatedly over and over

419
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,680
but again when you're in a desperate

420
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,120
situation where you can't sleep and

421
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,360
nothing else is possible and

422
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,279
and that's something worth considering

423
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,880
we're trying to

424
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,040
reduce histamine levels in the brain and

425
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,320
that

426
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,440
helps

427
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,480
you

428
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,120
fall into an unconscious state so

429
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,839
maybe try that

430
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,000
and one of the other things that a lot

431
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,079
of people in very difficult and

432
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:21,519
stressful times seem to suffer from

433
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:24,320
the sort of brain fog the

434
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,680
uh

435
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,920
seeming degradation of memory

436
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,560
cognition not as sharp as it used to be

437
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,720
focus lessened

438
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,880
um

439
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,560
this is one of the things that seems to

440
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,480
be a major

441
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,839
uh issue in the long haulers and it

442
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:43,120
seems to be

443
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,040
endemic anyway

444
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,040
now there's a whole host of nootropics

445
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,560
out there that

446
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,320
people are expert and you can get good

447
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,399
advice about um

448
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:55,360
some of those are hard to come by though

449
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,320
the

450
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,519
common

451
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:58,959
things that again are

452
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:02,079
more available easy to find

453
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:03,440
include

454
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,199
um coin enhancers and two key choline

455
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,039
enhancers include

456
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:12,959
alpha gpc and dmae both generally

457
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,400
recognized as safe and easily available

458
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,520
alpha gpc is something that can help

459
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,760
tremendously with memory it's important

460
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,880
to take it

461
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,799
uh with food in order for it to be

462
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:26,240
effective but it's something you can

463
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,079
take after breakfast and

464
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,000
you'll know if it's effective for you

465
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,160
after about a week

466
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,320
worth trying and it's not expensive as

467
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,120
well

468
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,280
dmae is another choline enhancer that

469
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,960
works by a slightly different mechanism

470
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,760
that a lot of people indicate

471
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,039
helps them

472
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:46,559
focus better it can sometimes make you

473
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,000
a little less patient a little more

474
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,760
agitated because your brain is going at

475
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,600
a faster pace than most of the people

476
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,880
around you once you have it in your

477
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,880
system so just be cautious and try to be

478
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,559
friendly and nice to the people around

479
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:02,639
you if you're trying to do that

480
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:04,799
so

481
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:07,360
the last thing

482
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,200
i'll mention just a little bit about

483
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,760
again is this question of depression

484
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,960
now

485
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,280
the 5-htp i mentioned before of course

486
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,640
is a

487
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,120
good tool because serotonin precursors

488
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,559
and the adjustment of serotonin in the

489
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,720
body can be helpful it can sometimes

490
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,400
take the edge off and of course there

491
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,000
are degrees of depression as to how

492
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,480
severe it is and how it's affecting a

493
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,840
person

494
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,640
and

495
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,760
how much those different techniques can

496
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,919
help varies if somebody is in the major

497
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:37,520
depression where they can't even get out

498
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,400
of bed then it's very hard to sort of

499
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,240
break out of that cycle to make things

500
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,039
better but

501
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:49,039
here are some tools that will work

502
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:51,520
sometimes for some people

503
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,240
in

504
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:56,080
some brackets of the depression spectrum

505
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,520
and again sapolsky the guy i mentioned

506
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:03,360
in that lecture series the depression

507
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,400
lecture is notably missing often

508
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,200
i'll try and mark that especially here

509
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,559
there's a place where he gave the

510
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,640
lecture that was outside of stanford and

511
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,919
you can

512
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:17,600
hopefully watch that separately

513
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,160
again i mentioned that often there's a

514
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,919
lot of really useless advice out there

515
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:23,440
where people say things like hey have

516
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,760
you tried not being depressed or hey why

517
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,640
don't you

518
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,280
exercise or change your diet or

519
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,799
and and of course

520
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:32,880
those things aren't wrong but they're

521
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,559
often inapplicable for the people who

522
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:38,039
are really suffering

523
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,039
but there is one thing

524
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:43,039
that i have come across that's not very

525
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:44,160
well known

526
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,520
but it is

527
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,520
fairly well documented

528
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,880
and it seems like a lot of action

529
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,360
in the neurobiology of depression

530
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,200
happens in the hippocampus

531
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,440
very well documented the people who are

532
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,120
chronically depressed

533
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,760
their hippocampus will actually atrophy

534
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,080
it will actually shrink and the action

535
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,000
of it will lessen and the hippocampus is

536
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,360
a really fascinating thing it's

537
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,240
covers all sorts of interesting forms of

538
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,640
cognition it's very complicated and

539
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,240
connects a lot of dots and

540
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,080
to have it shrink is a really

541
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,678
interesting thing to witness

542
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,120
the other time the hippocampus atrophies

543
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,440
is when people

544
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,480
utilize turn-by-turn directions when

545
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,840
they are navigating or in other cases

546
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,640
when

547
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,919
they are

548
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:38,720
not

549
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,480
in control of

550
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,200
some sort of navigation and the sort of

551
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,080
way that the human brain

552
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,280
orients

553
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,360
itself is really critical and when

554
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,360
you're no longer in charge of doing that

555
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,200
when you're no longer

556
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,240
uh

557
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,880
when it is no longer incumbent upon you

558
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,840
to orient yourself for whatever reason

559
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,280
if you've offloaded to a machine or

560
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,720
another person or you're just not going

561
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,840
anywhere

562
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,880
then again the hippocampus will atrophy

563
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,360
now interestingly

564
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,280
in a

565
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,159
somewhat predictable form of symmetry

566
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:16,799
in people who spend a lot of time

567
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:21,039
navigating very carefully using only

568
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:24,000
their brain and not a machine

569
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,960
you will see people with a hippocampi

570
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,000
that are

571
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,360
larger

572
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,520
and more active the

573
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,559
very

574
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:35,520
classic cases that of old london cab

575
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:39,039
drivers who were required by law to

576
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:41,919
memorize the structure of london streets

577
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:43,679
and be able to

578
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:46,000
from memory give the

579
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,200
most

580
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,679
efficient route from point a to point b

581
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:51,360
utilizing the

582
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,120
really bizarre one-way system that

583
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,880
exists in london

584
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,840
and and they have

585
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:01,600
huge growth in the hippocampus

586
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,159
so

587
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,840
one of the things that is suggested by

588
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,919
the research is that if you go out and

589
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:12,559
do some navigation

590
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:13,520
without

591
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,679
the help of a machine telling you where

592
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:17,520
to go

593
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,440
that

594
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,799
it can

595
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,720
start to grow the hippocampus and that

596
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,080
if you do grow the hippocampus it can be

597
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,280
a tool in combating depression

598
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,080
so

599
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:33,520
if you know somebody who's depressed

600
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:37,200
and they're in a state where

601
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,960
trying to go outside isn't an

602
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,840
inaccessible thing

603
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,080
try offering that to them

604
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:47,440
sit down with a map or print out a map

605
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,480
and say let's pick a place that's close

606
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,440
by

607
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,159
that you've not gone before and we're

608
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:55,520
going to

609
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,240
pick out a route in advance

610
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,039
and we'll go there

611
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,480
and then you go with them and they

612
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,840
leave their phone at home where they

613
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,120
leave their phone in their pocket and

614
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,799
you stay with them

615
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:11,120
and you let them lead the way

616
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,400
you tell them that you're there that

617
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,600
they're safe

618
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,360
you're not going to get lost

619
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,799
but you're just going to navigate to

620
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:18,320
this point and then turn around and head

621
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,400
home

622
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,039
and if that's too much even just the

623
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:25,039
thought exercise of course can help this

624
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:28,000
just um helping them imagine going to

625
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,600
that place and coming back and what

626
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,760
those landmarks look like and

627
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,400
orienteering there he have even been

628
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,480
suggestions of playing video games that

629
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,799
require you to explore uncharted

630
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:40,559
territory in a virtual space being

631
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:43,840
helpful that might even be worth trying

632
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,760
but working with map and compass or

633
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,760
working with just a map

634
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:51,039
even if somebody is really really

635
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:53,760
emotionally attached to their phone

636
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,159
have them just turn off gps and they can

637
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:57,919
still use the map but they'll have to

638
00:23:57,919 --> 00:23:59,840
figure out where they are from looking

639
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,279
around and they'll have to figure out

640
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:02,400
where to go

641
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,919
from consulting the map and that will

642
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:06,720
activate that system in the hippocampus

643
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,559
and can maybe make a little thing a

644
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:10,320
little bit better

645
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:13,039
especially if it's done repeatedly

646
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:15,279
so

647
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,080
hopefully that can help somebody a

648
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,279
little bit

649
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:21,120
and

650
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,120
we can continue to try and get things

651
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,200
together

652
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:25,919
so

653
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:27,120
again

654
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,960
i will be

655
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,679
back online soon with a lot of really

656
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:34,240
exciting things to announce about four

657
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,840
thieves and what we've done

658
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,559
in the past year

659
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:41,679
and i look forward to the possibility of

660
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:43,760
seeing you all in person again before

661
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,600
too long and i i

662
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,879
hope that that all works out

663
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,840
if you like four thieves and what we do

664
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,919
in general and you want to support the

665

cause

666
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:57,200
find somebody who

667
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,520
needs your help and help them

668
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,520
and do it whether you think they deserve

669
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,480
your help or not

670
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,799
keep each other healthy keep each other

671
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:07,760
safe

672
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:11,158
