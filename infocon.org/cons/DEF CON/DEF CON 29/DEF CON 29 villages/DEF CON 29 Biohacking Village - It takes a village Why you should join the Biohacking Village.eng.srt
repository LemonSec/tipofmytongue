1
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:04,799
hello and welcome uh my name is rob

2
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:07,600
suarez and i'm the chief information

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,280
security officer

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,800
for bd

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,200
bd is one of the largest

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,040
global medical technology companies in

7
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,800
the world and

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,560
we're advancing the world of health by

9
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,600
improving

10
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,279
medical discovery

11
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:24,320
diagnostics and the delivery of care

12
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,840
including the fight against probate 19.

13
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,920
and a little bit about myself and my

14
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,599
background i've been

15
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:33,920
in in healthcare for

16
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,320
more than a decade and i started my

17
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,559
career actually in software engineering

18
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:40,559
and then r d

19
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:43,760
and moved my way into um medical vice

20
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,320
cybersecurity and product security

21
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,760
and um and in recent

22
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,079
years i've been leading cyber street

23
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,079
efforts again across

24
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,879
all of bd and enterprise iit and

25
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,640
manufacturing

26
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,000
and in our products as the the chief

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,040
information security officer

28
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,040
and so now fcd

29
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,280
we believe that there is a patient at

30
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,560
the end of everything we do and patients

31
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,159
don't always

32
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,560
have a say in what devices they're

33
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,240
connected to

34
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,680
each hospital room might have 10 to 15

35
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,840
different devices from multiple

36
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,720
manufacturers

37
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,880
in addition you know each of these

38
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,079
devices

39
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:32,560
very likely contain third-party software

40
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,159
components

41
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,720
and so here's what we

42
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,360
know about all software

43
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,479
it ages like the human body

44
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,880
and instead of aches and pains it

45
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,840
develops

46
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,399
vulnerabilities weaknesses that can be

47
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,200
exploited by cyber criminals

48
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,799
to gain access

49
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,759
to a computer system or to

50
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:58,000
you know various types of data but in

51
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,280
healthcare

52
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,759
we're not just protecting i.t systems

53
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:02,960
and data

54
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,920
we're protecting patients safety

55
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,720
and the stakes could not be higher

56
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,440
you know as as manufacturers we

57
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,760
integrate uh and we really need we need

58
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,760
to integrate cyber street into

59
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,040
everything

60
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,120
of our product life cycle

61
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,800
from r d

62
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,720
through supporting the product in use

63
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,120
and customer support

64
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,760
but that's not enough you know criminals

65
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,360
are working 24 7 to disrupt you know the

66
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,200
production and supply of medical

67
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,400
technology

68
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,360
the cause reaches and compromises the

69
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,599
patient information protected health

70
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:40,959
information

71
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,120
and to disrupt the clinical workflows

72
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,040
and the delivery of health care

73
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,959
it happens

74
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,840
every day and what you see on the news

75
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,480
like the ransomware attacks on

76
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,959
gasoline pipelines and distribution like

77
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:01,599
on meat manufacturing

78
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:04,319
you know it's just a small slice of the

79
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,239
cyber attacks that happen on a daily

80
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:07,680
basis

81
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,480
and you know with hackers working in

82
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,560
real time around the clock

83
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,159
we have to put

84
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,080
we have to up our game

85
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,360
and um and that's why we have to work

86
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,159
together as mobile device manufacturers

87
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:23,760
healthcare providers

88
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,280
industry regulators security researchers

89
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,360
and other stakeholders

90
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,959
and so now i'm oftentimes asked by

91
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,560
security professionals in other

92
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,360
industries is there any benefit

93
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,040
to participating

94
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,640
in ethical hacking events like the

95
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,120
biohacking village at defcon

96
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,519
and my answer is yes

97
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,640
the biohacking village at def con brings

98
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,560
medical device manufacturers and

99
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,879
security researchers together for one

100
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:55,760
purpose which is to strengthen medical

101
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,080
device cyber security

102
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,720
and this approach makes us stronger

103
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,799
really in what i see is three different

104
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,439
ways one is that it allows us to

105
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:06,640
crowdsource

106
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,640
uh cyber security

107
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,040
uh two is that uh you know it allows us

108
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,720
to create a strong community of practice

109
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,839
and three it really promotes ethical

110
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:22,078
coordinated vulnerability disclosures

111
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,520
so ethical hacking events allow you

112
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,600
to crowdsource

113
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,040
security

114
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,479
and events like the biohacking village

115
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:35,040
and the medical device lab at def con

116
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,720
you know bring together the security

117
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,520
community in a way that not many others

118
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,040
can

119
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,160
tapping into the goodwill of a large

120
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,320
group of security researchers now that

121
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,440
means accessing a broader set of skills

122
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,440
and expertise

123
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,000
and at bd you know we do our own

124
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,160
security research and vulnerability

125
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,560
assessment and threat modeling but we're

126
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,479
always asking ourselves

127
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,880
what are we not seeing

128
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,120
and as an organization we talk a lot

129
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,160
about having a growth mindset

130
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,720
viewing challenges as opportunities to

131
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,720
grow and improve

132
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,120
having the courage to iterate try new

133
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,160
things and embrace change

134
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,880
and if you've never participated in an

135
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,880
ethical hacking event

136
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,520
because you don't want weaknesses

137
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,919
or vulnerabilities to come to light then

138
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:29,520
you're missing out

139
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,280
we all need to put customers and

140
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,800
patients first

141
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,639
and what matters is uncovering

142
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:37,120
vulnerabilities and communicating these

143
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,360
acts the actions

144
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,320
to your customers you need to take

145
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,240
and and also participating in the

146
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,240
biohacking village can literally save

147
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,320
patient lives it's that impactful

148
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,960
so you know instead of shying away and

149
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,080
collaborating with security researchers

150
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,400
we need to build a strong community

151
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,600
practice

152
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,880
for advancing cybersecurity

153
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,080
the reality is that cyber attacks are

154
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,400
happening more frequently

155
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,440
every single year and in fact every

156
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,039
single day

157
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,080
and

158
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,080
you know around the world

159
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,520
many hostels

160
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,759
don't even have a single person

161
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,600
dedicated to

162
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,199
cyber security

163
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,560
which makes it hard to address

164
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,120
vulnerabilities that exist in mental

165
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,199
devices

166
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,440
we can help by creating a strong

167
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,520
community of practice

168
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,240
and i i encourage all of us in the

169
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,400
medical device community to make a

170
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,520
commitment

171
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,919
to be called to being collaborative

172
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,240
not just with our fellow medical device

173
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,880
manufacturers and their customers

174
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,919
but also last but not least

175
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,639
with security researchers

176
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,319
you know there's no

177
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,080
there's there's so much knowledge to

178
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,280
share

179
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,599
and and we work

180
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:02,400
with healthcare and medical technology

181
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,720
trade association around the world

182
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,000
and the information and expertise shared

183
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,479
helps us respond more effectively to

184
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:15,360
potential threats and vulnerabilities

185
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,000
and it also becomes a feedback loop that

186
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,759
helps us design

187
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:22,720
more secure and resilient products and

188
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,080
it allows us

189
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,479
to provide actionable guidance to our

190
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:29,360
customers and security researchers are

191
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,720
are absolutely a component you know to

192
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,560
to these practices

193
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,240
and to benefit

194
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,240
you we have

195
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,800
we have to really remember that new

196
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,560
cyber security threats

197
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,120
are emerging every single day

198
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,479
and there will always be more to learn

199
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,120
so it's not a matter of if you'll face

200
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,960
cybersecurity threats

201
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,000
but

202
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,919
it's a matter of when

203
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:56,800
and

204
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,840
defensive strategies are not enough

205
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,240
you know no system can be a hundred

206
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,000
percent protected

207
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,199
against any and all vulnerabilities so

208
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,759
that's why we need to work together to

209
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,039
build a strong community of practice

210
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:16,000
and events like the biohacking village

211
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,759
promote ethical

212
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,400
coordinated vulnerability disclosures

213
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,240
and and really support improving our

214
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,840
processes for

215
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,400
for doing volatility disclosures

216
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,800
it's time to take the stigma

217
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,520
out of vulnerability disclosures

218
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,360
every security researcher at the

219
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,080
biohacking village you know signs the

220
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,958
hippocratic host for hackers

221
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:42,479
and and they agree to the biohacking

222
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,760
village rules of engagement

223
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,279
and this includes a court of for

224
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:52,240
coordinated vulnerability disclosures

225
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,560
so it's important to note that the

226
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,880
discovery of a previously unknown

227
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,040
vulnerability needs to be addressed with

228
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,399
a sense of urgency and due diligence

229
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,880
fda guidance directs manufacturers to

230
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,360
disclose vulnerability notifications

231
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,279
within 30 days

232
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,760
and to remediate or provide compensating

233
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,279
controls within 60 days

234
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,600
and this allows time to confirm the

235
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,959
finding establish any potential clinical

236
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:23,680
impact if needed and identify

237
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,120
mitigations and compensating controls

238
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,320
that we value the relationship with

239
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,040
security researchers

240
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,160
and and so you know along the way you

241
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,399
make sure to communicate where you are

242
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,560
in this process with uh your

243
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,320
stakeholders including security

244
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,760
researchers

245
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,880
trust goes both ways and remember that

246
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,640
your shared goal is patient safety

247
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,560
it's also important to communicate with

248
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,360
your customers and patients about your

249
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,760
coordinated vulnerability disclosure

250
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,839
processes

251
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:01,760
when cyber security vulnerabilities

252
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,839
emerge

253
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:06,240
provide guidance so customers can manage

254
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,040
potential risk properly

255
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,320
and at bd

256
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,880
we do this by posting products through

257
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,200
bulletins and patches to our

258
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,360
cybersecurity trust center and our

259
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,320
website at bd.com

260
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,600
forward slash

261
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,680
cyber security

262
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,440
this is something that health care

263
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,279
providers and patients should expect

264
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:30,720
from every medical device manufacturer

265
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,200
and posting a vulnerability disclosure

266
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,720
doesn't mean your organization has a

267
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,480
cybersecurity problem

268
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,640
it means that you're enabling customers

269
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,720
to properly manage that through

270
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,200
awareness and through guidance

271
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,000
and coordinated disclosures in fact

272
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,560
a sign of maturity for an organization

273
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,440
so

274
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,480
collaboration and transparency

275
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,920
are essential

276
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,160
to advancing cyber security in health

277
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,360
care

278
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,160
and in health care cyber security isn't

279
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,880
just about protecting systems

280
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,000
it's about protecting patient

281
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,040
patient data patient privacy

282
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,440
and patient safety

283
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,680
events like the biohacking village allow

284
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,160
us to crowdsource cybersecurity

285
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,760
they allow us to build a community

286
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,880
practice

287
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,839
and develop and mature coordinated

288
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:26,640
vulnerability disclosure and in our

289
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,640
processes

290
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,160
as a result

291
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,079
we can make our systems

292
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:34,000
products and customers

293
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,920
and our patients more secure

294
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,800
hi i'm scott schindledecker chief

295
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,519
product security office for bd

296
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,279
i wanted to share my perspective on

297
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,959
participating in events like the

298
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,680
biohacking village

299
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,760
it's an exciting opportunity

300
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,360
especially for my team and if you're

301
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,200
looking to motivate your team

302
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,800
i highly recommend getting involved in

303
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,079
the biohacking

304
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,720
village medical device lab

305
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,959
it's a controlled environment

306
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:04,800
and provides an opportunity for my

307
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,160
security team

308
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,720
to create a partnership with our product

309
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,760
teams and rally around the event

310
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,200
in years past we've been able to

311
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,920
participate in person due to covid we're

312
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,680
participating remotely this year but

313
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,560
still a great event

314
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,079
one of the benefits is being able to

315
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:23,360
work with fellow medical device

316
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,240
manufacturers and security researchers

317
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,079
it's a lot like having external third

318
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,000
party independently assess

319
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,279
the product

320
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:35,360
and its internal security controls

321
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,279
we know our products

322
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:38,639
and we communicate

323
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,560
what we know with customers about how to

324
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,959
use them in a secure environment

325
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:44,480
but participating in an event like

326
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,160
biohacking village

327
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,000
gives us an opportunity to validate our

328
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,360
assumptions

329
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,120
it provides great feedback for

330
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,399
improvement

331
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,560
put simply it pushes us further on our

332
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,600
mission to control risk

333
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,360
we do our own pen testing and threat

334
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,360
modeling but this goes a step further

335
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,440
event like the biohacking village

336
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,360
really serves our customers

337
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,360
making our products and processes more

338
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,720
secure

339
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,320
so with that i want to turn it over to

340
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,000
anastasia tomorrow

341
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,240
we will tell you a bit about how events

342
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,959
like biohacking village can also help

343
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:21,360
improve coordinated disclosure processes

344
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,760
across the industry

345
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,560
hi i'm nastasia and i'm a director of

346
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,000
security operations at bd we focus on

347
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,839
security operations for our

348
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:34,399
manufacturing product and enterprise

349
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,959
environment and at bd our experience

350
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:39,120
with security researchers has really

351
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,240
been overwhelmingly positive events like

352
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,399
biohacking village really improve

353
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,959
communication between bb and other

354
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,399
device manufacturers

355
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:51,199
and security researchers and as a result

356
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:53,120
we're really able to participate in a

357
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,880
more consistent coordinated

358
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,519
vulnerability disclosure process

359
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:00,160
and what we talk a lot about is that our

360
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,320
customers can't protect what they don't

361
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,399
know and so when security researchers

362
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,720
provide cd and other device

363
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,880
manufacturers with research about

364
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,279
vulnerabilities it's an opportunity to

365
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:14,240
provide transparency and awareness for

366
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,720
our customers we're always actively

367
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,600
working on releasing vulnerabilities

368
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,279
it's really just something that's part

369
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:23,279
of the software life cycle and this is

370
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,040
really in alignment with making

371
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,320
information available to our customers

372
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,440
which really kind of shows our

373
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,440
commitment to manage reported

374
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,720
vulnerabilities so we launched our bd

375
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,720
cyber trust center last year in an

376
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,360
effort to increase that transparency and

377
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,839
that collaboration with both researchers

378
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,920
and customers we really want to make it

379
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,800
easy to connect with our teams their

380
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,639
forms on our website where security

381
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,360
researchers can go through and report a

382
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,519
vulnerability and then the biohacking

383
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,199
village allows us to have those

384
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:57,920
in-person touch bases and so this year

385
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,519
obviously we know there's a lot of

386
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,760
virtual sessions happening and even

387
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,760
virtually we're able to connect with

388
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,800
researchers so it really is um a good

389
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,120
experience overwhelmingly positive for

390
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,600
both cd and researchers alike to be able

391
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,480
to to connect and talk through our

392
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,560
process around coordinated vulnerability

393
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,560
disclosure
