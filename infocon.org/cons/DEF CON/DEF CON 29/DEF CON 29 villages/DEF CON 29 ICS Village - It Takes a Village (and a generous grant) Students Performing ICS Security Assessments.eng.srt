1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,320
hello everyone thank you for tuning in

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:03,280
to our talk

3
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,520
it takes a village students performing

4
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,520
ics security assessments

5
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,440
my name is dennis scar i'm tenured

6
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:10,800
faculty here at everett community

7
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,440
college and i was also a member of the

8
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,160
national guard where we were performing

9
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,600
a handful of missions

10
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,080
in different critical infrastructure and

11
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,840
our unit even stood up training

12
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,840
and trained other cyber operators on how

13
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,439
to perform assessments

14
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,880
in an ics space i took that experience

15
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,640
and the lessons learned and rolled it

16
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,880
into the fabric of a five credit class

17
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,719
here at everett community college and

18
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,399
we're presenting on the first

19
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:39,520
class to actually go through this

20
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,719
experience and performing their

21
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,320
very own mock ics security assessment

22
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,640
special thanks to all the volunteers at

23
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,079
ics village

24
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:51,840
i know it takes a lot of work and effort

25
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,280
to get things off the ground for these

26
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,120
events and we appreciate the opportunity

27
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,719
to share our story

28
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,120
every year i would return to the defcon

29
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,039
and spend a lot of time at the ics

30
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:01,600
village

31
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,559
i really appreciated having access to

32
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:05,840
the technology

33
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,040
the talks culture and even the community

34
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,560
involved with everything

35
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,280
and when we had an opportunity to pursue

36
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,560
a grant

37
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,600
and you know possibly you know build up

38
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,119
an ics program

39
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:20,799
i immediately thought of those

40
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,880
experiences that i had

41
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,000
at defcon leading up to our pursuit

42
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,799
of this program

43
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,360
so when the grant opportunity kind of

44
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,280
came to our team we're exploring a lot

45
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,560
of different technologies and which we

46
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,000
could possibly invest in

47
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,600
and you know the typical stuff comes up

48
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,119
like should we go cloud server more

49
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:42,159
networking stuff

50
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,799
and you know obviously cyber security is

51
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,320
big and a lot of student interest is

52
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,759
there in that space

53
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,520
but it took a nudge from my team to say

54
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,600
hey you do a lot of cool missions you're

55
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,439
doing all this ics stuff like why don't

56
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:54,560
we go there

57
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,920
so you know we did and i reached out to

58
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,320
tom van norman who's the co-founder of

59
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,920
ics village

60
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,320
and you know i said tom like what you

61
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,159
guys have is extraordinary

62
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,720
what would it take to actually get that

63
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,560
here on our campus

64
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,280
and we came with a plan put in the

65
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,239
offering

66
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,720
and you know we were i was thrilled i

67
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,000
was actually blown away that we actually

68
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,280
had this opportunity and i'm very

69
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,040
thankful for the state of washington

70
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,200
to actually provide that to our students

71
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,239
when we created the assessing and

72
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,239
securing control systems class we wanted

73
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:33,040
to make sure

74
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,879
that we could have students from

75
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,400
information technology

76
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,400
operational technology and business

77
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,440
programs

78
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,519
all funnel up into this class so we can

79
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,200
have this

80
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,560
cross-cut of culture all within uh the

81
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,239
same class

82
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:49,920
in in my experience with these

83
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,319
assessments it really took those three

84
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:55,120
areas to come together to understand you

85
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,640
know not only how the business is

86
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,680
how businesses function but

87
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,640
how does the business processes map down

88
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,400
to the information technology

89
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,519
that technology supports those processes

90
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,599
and then i t how does that actually

91
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,200
relate to

92
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,280
all your different uh operational

93
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,040
technology down together and once you

94
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,040
have those dependencies mapped

95
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,519
and you understand how the whole system

96
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,120
truly works

97
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,440
that's when you can start looking at how

98
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,200
to effectively apply security controls

99
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,680
and find those crown jewels within an

100
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,480
organization that require

101
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,760
deeper layers of protection

102
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,239
all throughout the quarter students were

103
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,239
working as a team to actually prepare

104
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:42,959
briefings

105
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:47,360
to a a mock uh manufacturing

106
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,280
uh group you know where they had to

107
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,560
present different threats

108
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,040
uh that happened in real time so when

109
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,480
oldsmar happened

110
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,120
and the colonial pipeline we rolled that

111
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,720
into the fabric of the class they had to

112
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,080
actually kind of

113
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,920
take what information was available to

114
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,599
them and then present

115
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,599
to a group in terms that they actually

116
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:06,640
understand

117
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,319
so we built on those skill sets over the

118
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,879
quarter and during the last week

119
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:14,000
they were presented a company that

120
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,439
actually you know enjoyed their

121
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,918
presentations and hired them

122
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:21,040
to assess their company and the company

123
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:21,918
i created was

124
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:23,919
uh fantastic plastics it's a plastic

125
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:25,680
mold injection company

126
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,800
and they provide a product

127
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,000
to a aerospace manufacturer in the area

128
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,440
and they also have dod contracts

129
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,840
so students had seven primary tasks that

130
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,520
they had to deliver on

131
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,479
and in addition to you know working with

132
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:42,800
uh

133
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,280
the customer which was me through email

134
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,560
they had to

135
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,120
perform a physical assessment of this

136
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,560
environment

137
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,040
and then perform uh or give a

138
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,320
presentation

139
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,680
uh to the owner and the owner in this

140
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,800
exercise was tom van norman from ics

141
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,840
village

142
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,160
and they they knew that they had to

143
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,440
present to someone

144
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,440
knowledgeable they didn't know that they

145
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,560
had to present to

146
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,240
the creator of the wall

147
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,560
sharing their experience of this

148
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,880
assessment are two students

149
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,160
chris and alex who took a a

150
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,600
big interest in ics over the quarter

151
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,919
and have have a lot to offer to the

152
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:28,880
community

153
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,039
i'm proud of all of our students who are

154
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,520
choosing to get their education

155
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,560
on top of a pandemic right now

156
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,800
but i really want to take a moment to

157
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,000
have two

158
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,039
of uh my students share their story

159

and i came back to everett community

174
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,120
college just

175
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,240
for that class yep

176
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,800
the big uh capstone project that we did

177
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,000
for that class was a

178
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,080
mock security assessment that was

179
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,520
enabled by

180
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,639
an ics security wall

181
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,120
that we were able to acquire thanks to

182
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,360
tom van norman and grim

183
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,080
and what it is is it's a piece of

184
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,199
hardware that it's

185
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,400
an all-in-one kind of ics uh solution

186
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,759
including the hmi the plc and

187
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:58,000
the actual in-out process towards the

188
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,880
end which

189
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:03,520
i guess was a plastic making device

190
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,319
yeah well our our teacher dennis carhy

191
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:07,520
um

192
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,560
works with the air force national guard

193
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,680
and he created this capstone off of his

194
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,199
actual experiences in the field

195
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,720
and so he created this company

196
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,400
like the fantastic plastics

197
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,440
that has a dod

198
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:32,000
priority plastic mix and

199
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,840
and so we were sent in to assess

200
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,119
and secure the

201
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:44,400
the company and uh

202
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,080
the scope of our the scope of our

203
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,440
assessment was

204
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,280
having to do with the operational

205
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,879
technology part of the network

206
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,960
we did not um deal with the business

207
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,919
side

208
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:56,160
though in this scenario there was

209
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:56,960
elements

210
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,879
of the business network as well that i

211
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,160
think were critical

212
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,680
as you know it's important to kind of

213
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,680
tie those two networks

214
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,879
uh together because you know the air gap

215
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,919
is not a reality in 2021 that's my kind

216
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:10,160
of

217
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,319
favorite quote now but what we did is we

218
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:17,120
we mapped out all the relevant network

219
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:17,919
devices

220
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:21,039
you know every every single critical

221
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:24,400
device and service and data on the on

222
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,680
the network and we

223
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,000
were able to scan for vulnerabilities

224
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,160
that were

225
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,440
had the potential to impact those uh

226
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,599
elements that are most critical to the

227
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:36,958
system

228
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:40,080
right yeah we um

229
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,719
had actual physical access to this wall

230
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:43,200
on

231
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,360
the campus and so come in

232
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,640
hook the laptop into the switch and have

233
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,000
access to the network

234
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,120
and uh took because it took me a little

235
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,240
bit till i figured i had to change the

236
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,320
ipa address to be on

237
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,200
the actual network but from there we

238
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,080
were using a

239
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,600
netdiscover and wireshark to do passive

240
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,800
scans

241
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,160
to like try to see what was out there on

242
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,760
the network

243
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,200
and uh since ot

244
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,839
really doesn't like in map we actually

245
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:24,720
got uh signed off to actually

246
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,080
be allowed to use nmap to

247
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,399
start pinging actively pinging and

248
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,800
actively scanning

249
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,839
for vulnerabilities and what was on the

250
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:38,080
network and then we used grass marlin to

251
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,000
just get a really good map

252
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
of everything and uh after we

253
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,240
had our map we were allowed to

254
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,160
take the next step in the assessment and

255
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,680
get a foothold

256
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,440
into the network and start

257
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,839
playing around with what was on the

258
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:58,959
network

259
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:01,279
yeah not so much trying to break

260
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:02,240
anything but just

261
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,760
see what was on there right it was

262
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,320
really

263
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,800
great fun uh seeing you uh run the

264
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,839
python script

265
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,959
that then made the water tank or start

266
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:13,600
to

267
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,279
go haywire that was yeah

268
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,320
that was pretty good good times yeah

269
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,360
what well using the the

270
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,279
pie modbus discovery script and so being

271
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:28,160
able to see the

272
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,120
registers for the plc's and everything

273
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,079
and like watching them

274
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,360
change i'm like oh that's what controls

275
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,959
this thing let me change

276
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,959
use a different script and change that

277
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:40,880
register like

278
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,720
put the the water output the maximum

279
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,519
and watching dennis being like what the

280
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,160
heck was that

281
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:54,880
and then other plc is like oh i'm gonna

282
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,800
change the register numbers on this and

283
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,000
having the entire wall

284
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,600
shut down well lucked out that i mean

285
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,079
this

286
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:05,040
this thing is well made so just a few

287
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:05,519
pres

288
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,120
button presses and it's back up and

289
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,440
running but just like realizing like

290
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:09,920
okay

291
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:14,000
this is something you could do to like

292
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,560
effectively like shut down a business if

293
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,120
this was

294
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,480
in real life and uh then doing

295
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,440
uh the ettercap dos attack on the hmi

296
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,440
and like locking out

297
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,200
the ability to change the

298
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,480
controls and like

299
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,120
this is like this is something we're

300
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,880
we're seeing nowadays

301
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,920
and like we can actually visually see

302
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,000
like and be right there when this kind

303
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,920
of stuff happens

304
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,640
and like okay now we see how these

305
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,680
people are getting in

306
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:52,079
and doing these attacks

307
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,959
yeah so there's there's a huge kind of

308
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:56,079
exploration

309
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:58,720
based um element to this exercise it's

310
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,560
something that you don't get with a

311
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,760
something like a sim or a vm

312
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,680
which is you know a lot of my previous

313
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,279
security classes were based around those

314
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:08,720
kinds of exercises

315
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,800
this was very much a you get to

316
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,680
go in and you and there's like the whole

317
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,880
network out there for you

318
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,160
to to explore and to to work with and

319
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,880
but but do you also do it in a very or

320
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,000
controlled and organized

321
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,279
manner this is based off of dennis's

322
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,760
time with the national guard and the air

323
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,800
force

324
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,800
he's been doing security assessments

325
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,000
with them

326
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,120
for 10 years i believe he was involved

327
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,120
with the 2016

328
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,360
elections he did some cyber security

329
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,959
assessments relating to that i believe

330
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:44,480
to voting

331
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,680
uh system hardening all right yep

332
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,760
and so he was able to bring a lot of his

333
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,399
experience into this exercise and

334
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,639
he was able to build a highly kind of

335
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:55,920
modular

336
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,959
um you know

337
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:02,399
project that it's it's it was all up to

338
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:03,519
kind of the students

339
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:07,200
to um to make with it what they will and

340
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,600
and one of the kind of big takeaways

341
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,639
that i personally got

342
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:13,279
out of it was having to deal with teams

343
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:14,560
and working with

344
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,000
um the time uh crunch element because

345
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,760
you know when you're doing a security

346
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,760
assessment uh professionally

347
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,440
you're not doing it by yourself you're

348
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,200
working as a part of a team and you have

349
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:25,920
to

350
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,639
you have to know how to divide roles up

351
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:29,200
and

352
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,680
how to kind of tackle the challenges

353
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,240
that you're

354
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,800
faced with in a logical manner and

355
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,760
that's kind of

356
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,040
what uh dennis helped us with but

357
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,880
there was no hand-holding involved it

358
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,480
was a very much kind of

359
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,839
sink or swim kind of situation which

360
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:49,519
and he always says this um you learn

361
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,279
you really learn the most when you're

362
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:52,639
going through something hard

363
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,720
like you that's when the best learning

364
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,079
happens right is when you're

365
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:57,839
struggling right because if you're no

366
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,920
pain no gain as they say

367
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,519
yeah and yeah and like

368
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,040
when you're you're you're actually doing

369
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,760
this assessment like we were an actual

370
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,600
like red team and

371
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,639
like you don't in those kind of

372
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,880
experiences you don't have

373
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,440
somebody behind you going oh oh you did

374
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,160
that right

375
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,680
or like this is how you get to that like

376
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,320
we actually had to troubleshoot and

377
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,000
figure this stuff out

378
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,120
and but also sting within scope

379
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,320
of our

380
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,160
like objectives objectives and their

381
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,360
sod and all that stuff

382
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,920
right you had to get authorization to be

383
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,760
able to do certain things i remember

384
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,040
when we wanted to um try using default

385
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,800
credentials to get into some of the

386
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,720
network devices that's something you had

387
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,240
to get authorization to do

388
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,440
which again is that's how would be in

389
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,639
in the real world you know a business

390
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:03,680
might not want you

391
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:07,600
accessing uh certain you know documents

392
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:12,240
um so it was highly effective as an

393
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,040
exercise

394
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,279
in that sense and again if you think

395
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:17,120
about it this is how

396
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,360
um security assessments go in in the

397
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,800
real world every network is going to be

398
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,920
different

399
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,199
um for me i'm actually

400
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:28,240
working with a an aerospace manufacturer

401
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,279
currently myself and so we're constantly

402
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:32,560
dealing with

403
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,360
these principles um almost all the data

404
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,240
that we work with

405
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,839
is highly controlled it's called cui uh

406
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:40,480
controlled

407
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,639
unclassified information department of

408
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:45,120
defense is one of our clients so

409
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,399
it's if we don't if we fail to protect

410
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,639
uh the data and the confidentiality of

411
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:51,839
that data

412
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:54,399
it's it could mean huge uh fines for us

413
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:55,920
or loss of face it

414
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,079
certainly we can lose customers because

415
00:15:58,079 --> 00:15:59,920
of that um

416
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,720
with our assessment we were primarily

417
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,440
working with

418
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,639
you know all that i just mentioned that

419
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:07,680
was part of it

420
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,440
and then the really exciting stuff was

421
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,880
actually disrupting

422
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,000
the uh the the hardware itself

423
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,759
which but that would be on the

424
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:17,839
operational technology side

425
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:22,079
um yeah and like for me this

426
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:26,079
class really like being able to be

427
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:29,519
working with the first ics

428
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:33,440
wall in higher education in the country

429
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,600
or even in the world really like

430
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,639
it so solidified like okay cyber

431
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:42,959
security's the way i want to go

432
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,839
so i'm like currently enrolled in sans

433
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,600
so i can get that bachelor's degree in

434
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,880
cyber security

435
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,000
and like looking at

436
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,440
pathways that i can take in

437
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,560
cyber security now and it's like icgs is

438
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,360
one of them and it's like i wouldn't

439
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,959
even think of doing that without this

440
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:03,839
class

441
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:07,280
and so being able to just work with this

442
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,039
actual thing instead of

443
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:11,760
like oh here let me do the point a to

444
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,640
point b

445
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,039
like follow the instructions and the

446
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:16,160
simulation

447
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,760
it's like having this actual

448
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,799
physical thing that you know see

449
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:25,839
how the little things you do

450
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:30,880
affect everything and being like okay

451
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,840
i can do these things now how do i

452
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,799
protect against these things

453
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:39,600
yeah what you're saying really um really

454
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,080
hits home for me because

455
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,039
i was very new to i.t even when i

456
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:46,880
started the program here so i had to

457
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,559
learn the hardware and the networking

458
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:50,000
principles like from

459
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,320
from the ground up and then it was only

460
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,760
when i started getting comfortable with

461
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,160
that

462
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,720
that i started even getting interested

463
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,520
in security

464
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,280
and again those earlier classes they

465
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,960
were all dealing with

466
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,080
just very rigid simulations very kind of

467
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:04,799
clunky

468
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:07,280
vms and i never had a chance to really

469
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,120
like stroke that fire

470
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,120
to to really become invested and

471
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,160
interested

472
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,760
i mean i wanted to but what really did

473
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,480
it was

474
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,880
be this exercise with the wall like

475
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,080
that's what

476
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,679
that's when it clicked like you actually

477
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:24,000
have to do the thing

478
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,559
to know you know if you enjoy doing the

479
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:27,120
thing

480
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,520
or you know maybe you don't but we both

481
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,160
do yeah

482
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,919
yeah i i i've done

483
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:39,280
ics village uh hack the plant

484
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:43,039
plant planet uh ctf and gotten

485
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,760
third and i was like oh cool i i know my

486
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,960
stuff and then i get

487
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,760
a chance to work with like there is so

488
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,880
much

489
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,480
to learn and it's like it's

490
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,760
it's just mind-boggling and so cool that

491
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,840
we got to have this chance to be like

492
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,520
the first ones

493
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:05,200
on the doorstep of this expanding

494
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,320
field of like because ics is just

495
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,280
so in the news right now and exploding

496
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,160
and

497
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,720
like we get a chance to actually work

498
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,320
with this stuff

499
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:20,080
so it totally like

500
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,440
sets us up for like our future and doing

501
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,799
these

502
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,200
doing assessments and doing red team

503
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,640
blue teaming and

504
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,200
all that stuff and we we need to build

505
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,200
the workforce when it comes to um

506
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,880
security experts

507
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,360
and here in washington especially i mean

508
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,200
there's we have such a big aerospace

509
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,160
industry

510
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,600
which is you know like what i described

511
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,480
with what i do it's

512
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,320
it's extremely important to be able to

513
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,320
have these skills and to know how to

514
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,559
um prioritize security from the from the

515
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,400
ground up

516
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,080
so it's it's not only is everett

517
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,280
community college the first place to

518
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:57,919
kind of

519
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:00,240
do an exercise like this and have um the

520
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,039
wall

521
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:03,360
that type of hardware we're also in a

522
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,960
state that really

523
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,240
it's the best place to um to kind of

524
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,360
begin to build that workforce up because

525
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,679
we need we need people who understand

526
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:14,240
this stuff

527
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,080
and who've experienced it you know for

528
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,600
real not just

529
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,280
not you can get a lot from a book you

530
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,960
know but there's no substitute for

531
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,480
experience

532
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,919
yeah so uh that's looking like our time

533
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:26,320

tom van norman for

538
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,400

539
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:44,799
thank you everyone thank you alex

540
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,919

your experience it's been a pleasure

542
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,440
having me in class and i hope to see you

543
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,039
in the control system security community

544
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:54,880
in the future maybe you will be

545
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,720
presenting by yourself at def con in a

546
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,080
couple years

547
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,200
so with that you know you know that was

548
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,480
what we were able to do

549
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,799
with our initial investment but we were

550
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:06,559
even more fortunate to get

551
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:08,640
another round of funding from washington

552
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,000
state

553
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,799
uh to get even more products to expand

554
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:15,039
this to the even the next level

555
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:18,320
and now we have you know individual

556
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,039
trainers with a plc

557
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:22,640
where they can perform a handful of

558
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,880
exercises whether they're programming or

559
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,679
just network

560
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:28,400
uh exploitation traffic analysis you

561
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,159
kind of name it we're kind of building

562
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:31,679
this stuff as we go

563
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:34,400
you know the newest version of grimm's

564
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:34,960
uh

565
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,799
advanced trainers where they have their

566
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:38,880
own firewall switch plc

567
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,360
and an esxi server under the hood you

568
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,720
know we have

569
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,159
you know these will be part of our

570
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:46,720
competitions as well as workshops

571
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,120
and our classes you know here at everett

572
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,720
we teach you know uh

573
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,720
servers networking help desk traditional

574
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,760
i.t stuff

575
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,120
and we're going to be working to

576
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,640
actually incorporate these into all of

577
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,559
our classes

578
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:00,480
so you know students aren't just getting

579
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,840
like an ics class

580
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,159
like they're getting exposure to it as

581
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:05,520
throughout the entire program and

582
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,400
they're getting away from the

583
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,760
traditional i.t stuff

584
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,679
cisco is great but how about you do

585
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:11,120
those same kind of concepts on a

586
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,799
fortinet and see how that kind of works

587
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:13,280
out

588
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:17,760
and you know moving right along our 15

589
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,120
foot wall here uh the latest addition

590
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,760
is a building automation system here

591
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,440
with the latest and greatest alan

592
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,720
bradley plc

593
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,679
some some kind of newer equipment you

594
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:30,240
know we got

595
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,520
rf rfid uh

596
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:37,760
a new hmi and a very very sweet

597
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,400
uh wrapped uh server that's hosting our

598
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,520
ctf server

599
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,640
in here so what this

600
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,280
element adds to our program is you know

601
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,880
obviously there's new technology new

602
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,159
network protocols that we get to

603
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:51,520
interact with here

604
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,640
but you know this is also built into our

605
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,559
college level capture the flag

606
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:58,240
competition it was also developed by

607
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:58,960
grimm

608
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,799
so what this round of funding provided

609
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:03,200
us is a high school level

610
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,240
and college level ctf

611
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:10,080
um where students are actually you know

612
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,720
interacting with all of our technologies

613
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,440
to

614
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,880
uh unlock different challenges here um

615
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,039
and kind of stay tuned for nets in the

616
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:20,840
works
