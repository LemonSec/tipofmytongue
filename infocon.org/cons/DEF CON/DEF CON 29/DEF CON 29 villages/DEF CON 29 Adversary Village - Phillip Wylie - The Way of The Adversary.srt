00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,800
talk

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:12,240
the way of the adversary threat actor

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,240
philosophies and mindsets

6
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:17,920
i appreciate this opportunity to get to

7
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:17,920
present here this year

8
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:25,680
a little bit about myself

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:29,840
my name is philip wiley i have my cissp

10
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:32,399
oscp and sam's gw apt

11
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,920
most proud of those is the oscp that was

12
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,719
a tough

13
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,559
process to study for and

14
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,480
get certified the exam was pretty tough

15
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:43,120
but i learned a lot when i was

16
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:45,360
getting started as a penetration tester

17
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,360
i'd moved over from application security

18
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,200
got laid off from my job

19
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,039
and went to work as a consultant doing

20
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,879
pen testing i'd run vulnerability

21
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:55,440
scanners and worked in appsec for

22
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:57,600
several years and security and worked as

23
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,760
a sys admin but i needed to learn how to

24
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,680
hack so i went through the oscp so

25
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,440
that's a was a really great experience

26
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,840
so i'm very proud

27
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,920
to get that it wasn't easy for me i had

28
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,200
to learn how to hack and that was uh was

29
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,880
a really good one for me to learn how to

30
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,439
hack

31
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,280
i'm also the in my career-wise i am the

32
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:16,880
office of an offensive cyber security

33
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,479
professional instructor

34
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,240
i have been in

35
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:24,560
offensive security for a little over

36
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:26,720
nine years of my 23 plus years of i.t

37
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,640
and cyber security

38
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:31,200
have a little over 17 years of dedicated

39
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,960
cyber security experience i'm an adjunct

40
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,439
professor at dallas college i teach

41
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,360
ethical hacking and web app pen testing

42
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:41,119
i'm also the home school project founder

43
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:43,600
the pone school project was created to

44
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:44,799
give my students a way to further their

45
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,320
education

46
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,000
students down towards the end of the

47
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,040
very first semester i taught were asking

48
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,439
me

49
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,360
where do i go next where do i go to

50
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:55,840
learn more about this subject the

51
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:58,799
college didn't offer any more than just

52
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,880
the ethical hacking class at the time

53
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,560
so i decided to found the palm school

54
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,799
project

55
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,240
it started out mainly being

56
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,440
topics on

57
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:12,080
uh offensive security but with our debt

58
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:14,319
meetings uh then texas

59
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:17,280
didn't have uh a security community

60
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:18,400
there so those meetings tend to be more

61
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,400
than just

62
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,040
uh offensive security we spread into

63
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,520
other areas because the goal is to help

64
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:28,400
people get started in security or people

65
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:30,080
in security to advance their careers

66
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,920
so i'm also the concept creator and

67
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,560
co-author of the pentester blueprint

68
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,720
starting a career as an ethical hacker

69
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,800
this talk came out of a

70
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,959
lecture that i used to give my class

71
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,040
at the beginning of each semester

72
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,560
some of the other uh professors at the

73
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,000
college asked me to give the talk to

74
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,160
their students

75
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,640
and you know the first time i gave this

76
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:56,319
presentation was in uh january 2018 was

77
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:58,239
starting out teaching at dallas college

78
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:01,440
so from january

79
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:02,959
to to november of that same year of 2018

80
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,200
it became a conference talk and i gave

81
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,720
the talk at several conferences

82
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,159
i was featured in the tribe of hackers

83
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,360
red team book

84
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:11,760
and

85
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,360
the publisher wiley publishing asked me

86
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,519
if i'd be interested in writing a book

87
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,280
myself and i thought

88
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:19,200
for a while that the pentester blueprint

89
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,599
would be a good book to

90
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,519
to write about a lot of other resources

91
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:25,360
teach you how to be a pen tester teach

92
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,720
you pin testing but no one was really

93
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,200
telling you this is what you need to

94
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,040
learn before you start these are some

95
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,840
good learning resources to learn pen

96
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:36,239
testing i'm also the host of the hacker

97
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,680
factory podcast and in the spirit of a

98
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,519
lot of things i do

99
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,840
uh it's to help people get started as

100
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:43,599
pen testers so i have different guests

101
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,920
on each episode

102
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:47,360
telling about how they got started in

103
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,959
cyber security

104
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,280
and pen testing

105
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,480
and their tips on how to get started so

106
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,080
this is a

107
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,840
in the spirit of the other thing the

108
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,680
other things i do is try to help people

109
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,920
and help people get started

110
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,319
i'm also innocent lives foundation

111
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:05,680
ambassador the innocent liars foundation

112
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:07,680
helps unmask anonymous child predators

113
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,879
so they work with volunteers the duo

114
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,239
cent that try to collect this

115
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,799
information that they turn over to law

116
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,879
enforcement to hopefully apprehend these

117
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:17,120
these uh

118
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:19,759
these people that are harassing children

119
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:22,240
online these predators i'm also a

120
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:24,639
hacking is not a crime advocate

121
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,320
and this we're trying to take back what

122
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,720
the true meaning of hacker because the

123
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:31,040
media has portrayed it as uh you know

124
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:34,160
we're as we're all cyber criminals

125
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:36,560
and so the goal of that is to help

126
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,800
the name of the the hacker you know when

127
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,320
hacking started out it was more about

128
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,960
people that were actually coding

129
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,639
building things uh you know some of this

130
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,440
came out of the

131
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:49,440
mit railroad club where you know

132
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,880
people were there working with different

133
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,800
technologies and stuff and that in

134
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,000
general you know hackers have really

135
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,880
been more of

136
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,440
uh

137
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,639
makers and and people that were able to

138
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,720
enhance

139
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,720
you know capabilities of product of

140
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,320
different products and software's

141
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,440
different technology

142
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,520
and that's kind of where the hacking

143
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,880
turn came about they were able to hack

144
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,880
it or make it do things it wasn't

145
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,280
supposed to do and enhance the

146
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:16,560
capabilities and then you know over the

147
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:18,400
years we got to learn the term

148
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,000
you know it came to be more about you

149
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,840
know hacking into something be able to

150
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,120
bypass security controls or something

151
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,120
like that finding

152
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,000
bugs and systems but the original term

153
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,800
was

154
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
uh

155
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,680
based on

156
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,720
you know

157
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,520
development because you look at the

158
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,440
hackathons hackathons are programming

159
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:38,479
competitions so these aren't really

160
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:40,000
anything about computer hacking so so

161
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:42,160
hacking is not crime we're just trying

162
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,639
to bring awareness

163
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,880
to the media and the public

164
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:49,360
because as an ethical hacker or a

165
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:51,280
penetration tester offensive security uh

166
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,720
professional over the years people ask

167
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,400
me what do you do for a living and it's

168
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,800
easier to say

169
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,960
ethical hacker than penetration tester

170
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,240
because people don't understand it that

171
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,520
term and it takes a little more

172
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,440
explanation

173
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,639
when you say ethical hacker the intent

174
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,720
is to make it easier for them to

175
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,400
understand but i've had several people

176
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,240
ask me is there such a thing as an

177
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,000
ethical hacker so

178
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,720
you know there's a lot of work that we

179
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,400
need to do to to you know help bring

180
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,600
awareness to that

181
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:22,560
and make up for what what the

182
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,560
the media has done

183
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:29,680
so the way of the adversary threat actor

184
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:32,240
philosophy's mindsets uh

185
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:35,120
most of your most of your uh talks and

186
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:37,360
most of your trainings and stuff that

187
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,600
you go through in cyber security

188
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:42,000
especially offensive security so many

189
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:44,560
times we focus on

190
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
the victims the targets the people we're

191
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,440
testing you're focusing on the

192
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,319
psychology

193
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:53,280
of those specific targets

194
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:56,800
and sometimes overlooking the psychology

195
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,599
and mindset of the adversaries

196
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,680
while

197
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:01,759
understanding the psychology of the

198
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,160
victims or the end users how

199
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:06,080
to successfully social engineer them is

200
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,160
very important but i think to be a

201
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,960
really good adversarial

202
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,440
uh

203
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,520
professional or you know offensive

204
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,280
security professional is to understand

205
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,840
the psychology of who we're trying to

206
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,840
emulate

207
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,680
so the threat actor philosophy

208
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,479
and

209
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,919
psychology should be considered

210
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:28,639
war teaches us

211
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:32,160
to know our adversaries same thing is in

212
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:34,160
martial arts or other combat sports

213
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,479
and sports in general know your

214
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,880
adversary know your opponent

215
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:41,039
even like football teams will

216
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:44,879
review videos of their opponents prior

217
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:46,160
to the game to to see how they work and

218
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:47,840
uh cyber

219
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,000
cyber professional cyber security

220
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,759
professionals are fighting cyber wars so

221
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,240
we must know our adversaries in that

222
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:54,240
same way

223
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,800
so kind of to get into some of the

224
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,319
philosophies and stuff the conscience of

225
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,199
the hacker also known as the hacker

226
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:06,319
manifesto is a small essay written

227
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:08,080
january 8th 1986 by a computer security

228
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,400
hacker who went by the handle or

229
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,879
pseudonym of the mentor

230
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:15,039
his birth name lloyd blankenship

231
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:18,319
who belonged to the second generation of

232
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:20,879
the hacker group legion of doom

233
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:22,479
it was written after the author's arrest

234
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:25,199
and first published in the underground

235
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:27,759
hacker ezine frack and can be found on

236
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:29,759
many websites as they tell as as well as

237
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,199
on t-shirts and films

238
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,839
consider the cornerstone of the hacker

239
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:35,839
culture the manifesto access guideline

240
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,399
to hackers across the globe especially

241
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:41,200
those new to the field it serves ethical

242
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:43,039
foundation for hacking and asserts

243
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,720
that there is a point of hacking

244
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:46,080
that supersedes selfish desires to

245
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,959
exploit harm

246
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,040
harm

247
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:51,600
other people and that technology should

248
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:53,200
be used to expand our horizons and help

249
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,839
keep the world free

250
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,040
so this this is is a good reference here

251
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:00,080
uh for

252
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:02,959
like the the philosophy of hackers and

253
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,880
this is more in the mindset of

254
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:07,680
you know professional hackers

255
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:09,040
or ethical hackers people are trying to

256
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:12,000
do this for good

257
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:14,000
you get into some of the cyber criminals

258
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,600
and hacktivists and sometimes they don't

259
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,080
always take these things into

260
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,000
consideration hacktivists sometimes will

261
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:24,240
be not wanting to injure people but

262
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,240
maybe their uh you know

263
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,160
uh activists towards

264
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,600
you know

265
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,040
climate change

266
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,640
in the environment and they'll just want

267
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,959
to do things like deface

268
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,399
websites or do things to get attention

269
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:38,000
not harm people

270
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,839
but then again there's other there's

271
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,200
other types of

272
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,640
people that use these adversary

273
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,120
techniques that

274
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:48,320
that uh don't keep this in mind so they

275
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,680
that this can kind of vary from the type

276
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,080
of

277
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,440
hacker adversary and keep in mind when

278
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,360
we're talking about hacker we're talking

279
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,519
about the when i'm referring to the

280
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,680
skill set not say you know because

281
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:02,160
hacker and cyber credibles criminals are

282
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:04,320
not used interchangeably it's just the

283
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,200
tools and techniques that are that are

284
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,959
shared

285
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,040
so these the philosophies vary between

286
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:11,120
different types of hackers for example

287
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,959
some nation states and cyber criminals

288
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,279
aren't concerned with the safety

289
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:17,600
and well-being of their targets

290
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:20,079
which contradict the hackers manifesto

291
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:22,000
in some cases during you know nation

292
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:24,959
states during cyber wars

293
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:28,320
and you know they're not concerned with

294
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:30,560
the safety of people maybe the person

295
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,560
doing the action maybe they are but the

296
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,000
people that they are working for

297
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,519
don't consider that so these

298
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,160
philosophies vary that's why it's really

299
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:39,920
hard to define the philosophy so if you

300
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:42,560
went to like a

301
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:44,240
a criminal philosophy compared to just a

302
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,360
hacker philosophy it's going to be

303
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,079
different but there's going to be some

304
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:50,000
things that are even

305
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:52,000
similar

306
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
in

307
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,200
all types of hackers all types of people

308
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,320
that that hack

309
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,040
so

310
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,800
learning and practicing ttps

311
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:05,040
would also you know known as the

312
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:07,519
long-term techniques techniques and tech

313
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:09,519
techniques tactics and procedures help

314
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:11,440
develop the hacker mindset so developing

315
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:13,920
the hacker mindset

316
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:16,480
is is developed by hands-on practice so

317
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,760
working in labs working in

318
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,360
bug bounties and doing these things

319
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,040
hands-on hacking is going to help build

320
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,720
that mindset

321
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,959
and it's always things once you've

322
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,720
worked as a penetration tester or done

323
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:28,240
some sort of hacking

324
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,959
you kind of learned that you know you

325
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,560
see things for instance i was an air at

326
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:34,880
an airport back during my consulting

327
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,800
days waiting for my luggage at the

328
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,560
luggage carousel

329
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,680
and i saw a usb stick laying on the

330
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,680
ground

331
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,279
and the first thing i come to mind as

332
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,720
i'm thinking of what malicious payload

333
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:46,480
is on that

334
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:49,200
that usb stick

335
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:51,200
because i know as an adversary emulator

336
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,120
a penetration tester that

337
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,800
a lot of times we deliver payloads that

338
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,920
way and so will

339
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:59,200
adversaries so will the the bad guys so

340
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,040
when you see those things you just kind

341
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,200
of learn to you get that hacker

342
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:05,200
mentality you start to think like a

343
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,040
hacker and you know you see certain

344
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:10,000
vulnerabilities on a system

345
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:12,399
you know you see apache web server or

346
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,200
you see tomcat and you know sometimes

347
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:16,560
they're

348
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,560
vulnerable to um

349
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:22,480
to uh payload uploads and you know

350
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:23,600
unrestricted uh uploads or

351
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,120
something like you know default

352
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,600
credentials so sometimes you know you're

353
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,440
able to get a payload to that system and

354
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,360
maybe get access so as you see those

355
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,320
things and you develop those hacking

356
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,240
skills learn the different

357
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,000
vulnerabilities and exploits

358
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,440
you kind of learn that

359
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,120
you put those things together when you

360
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,800
see it you think okay this is what i do

361
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,639
next and that's that's kind of

362
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,959
a description of the hacker mindset the

363
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:46,480
hacker mindset's universal whether it's

364
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:48,320
used for good or bad you know it's the

365
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:51,200
intent that is different it's not

366
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,800
necessarily so the the understanding how

367
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,880
to get into things

368
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:57,360
peace kind of uh

369
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:59,839
is universal

370
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,839
so the different adversary types so we

371
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:03,519
have hacktivist

372
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:06,240
state actors

373
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:08,000
cyber crime groups insiders scammers and

374
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,000
script kitties

375
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,360
so these are just you know there

376
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,040
there could be more groups and this can

377
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,760
be broken down further

378
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:18,839
uh your hacktivists are usually just in

379
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:21,200
this because it's for a cause some

380
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:22,160
ideology uh you know you could be people

381
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,800
that are

382
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:26,959
that are you know for the environment

383
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:29,760
and they may go after

384
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:31,600
some uh companies or energy companies

385
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,200
that are polluting the environment

386
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,200
so they're doing it for a good cause

387
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:38,000
they're trying you know it's just taking

388
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:40,480
activism a step further you know one of

389
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,519
the things we look at in the digital age

390
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:45,839
you know protesting certain things were

391
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:47,360
in person just some of the

392
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:50,079
old school hack

393
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:53,199
activist type of

394
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:55,920
opportunities and ways of doing things

395
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:58,560
have transformed along with you know our

396
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:00,959
digital age in the communications

397
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:03,040
uh state actors this could be any you

398
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:05,519
know foreign country

399
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:07,519
nation states that this could be their

400
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:09,120
cyber warfare team this they're trying

401
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:10,480
to possibly steal

402
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,959
intellectual property from other

403
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,240
countries they're trying to disable

404
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,920
you know

405
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,480
power grids or something for other

406
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,519
countries in different you know enemy

407
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,920
states

408
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:24,959
and you get cyber crime groups

409
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:27,360
uh which this can vary the types

410
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:29,440
insiders of course a lot of times people

411
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,959
overlook and there's a higher percentage

412
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,560
of people are insiders and this could be

413
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:35,199
disgruntled employees

414
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,160
and this is not always

415
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:37,920
you know

416
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,079
an actual employee this could be someone

417
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,839
as implanted in the organization

418
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:45,199
i was speaking with a company last year

419
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:46,480
and they were kind of sharing some uh

420
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:48,160
intelligence with us and they were

421
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,680
talking about a company that that

422
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:52,959
produced hardware

423
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:54,399
that someone was implanted from another

424
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:55,760
government there to steal intellectual

425
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:56,720
property

426
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,160
and so these

427
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,800
insiders can also be disgruntled

428
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:04,160
employees you hear the stories

429
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:05,440
of past where someone a programmer for a

430
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:08,639
bank

431
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:10,399
programmed the application to put like

432
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:12,560
like a tenth of a percent into his

433
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:14,000
account from all the accounts in the

434
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,880
bank and after so long they got this

435
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,360
money

436
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:19,279
i never verified if that's true or not

437
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,519
it could could well possibly be

438
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:23,519
sometimes those stories come from

439
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:24,720
from facts but i can't validate for sure

440
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:26,240
but you hear those kind of stories so

441
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,760
you see people that are doing all sorts

442
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,199
of things for

443
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,800
job security

444
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:31,600
they want to document things they don't

445
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,680
want

446
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,120
people to be able to replace them so

447
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,320
sometimes they do malicious activities

448
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,000
they get

449
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,279
you know upset with their employer they

450
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,720
do things

451
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:42,959
still intellectual property and all

452
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:45,839
sorts of things so insiders

453
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:45,839
are also a threat

454
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,720
and so the motivation

455
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,639
and so we some of these are going to

456
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,079
kind of over

457
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:57,040
you know kind of overlap with some of

458
00:15:54,079 --> 00:16:00,480
the the with the uh

459
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:03,279
the other slide but hacktivism

460
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:05,839
financial retaliation cyberterrorism

461
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:07,600
curiosity challenge and thrills these

462
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:09,600
are some of the motivations

463
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,680
and these last three the curiosity and

464
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,680
challenge

465
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,279
these are the more the universal traits

466
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,800
motivations because a lot of people

467
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:19,519
whether they're

468
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:21,600
you know a malicious threat actor

469
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:23,839
or just someone that does bug bound is

470
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:26,160
someone that is playing around hack the

471
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:28,160
box the curiosity and the challenge

472
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,600
and the thrill is kind of a motivator

473
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,759
and this is really some of the things

474
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,360
that motivate like script kitties you

475
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:35,680
know they may find some tool they're

476
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:38,000
wanting to see if it actually works on

477
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:40,000
a production website and so they try it

478
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,079
on a website and

479
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,160
so but this the curiosity and challenge

480
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:46,079
and thrills what gets people into

481
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,839
hacking in general

482
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:49,199
and so financial one of the things we're

483
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:50,399
seeing with financial you know this

484
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:52,639
could be

485
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:54,639
someone directly

486
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:57,040
breaching a system

487
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:58,639
and getting access to funds or

488
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,399
things of value

489
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:01,680
and then there's also you know

490
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:04,559
ransomware has been one of the more

491
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:07,600
popular ways that attackers can monetize

492
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:09,760
their attacks so using ransomware

493
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:11,760
you know files are encrypted and then

494
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,720
the victim has to pay

495
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,039
to

496
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:17,120
you know get the decryption code keys to

497
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:18,959
be able to decrypt their data so this is

498
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,839
one way attackers have

499
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,520
have

500
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,959
found to to

501
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,720
monetize

502
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,640
attacks and using

503
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,559
cryptocurrency they're able to get the

504
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,720
the funds without

505
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:32,400
being traced as easily as you would back

506
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,720
in the days of someone who's doing a

507
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,640
wire transfer to a bank or

508
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,640
or actually sending money physically or

509
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:41,200
whatever so these are kind of ways that

510
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:43,600
those things have kind of evolved over

511
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,600
the years

512
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:49,760
and so how to start so getting to know

513
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,280
the adversary so to get to know the

514
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:54,160
adversary you need to understand their

515
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:56,880
attacks so one of the ways to start out

516
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:58,240
that is kind of a good shortcut to that

517
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,720
because otherwise you can do a lot of

518
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,679
studying and i advise that too if you're

519
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,440
interested

520
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:05,760
in offensive security especially more

521
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:08,000
towards the red teaming or adversary

522
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,919
emulation then it's good to study all

523
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,280
the different attack techniques and

524
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:13,760
stuff out there but

525
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:15,679
mitre has made this more easy for us

526
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:18,960
through the miter attack framework and

527
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:22,080
you can find that at attack.miner.org

528
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,080
and so they've got like a

529
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,080
resource there that you can go through

530
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,760
and see these different atps and the

531
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,120
different ttps that they're using for

532
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,480
their attacks

533
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,320
so this is kind of a way to get to

534
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,320
understand you look at these different

535
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,000
apts and see how they're operating so

536
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,559
the cool thing about that is you know

537
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,080
just from the ttp standpoint this is

538
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:42,240
something that could go across different

539
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:44,160
apts but getting to understand different

540
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:47,760
apts can be important to your

541
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:49,280
organization so maybe you you work for

542
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,799
a power company

543
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,880
or some other resource like natural

544
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:54,799
resource type company and you can go out

545
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,880
and look and find these different apts

546
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:59,440
and find out what may be the ones that

547
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,679
may be attacking your industry more

548
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:04,720
uh specifically so that way you kind of

549
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:06,240
know to understand that adversary more

550
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,520
and then cyber security threat

551
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,640
intelligence

552
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:13,200
so cyber threat intelligence

553
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:15,440
is uh is something good to know whenever

554
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:18,080
you're you're trying to learn

555
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:20,720
what these adversaries are doing so

556
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:23,520
that is a good area to

557
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:26,480
to know is knowing your adversary from

558
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,480
threat intelligence

559
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:36,880
and so if you're not familiar with mitre

560
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:37,960
miter attack is at the address mentioned

561
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,919
above

562
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:41,600
attack.miner.org

563
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:43,520
miner attack is a globally accessible

564
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,799
knowledge base of adversary tactics

565
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,400
techniques based on real world

566
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:48,480
observations

567
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,480
the attack knowledge base is used

568
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:53,200
as a foundation for the development of

569
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:55,440
specific threat models and methodologies

570
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,280
in the private sector in government and

571
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,600
in cyber security product and service

572
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,880
community so this is a good way to you

573
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,640
know you're working on they mentioned

574
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:04,320
here your threat model so you're working

575
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,679
your threat model you know they're

576
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,880
specific when you're building out that

577
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:09,280
threat model

578
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:11,360
uh you want to take in consideration

579
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:13,760
the adversaries that you may have trying

580
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,799
to attack your environment so that's one

581
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,080
of the good ways to know that so this

582
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:17,679
kind of gives you

583
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,760
the uh

584
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:22,320
the definition from minor attacks

585
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,320
website

586
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:28,720
so using the the so getting more into

587
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:30,480
the cyber threat intelligence

588
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:33,760
katie nichols has some really good stuff

589
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:35,280
out there and she's a sans instructor

590
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:38,720
and she's also

591
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,720
i believe she works for

592
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:45,200
i think canary possibly

593
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:49,039
not real sure at that i was looking

594
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:50,640
prepare any slides but any rate katie

595
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:52,799
created this uh

596
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:55,120
this intelligence training

597
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:57,440
with adam pennington so you can access

598
00:20:55,120 --> 00:21:00,000
that on a miner's website so they get

599
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:01,280
some videos and stuff to teach you how

600
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,720
to uh

601
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,480
to learn that threat intelligence and

602
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,000
where i first found out about katie and

603
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,080
the threat intelligence

604
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
i follow her on twitter for years but

605
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:11,600
where i found out about her threat

606
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,480
intelligence involvement

607
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:16,960
was going through looking at some some

608
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:19,280
material from sands some information on

609
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,559
on purple teaming and red teaming and

610
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:23,280
when they cover some of the stuff on

611
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:24,400
threat intelligence uh you know saying

612
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:27,440
sans

613
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,799
uh has katie as an instructor there so

614
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,600
looking at some of the information she

615
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:32,159
had

616
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:35,120
to offer there some links back to

617
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:36,720
mitre and some and also

618
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,240
some other resources

619
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,840
so on that resource there's actually

620
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,520
like some videos and stuff too so that's

621
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,760
a good resource

622
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:45,760
and a cyber threat intelligence

623
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:48,559
self-study plan

624
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:50,320
by katie nichols this is on our medium

625
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:52,000
uh page

626
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,679
and

627
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,960
today to believe all there is just the

628
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:56,840
part one out there but this is a really

629
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:59,200
good place to start that shows you some

630
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:00,880
different places ways to do self-study

631
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,799
on threat intelligence

632
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,640
a good low cost i mean it doesn't cost

633
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:06,799
you anything it's free resources so you

634
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:09,039
go out there and use this to to learn

635
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:10,640
about threat intelligence and also

636
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:11,600
crowdstrike has some good information

637
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,400
out there

638
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:16,559
and what is a what is cyber threat

639
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,400
intelligence by crowdstrike

640
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:20,960
so you can find that on their security

641
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,960
101 section on their website

642
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:26,159
so that's that's a good resource there

643
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:28,000
that you can use

644
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:30,480
and so defending against the adversary

645
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,559
so you you've learned you're

646
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,799
learning this knowledge of how threat

647
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:37,280
actors work so you can use this to

648
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:39,039
defend against threat actors

649
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:42,159
so you know this threat intelligence is

650
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:44,640
good for you know red teamers to emulate

651
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:46,480
adversaries but this is also good

652
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,919
and very important to the defenders to

653
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,360
know what to defend against you can go

654
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:51,919
out look at mitre

655
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:54,880
you look at the different type of apts

656
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:56,240
what ttps that they're using and you can

657
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,679
go in and make sure you're protecting

658
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:00,000
against those you know to watch for

659
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:01,919
those try to detect and prevent against

660
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,720
those type of

661
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:04,720
ttps

662
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:10,000
and so for the offensive side this is

663
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:11,360
kind of the more the area that's more

664
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,960
that i'm more passionate about but i

665
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,559
wanted to include some of the defense

666
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:17,120
stuff in there too because

667
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:18,080
uh in my pintester blueprint talks in my

668
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,840
book

669
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:22,000
you know i share with how

670
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:23,679
offensive cyber security knowledge is

671
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,200
good for defenders

672
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:27,760
it's good for

673
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,440
for sock analysts it's good for

674
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:31,600
network security

675
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:34,000
operation security different defenders

676
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:36,240
not necessarily

677
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,840
just the offensive team but it's good

678
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,799
for the defenders to be able to defend

679
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,480
against

680
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:42,320
the bad guys

681
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,080
so for offensive security

682
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:46,159
using the knowledge to emulate threat

683
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:48,400
actors so you got red teaming this is

684
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:51,279
true adversary emulation and i want to

685
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:52,400
make sure to you know clarify there is a

686
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:54,960
difference

687
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,559
uh red teaming and blue teaming are used

688
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,159
to generically

689
00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:00,320
identify

690
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:02,000
offense and defense

691
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:03,679
but true red teaming is adversary

692
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:07,279
emulation

693
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:08,799
pen testing is using the adversary ttps

694
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,799
during security assessment so you're

695
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:12,799
performing a security vulnerability

696
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:14,720
assessment you're using these different

697
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:16,080
ttps during

698
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,320
that test

699
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,840
a pen tester is trying to find every

700
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:22,400
vulnerability

701
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:24,400
that can be exploited

702
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:26,559
and exploiting those

703
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:29,039
as a red teamer during a red team

704
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:30,559
operation you're trying to find

705
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:32,880
high impact

706
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:35,120
vulnerabilities that can be exploited

707
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:37,440
something that would emulate a breach so

708
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:39,600
you're finding one or two ways in

709
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:42,159
having a secondary weigh-in in case you

710
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:44,159
get that first uh

711
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:46,000
option is blocked or something happens

712
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:48,000
the system that gets root rebooted you

713
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,440
can't get back on having a backup plan

714
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,360
another way to get in so you're doing

715
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:53,520
things that lead to a breach it's more

716
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:55,440
emulating what a threat actor would do

717
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:57,440
like a nation state

718
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:59,679
or those type of actors

719
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:02,320
so you're like i said you're looking for

720
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:03,600
the things that can be breached

721
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:06,559
you're going through

722
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:08,240
and trying to you know get access trying

723
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:10,159
to exfil data see if that's a

724
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,360
possibility see what you can get to

725
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:12,960
you're trying to go undetected

726
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,559
penetration tests

727
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,000
you've got a limited time so you're

728
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:17,679
really not trying to go undetected

729
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,679
you're using vulnerability scanners

730
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:21,600
whereas in red teaming you're not using

731
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:23,120
the vulnerability scanners you don't

732
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,760
want to be caught you're doing

733
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:27,120
techniques that are there to go

734
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,120
undetected so

735
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:31,039
you keep this in mind pen testing

736
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:32,400
less time you're trying to find every

737
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:34,640
vulnerability and try to exploit

738
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,240
everything that's vulnerable

739
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:38,159
and purple team is collaborating with

740
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:40,240
the blue team so red team and blue team

741
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:43,640
working together to try to prevent these

742
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,640
type of attacks

743
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:48,799
and so when it comes to renting

744
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:52,000
operations you plan to execute your your

745
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:53,760
operation so you leverage mitre

746
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,000
to emulate adversaries we have a

747
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:58,640
screenshot here of what the attack

748
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:01,360
matrix looks like

749
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:03,520
so you can see there's a reconnaissance

750
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:05,919
resource development initial access

751
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:08,799
execution persistence

752
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:11,360
privilege escalation

753
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:14,080
defense as defensive asian credential

754
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:15,120
access discovery and lateral movement

755
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,880
and so

756
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,919
you know also maintaining persistence

757
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,840
one of the things that goes on during

758
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:22,559
this time so you can go through here and

759
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:24,240
pick the apt that you want to use

760
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:26,080
choose the apt for your engagement and

761
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,679
execute the operation and then write

762
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,960
your report

763
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:30,720
but also one of the things you can do is

764
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:32,799
you can be more creative

765
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:35,360
as far as choosing apt

766
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:36,799
uh first choice you might find

767
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:39,679
apts

768
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:41,760
that are common to your industry

769
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:43,520
and work with those work on those first

770
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,880
then later on you can get more creative

771
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,559
and

772
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,679
just kind of do your own come up with

773
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:49,760
your own

774
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:50,960
ttps and own attack methods because you

775
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,880
know

776
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:54,400
these things before

777
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,799
the community knows about it before

778
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:58,480
mitre has it in their database go

779
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:59,360
unknown so being creative and building

780
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,039
your own

781
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,640
uh

782
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:06,799
ttps

783
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:08,480
is is a good practice as well

784
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:12,159
and so pen testing so you leverage the

785
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:13,520
ttps during the security assessment so

786
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:15,520
in this case you know you're you're

787
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:17,520
using whatever you know like eternal

788
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,799
blue when it was you're still seeing

789
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,799
that environment but that's one of the

790
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:23,039
ones that you could try to leverage see

791
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:24,960
if these vulnerabilities are

792
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:26,559
are vulnerable to something like that so

793
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,000
you try to see if you can

794
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:30,080
you look for your vulnerabilities and

795
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,760
see if they can be exploited and then

796
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,440
you see how far you can go so you're

797
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,559
you're still leveraging some of the same

798
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:38,159
techniques

799
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:39,200
as an adversary using these ttps

800
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:41,279
but

801
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,960
you're you're you're doing this

802
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:46,000
in a way where you're not worried about

803
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:48,159
going undetected and to also

804
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,000
kind of share it's good to do pen test

805
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:52,480
and red team engagements both because

806
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,159
the red team engage the blue the

807
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:56,080
pen tests are going to get your security

808
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:57,520
defenses up a little bit quicker you're

809
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,960
doing your regular reoccurring

810
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,320
vulnerability scans you're doing your

811
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,279
pen tests

812
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:03,760
so

813
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:07,520
red team engagements are more for more

814
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:09,039
mature operate more mature organizations

815
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:11,120
so once your organization gets a little

816
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:14,159
mature then you don't have to you know

817
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:16,559
then you can kind of move on to

818
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:18,720
the adversary emulations of red team

819
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:20,159
engagement

820
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,200
so purple team as we kind of mentioned

821
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:23,600
while ago

822
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:25,600
uh you're working with the red team red

823
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:27,600
team blue team are working together

824
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,720
to to make sure that things are being

825
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:31,360
detected

826
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:33,600
so going back to to mitre you know

827
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:35,520
selecting the different apt groups

828
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:37,919
select specific apd seeing if you can

829
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:40,399
run mini cats in your environment or if

830
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:42,000
powershell is enabled by default

831
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:44,640
just going through and working on those

832
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,320
executing mimikats if that executes

833
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:48,480
successfully then you need to make sure

834
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:50,720
your endpoint protection is detecting

835
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,799
and blocking those and so you work this

836
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:54,960
is really good to do after a red team

837
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:56,720
engagement or penetration test because

838
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,799
by going in and shutting down certain

839
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:00,640
tools then you make it more difficult

840
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:01,679
for attackers to get their attacks

841
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:04,399
through

842
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:05,520
so this is a great resource and really

843
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:06,880
one of those things when you're starting

844
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,080
your pen tests

845
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,679
and your vulnerability assessments are

846
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:11,200
running purple teaming is something to

847
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:13,919
put in there because that helps bring up

848
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:16,399
the maturity of your your security

849
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:16,399
environment

850
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:22,799
and so thanks for attending my talk

851
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:24,320

wanted to become

855
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:31,679
oscp certified wanting to become pen

856
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,799
testers so i've done a lot of mentoring

857
