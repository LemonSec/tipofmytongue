1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,199
american citizen must have

2
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:06,480
an equal right to vote administration of

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:06,960
elections

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,320
is primarily state and local

5
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,040
responsibility

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,360
whether you voted for the very first

7
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,040
time

8
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:19,920
or waited in line for a very long time

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,119
by the way we have to fix that

10
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:25,039
hi welcome to highs you're not wide

16
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,880
and we are really excited to talk to you

17
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,160
today about

18
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,160
our podcast which is high turnout wide

19
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,480
margins but also how we've been trying

20
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,719
to use it to fight this information

21
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,480
with the nuts and bolts of elections

22
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,079
administration over this

23
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,879
past year

24
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,840
so at the end of last year as we were

25
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,960
going through

26
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,359
the end of the 2020 election and

27
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,199
election officials were feeling

28
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:05,199
born down and starved for

29
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,520
contact other than zoom meetings because

30
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,960
we're used to having these really good

31
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,640
conferences where we can share all this

32
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,760
information

33
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,520
we can share best practices and we can

34
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,200
actually commiserate on what we've been

35
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,479
going through

36
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:18,400
all of these news articles have been

37
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,759
coming out about

38
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:21,920
how much pressure we had all been under

39
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,119
how many people were leaving the

40
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:24,960
profession how we were going to help

41
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,000
bring new people

42
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,799
in and yet at the same time we hadn't

43
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,159
really created a space

44
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,880
in the digital world to try to share any

45
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,240
of that information

46
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,960
or talk about things that you can do in

47
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,960
your own office to help make your job

48
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,479
easier or more efficient

49
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:43,360
or what's happening in neighboring

50
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,640
states that you might

51
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,479
benefit from if you brought it into your

52
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,079
own jurisdiction

53
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:51,040
and so we thought about the idea of um

54
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:51,759
well maybe

55
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,520
maybe this information does exist maybe

56
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,360
it's just out there in the podcast forum

57
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,479
there's a lot of people that put up

58
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,000
podcasts but it turns out

59
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,799
there really wasn't anybody and the

60
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:01,680
reaction

61
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,520
was extremely positive and optimistic

62
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,840
that it would be very beneficial if we

63
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,720
did do that

64
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,038
and so we kind of took that and ran with

65
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:12,160
it and

66
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,599
at the end of december and beginning of

67
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:17,440
january we launched our first episode

68
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:22,879
so why are we doing this

69
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:26,480
well education community and

70
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,920
we're nerds uh brianna has even

71
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,280
made uh high turnout wide margin swag

72
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,239
and uh i think one of them says i'm an

73
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,280
election nerd right

74
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,800
something like that it does yeah yeah so

75
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,120
um

76
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,920
it's i think i think we said in our

77
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,280
first episode

78
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,599
um it's for all these reasons but it's

79
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:52,560
also for kind of selfish reasons that

80
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,040
you know we just want to talk to people

81
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,720
we're interested in we want to learn

82
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,239
from them

83
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,159
i think as i might have mentioned you

84
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:01,680
know an election administration

85
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,840
we really like to employ the case method

86
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,120
copy and steal everything

87
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,159
so the more we can learn from each other

88
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,000
the more we can copy and steal from each

89
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,680
other and use

90
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,959
because unlike private industry

91
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:16,959
in election administration we're not

92
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:18,560
competing with each other

93
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,080
we you know to the extent that

94
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,080
uh other people succeed you know we

95
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,159
succeed it makes the whole community of

96
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,000
election administrators better

97
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,879
when when more people are are succeeding

98
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:31,440
and

99
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,200
and doing new things and innovative

100
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,640
things so

101
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,239
uh the podcast i think at least for

102
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:41,280
for me and for us has has achieved that

103
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,959
largely and

104
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,080
we hope to continue doing it um

105
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,440
and i think brianna has some great

106
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,920
audio clips as we move through this

107
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,680
presentation just to kind of

108
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,680
illustrate uh some of these points

109
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,680
so when we started this were we

110
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,159
expecting that all this was going to be

111
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,720
you know educational community oriented

112
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,439
i mean

113
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:08,000
maybe we weren't really sure what we

114
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,159
were getting into it's been

115
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:13,120
extremely fun and very educational but

116
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,120
not always exactly what we expected it

117
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,079
to be

118
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,079
but what have we learned since we

119
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,918
started doing it

120
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,720
one that narrative is absolutely

121
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,080
everything

122
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,680
i mean i think it'd be really

123
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,520
interesting just to go through all of

124
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,880
the logistics

125
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,880
and that this is what's involved and we

126
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,919
have

127
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,800
you know two part-time people you know

128
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,000
who have to go through

129
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,160
all of this mail and we have to sort all

130
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,759
this down we have to check

131
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,520
the voter registration list and look at

132
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,600
this voter registration list this is how

133
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,800
it works

134
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,800
i i think people love those stories and

135
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,759
i think you know quite frankly because

136
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,320
of all the misinformation only a

137
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,840
terrible terrible terrible

138
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,120
attacks against election officials

139
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,520
you know non-partisan election officials

140
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,880
i think it's important that you really

141
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,360
have to

142
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,039
come out and tell your story this is who

143
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:04,479
we are you know we

144
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,600
are public servants we are

145
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,919
the people who are trying to make

146
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:12,560
democracy work

147
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,199
so pam fessler who just recently retired

148
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,880
from npr was one of our more recent

149
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,560
guests but she really illustrated a

150
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,919
point we heard

151
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,160
over and over again especially when

152
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,919
we're talking about trying to combat

153
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:25,039
disinformation

154
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:27,199
trying to get good information out there

155
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:28,160
continuing to be

156
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,639
trusted sources of information as the

157
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:31,280
election

158
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,639
office for our respective jurisdictions

159
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,880
and that's that you know it doesn't cut

160
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,320
it to just say

161
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,759
here's where the voter registration

162
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,160
deadline is here's how you request an

163
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,000
absentee ballot i mean you really do

164
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,759
need to tell the story of the office

165
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,680
it's something that we've taken very

166
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,960
literally and in some ways it's been a

167
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,880
very meta thing that we are telling

168
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,720
these stories through this podcast

169
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,360
and hopefully helping to further that

170
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,520
narrative for other people that

171
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,600
um need to be able to share this

172
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,199
information and

173
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:05,199
do it in a way that's compelling enough

174
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,360
that people don't just tune it out and

175
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,240
say

176
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,479
you know i know how to vote i know when

177
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:11,280
to register

178
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,479
but there's nothing that's really

179
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,720
pulling them into why it's still

180
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,639
important that we do what we do

181
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:19,199
and why it's important that they can

182
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,600
feel that their ballot is being counted

183
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,319
that everything

184
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,039
is safe and secure and that elections

185
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:26,800
are being run with integrity

186
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,160
and with security i think it's also

187
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,520
important to

188
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,520
point out that election administrators

189
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,440
by and large are not

190
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,520
media hounds you know i think a lot of

191
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,120
election administrators are used to kind

192
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,199
of toiling in anonymity

193
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:45,120
um they appreciate whatever you know

194
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,479
little recognition they might get from

195
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:49,199
time to time but um

196
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,199
usually they're on the news around

197
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:52,479
election time

198
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,000
trying to get out that that kind of

199
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
basic information and then

200
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,440
you know they go behind the scenes after

201
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,319
that but what 2020 showed everybody was

202
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:00,880
that

203
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,479
whether election administrators like it

204
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,639
or not they're going to be thrust into

205
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:05,520
the spotlight

206
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,680
and to the point that brianna just made

207
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,880
pam fessler was very

208
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,080
strident in her belief that election

209
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,360
administrators need to

210
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,400
really try to tell their story and and

211
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,000
make it compelling

212
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,759
um so that was a really great takeaway i

213
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:28,080
think from that

214
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,319
we also mean we knew this as election

215
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:31,759
authorities but

216
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,960
um it really

217
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,199
it really became crystal clear as we

218
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,960
were talking to more local election

219
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,080
authorities

220
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,400
how much this whole process in this

221
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,319
whole field runs on community

222
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,400
and as eric was saying this is an

223
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,400
extremely collaborative field it is not

224
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,280
one where

225
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,319
you know we're trying to forward

226
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,000
information from each other we're trying

227
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,560
to be

228
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,440
like the best one everybody is working

229
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,280
on a common goal we're all trying to

230
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,879
serve our voters in the best way that we

231
00:07:58,879 --> 00:07:59,680
can

232
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:04,000
and so it really becomes this kind of

233
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,039
family oriented group and if you think

234
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:08,720
about everything that we went through in

235
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,919
2020

236
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:12,240
and all of the different stresses that

237
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,919
we had just as people not just as

238
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:16,000
election authorities it's very hard to

239
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,599
not be able to have that kind of

240
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:19,280
camaraderie um

241
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,080
and so we've learned just how important

242
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,199
that is

243
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:25,440
uh it to the profession itself not just

244
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,039
to ourselves but to the profession

245
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,800
itself

246
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,879
it's just fun to get around a chat

247
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,240
there's just something about

248
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,320
when you eat or drink together and

249
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,360
you're just

250
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,799
you're just letting your guard down a

251
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:39,039
little bit or formalities go away

252
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,159
you talk to whoever you want it really

253
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,519
is

254
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,200
i used to think that that was a waste of

255
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,440
time now i think that's

256
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,800
more important than showing up to the

257
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:54,000
meetings

258
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,959
and uh that's ricky hatch from weber

259
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:58,000
county utah

260
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,080
uh ricky is um

261
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,519
uh and and on the executive board of igo

262
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:06,959
the international association

263
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:10,000
association of government and officials

264
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,839
he also is very active in naco national

265
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:13,519
association of counties

266
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,959
and as you saw he just made the point

267
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:18,640
that collaborating

268
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,880
and just kind of sharing stories is a

269
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,519
big part of election administration

270
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,000
and i would i would agree with him and i

271
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,760
think many election administrators would

272
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,080
that

273
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,519
just uh kind of having that camaraderie

274
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:32,480
and being able to

275
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,800
share stories is is valuable and

276
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,200
you know making what you do a little bit

277
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,560
better just to learn what other people

278
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,680
are doing but it's also kind of

279
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,720
cathartic

280
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,519
and that just uh it's just like i think

281
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,360
in many professions that

282
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,320
um you really you can't understand it

283
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,200
unless you're in it

284
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,560
and and so for election administrators

285
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,640
um being able to um talk to each other

286
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,120
and and share those stories and our our

287
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,040
podcast is i think just a little

288
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,079
a little part of that but also being

289
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:08,320
together at conferences and things

290
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,600
makes a big difference so that's i think

291
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,600
we hope our podcast is kind of filling

292
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,839
up a little bit of that void especially

293
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:17,040
while

294
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,959
people couldn't really go to conferences

295
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:20,640
and um

296
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,880
but even even when things you know go

297
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,560
back to some more in person things

298
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,279
we hope to keep it going because i think

299
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:28,079
it still feel

300
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:30,839
uh fills a need amongst election

301
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,839
administrators

302
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:37,440
we've also learned which is not as

303
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,600
positive but definitely something that

304
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,920
that i feel like we've all felt is that

305
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,160
the field is simultaneously energized

306
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,959
and demoralized we've probably talked to

307
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:49,120
an equal number of people that feel like

308
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,440
you know wow this is really our time to

309
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,279
shine we have this opportunity

310
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,279
to teach people about how elections are

311
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,640
being administered

312
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,839
to really um tie into the fact that more

313
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:01,360
people than ever are paying attention to

314
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,959
how elections are being run and that's

315
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:05,279
really wonderful but at the same time

316
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:08,399
um many of our colleagues

317
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,519
are are getting threats issued at them

318
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,320
and are feeling pressure not just from

319
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,079
their own voters but voters from

320
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:17,760
other jurisdictions people from all

321
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,600
across the country if they're being

322
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,200
targeted in certain states and things

323
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:21,920
like that

324
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,480
and it makes it incredibly hard uh

325
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,399
especially like how eric said a lot of

326
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:26,959
us

327
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:29,120
work in the background where you never

328
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,040
thought that this was going to be

329
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,680
a job that thrust you into the spotlight

330
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,079
and

331
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,560
and made you a target in a lot of ways

332
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,200
so there are people that have really

333
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,720
looked at that and said well this is an

334
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,160
opportunity and then there's people that

335
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:42,399
are

336
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,160
leaving the field because it's that

337
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,079
difficult right now and it's just not

338
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:49,839
worth it when you think about all of the

339
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:53,040
tasks and uh responsibilities that our

340
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,200
offices have not all of us are just

341
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,040
election authorities there's lots of

342
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,480
other things that our offices have to do

343
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,639
and in a lot of places elections are

344
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,160
actually a very small part of the job so

345
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,760
if you think about

346
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,760
people that are trying to do you know 50

347
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,839
things for their county just to keep the

348
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:12,240
lights on and payroll happening

349
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,320
and elections taking up more and more of

350
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,160
their time and their energy

351
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:20,800
it's just not it's just not sustainable

352
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,639
and details matter i mean the people out

353
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,480
here who know me and hear that said oh

354
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,160
well that's paul's mantra you know

355
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,680
that's a good play i've always heard

356
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,079
paul

357
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,160
talk about and that's what i would say

358
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,839
to anybody wanting to get in this job

359
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:34,800
and get in the j

360
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,120
and once you're in it to understand the

361
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,000
details you know and i know plenty of

362
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
folks who've gone into the job in a

363
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,600
partisan manner

364
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,839
who understand after they're in there

365
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,000
wow you know i'm serving everybody

366
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,680
and i really have to tone down my

367
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,120
partisanship and i think

368
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,160
that um you know i think if they do that

369
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,040
they'll find

370
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,200
you know that the the job is very

371
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,240
rewarding

372
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,040
that you're serving your voters uh it's

373
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,720
very difficult right now under

374
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,480
you know these circumstances that people

375
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,480
are um attacking

376
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,480
you know uh election officials for one

377
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,680
thing or the other

378
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,079
uh you have to have thick skin but i

379
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:13,760
think if you keep your honesty your

380
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,680
integrity and professionalism

381
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,079
you'll do a great job and uh more than

382
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:18,959
ever we

383
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:22,880
really need good people in these jobs

384
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:28,160
we have during the course of this

385
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,360
podcast

386
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,519
we've talked to several election

387
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,440
administrators that were thrust into the

388
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,800
spotlight

389
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,880
uh last year you know i think of people

390
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,959
like tina barton from michigan

391
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:42,638
and al schmidt from philadelphia

392
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:49,040
joseph kirk from georgia and uh

393
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,199
what paul just said there was a common

394
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:52,959
thread in what all those

395
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:56,399
folks said to us that um you know

396
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,399
they came under intense scrutiny last

397
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,320
year but they were very proud

398
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,800
of what they had done they all felt that

399
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,959
that they had conducted themselves in a

400
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:08,639
professional and manner with integrity

401
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,680
um and that you know they

402
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:15,199
they were certainly frustrated and

403
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:16,959
maybe a little downtrodden from the way

404
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:19,680
they were treated in some cases but

405
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,360
they were proud of their staffs they

406
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,000
were proud of their poll workers

407
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,519
and they were proud of all the work that

408
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:27,600
they had put in and that at the end of

409
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,160
the day

410
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,880
you know after the recounts and audits

411
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:31,279
which

412
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:33,120
which they had all done on their own

413
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,800
volition

414
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,760
uh you know proved out that uh at least

415
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,600
in their cases that the 2020

416
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,360
the november 2020 election was was very

417
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,279
accurate and uh very honest so

418
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:51,440
um i again i just think

419
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,120
having those conversations with people

420
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,800
that had been through some of the worst

421
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,320
of it last year

422
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,600
um you know reinforced how

423
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,800
important it is to uh to stick around in

424
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,199
this

425
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:05,839
in this profession and and to find uh

426
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:06,240
more

427
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,680
good people to do it and and that

428
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,600
for some people um you certainly can

429
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,279
blame them for for looking to other

430
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:14,320
career paths and

431
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,040
a number of people are doing that but um

432
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:17,360
i

433
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,880
i still think there are a lot of good

434
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,959
folks around that are gonna keep doing

435
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:22,639
it for years to come

436
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:24,000
and i think these are the lessons that

437
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,399
we're trying to impart you know

438
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,399
this is not we didn't start this podcast

439
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,320
thinking we would have

440
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,240
widespread appeal i mean this is a

441
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,160
podcast that we designed for

442
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,279
other election officials and so

443
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:40,079
with our takeaways we're hoping that

444
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:41,519
other election officials have very

445
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:43,199
similar takeaways and are

446
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:46,560
um at least feeling like they're a that

447
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,759
they're not alone but b

448
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:50,320
that um there is still energy in the

449
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,079
field there are still things that

450
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:55,040
we have um that we're doing very well in

451
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,240
that there's a lot of people in our

452
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,040
corner

453
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,639
and having that

454
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:03,519
sense of pride is something that is not

455
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:05,440
unique to any particular local election

456
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,519
authority i think everybody has that

457
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:09,040
uh it's one of the things that draws

458
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,279
people in one of the big things

459
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,519
that uh we learn when we're going

460
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:14,959
through all of these is we always ask

461
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:16,720
people how they ended up in elections in

462
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,680
the first place

463
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,959
so the first question we always ask is

464
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:23,920
you know did you did you come into this

465
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,639
intentionally did you fall into it and

466
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:29,120
you know 99 of the people never planned

467
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,040
to be local election authorities there

468
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,680
was something that happened that either

469
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,600
landed them there like a part-time

470
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,199
position that they decided they just

471
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:38,399
fell in love with

472
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,639
or they were working in another field

473
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:41,519
and then

474
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,279
this position happened to open up and so

475
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:44,800
they ended up working there and realized

476
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,399
how much they loved it but

477
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,320
everybody that we've talked to it really

478
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,519
draws you in

479
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:52,560
and like eric said it

480
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,560
it makes you want to stick around and it

481
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,320
helps when you know that other people

482
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,480
are all working towards that same goal

483
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,560
too

484
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,279
so what do we do i mean we're we're here

485
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:05,280
presenting at def con not to just talk

486
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,559
about how

487
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,319
fun it is to be an election official but

488
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,599
also to talk about

489
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:12,640
you know we've had this uh terrible

490
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,119
dismiss information campaign that has

491
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,079
been going on

492
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,160
all throughout 2020 that's continuing on

493
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,240
through 2021 and we're looking at

494
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,880
going into 2022 and what are we gonna do

495
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,760
um

496
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,799
and and hopefully in one way putting all

497
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:28,160
this information out there and

498
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,559
demystifying some of local election

499
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:32,640
administration and just talking to

500
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,640
people and humanizing them is one way to

501
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,000
combat that

502
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,440
but the other thing we can do is

503
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,200
collaborate

504
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,320
you know it's something that we

505
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,200
naturally do anyway but what we've seen

506
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,200
over this past year has also been huge

507
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,799
collaboration between

508
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:50,400
industry academic academics

509
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,559
people that had not necessarily all been

510
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,559
in the same room

511
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:56,480
and asking the same questions and trying

512
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,240
to reach the same goals are now

513
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,360
having all of these synthesizing

514
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,000
uh meetings and discussions and

515
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,840
conferences to try to get everybody on

516
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,520
the same page because we're all fighting

517
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,240
now

518
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:15,840
the same enemy which is disinformation

519
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,120
it's also really important one of the

520
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,120
things that we talked about with

521
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,559
a lot of our guests is filling the space

522
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,320
with that narrative i mean narrative

523
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,000
is one of the ways that you can do that

524
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,400
but at this

525
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,679
particular time i mean it's 2021 there's

526
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:36,000
not

527
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,520
a ton of elections that are happening

528
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,520
there are a lot of places that have

529
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,280
local elections and things like that but

530
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,880
it's not a november

531
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,600
2020 general election it's not something

532
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,200
that's on the top of everybody's mind

533
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,640
that they have to go vote they have to

534
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,360
pick

535
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,679
who they want to represent them this is

536
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:52,880
the time where

537
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,600
we as local election authorities can do

538
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,120
that collaboration

539
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,559
work on planning out for 2022 and start

540
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:02,559
trying to be proactive and not just

541
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,160
reactive i mean that's something that

542
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,280
came through a lot too

543
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,320
is as we're preparing for future

544
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,520
elections

545
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,120
we can do as much preparation as we want

546
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,559
i mean that's in our dna

547
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:15,600
is to make sure that we are 100 planned

548
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,760
with all sorts of redundancies in case

549
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,120
something happens

550
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,640
uh in the election but we're not always

551
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,880
great at predicting exactly what that

552
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,720
common enemy is going to be

553
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,440
at any given election so you can follow

554
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:29,840
that

555
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,640
trajectory you know 2016 out of that

556
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,559
came cyber security efforts we started

557
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,320
working on cyber security efforts we

558
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,000
thought that's what it was going to be

559
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,280
in 2018 2020 and we were all prepared

560
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,559
for that we've done

561
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,720
fantastic work and federal government's

562
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,640
done fantastic work and defcon has done

563
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,640
fantastic work in furthering that cyber

564
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,360
security

565
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,520
but then here comes this whole

566
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,360
disinformation campaign

567
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,880
that really ended up filling the entire

568
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,640
space and we need to take some of that

569
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,200
back we need to start reclaiming that

570
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,000
for

571
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,520
the trustworthy and accurate and honest

572
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,159
information

573
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:09,520
so that that's what voters hear i hope

574
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:13,120
um if nothing else uh

575
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,720
you know what comes out of everything

576
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,640
that's transpired since uh

577
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,840
last november's election that at least

578
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,840
people who have

579
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,400
good intentions once they learn that

580
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,480
elections aren't being you know run

581
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,600
by the venezuelan government they will

582
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,200
actually start to learn about some of

583
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,400
the nuts and bolts of election

584
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,679
administration and

585
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:36,960
if as pam fessler mentioned if if we can

586
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,600
tell our story or if people other people

587
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,080
can

588
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,360
uh help to tell our story that um

589
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,640
you know at least some people in the

590
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,480
media in

591
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,440
in um academia and things like that

592
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,039
start to understand

593
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:54,000
some of the challenges and other things

594
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,360
that we have

595
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,880
um you know i i think one another thing

596
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,640
pam fessler mentioned that

597
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,600
was very interesting that when she you

598
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,280
know back in the early 2000s when she

599
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,799
would kind of cover the voting beat the

600
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,720
election administration beat

601
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,000
um she might be the only reporter

602
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,799
there at a national association of

603
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:16,080
secretaries of state meeting or

604
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,039
something like that

605
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:19,919
and now there are you know dozens

606
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:22,240
sometimes so

607
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,960
i like to you know think there's a

608
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,799
silver lining to all this so if there's

609
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:27,280
a

610
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,720
silver lining to this i hope maybe

611
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,799
that's what it is that especially some

612
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:33,360
folks in the media are really

613
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,600
starting to learn uh how elections are

614
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,520
run because it's an ever-evolving field

615
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,960
like brianna was just saying that

616
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,280
you know we we had uh as election

617
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,960
administrators really had to bone up on

618
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,080
cyber security

619
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,200
and start to take that more seriously

620
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,320
after the the 2016 elections and and now

621
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,559
miss and dis and mal information are

622
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:55,600
things that

623
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,080
are uh in the vocabulary of all election

624
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,600
administrators and

625
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,799
and that's something i think we're going

626
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:04,400
to get better at as time goes on

627
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,679
and finally i think listening is still

628
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:10,480
incredibly important i mean we can talk

629
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,760
all day about how local election

630
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,120
authorities talk to each other and we

631
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,880
collaborate but it's also important to

632
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,440
listen

633
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,960
to our voters it's important to listen

634
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,799
to our own stakeholders because at the

635
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:19,440
end of the day

636
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:23,440
we are a public service oriented

637
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,480
administration so you know we make sure

638
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:26,960
that

639
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,640
everything is ready for election day we

640
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,640
make sure that everything

641
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,400
is prepared for uh being able to cast

642
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,000
ballots and all of that but we have to

643
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:36,720
listen to

644
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,880
our voters about what they have concerns

645
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,720
about what they have questions about

646
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,200
and not be defensive when somebody does

647
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,720
try to get us to

648
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,080
explain more of the process part of

649
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:52,080
i think it being a very

650
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,480
administrative field is that we're not

651
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,480
used to being asked a lot of questions

652
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,240
about how things work and it can

653
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,200
be taken in a defensive way and so

654
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,159
listening

655
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:05,840
and trying to um you know really take to

656
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,520
heart that

657
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,520
voters deserve to have that information

658
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,280
and we can put that information out

659
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,799
there and it's actually beneficial to

660
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:14,720
everybody it's beneficial to us too

661
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,400
it helps combat some of that bad

662
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,080
information out there

663
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,760
is something that's really important

664
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,200
that

665
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,280
hopefully as more

666
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,039
local election authorities are thinking

667
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:28,400
about what they can do

668
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,600
moving into 2022

669
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,000
wanting feedback and listening to that

670
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,720
feedback is one of those things

671
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,320
yeah i hope that's another good thing

672
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,080
that comes out of

673
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,400
the mess that you know the post-election

674
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,679
mess that 2020 was

675
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:49,440
that election administrators

676
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:53,360
become a little more open to

677
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,159
how things are presented to the public

678
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:56,720
and

679
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,039
how the public can come and see what

680
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:00,080
they do

681
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,799
as brianna just mentioned you know

682
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:04,320
election administrators by and large

683
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,200
they weren't

684
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:09,360
used to a lot of people uh

685
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,360
uh coming to their office and wanting to

686
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,480
see this and

687
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,559
and understand you know how do you

688
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:16,559
process the ballots what happens here

689
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:18,400
i mean it used to be years ago we would

690
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,240
shout from the rooftops this is

691
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,159
you know what we do this is how things

692
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:23,279
work uh

693
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:25,919
nobody cared nobody was interested in

694
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:27,360
coming to the election office and

695
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:27,840
watching

696
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,000
ballots be processed or audits take

697
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
place they were still taking place

698
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,480
it was all being done but you know very

699
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,240
few people cared so

700
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,440
now that um it's it's come to the

701
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,159
forefront

702
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:43,360
that you know party challengers the

703
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,799
media whoever they may

704
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:46,960
they may want to be a part of this

705
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,960
process

706
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,919
hopefully election administrators find a

707
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:53,360
way to

708
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,120
make them part of the process and and

709
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,120
how they how they show how their jobs

710
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,320
are done

711
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,840
and that it leads to again more

712
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:02,240
understanding last we just wanted to

713
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,520

725
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:32,240

727
