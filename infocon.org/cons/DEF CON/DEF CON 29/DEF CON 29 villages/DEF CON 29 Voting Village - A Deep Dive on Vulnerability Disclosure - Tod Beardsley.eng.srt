00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,639
welcome to this virtual voting village

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:03,360
talk

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,200
vulnerability disclosures for voting

4
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,120
systems a deep dive into vulnerable

5
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,800
disclosure programs among the most

6
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:09,519
popular

7
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:12,799
voting system vendors thanks for coming

8
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:14,559
i wish i could be there in vegas with

9
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:16,400
you but alas

10
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,039
uh the coveted weather is is just too

11
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:19,840
severe so

12
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,600
couldn't make it this year next year for

13
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,640
sure right so yeah i'm todd beardsley i

14
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,560
am the director of research at rapid7

15
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,400
and i deal with vulnerability disclosure

16
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,439
pretty regularly and i also

17
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,840
incidentally care about election

18
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,079
security and election integrity

19
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:38,000
uh and because of that i'm also an

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,280
election judge here in

21
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,000
in travis county texas if you want to

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,559
find me

23
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:45,600
or look up my stuff you a

24
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,559
great starting point is uh keybase.i o

25
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:50,079
slash todd b

26
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:51,760
all my twitters and all my stuff is

27
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,840
there so check it out there

28
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,559
but enough about me on to the voting

29
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:59,359
machines that we're all

30
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,719
interested in hacking i guess

31
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,438
all right i'm up in the corner now um

32
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:06,560
i'll be here for most of the

33
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,760
presentation just to stay out of your

34
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,400
way

35
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,400
uh first off let's blast through some

36
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,000
terms that i

37
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,640
am likely to use all of the time they

38
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,280
are

39
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,320
coordinated vulnerable disclosure or cbd

40
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,000
this is the process by which i typically

41
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,240
disclose vulnerabilities typically it

42
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,520
starts with

43
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,000
a researcher almost always who is not me

44
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,520
occasionally i do my own bones but

45
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,439
mostly these days i help other other

46
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,600
people disclose vulnerabilities

47
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,920
and this for me like this is all about

48
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,520
getting the vendor and the researcher

49
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,200
and you know any other interested

50
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,040
parties maybe a regulatory agency or

51
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,399
somebody like that

52
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,640
all on the same page all ready to go all

53
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,159
agreeing on what the vulnerability is

54
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:51,200
severity

55
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,759
descriptions mitigations fixes all that

56
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,520
stuff that whole thing from beginning to

57
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:55,840
end

58
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,920
from discovery to eventual public

59
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,040
disclosure that's

60
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,479
cbd so if i see say cbd that's what i

61
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:04,399
mean

62
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:07,520
uh also i use another acronym vdp a

63
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,000
vulnerability

64
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,800
disclosure program a vulnerability

65
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,760
disclosure program

66
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,239
is pretty much in my opinion it is

67
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:15,920
pretty much anything

68
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,000
where you are a vendor of software

69
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,120
which is to say all companies and all in

70
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,400
most organizations

71
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,160
uh you have some kind of software

72
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,520
product um

73
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,160
it might be embedded it might be a

74
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,120
typical app

75
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,360
on a phone it might be a typical program

76
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,360
it might be server side it might be

77
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,120
your website it might be your back end

78
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,879
it might be anything right

79
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,879
basically what we're looking for in a

80
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,080
vdp is

81
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,239
some way to contact you and let you know

82
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:45,440
about this vulnerability

83
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,920
i don't super care like about the

84
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,879
details of it just

85
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,920
if you have a vdp great and you're in

86
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,319
you're in rare company if you do and

87
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:55,840
then finally

88
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,319
we have bug bounty programs i talk about

89
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,920
a little bit nobody calls them

90
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,000
bbs this is something we don't acronym i

91
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,680
don't know why but a bug browning

92
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,159
program

93
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:07,280
is is basically like a vdp except

94
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,000
there's

95
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,040
usually money involved

96
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,120
not always sometimes it's just like for

97
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,080
like kudos

98
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,280
and karma or whatever

99
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,280
almost always there's some kind of more

100
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,360
formal nda in place

101
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,560
usually restricting uh the the reporter

102
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,760
of the vulnerability from

103
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,840
from talking about it until the the

104
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,440
receiver the bug bounty

105
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,319
runner um does a thing either they fix

106
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:32,879
it

107
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,239
um okay very occasionally they um

108
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:37,360
i would say occasionally not very

109
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,720
occasionally anymore occasionally they

110
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,280
have

111
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,280
uh like a timeout procedure so if so

112
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,799
much time has passed then you're free to

113
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:43,840
publish

114
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,040
um but but yeah so that is the deal

115
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,079
uh with bug bounties

116
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,080
so um actually finding vdps in the wild

117
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:56,640
um

118
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,640
is not terribly hard uh you know i look

119
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,640
at a few things i look at bug crowd

120
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,120
hacker one and disclose io i bring up

121
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,400
bug crowd and hacker one because they're

122
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,920
bug bounding programs and it's in

123
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,360
their interest to to really let you know

124
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,760
that such and such a company has a bug

125
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,120
bounty program which is a

126
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,279
you know a species of vdp it's not the

127
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,358
only kind of vdp but it's a species of

128
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:20,000
it

129
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,479
disclose io and bug crowd are like this

130
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:23,040
and

131
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,080
disclose runs a pretty nice

132
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,000
community sorted

133
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
directory of vulnerability disclosure

134
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,520
programs right

135
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,080
i also look for the security.txt file

136
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,199
that

137
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:41,280
should be on a given company's or

138
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,000
product even

139
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,479
websites so like let's say you work at

140
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:45,280
acme corp

141
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,880
um and your website is acmecorp.com

142
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,040
you would have a security.text in acme

143
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,199
torque

144
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:55,680
acmecorp.com dot well dash

145
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,040
known slash security.tax you can learn a

146
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,080
lot about this

147
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,120
at securitytechs.org it is a great way

148
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:03,600
to

149
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,800
tell people and it's like um well

150
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,240
let me back up it's a great way to tell

151
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,120
people about your vulnerability

152
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,880
disclosure program

153
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,120
what the policy is who to contact a ptp

154
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,199
key languages all kind of stuff can go

155
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:15,919
in there

156
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,360
but the minimum is like some kind of

157
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,120
contact information

158
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,120
i look for that basically second these

159
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,759
days i'm usually disappointed

160
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,080
sometimes i come across one um and then

161
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:26,880
finally

162
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,120
if those don't pan out i google to work

163
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,000
around right for

164
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,080
vulnerability for the word disclosure

165
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,840
for the word security and whatever the

166
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,800
organization or the product name is

167
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,199
typically if these if all of these fail

168
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,960
this tends to succeed

169
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,600
um you know it's a very jargony sort of

170
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,880
business we're in with vulnerability

171
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,000
disclosure so

172
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,160
these words all together uh almost

173
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,080
always first page

174
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,560
great seo right um so if you are running

175
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,199
one

176
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:54,720
and people don't know where it is make

177
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,479
sure that this google door works and and

178
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:57,680
people will find it

179
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,800
um if all of this fails i kind of have

180
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,759
to assume that

181
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,520
you don't have a vulnerability

182
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,720
disclosure program that might not be

183
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,440
true

184
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,680
um you know and there's certainly other

185
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,639
ways to have

186
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,840
to advertise vdps um but if

187
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,919
if it's not one of these like five

188
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:15,039
things basically

189
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,080
uh it is effectively invisible to

190
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,680
uh certainly me and i would say most

191
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,639
uh most people who are in the business

192
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,000
of vulnerability disclosure

193
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
in my business i mean charity almost

194
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,520
always um

195
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,600
you know bug bounty programs are a

196
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,199
little bit special and they tend to have

197
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,199
their own thing but again like

198
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,800
and it's totally possible to run a bug

199
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,240
binding program without bug crowd or

200
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,440
heck of one for sure

201
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,120
um but if you're running your own

202
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,960
homegrown bug bounty program and you're

203
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,560
not hitting that google door or not

204
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,720
hitting that secure that text

205
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,000
this is an easy easy problem to solve

206
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,680
so let's take a look at the fortune 500

207
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,919
just for context um this is not

208
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:56,080
uh you know none of these uh voting

209
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,759
system manufacturers are in the fortune

210
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:58,960
500

211
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,639
but we can take a look at the fortune

212
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,000
500 and see what's going

213
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,160
on there like kind of just a level set

214
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,639
like how common are vdps out in the the

215
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,960
real world you know this is the world of

216
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,520
uh name brands um you know the most

217
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,319
successful

218
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,639
and highest revenue companies uh lots of

219
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,160
tech companies lots of manufacturing

220
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,360
companies lots of everything right

221
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,120
uh in the fortune 500. um back in march

222
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,440
uh i ran around and counted all of these

223
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,599
uh using exactly that methodology i just

224
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:28,000
i just talked about uh and you can read

225
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,080
that report if you like um it's it's

226
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,319
on rapid7 if just do like rapid seven

227
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,080
icer uh you'll find it's the industry

228
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,520
cyber exposure report

229
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,800
uh and uh if this were in person i would

230
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,319
ask for people to guess

231
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,360
how many of the fortune 500 have a vdp

232
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,720
and then i would chortle and say you're

233
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,639
wrong because it's actually this many

234
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:50,800
um it's just about 20 almost 100

235
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,840
of the fortune 500 have a vdp now

236
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,680
they're not all in the top 100.

237
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,000
top 100 is overrepresented um fortune

238
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,360
100 has about 40

239
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,560
of these and then the rest are kind of

240
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,479
scattered throughout um the the

241
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:03,520
remaining 400

242
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,960
but that like gives us an idea of like

243
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,879
well how common are these right

244
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,759
uh and i will say that on a given very

245
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:10,879
successful company

246
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:13,360
um about 20 percent have an active

247
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,639
findable vdp today

248
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,280
so how do i pick uh voting machines um

249
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,280
or i'm sorry voting system manufacturers

250
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,639
well i look at

251
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,520
the eac or the u.s election assistance

252
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,800
commission

253
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,039
they run a program that certifies

254
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:34,399
vendors in this space and

255
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,640
one quick caveat before i talk about

256
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,479
those

257
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:41,360
not every vendor is certified by the eac

258
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,240
and

259
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,360
uh not every eac

260
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,480
um certified uh

261
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,600
vendor is in any of the all of the

262
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,560
states right

263
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,839
um or in by state i mean locality

264
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:57,920
so which ones are they um well they're

265
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,200
these ones there's avante

266
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,640
clear ballot dominion voting ess esns

267
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,440
heart interactive microvote smartmatic

268
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,080
unison

269
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,720
and votingworks those are the nine

270
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,600
vendors

271
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,640
uh that are part that that participate

272
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,120
with the

273
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,800
eac get their stuff certified um there's

274
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,720
mountains of documentation on the eac

275
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,920
and this is not an eac

276
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,760
talk so i'll just go by there i'll just

277
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,279
stop there but like these are the nine

278
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:24,399
companies that i'm looking at

279
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,480
um to see like who has vulnerability

280
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,600
disclosure program

281
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,160
um and as i mentioned before a quick

282
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:30,959
caveat

283
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:34,320
um this is where any of these companies

284
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,440
operate um today and by today i mean i

285
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,160
think this

286
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,120
uh survey was for the last election the

287
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:41,920
2020

288
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,200
um presidential election uh so

289
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,399
you can see that like not even every

290
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,640
like there are a few states where it's

291
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,519
100 eac certified voting machines um

292
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,360
some states have none uh some of them

293
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,360
are rather large like california and new

294
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,800
york and florida

295
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,800
um all of the um

296
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,600
decision making on what voting systems a

297
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,320
given

298
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,560
locality uses that tends to evolve down

299
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,519
to the county

300
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:10,720
um but if you're in the voting village

301
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,040
you probably know that so moving on

302
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,240
uh from there so

303
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,519
among the vdps who which are eac

304
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,640
certified

305
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,000
uh how many of them have some kind of

306
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,360
vdp how many of them

307
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,399
are welcoming of vulnerability

308
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,959
information on their products that are

309
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,000
installed and people

310
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,640
cast votes on or are used to tabulate

311
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,320
votes or anything like that any election

312
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:36,800
system

313
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,240
kind of deal what do you think

314
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,360
well you are right some of you

315
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,560
it is better than the fortune 500 it is

316
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,000
about 55 or 509 uh have

317
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,279
some kind of vdp so uh good job good job

318
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:53,680
guys

319
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,240
uh we're doing better uh than than we

320
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:56,720
were

321
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,519
even even a year ago most of these are

322
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:00,640
very new

323
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:05,680
and so just to remind you 55 percent of

324
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,519
voting system manufacturers have a vdp

325
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,480
about 20 percent of the fortune 500 have

326
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,200
a vdp

327
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,760
and so that is that is better uh it is

328
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,440
it is greater than so

329
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,040
good job guys um so for the for the next

330
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,120
section i want to like kind of dive this

331
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,399
is the deep dive part

332
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:27,279
um i want to dive deep onto these uh vdp

333
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:29,120
so i read all of them so you don't have

334
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:29,680
to

335
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,920
um and first and foremost let's just

336
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,680
knock out the ones that don't have

337
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,560
any vdp at all that is avante microvote

338
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,560
smartmatic and votingworks

339
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,360
guys get on the stick there but of the

340
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,640
rest all of these

341
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,240
the rest of these do have some kind of

342
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,040
vdp but not all vdps are

343
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,000
created equal right um of those that

344
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,360
have a vdp

345
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,000
uh some of them don't actually cover the

346
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,959
voting machines

347
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,360
and customer implementations so that

348
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,800
knocks out heart inner civic

349
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,240
and unison so if you

350
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,120
recall from from last year at black hat

351
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,360
and and defcon time

352
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,600
i know that some of these vendors said

353
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,360
like yes we have a vdp and we are

354
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,079
anxious to work with uh researchers uh

355
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:15,040
well not so fast

356
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,120
um these two companies in particular

357
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,639
heart inner civic and

358
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,800
unison their vulnerability disclosure

359
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,519
program only covers their own website

360
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:27,040
and so great that they have one

361
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,440
but not so great that they they they

362
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,120
have a written policy that says that

363
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:31,519
their

364
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,279
voting machines and any like customer

365
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,360
implementation implementations are off

366
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,240
limits which is

367
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,040
weird it's kind of not a vdp anymore but

368
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,360
hey you have a vdp so wonderful

369
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,000
of those that have a vdp that do cover

370
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,279
customer implementations

371
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:46,959
who has a safe harbor policy well it's

372
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:48,800
not clear ballot

373
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,519
clear about is a little weird they do

374
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,200
have a place to report vulnerabilities

375
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,800
they publish an email address and they

376
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,639
talk about their security a lot

377
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,079
but they don't actually seem to have any

378
00:12:58,079 --> 00:12:59,680
written policy at least i couldn't find

379
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,600
one and if you know somebody clear about

380
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:01,920
it

381
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,000
reach out to me i'd love to be able to

382
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,040
find it

383
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,399
it is if it exists it's invisible so

384
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:09,839
you're welcome to report vulnerability

385
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,079
to them but it's like unclear

386
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:14,959
how they'll take it uh which is which is

387
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:15,839
fine right

388
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,240
um i'm glad they have some way of doing

389
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,800
it i guess

390
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,320
so esns and dominion

391
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,240
are the only two eac certified voting

392
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,480
system manufacturers that actually offer

393
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,200
a clear unambiguous safe harbor for

394
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,560
researchers and hackers

395
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,000
in their vulnerability closure program

396
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,959
so yay congratulations guys you did it

397
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:40,000
um es and s and dominion i do believe

398
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,680
their heart is in the right place

399
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,199
they're a pretty great place to report

400
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:45,199
vulnerabilities incidentally between

401
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,279
es and s and dominion you're looking at

402
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:49,199
most of the voting machines in america

403
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:50,000
including

404
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,720
in those areas that you know aren't

405
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,839
required to have

406
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:56,720
eac certified voting machines they still

407
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,920
use them

408
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,839
they may be like back a rev or they may

409
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,600
just use them and not bother to tell the

410
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,880
eic because you know

411
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,720
hands off my local government you big

412
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,160
federal nasties

413
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,639
or whatever reason right so it's

414
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,880
certainly possible to run into

415
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,959
a voting system from one of the other

416
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:14,240
these companies

417
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,320
in a locality that that eac doesn't know

418
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,360
about

419
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,440
so if you find vulnerabilities there you

420
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,040
are it's smooth sailing

421
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,440
um good job and let them know because

422
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,680
they want to hear about it

423
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,440
um but of all the other companies don't

424
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,040
give up you know if you find

425
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,680
if you're a researcher or a hacker or an

426
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,240
academic

427
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,839
and you find some kind of vulnerability

428
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,519
involving one of these systems

429
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,519
i mean it doesn't hurt to try i wouldn't

430
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:39,120
say just sit on it

431
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,279
because that doesn't help anyone right

432
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:43,040
um and so

433
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,160
uh this uh you know this is this is my

434
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,199
opinion anyway

435
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:50,320
um some people are our real sketch

436
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,639
about uh trying to report

437
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:54,480
vulnerabilities to a place that doesn't

438
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,199
have a

439
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:58,720
clear and concise and unambiguous

440
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,680
safe harbor provision for for hackers um

441
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,399
so

442
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,639
these companies are less likely to get

443
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:06,880
decent vulnerability intelligence from

444
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,240
you know good samaritans out on the

445
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,320
internet um than es and s

446
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,480
and and dominion um but it doesn't mean

447
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,160
that you have to be that way right like

448
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:14,720
it is

449
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,880
of of course it's our all up to your own

450
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,000
risk tolerance

451
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,839
very similar to traveling to las vegas

452
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:21,120
during covet um

453
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,600
it's up to you and it's up to like how

454
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,720
you deal with it

455
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,440
um but basically like if you have a

456
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,120
vulnerability on

457
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,600
a voting system manufacturer that's not

458
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,320
on that list

459
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,639
or which is on that list but their terms

460
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:36,000
are like real restrictive

461
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,160
uh or they might be on the list like you

462
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,839
found an issue but you're not super sure

463
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:40,880
what it's for

464
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,040
like maybe you found some kind of sql

465
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,720
injection bug and some

466
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,959
you know in like an e poll book that's

467
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:49,040
online or something like that right like

468
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,880
it's not directly a vote it's not like a

469
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,240
voting machine compromise but it's a

470
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,320
back-end system compromise or like a

471
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,320
maybe a military or a front-end

472
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,800
for some county like and it may be run

473
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,759
by one of these companies these

474
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,040
companies don't just produce

475
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,519
voting machines as you know they often

476
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:06,320
do the end-to-end

477
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,560
management of of the voting machines the

478
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,560
ballot box the e-poll books the

479
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,959
collection all of the stuff right um

480
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:14,639
they may be all up in that

481
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,959
in that business if you find a

482
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:18,079
vulnerability

483
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:20,720
in a candidate's website or in something

484
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,079
in their infrastructure or in their

485
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:22,959
campaign

486
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:25,600
um what do you do um or if it's like in

487
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,079
a

488
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:28,959
general political party issue like as we

489
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:29,680
all know

490
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,160
political parties are not immune to to

491
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,519
hackery and are not

492
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:35,279
certainly not immune to like not

493
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:36,880
patching something

494
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,720
so if it's a political party or pack

495
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,320
what do you do well

496
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,320
i'm here to tell you uh there's a one

497
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,519
stop shop these days

498
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,040
uh i used to have a long complicated

499
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,040
answer for this but now i have a very

500
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,240
short and terse answer and it's scissor

501
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,079
is pronounced not like pizza by the way

502
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:53,440
uh but it's as a

503
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,279
cyber security and infrastructure

504
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:56,639
security agencies

505
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:00,720
so secure the name did twice was secure

506
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,920
i would say that like in all cases if

507
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:04,319
you

508
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:07,039
see something say something um cesa is

509
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:08,640
generally pretty good about this uh they

510
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,000
have some really talented people there

511
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:10,720
still

512
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,760
um and continue to be like

513
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,799
pretty responsive um if you

514
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:21,439
uh yeah so if you're not comfortable

515
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,319
with uh interacting with cizza for

516
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:25,280
whatever reason

517
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:29,760
you should know that as far as i know

518
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,000
they've never gone after anyone they've

519
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,679
never they never hassled anybody they've

520
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:34,160
never

521
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,320
like turned around and you know ratted

522
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,919
anybody out to the doj or anything like

523
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:38,480
that

524
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,080
they've always been on the up and up and

525
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,520
they are sincere

526
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,640
in wanting to know about your

527
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,679
vulnerabilities to fix them

528
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:48,480
and they are specifically excluded um

529
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,760
this whole vulnerability intelligence

530
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,559
gathering

531
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:52,400
function that they have they're excluded

532
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,240
from the uh vulnerability equities

533
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,760
program if you've heard of that

534
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,520
and are worried about that they're

535
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,880
excluded from that so

536
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,679
uh spooks and spies will not use your

537
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:03,280
vulnerability in the meantime

538
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,200
um you know unless they're doing

539
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,640
something like super duper illegal like

540
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,400
spying on scissors which

541
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,039
that never happens right um there's

542
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:12,240
there's no such thing

543
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,039
as interagency conflict um but they're

544
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:16,880
they're a great backstop for basically

545
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,120
anything related to civilian government

546
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,720
um including these issues so

547
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,080
uh i urge you uh get in touch with sizza

548
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,880
um and and they will they will take care

549
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,320
of you if you have a bad experience this

550
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,520
is let me know and i will

551
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,679
i will i don't know be your champion and

552
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:34,880
your white knight i guess

553
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,720
um i just wanted to take a moment

554
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,520
uh to talk about the r words and that is

555
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,240
reasonable

556
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,960
or responsible disclosure i try to use

557
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,160
reasonable exp

558
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,000
disclosure as a as a term but it's just

559
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,360
not it's just not taking off

560
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,400
um but let's talk a little just a little

561
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,679
bit about responsibility now that we've

562
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:55,520
talked about like who has a vdp

563
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,120
maybe you run into a situation where

564
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,600
you're not comfortable with the vdp or

565
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,000
you

566
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,760
don't find a vdp or something like that

567
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,039
what do you do then right

568
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,919
um uh so the the rest of this talk and

569
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:07,280
it's i'm almost at the end here because

570
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:07,760
these are

571
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,960
these are all real short talks um

572
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,280
restless talk is just pro tips uh just a

573
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,960
couple grab bag of pro tips

574
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,520
uh so first off uh timing considerations

575
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,000
um

576
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,600
nobody does anything with a deadline if

577
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,600
you report a vulnerability and don't

578
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,200
say you're gonna do something in a

579
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,640
certain amount of time

580
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,559
i guarantee you no one will do anything

581
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:27,679
with it

582
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:29,679
they will they may reply they may say oh

583
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:30,799
thank you for the thing and you'll never

584
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:32,480
hear from them again

585
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,760
in my experience in disclosing a few

586
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,600
hundred vulnerabilities

587
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,120
being upfront with that deadline is

588
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,919
everything um what's extra great is

589
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:43,440
being able to tell people like hey i

590
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,799
found a vulnerability

591
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:47,039
i would love to publish this buy the

592
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:48,480
next conference whatever that conference

593
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,440
is you can make it up

594
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,679
you can lie it's fine but just pick a

595
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,960
security conference off the calendar

596
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,240
that's like a couple months ahead you

597
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:54,799
know

598
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:58,160
um and uh and and do that right

599
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,240
um provide them with regular reminders

600
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,840
that this deadline is approaching and

601
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,039
you have to do the thing

602
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:04,480
um you know if you want to say a

603
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,960
conference or a cfp or just say a date

604
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,960
um or if you say or if like you work at

605
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,240
a company or whatever and you want to

606
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,679
publish these things on your company's

607
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:13,600
blog like i do all the time

608
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,720
[Music]

609
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,200
you know let them know you don't have to

610
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,480
be a jerk about it you don't have to say

611
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,120
like hey

612
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,200
i haven't heard from you in like six

613
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,960
hours and what's the deal here

614
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,360
like you should know that like

615
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,880
vulnerability disclosure from the

616
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,159
receiving end is usually a pretty

617
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:29,120
emotional event

618
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,919
um so anything like i strongly urge you

619
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:33,679
to go hang out with

620
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:35,600
the social engineering folks over in

621
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,360
social engineering land

622
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,400
and learn how to make people believe

623
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,080
that you're on their side

624
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,320
i guess is the best way to put it but

625
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,360
yeah you don't have to be a jerk about

626
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,400
it

627
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,120
allow for extensions on your deadline um

628
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,039
if you have a deadline in mind

629
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:53,679
um know that things happen and sometimes

630
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:54,880
deadlines slip

631
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,559
um so if you're using the conference

632
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,559
excuse super um

633
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:01,679
you know that that is i think i think

634
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:02,480
okay

635
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,760
nobody cares about your conference by

636
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,280
the way you care about it uh they

637
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,400
definitely do not

638
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,200
um so if you blow through it then you

639
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,360
have mechanisms you know of disclosing

640
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,280
without specifically naming the vendor

641
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,280
and you can you can give that up right

642
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,480
and say like well listen i'm going to

643
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,200
publish

644
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,640
some details but i won't say your name

645
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,240
and i won't say who it is and i'll black

646
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,520
out all your logos and then they'll

647
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,000
they'll

648
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,320
feel they'll feel cared for if you do

649
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,320
something like that

650
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,200
and uh i don't know how to do it anyway

651
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,200
but try not to notice these buttons

652
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,919
right before or right after an election

653
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:34,720
um

654
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,720
because of reasons um since 2016

655
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,120
uh the general public is

656
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,200
[Music]

657
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,760
aware of us and aware of our activities

658
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,120
here and so

659
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:50,799
if you go to the news and say like hey i

660
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:51,360
know about a

661
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,480
vulnerability in you know dominion or

662
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,000
ess or whoever um and you disclose that

663
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,120
like two or three days before an

664
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,799
election you're causing a bunch of chaos

665
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:02,159
now maybe that's your maybe that's what

666
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:03,840
you want to do maybe that's your thing

667
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:07,039
um not my thing but maybe that's your

668
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:10,080
thing i strongly urge you uh to

669
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,600
not do that if you want like the best

670
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,600
time to disclose bugs is like today

671
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,039
right now

672
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:19,200
we are a year before the next um

673
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,880
congressional national congressional

674
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,480
elections there's almost always an

675
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,679
election going on

676
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:24,880
usually two or three times a year in

677
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,799
most localities there's uh there's an

678
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:27,600
election

679
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,760
um but then you know you've got headline

680
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,280
elections too so

681
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,080
uh be sensitive about that please and

682
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,440
you don't have to cause a huge

683
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,480
huge tussle uh over your vaults

684
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,120
um just as inside uh these three

685
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:41,840
companies

686
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:45,120
uh do you have edps and they state uh

687
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,880
in no uncertain terms the kinds of

688
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,240
deadlines they expect

689
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,080
um which is great it's good for you like

690
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,679
you know now and you can and that

691
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:53,120
actually gives you a huge amount of

692
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,240
ammunition because you can tell these

693
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,720
companies like hey man you said 120 days

694
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,280
so

695
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,559
that's coming up um and you know

696
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:02,220
they will still

697
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:03,760
[Music]

698
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,840
somewhat regularly ask for some

699
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,320
extension because of something

700
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,600
there's like a whole recertification

701
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,559
process there's a bunch of things that

702
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:12,320
go into these things right so

703
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,679
um with voting systems in particular um

704
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:19,039
expect definitely expect like a response

705
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:20,000
pretty quick but

706
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,320
like an ultimate fix maybe a little ways

707
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,200
out um

708
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,039
i do think that like opening with like

709
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:28,400
45 days or 60 days or 90 days

710
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,400
is a pretty good opener and fairly

711
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,440
reasonable for

712
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,400
like just tech in general um you know i

713
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,240
know this is a fact because every open

714
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,440
source project i

715
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,799
disclose vulnerabilities to they can

716
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:40,480
turn them around in a day

717
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,880
it's always these proprietary software

718
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,600
things that have

719
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,679
have troubles with more than that but

720
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:47,120
anyway uh they have

721
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,279
they have their own preferences there

722
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:52,559
and good for them for saying it out loud

723
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:55,840
um when you're looking at your

724
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,840
eventual public disclosure and i promise

725
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,679
i'm almost done uh when you look at your

726
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:01,039
public disclosure

727
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:03,600
just be clear on the attack scenario be

728
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,120
clear on the hardware

729
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,799
if it's a hardware attack if it's a

730
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:08,400
radio attack if it's a trusted network

731
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,000
attack or if it's an internet attack

732
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,679
right these are all very different kind

733
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:12,799
of levels

734
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:15,679
of scalability for attackers so be clear

735
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:16,840
about that

736
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,440
um when you're disclosing

737
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,559
vulnerabilities and when you're talking

738
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:21,520
about it you should have

739
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,520
at your fingertips at all times the name

740
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,159
of whatever the system is

741
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,799
they have several every one of these

742
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:31,360
vendors has several of these things

743
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,880
they have several versions of these

744
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,640
things and so be sure that

745
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,039
if if at all possible like get that

746
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:38,080
version number

747
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,240
if you have one that you've taken apart

748
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,720
get the fcc ids those are great

749
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,400
get serial numbers anything that like

750
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,000
identifies the the machine

751
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,400
is perfect um and also of course note if

752
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,000
it's a default config versus a custom

753
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,799
config

754
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:53,039
um you know that can go that you know a

755
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:54,559
lot of people can get real confused if

756
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,080
you are talking about something that

757
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,000
only happens in like a rare

758
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,640
custom config on the flip side if

759
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,320
there's a custom config that's like a de

760
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:05,120
facto default because the defaults are

761
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:08,320
nonsense or you know nobody uses them um

762
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,840
then then be clear about that as well

763
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,360
and finally when you're dealing with the

764
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,520
media reporters always want razzle

765
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,520
dazzle especially with this

766
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,159
especially with with voting systems they

767
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:20,640
will

768
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,240
many will try to push you into

769
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,840
oversimplifying the attack

770
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,760
and will try to put words in your mouth

771
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,880
and try to like lead you

772
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,559
down a a narrative that makes sense

773
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:32,960
and that a narrative that makes sense is

774
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,400
like the hallmark of fiction

775
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,840
when it turns out um so be careful about

776
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,320
that

777
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,919
uh journalists don't usually control

778
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:41,679
their own headlines and so you might

779
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:42,880
have a great experience with a great

780
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,320
journalist and then you see a headline

781
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,919
that is totally wrong and well that's

782
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:47,200
the editor's problem

783
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,000
um you know click click's gonna bait i

784
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:50,640
guess

785
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,039
um when you disclose these

786
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:54,880
vulnerabilities uh be prepared to deal

787
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,240
with crazy people

788
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,039
um there are a few of them out there uh

789
00:25:59,039 --> 00:25:59,440
that

790
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,520
especially pay attention to things like

791
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,200
voting machines i'm sure you can talk to

792
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,559
any of the

793
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:06,640
voting security superstars that are that

794
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,840
are at this event

795
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,919
and ask them about the crazy people that

796
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:12,080
they've that they've interacted with

797
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:15,440
um and and just finally like your bug

798
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,919
is beautiful um it is beautiful and

799
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:18,640
unique

800
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,640
and it is special and because of that

801
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,720
you are incredibly biased about your bug

802
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,000
so just keep that in mind

803
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,640
um when someone tries to talk you out of

804
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,320
you know trying to trying to lower a

805
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,919
cvss rating or

806
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:31,200
wants to say like well that's not

807
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,919
actually really how it works like

808
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:36,320
try to listen to it it's very hard

809
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,159
sometimes it's hard to hear

810
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:39,440
just like it's hard to hear that your

811
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,039
software is vulnerable it's hard to hear

812
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:42,799
that your bug kind of sucks

813
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:45,520
um so just keep that in mind if you want

814
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,880
any help on all any of this

815
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,120
ask me i'm a guy who does this all the

816
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,559
time you can write me

817
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:52,159
at rep7 you can find me on twitter my

818
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:53,840
dms are open

819
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,720
and with that

820
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,080
thank you so much uh i'm done so i'll be

821
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,400
around on the discord

822
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,600
and happy to talk about your cool cool

823
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,080
vulnerability
