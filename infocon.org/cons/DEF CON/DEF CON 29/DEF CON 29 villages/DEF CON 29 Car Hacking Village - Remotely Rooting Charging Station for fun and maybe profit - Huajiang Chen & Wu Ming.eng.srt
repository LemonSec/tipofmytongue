00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,279
hi there

2
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:20,160
thanks for attending our talk um our

3
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,439
talk today is

4
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:23,920
remote routine charging station for fun

5
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,119
and profit

6
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:27,359
and you will be presented by me and my

7
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,119
teammates bucket

8
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:30,800
and we're going to share our back

9
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,159
counting experience for

10
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,120
schneider at triple charging station

11
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,680
evading

12
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,520
okay so who we are i'm kevin to 600

13
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,000
a security researcher and i love

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,440
breaking stuff

15
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,160
and this is my teammate but he's a

16
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,680
security engineer

17
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,600
he's also the founder of wrapped dns.io

18
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,680
for the past few years we have focused

19
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,199
on vehicle security

20
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:01,359
for example we have successfully demoed

21
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:02,320
the

22
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,360
nyc nfc key fob relay attack for tesla

23
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,720
model 3 last year

24
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,880
and for this year we have found three

25
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,320
bucks for schneider

26
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,680
at electrical evidence charging station

27
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,640
and one of them is scored as the most

28
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,360
critical part

29
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,880
so here are the contents for today um

30
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,119
first i'm going to do a charging station

31
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:26,320
101

32
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,119
i will be introduced how does it work

33
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:31,040
and why do we need to concern

34
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,000
its security and then i will walk

35
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,600
through some of the interesting case

36
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,560
studies

37
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,240
from the other skill researchers

38
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,479
and eventually but he will share the

39
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,360
whole story

40
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,720
on how we got rc on the ev link and what

41
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,680
the impact

42
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,040
can be can can it be

43
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,320
once we got in okay so china station 101

44
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,159
so why charging stations right

45
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,399
um a lot of people talking about vehicle

46
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:05,920
security nowadays

47
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,280
um they usually refer to car itself

48
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,120
for example they were talking about how

49
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,920
to reverse engineer cam protocols

50
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,200
or can we sniff in the tpns

51
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,720
tpms for tires and

52
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,440
if we can hack the key fob systems and

53
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,000
getting

54
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,040
vehicles but let's not forget there's

55
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,680
something called we to act communication

56
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,000
and it's also played a very big part in

57
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,959
the vehicle network

58
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,319
and the x v to x the x

59
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:41,200
uh can means many things for example

60
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,720
we're called to vehicle

61
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,440
with v and we're equal to infrastructure

62
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:45,760
which

63
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,879
i and also for the charging station

64
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,080
we took great weight to g okay

65
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,480
so for v2g they usually refer to

66
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,120
connection

67
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,319
between the car and charging stations so

68
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,400
when you go to charge station you're

69
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,760
usually talking about

70
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,959
um you you to interactive with the uh

71
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:07,200
the scada system behind me or something

72
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,159
like that

73
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:11,280
okay so i think we

74
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,000
we where nowadays won't feel any strange

75
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,840
to see a charging station

76
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,480
around you because they are everywhere

77
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,360
now

78
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,599
and this is just a map to show how many

79
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:22,959
charging stations are around the

80
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:24,000
chinatown area

81
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,799
in vancouver canada see i took this

82
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:27,840
picture from the

83
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,200
open source open charge map io

84
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,159
and you see we already see many menus

85
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:35,519
all right

86
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,239
and also this one gets from charging

87
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:39,200
point map

88
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,360
and can you see how many of them are in

89
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,799
a state right now

90
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,400
amazing right so many

91
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,440
and they not only in exist in their

92
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,080
rewards

93
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,640
we can find lawton exposed to internet

94
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,200
too

95
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,120
as you can see we can use user easily

96
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,400
find the fund find a loved one

97
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,879
through some search engines so for

98
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:03,760
example

99
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,080
with the help from student we can easily

100
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,680
spot a tesla

101
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,760
power pack system um yeah let's see

102
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,120
not many but there's they are exist

103
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,120
also if we were searching for ocpp

104
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,440
which is the protocol specially designed

105
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,479
for communicating

106
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,240
between the charging station and the

107
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,600
back-end server

108
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,680
we can spot many of them on the internet

109
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,919
too

110
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,080
so this is what charging station looks

111
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,080
like in the real life

112
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,320
see as you can see it can it can be

113
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,040
different forms and sizes but

114
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,080
for example this one is for uh usually

115
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:44,639
for the

116
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,960
a small residential area and this can be

117
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,000
uh for just

118
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,759
like commercial use okay

119
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,960
but regardless of the size of forms they

120
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,680
all got

121
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,080
plug connectors however each country

122
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,440
each country

123
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,240
has used its own standard even for

124
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:02,880
company like

125
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,759
tesla has even implemented their own

126
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,400
version of connectors

127
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,560
and charging station usually use cam

128
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,720
protocol to communicate with bns

129
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,800
system on a record which is for stand

130
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,199
for natural management system

131
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,320
but in europe they're using plc

132
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,160
power line communication to talk to the

133
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,000
bms with tcp so

134
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,440
yeah they got they actually got iphs

135
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,120
right pretty cool right hackers

136
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,759
and there are network servers in the

137
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,039
back end right

138
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:38,080
so to take care of like payments is

139
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,960
payments or any other service the

140
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:41,919
customer may

141
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:44,880
they may need to dealing with right so

142
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,199
it's

143
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,400
actually a whole lot of the uh

144
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,880
it looks like it is you look like a

145
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,560
actual iot network

146
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,680
but it's bigger right

147
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,120
okay as i mentioned earlier

148
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,919
charging station can use ocpp protocol

149
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:03,840
to talk to the backend server

150
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,199
and the latest version of ocpp relies on

151
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,400
jason from messenger and this is great

152
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,120
place

153
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,479
for uh for for us to do the forcing

154
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:15,039
attack

155
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,840
right so maybe we can force in some um

156
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,319
specific uh area to find if there's any

157
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,319
bug

158
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,919
okay since the charging

159
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,639
station is just embedded assistant so

160
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,479
and has provided many services

161
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,720
so the servers they provide more

162
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,520
possibility

163
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,000
we can attack them so here are sounds

164
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,120
for the tech matters

165
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,000
i can i think we can try it on so first

166
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,919
we can try to reverse engineer

167
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:47,120
their application app applications

168
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,840
to try to find if there's any api

169
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,919
interface exposable

170
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:55,039
also since there they have the

171
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,199
cloud back-end server maybe we can try

172
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:58,400
that on too

173
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,120
and like i said there the charging

174
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,240
station itself is a

175
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,680
most likely an embedded system they

176
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,919
they probably have the running on ubuntu

177
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,520
or other linux system

178
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,960
so yeah the next system we can try

179
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,000
um also if we we can take in part

180
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,880
we may find some debugging port um

181
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,280
accessible like jtag or uart

182
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,560
right and usually the the charging

183
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,280
station has

184
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,400
some wireless connection uh with it like

185
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,759
uh ble wifi of like 4g

186
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,440
5g and when talking about the payment

187
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,240
they're probably using rfid and yeah

188
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,280
rfid

189
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,479
is it's also hackable too and as i

190
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:43,199
mentioned

191
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,319
the the vehicle we're using can or plc

192
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:46,800
to talk

193
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,080
to the uh charging stations um

194
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,919
maybe there's a way to to hack it as

195
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,080
well

196
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,319
right so back as question we asked in

197
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:57,759
the very beginning

198
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:00,160
why charging stations right because i

199
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,199
think they are

200
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,360
already everywhere and they're less

201
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,560
expensive than cars

202
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,199
so buy a car it's usually cost a lot of

203
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:07,759
money

204
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,919
but it's much cheaper if we're just

205
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:10,960
targeting

206
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,800
charging stations we can buy a brand new

207
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,800
one and start from there

208
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,919
and right now i i when i do

209
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,080
when we do the research we didn't

210
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,319
there's a few but not many people

211
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,120
focus on this area so less attention

212
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,280
maybe that means there's a lot of bug

213
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:27,919
for us to

214
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,800
just waiting for us to discover so yeah

215
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,840
more functions

216
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,958
more tech betters right

217
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:39,599
so charging station case studies um

218
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,760
so for the first one this first one is

219
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,519
uh um

220
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,160
the one from uh third control company

221
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,519
called sir control

222
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:51,760
the report name circle car life

223
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,279
um this is not new but rather

224
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:58,000
years old however we still can find lots

225
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,399
of them

226
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,480
online you see when i when we simply

227
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,519
search for

228
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:06,640
server circle car life we we find 2932

229
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,040
of them already are still exposable

230
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,720
online

231
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,519
right so currently there are multiple

232
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:14,240
cvs

233
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,959
under uh circle car life charging

234
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:17,760
stations

235
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,920
for example it will leak username and

236
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,720
password information like here

237
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,200
from a log file without any

238
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,240
authentications

239
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,600
so this is um not acceptable right so

240
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,320
many years and

241
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,920
they still not fix it okay

242
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,560
on case number two there's multiple

243
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,519
devices

244
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,560
made by us sorry there's a main

245
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,680
innovator device

246
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,480
made by a secure researcher and it can

247
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,760
be used for sniffing

248
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,160
and inject package between cars and

249
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,560
charging station through plc

250
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,080
i think this is pretty cool he has also

251
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,920
released a tool to help us to decode

252
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,560
pockets

253
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,279
so if you're interested to research on

254
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:02,240
you can try to this

255
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:05,120
website and even better

256
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,760
he also released another tool called v2g

257
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,560
injector

258
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,640
which can inject pocket into the cars

259
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,079
and charging stations

260
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:15,680
however this comes from fallout

261
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,800
if you need to you you have to be in an

262
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,120
area like support plc for example you in

263
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:21,680
most

264
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,920
european countries are supporting them

265
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,920
but if you happen to be in china

266
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,360
um usually you usually face in the uh

267
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,360
the charging station only accept chem

268
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,399
protocols so

269
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,240
you will not able to do this kind of

270
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,720
research

271
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,680
now this is another uh interesting

272
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,240
research

273
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,279
done by tencent blade team they found

274
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:45,200
this design flaw

275
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,640
seeing a charging station payment

276
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,279
mechanism the way this payment mechanism

277
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:49,600
work

278
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,120
is the first our car

279
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,680
like for example bms will transmit we

280
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,959
call win

281
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:59,760
number two to the charge station and the

282
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,000
transformation will transmit

283
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,040
this win number uh

284
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,959
all the way back to the chat uh the

285
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,079
back-end server

286
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:10,320
and they do that do the background check

287
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,839
on there and then

288
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,920
once they all slide you they will send

289
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,200
back their

290
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,480
credentials banned following

291
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,920
with number all right and once they they

292
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,959
they they know you are a legit user

293
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:28,480
they will start charging on the payments

294
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,519
uh recordingly okay now this is uh

295
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,839
like this is a thing called a plugin

296
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:35,120
charge

297
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,320
so as i i mentioned

298
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,320
since the vehicle in china using cam

299
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,680
proco to communicate

300
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,320
with a charging station so the bulletin

301
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,040
what they did

302
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,920
is they built a cam made in the metal

303
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,480
device

304
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,920
called x charger so basically they

305
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,760
they build one device based on a

306
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,600
raspberry pi they can sniff

307
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,160
the the chem protocols in between the

308
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,200
main middle attack

309
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,200
again but for the cat protocol this time

310
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,480
so with help from this device they can

311
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,279
capture

312
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:12,079
out of canned traffic between car and

313
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:13,279
stations

314
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:16,800
now um

315
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,639
what they have found is that some other

316
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:19,920
station in china using

317
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,760
as i mentioned earlier they're using

318
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,519
wind number to authenticate the user for

319
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:24,560
the payment

320
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,760
purpose now however this win number

321
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,160
is easily replaceable during the whole

322
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,200
process

323
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,560
so they can simply replace

324
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,600
the the for the number with different

325
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,360
cars so the other people

326
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,800
will pay the fees for you

327
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,360
so free charge right pretty cool and

328
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,000
also

329
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,240
like nicely they have done research on

330
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,040
the tesla

331
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,839
now they found the tesla charging

332
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,440
station actually using their private

333
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,399
protocols

334
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,120
so we still need to have to re find a

335
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,560
way to reverse engineer

336
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,600
the entire private protocols um

337
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,320
if so it's pretty i think this is a

338
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,040
pretty good

339
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,639
area to thinking more now

340
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,720
the last case case for this is an

341
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,079
interesting case found by

342
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:15,279
us the story um

343
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:17,040
is we know that one of the particular

344
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,160
charging station companies called

345
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,200
charging points

346
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,600
they predict that in by 2025

347
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,959
there will be 2.5 mil uh every charging

348
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:28,079
station spot

349
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:31,120
banned by then right i think this is a

350
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:31,760
very

351
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,560
popular one in vancouver and across the

352
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,200
country

353
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,720
in the state as well so

354
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,800
the story is very simple actually one

355
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,680
day which we choose to reverse engineer

356
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,399
their mobile the mobile application from

357
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:48,639
them

358
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:51,600
we have found a simple uh reflected

359
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,279
cross-site scripting pack for their

360
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,639
back-end server

361
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,720
um because they are using some kind of

362
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,720
waft system but however we find a way to

363
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,279
bypass

364
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:02,639
it um and we

365
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:06,160
right away as a uh ethical hacker we

366
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,399
report them back to the to to the

367
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:09,199
company and

368
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:11,680
with the full details discouraging so

369
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,959
any stories right

370
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,839
no turns out the charge point security

371
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:18,480
team takes security very seriously

372
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,199
they have rewarded us a one thousand

373
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:21,920
dollars

374
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,120
for a bounty through hack one well one

375
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,480
thousand dollars right for

376
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,399
just for uh chris chris

377
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:34,160
crosby scripting i mean pretty cool

378
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,399
we cannot be hacked here so yeah big

379
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:37,600
thanks for thumbs up

380
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,639
for for the charging point um

381
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:44,160
yeah okay so

382
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,560
now my teammate back he will walk

383
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,199
through

384
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:50,320
the whole journey of [ __ ] hunting of

385
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:59,839
schneider evading okay

386
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,639
now i'm going to share our journey

387
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:12,240
of hunting for schneider link

388
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,279
this is my first time please bear with

389
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:17,519
me

390
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,480
first i like to make it clear our mind

391
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,800
goes carries to god root

392
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,560
until and juices on the target target

393
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,680
and we are lucky we might our goal

394
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,199
and were assigned three series

395
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:38,480
from schneider in the on also

396
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,600
the reason to trust to research

397
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,040
on ebay link is because

398
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,160
the firmware can be easily

399
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:52,880
downloaded from slider website

400
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,639
and there are a certain amount amount

401
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:59,759
of uv link device i exposed to the

402
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,320
internet

403
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,839
so the first step is to do some

404
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:09,040
recon for our target and as

405
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,160
i said we can download the from web

406
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,959
directly

407
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,240
[Music]

408
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,240
the firmware is a top field top file it

409
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,360
includes files like bootstrap

410
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,720
homage ebay ic based image

411
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,480
file under other binary files

412
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,519
based on on this

413
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:38,480
files we can find the lights to target

414
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:38,800
with

415
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:43,680
our arm based direct device

416
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,800
under from your board file

417
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,480
we can find the body rate

418
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,120
servo ip under some other

419
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:00,079
configuration information

420
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:03,839
from homage we know the kernel version

421
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:07,439
and the untried point device which makes

422
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:07,839
it

423
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:11,119
easy for later reverse engineer

424
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:14,799
work so

425
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:18,880
now we learned the partition start

426
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,079
structure of our target

427
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:26,559
and we have tried to crack the root hash

428
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:30,000
inside the shadow file but

429
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,840
it's failed

430
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,760
when they started to reveal survival

431
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,559
manager

432
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:44,880
and interface it has many functions

433
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,640
such as the log files open parts

434
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,919
and the form while updating also

435
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:55,760
the path of a web application on the

436
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:01,679
ebay ic circle database file

437
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:05,520
there are some open source components

438
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:09,360
that every link is using

439
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,799
under interestingly founded two

440
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:18,000
hardcoded secret accounts

441
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,520
named open and schneider within the

442
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,360
circle file and they have been removed

443
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:30,639
from the lattice the from map

444
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,160
after we have done the recap time to

445
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,679
hunting box for one hour

446
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:43,360
we start with the cross first side

447
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,720
script and this guy's

448
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,799
as our first destiny however

449
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:54,480
this won't help us to guide us so

450
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,840
let's try harder

451
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,640
wait let's move on to reversing the

452
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,799
binary file cgi server

453
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:10,640
we located some useful keywords

454
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,400
as a ice core and this is useful

455
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,000
for us to distinguish

456
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,280
different functions

457
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,640
we also found some white parts

458
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,679
from cjs05

459
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:32,559
this may be useful for later fighting

460
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:34,960
attack

461
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,640
eventually we have located an

462
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,400
interesting function

463
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,679
with insight function we found

464
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,799
a hardcoded cr tokens

465
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:52,640
and these tokens can be used to bypass

466
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:58,080
the login author authentication process

467
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,520
continue to analyzing the

468
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,559
login process we found that one's

469
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:11,520
local size the problem with

470
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:15,440
parameter meter

471
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,280
we 1 5 3 we will become

472
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,320
true and this is

473
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,200
the same results as using other

474
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,000
coordinated tokens

475
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,960
which confirm the light tokens can be

476
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:31,600
used

477
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,840
to bypass attack

478
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,880
once manually and by the

479
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,960
security token within our request

480
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,000
we can successfully bypass the logging

481
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:48,880
awesome

482
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,840
authentication

483
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,760
so now we need to find a way

484
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,960
for rce after we search the

485
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,159
erc savvy we have located the

486
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:05,200
hard coded epk and

487
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:09,080
this key is used as signature

488
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:13,520
verification for firmware

489
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:18,159
after we read the epk install file

490
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:21,360
we found that the firmware package can

491
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,320
be

492
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:27,120
easily forged folded

493
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,480
as long as way build a

494
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,760
installing package with hardcore data

495
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,640
etk

496
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,880
as you can see rebuilding a new firmware

497
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,679
package

498
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:45,600
is very easy we can put our

499
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,799
own reverse child pilot

500
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:52,720
into the firmware package

501
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,799
in order to trigger the part we need to

502
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:02,080
upload the back downwards of the

503
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,639
firmware

504
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,240
as you can see once the payload

505
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,280
triggered

506
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,640
we got ourself a good shot

507
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,919
missing completed

508
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:22,158
so now we got rc work

509
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,720
let's write a working exploit

510
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,240
the other to do that we first

511
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,440
need to know the process of updating

512
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,720
from life

513
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,960
under some parameters

514
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,960
like final id and we can use

515
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,960
very sharp temperature of light

516
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,640
once we know the

517
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,080
entire updating process

518
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,120
we can draw a flowchart for

519
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,880
developing exploited undercut payload

520
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,240
ready and

521
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:08,320
of course we need to preview

522
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,360
the second section token

523
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,720
for the cookies request plus

524
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,840
without all the needed information

525
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:23,520
the exploiter is ready to go

526
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:27,440
now you may ask what can they do

527
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,880
after god healthy i think

528
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,440
most people will like to get a free

529
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,840
charge

530
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:38,480
right but there are

531
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,799
there are amount for example

532
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:46,080
it can be turned to boneless

533
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:50,159
for the dog's attack house

534
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:53,440
also it can be a breaking point

535
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:57,120
for the enterprise nightmare and thus

536
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,400
it hides knight either to be mis

537
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04,240
on the right code maybe a way to

538
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,919
surprise rice write some wall

539
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:10,559
for cars

540
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,559
here are some examples for operating

541
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:20,000
to a internal network this traveling

542
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:20,640
station

543
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,159
is also part of the university

544
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:26,720
network

545
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:30,799
and on this parking station also running

546
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:31,679
a building

547
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:35,600
management application with a different

548
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:39,760
part is what

549
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:43,120
has our model functions to

550
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:47,840
manage the vehicle charging system

551
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,760
so after we found those sparks

552
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,880
we have reported reported them

553
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,880
to schleider they had fixed the

554
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,400
13 packs in total from the eva link

555
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:07,600
products and released the

556
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:12,480
advisory advice advisory

557
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,000
last month's month and assigned

558
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,679
us three cves

559
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:23,360
so we believe

560
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,799
that more trust will bring more

561
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:30,720
attack vectors vectors

562
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,320
and the charging solution of v2x

563
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,760
has got a huge

564
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:42,720
pad type potential for split security

565
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,480
researchers

566
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:57,840
thank you

567
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,639
you
