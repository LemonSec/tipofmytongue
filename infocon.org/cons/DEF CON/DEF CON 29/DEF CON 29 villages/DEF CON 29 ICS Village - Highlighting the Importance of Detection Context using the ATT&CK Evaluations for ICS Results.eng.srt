1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,360
hello everybody uh thank you for taking

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,520
the time to listen today

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,320
my name is otis alexander i'm a cyber

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,080
security engineer

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,679
um at mitre

6
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:13,519
and i lead the effort for attack

7
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,119
evaluations for ics uh so today i'll be

8
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:19,520
talking about uh the importance of

9
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,400
detection context uh

10
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,880
in regard to our recently released

11
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,720
results for

12
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,960
minor ingenuities attack evaluations for

13
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,279
ics

14
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:33,760
so just as background

15
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,440
this is attack evaluations first

16
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,200
move into

17
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,239
a new evaluation domain industrial

18
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,520
control systems and we just completed

19
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,680
our first round of independent

20
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,079
evaluations for ics and the results were

21
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,800
released last month on the 19th

22
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,760
so the evaluations examined how cyber

23
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,320
security products from five vendors or

24
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,239
ics vendors armis

25
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:04,799
clarity dragos iii and microsoft

26
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,280
were able to detect ttp

27
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,320
associated with the trident malware

28
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,760
so

29
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,600
just as background for attack

30
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,880
evaluations our goals are to improve

31
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,360
organizations against known adversary

32
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,400
behavior by first empowering end users

33
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,360
with objective insights so they know how

34
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,560
to use the participating uh products

35
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,360
uh

36
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,159
providing transparency around the true

37
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,560
capabilities of these products

38
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,720
and driving vendors to really enhance

39
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,960
their capabilities

40
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,799
it's important to note that these

41
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,399
evaluations

42
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:45,200
uh

43
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,040
don't result in a winner we're not

44
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,920
declaring a winner uh they're not meant

45
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,880
to be a competitive analysis

46
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,600
we're simply documenting what we

47
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,960
observed in regard to detections

48
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,040
and it's just important

49
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,600
to remember across vendors there's no

50
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,159
similar way that you know we know of

51
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,598
analyzing ranking or rating solutions so

52
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:12,720
we look at how each vendor approaches

53
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,040
threat defense within the context of

54
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,440
attack

55
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,040
so for

56
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,280
this adversary emulation that we did for

57
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,280
this evaluation

58
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,280
we were emulating

59
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,000
ttp associated with

60
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,959
the well-known trident attack

61
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:34,000
and

62
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,080
we launched our adversary emulation

63
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,120
against an evaluation environment

64
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,560
uh that is our lab which functions as a

65
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,879
burner management system

66
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:47,760
so we launched 100 sub steps against

67
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,239
that environment and the real goal of

68
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,000
this was

69
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,879
to disable safety functions and to allow

70
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:57,200
for unsafe state to be induced so the

71
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,040
unsafe state that we were trying to

72
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,319
induce in this burner management system

73
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:05,920
was a release of gas without the system

74
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,640
tripping at all and once we

75
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,800
got enough gas in the simulated facility

76
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,080
uh we

77
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,560
went ahead and ignited that gas to cause

78
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,680
uh

79
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,239
destruction to the infrastructure

80
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:20,959
so

81
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:23,040
it's important to note here that many of

82
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,480
the things that we did were just

83
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,879
standard actions that were

84
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,519
leveraged against the environment

85
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,680
the adversary emulation consisted of a

86
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,599
lot of remote access

87
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,120
actions it

88
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,360
also from the ics perspective it

89
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,519
consisted of like status requests to

90
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:46,560
pocs or online edits to change

91
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,840
configurations of plc's or even forcing

92
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,040
points to

93
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,120
try to drive the process into a bad

94
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,080
state

95
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:54,959
so

96
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,879
if you want to learn more about what we

97
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,720
did i encourage you to go to the attack

98
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,720
eval site to look at our operational

99
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,720
flow and we'll go through the individual

100
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,200
steps

101
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:06,480
so

102
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,920
each vendor

103
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,760
that was participating

104
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,720
sent us a physical appliance

105
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,640
with their solution installed on it for

106
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,680
us to

107
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,399
install in our lab and they all received

108
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,000
network traffic was which was

109
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,759
distributed to them by a network

110
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:22,960
aggregator

111
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,320
uh in addition uh windows event logs

112
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,479
were centrally collected and then

113
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,720
forwarded via syslog to any of the

114
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,639
vendors that

115
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,360
had the capability to collect those with

116
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,240
the appliance that they sent to us

117
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,160
we also offered the opportunity to

118
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,360
actively pull the plc's for

119
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,919
configuration changes this is a feature

120
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,880
that some of the vendors have and we

121
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,199
wanted to see how it worked so for those

122
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,520
that offer that to their customer base

123
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,000
we offered the chance to do that but at

124
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,800
the end of execution so that uh that

125
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,600
traffic to the plc's didn't interfere

126
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,120
with the network traffic going to

127
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,000
everybody else

128
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,919
so important concept is uh detection

129
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:13,199
categories and it's important because

130
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,759
each of these vendors has their own way

131
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:16,720
of

132
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,000
describing uh detections they have their

133
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,960
own

134
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,960
uh windows and their ui where they

135
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,199
collect these things it may be called

136
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:29,360
you know alerting window or detection

137
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,840
window or even uh notifications or

138
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,160
something like that it also a lot of

139
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,400
times have a back end

140
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,600
which collects a lot of the atomic data

141
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,680
that's being parsed um

142
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,240
from the particular uh collector or data

143
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,320
source that that um they're ingesting so

144
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,240
um it's important for us to be able to

145
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,160
abstract that data

146
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,240
so that we can talk to about it in a

147
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,479
similar way across the vendors and

148
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:00,479
that's really what detection categories

149
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:01,199
are

150
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:05,039
so across the top we have our uh main

151
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:09,280
detections uh n a just means that the

152
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,360
particular participant

153
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,400
didn't have a solution to collect a

154
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,319
particular data source so we just write

155
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,680
n a by that

156
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,680
uh none means that we didn't see any

157
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,280
detection at all

158
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,319
uh telemetry is just minimally processed

159
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:25,840
data with

160
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,800
you know little to no context associated

161
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,759
with it a general tactic and technique

162
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,440
represent context that the vendor

163
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,919
product has added to

164
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,360
the detection

165
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,039
to kind of talk about why it's malicious

166
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,919
we also will include two modifiers which

167
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:48,400
are config change and correlation so

168
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,160
config change

169
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,080
is uh

170
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,720
added to a detection or to a point in

171
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,520
time to show that the

172
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,759
vendor made a change to their product so

173
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,120
they have to

174
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,120
come to us and let us know what that

175
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,680
change is and if we approve it then

176
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,199
we'll add that

177
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,160
to that particular sub step

178
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,199
that it

179
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:12,960
corresponds with

180
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,680
correlation uh which is going to be a

181
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,160
important topic coming up

182
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,120
is

183
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,960
i add it to a detection to show that

184
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,759
a detection was associated with another

185
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:28,479
detection or other data that had been

186
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:29,360
seen

187
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,199
uh and this can add more

188
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:32,720
context to

189
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,319
a detection so that you can better

190
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,360
understand surrounding events

191
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,000
um so let's talk about that a little bit

192
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,599
uh let's talk about how we can add more

193
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:44,720
core

194
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,479
context to

195
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,639
particular detections by leveraging

196
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,560
correlation and even leveraging

197
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,400
correlation across data sources

198
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,080
so

199
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,479
like i said before uh we were talking

200
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,960
about the abster emulation

201
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,639
this was

202
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:07,039
built off of a lot of standard actions

203
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:08,400
and

204
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,400
these actions are not malicious on their

205
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,039
own you really have to provide context

206
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,599
to them to understand that they're

207
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:19,039
malicious so

208
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:22,560
rdp ssh sftp if there's things that you

209
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,160
do in your environment those are just

210
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,479
standard actions that happen

211
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,879
uh status requests in

212
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,240
regard to

213
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,679
uh the sip protocol or online edits or

214
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,839
force points or you know the standard

215
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,640
actions that you see uh in control

216
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,399
systems are

217
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,360
uh not malicious in and of themselves

218
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,399
uh so it's important to add context to

219
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,080
them so that

220
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,160
analysts can understand that this is

221
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,040
something that really needs to be looked

222
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,120
at or

223
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,880
responded to

224
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,560
so to prove that action is bad uh we

225
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,240
really need to show

226
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,480
something else some some other context

227
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,040
we need to give some more information so

228
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,440
maybe it's that this particular action

229
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,600
will negatively impact the control

230
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,720
system

231
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,680
or it should not have been performed uh

232
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,839
at a particular time

233
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:20,320
or by a particular person or at all in

234
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,200
this environment or you know another

235
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,920
thing that we can do is we can

236
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:30,080
use correlation or tie it to some other

237
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,839
malicious activity

238
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:34,160
that it's related to and therefore we

239
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,920
have more context

240
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,360
about it

241
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,200
maybe potentially being bad

242
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,320
so

243
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,440
what we're really looking for is a more

244
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,959
holistic view of detections what we see

245
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,839
a lot is telemetry

246
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,720
and singular analytic detections

247
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,440
uh which all increase visibility in an

248
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,040
environment

249
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,600
but alone they don't always provide

250
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,000
enough context for ants to know that

251
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,399
they're bad or or that they should be

252
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,560
investigated

253
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,760
so correlation can be really used to tie

254
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,560
together the standard actions to

255
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,240
malicious ones

256
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,200
so

257
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,640
during uh

258
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,279
the execution and while we were

259
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,200
collecting evidence and processing

260
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,200
results we did see correlation we saw um

261
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,800
correlation

262
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,399
in our regard to singular data sources

263
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:33,200
so

264
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,399
um

265
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:37,519
windows events or network traffic but

266
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,000
not both at the same time so just to

267
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,839
give you some examples of

268
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:43,440
things that we saw

269
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,680
uh we saw windows host data sources

270
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,360
which were tied to related events

271
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,880
associated with the execution of

272
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,959
malicious programs

273
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,160
usually

274
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,800
consolidated to a single asset something

275
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,279
that happened on one asset so this was

276
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:02,720
good because

277
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,519
what it did was it built a bigger story

278
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,160
around a single action so that we saw

279
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,560
related events and we got more context

280
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,720
of what happened over a particular time

281
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,680
period

282
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,120
or uh how a parent process launched

283
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,200
under other processes

284
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,480
and you know a tree structure of events

285
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,440
so that we as an analyst can

286
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,880
uh really understand a a sequence of

287
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,320
events

288
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,160
uh the other thing that we saw were

289
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,720
events pulled together in a story format

290
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:39,600
more of a a narrative talking about

291
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,680
network sessions that may relate to each

292
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,839
other or

293
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:45,760
other information that provided root

294
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,800
cause analysis to really explain why

295
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,120
something may have been happening

296
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,120
both these are great examples of

297
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,639
correlation

298
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:58,160
over a single data source but what we

299
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,760
wanted to see is more narrative about

300
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,160
what was happening across data sources

301
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,160
to really tie some of this stuff

302
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,519
together so that we had more context as

303
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,920
an analyst

304
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,720
so

305
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,160
i provided a couple of examples of

306
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,000
things that we could

307
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,480
potentially do to provide more

308
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,440
correlation across data sources

309
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,399
so

310
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,880
if you look at our adversary emulation

311
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,720
it's broken out into sub steps

312
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,519
and

313
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:34,880
each subset has some criteria something

314
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,279
that we're looking for

315
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:38,639
in terms of the

316
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,000
detection

317
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,880
uh to say that this is related this uh

318
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,440
will count as evidence of

319
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,600
this particular step of adversary

320
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,959
emulation

321
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:52,800
so some of our sub steps are related

322
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,839
together uh and it's usually in in terms

323
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:59,360
of numbering but overall it's a a

324
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,360
similar action so for instance 4b

325
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:09,519
1 and 4b 2 are uh and 4 4 c 1 are all

326
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:10,959
pretty much

327
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:14,160
a similar goal of the atmosphere

328
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,920
similar action

329
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,440
uh 4b1 is evidence that

330
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,200
the executable s p client uh is not

331
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,040
legitimate so

332
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,200
this particular executable is

333
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,800
masquerading as something related to smb

334
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,079
but it's truly not

335
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:38,160
and 4b2 is evidence of an established

336
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,839
network connection over tcp port 445

337
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:44,480
uh between the adversary machine and the

338
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,120
control engineering workstation

339
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,639
and this is an outbound ssh tunnel uh

340
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,600
request through the firewall

341
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,880
and uh what we see here is the s p

342
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,440
client is actually plink

343
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,600
under the hood and it's creating this

344
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,360
outbound ssh

345
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,560
request

346
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,959
and then 4c is evidence of an

347
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,360
established network connection over tcp

348
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,680
port 3389

349
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,920
uh between the adversary machine and the

350
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,760
control ews

351
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:19,680
so if we look at all of these uh sub

352
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,720
steps

353
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,839
what we see is that they have uh

354
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:26,480
differing data sources so the first one

355
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,199
is uh we're looking for a windows event

356
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:31,680
uh the next one we're looking at network

357
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,600
traffic for evidence of the network

358
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,560
session

359
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,199
and then the third one we're looking for

360
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:39,279
a windows event again

361
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:40,480
so

362
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,600
what we kind of saw is like for 4b1 we

363
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,079
may see an alert that talks about

364
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:47,920
masquerading and

365
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,560
uh may tie together

366
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:54,160
certain processes uh that are related to

367
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,800
each other to correlate and kind of tell

368
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,360
a story about how these processes were

369
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,880
being executed but what we did see is

370
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,440
the windows event related to the network

371
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,560
traffic

372
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,160
so on the right-hand side what we have

373
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,519
is you know it's a narrative but it's

374
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,360
something that we would

375
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,839
like to see in terms of correlation

376
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:18,000
across the data sources to to kind of

377
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,720
tell a narrative so it says behavior was

378
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,040
observed indicating network restriction

379
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,320
bypass through rdp tunneling based on

380
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,440
the executable s b client i execute

381
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,560
masquerading as plink die execute

382
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,199
being used to create an ssh tunnel over

383
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:37,120
port 445

384
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,639
so

385
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:41,920
we don't expect this exact um you know

386
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,519
sentence to be

387
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:46,720
stated within a particular platform but

388
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,839
something

389
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:49,839
that uh

390
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:51,120
leverages

391
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,160
information from all three of these sub

392
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,680
steps

393
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,720
uh to correlate it into some

394
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,839
coherent story or tied together so that

395
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:03,920
the analyst knows

396
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,560
that these things are related and

397
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,759
that these standard actions are tied to

398
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:11,199
something

399
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:13,759
malicious in this case uh masquerading

400
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:17,040
for smb client

401
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,839
so i have another example here of uh sip

402
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:24,320
communication and uh correlation across

403
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,399
uh these types of events

404
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:31,360
so these span across sub steps 19 b1

405
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,560
20 a1 and 282

406
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,759
so 20 our 19b1 is evidence that a newly

407
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:39,519
created uh

408
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:41,759
newly created files from

409
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:44,480
a zip that are have been extracted into

410
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,160
the temp directory

411
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,399
are not legitimate so now we're kind of

412
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:51,360
dealing with this whole masquerading

413
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,880
again

414
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,160
and then 20a one is evidence that rs

415
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,199
logic 5000. that execute which was

416
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:03,600
recently uh extracted from this uh

417
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,400
uh was executed on the safety

418
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,119
engineering workstation and this may

419
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:12,319
also include uh things like

420
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:15,280
their uh parameters associated with this

421
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,280
particular executable and things like

422
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:21,119
that 2082 is evidence of an adversary

423
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:23,280
initiated get attribute single sip

424
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,480
request

425
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,359
for the status attribute associated with

426
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,120
the plc

427
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,720
so again we have three separate sub

428
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,280
steps with their own criteria and they

429
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,400
have differing data sources on uh the

430
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,039
middle column here so the first one is

431
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:43,520
associated with windows events as is the

432
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,240
second one but the third one is network

433
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,280
traffic that we may be uh looking for

434
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,760
so again we saw

435
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,240
a correlation for windows events

436
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,320
associated with masquerading or

437
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,000
scripting and different things like that

438
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,039
we saw

439
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,840
event trees being created or events

440
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,480
being tied together based on

441
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,360
certain criteria but what we didn't see

442
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,720
is

443
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,960
windows events related to network

444
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,000
traffic

445
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,480
so on the right hand side again we have

446
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,400
uh correlation

447
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,840
across the data sources and what we uh

448
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,320
would expect to see in terms of tying

449
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,480
together these events so

450
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,480
behavior was observed indicating that a

451
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,520
newly created file rslogix 5000 is

452
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,440
masquerading as an allen bradley

453
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,880
executable

454
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,400
and is an issue a sip request for status

455
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,559
attribute over the network

456
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:39,760
so now

457
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,039
we have this standard action again uh

458
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,600
that we may see in an environment a lot

459
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,480
this sip request for a status attribute

460
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,240
for the plc

461
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,520
uh which

462
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,360
may or may not be malicious we don't

463
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,240
know but combined with something that

464
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,559
relates in time or

465
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:00,559
some other criteria

466
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:02,720
to this newly created file that's

467
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,160
masquerading as an allen bradley file

468
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,320
uh now we can kind of build a story

469
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,320
about why this may be malicious and it

470
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,400
takes on a whole new meaning

471
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,120
to

472
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,919
an analyst looking at the screen

473
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:16,880
so

474
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,440
by leveraging these different data

475
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,720
sources and tying to them together we

476
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,280
can actually tell a better story about

477
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,160
why standard actions may warrant some

478
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,520
more investigation

479
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:35,120
so this really is our call to vendors as

480
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,080
you know provide more context to some of

481
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,600
these detections

482
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,160
we saw a lot of

483
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,840
good context provided in regards to

484
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,039
singer singular analytic detections we

485
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:51,919
saw correlation across singular data

486
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:53,280
sources

487
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,520
uh but we didn't see

488
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,039
um

489
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:59,840
the ability uh to leverage approaches to

490
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,919
correlate the textures across multiple

491
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:05,039
data sources so we gave some examples of

492
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:08,400
host-based and network-based

493
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,120
data sources but also plc

494
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,039
based data sources so that's the

495
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:15,520
capability of your

496
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,120
platform to

497
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,520
actively pull

498
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,559
plc's to get configuration information

499
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:24,159
maybe all these things could be

500
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:26,240
correlated in some form or fashion to

501
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,400
tell a bigger story about what's going

502
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,360
on

503
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,320
uh

504
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,320
in these environments so

505
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,880
this will not only improve the analysts

506
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,679
understanding of the activity but it

507
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,640
will also help uh you know make sense of

508
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,000
standard actions that may uh go ignored

509
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,240
or be misunderstood in these

510
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,640
environments without more contacts

511
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,280
and it really defines why a standard

512
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:55,360
action uh may be malicious so

513
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,840
we encourage vendors to

514
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,320
see how you can leverage

515
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,320
a correlation across these data sources

516
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,480
to provide more context to

517
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,000

00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,840
deep into them to understand

521
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,480
uh how these um

um

524
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,039

you know things that may or may not

provide as much context so we think it's

533
