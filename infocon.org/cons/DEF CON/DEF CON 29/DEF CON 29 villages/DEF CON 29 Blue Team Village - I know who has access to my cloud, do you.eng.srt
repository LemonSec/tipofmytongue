1
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:09,920
hi welcome to

2
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,599
my talk i know who has access to my

3
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:12,960
cloud do you

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,040
i'm miguel fleckman i'm an identity

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,400
security engineer with years of

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,160
experience building products

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,160
for identity and pki management at

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,920
microsoft and after a few years i

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,000
decided to leave and co-found ketos

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:24,960
where we do

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,880
we make it easy for companies to become

12
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,840
passwordless with easy-to-use pki

13
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,960
solutions and there's my twitter if you

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,159
have any questions i'll be in the

15
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:32,800
discord

16
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,960
and i'll also be on twitter so feel free

17
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,719
to message me wherever you prefer

18
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,239
and i'll also be in vegas so if you want

19
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:40,160
to swing by and talk to

20
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,719
me in person like let me know and here's

21
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,399
a picture of me outside so it looks

22
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,000
like i do stuff outside and it's not

23
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,840
just coding all day

24
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,840
uh so let's just jump right into it with

25
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,280
a controversial topic

26
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,039
uh why security reviews suck so

27
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:57,039
one of the main things is it's based on

28
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:58,719
what you think your infrastructure looks

29
00:00:58,719 --> 00:00:59,280
like

30
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,640
so it might be you you forgot to close a

31
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,039
port

32
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:04,799
and you know in the review you go and

33
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,159
say like now all my

34
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,640
ports are closed or you might say this

35
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,840
is encrypted and it's not actually

36
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,040
encrypted

37
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,720
and it also doesn't change over years

38
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,400
i've seen teams that have gone

39
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,479
over and over again with the same

40
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:18,159
diagram and did not

41
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,320
update it to the new microservices they

42
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,159
added or they completely changed the

43
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:23,360
platform

44
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,600
and we just kind of like assume that

45
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,439
it's still working

46
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,119
and i've also seen some security

47
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:30,560
professionals that care more about the

48
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,520
actual

49
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,680
diagram than they do from the security i

50
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,000
actually was blocked once

51
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,280
uh until i put a box around my

52
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,200
items to show that everything was

53
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,560
running in azure when it was

54
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,240
logical that everything was running in

55
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,720
azure so

56
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,640
let's talk about how hackers actually

57
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,920
get in and

58
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,280
it's a hacker talk so i had to put a

59
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,000
black guy

60
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,759
a guy in a black hoodie and um

61
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,520
let's talk about the first one that is

62
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,280
adding a member to a group

63
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,560
so this one is pretty easy like once you

64
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,560
get access to a group and you add your

65
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,759
identity to that group

66
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:09,199
it's pretty hard to detect because you

67
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,878
might have like your engineering group

68
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:11,840
that you add

69
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,879
to all your azure resources and you're

70
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,560
not really checking it that often you

71
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,239
don't change engineers that much so like

72
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:19,680
you're not going to be checking the

73
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,760
membership so it's an easy way to get in

74
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:22,959
and when you're checking our back and

75
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,280
everything you're not really gonna check

76
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:25,760
for

77
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,400
the group members another one is adding

78
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,599
an azure

79
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:32,160
classic administrator so azure classic

80
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,599
administrator is something that they

81
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,200
have been trying to get rid of for like

82
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,000
four years now

83
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,280
i think and now they put them into a

84
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,200
different tab so it's harder to add but

85
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,080
it's also

86
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,319
harder to detect if someone adds someone

87
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:45,599
and and you don't

88
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:49,040
notice the third one is adding a service

89
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,640
principle as a contributor to a

90
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,440
subscription

91
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,120
this was as a pentester one of my

92
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,959
favorite ones to do you just add

93
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:55,760
deployer

94
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,360
to the end of the service principle and

95
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,879
no one is going to touch it because no

96
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:01,040
one wants to break deployment so

97
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,959
once you're in you're in forever and you

98
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:04,480
will usually have like high

99
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,680
contributor owner access the next one is

100
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,760
removing a the only sql authentication

101
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,680
that one i haven't really seen but

102
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,239
we're actually forcing everybody to in

103
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:15,280
in my company to

104
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,640
use aad authentication for sql and we

105
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,159
don't want people to revert back into

106
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,200
using sql or

107
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,400
creating their own passwords and

108
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,159
everything so we added that check to

109
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:25,040
make sure that

110
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,159
everything is secure

111
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:29,440
and then another one is adding

112
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,360
permissions to azure

113
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,480
act uh akb policies

114
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,000
so basically you might have good

115
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,599
segregation of duties having

116
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,120
different applications having different

117
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,200
access to certain secrets some might be

118
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,640
able to get them some others

119
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,080
might be able to create them or delete

120
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,680
them but if someone

121
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,760
manages to compromise one of those

122
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,000
accounts and give themselves

123
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,040
access to everything then when you look

124
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:53,519
at the

125
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,200
access policies you still see the same

126
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,040
application so you don't see anything

127
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,879
different but they might have more

128
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,640
access that what they didn't need

129
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,080
and the other the last one i'm going to

130
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,080
talk about is adding ip addresses to the

131
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:04,959
firewall

132
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:07,680
so most companies have hundreds of ip

133
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,560
addresses

134
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,640
either from like your microservices that

135
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,159
talk to your service or you might have

136
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,000
your corporate vpn that has access to

137
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,478
it and adding one extra one either being

138
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:18,320
like a developer being lazy and adding

139
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,600
their home address

140
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,240
or a bad actor adding their address so

141
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,199
they can access

142
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,520
the system is something that can go

143
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,280
unnoticed

144
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,680
so the solution we created cloud watcher

145
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,639
cloud watcher

146
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,960
is a powershell module that runs on

147
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,240
azure automation

148
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,520
it's actually in the azure gallery so

149
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,040
you can just go there and download it i

150
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,040
have instructions at the end of the

151
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,680
slides it scans your subscription and if

152
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,320
it detects

153
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,240
any configuration changes that i just

154
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,360
mentioned

155
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,960
it will fail the script and then you can

156
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,800
send an alert we have it that like it

157
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,280
emails

158
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,400
uh sorry calls our on-call engineer and

159
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,639
let us know and here you have a run

160
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,520
that it shows how it's uh when there is

161
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,360
no changes detected

162
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,199
and here's a run that it tells you that

163
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,560
there were changes detected so we'll

164
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,080
tell you exactly what it found like

165
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,479
resource providers changed and

166
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,120
rbac changes and it will fail the round

167
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,880
book so then you can have like

168
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,720
azure automation like call you or like

169
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,000
send you an email

170
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,800
whatever you want it to do so let's talk

171
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,880
about what we actually cover

172
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,280
so arbex changes any hour exchange

173
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,960
adding removing

174
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,759
changing well it would still be adding

175
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:26,479
or removing

176
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:29,120
our back we'll catch it classic

177
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,080
administration

178
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,520
changes so you don't have to keep

179
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,680
looking for them we'll look for them

180
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,600
azure resources providers so azure

181
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,880
resource provider is something that i

182
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,320
didn't really talk about but that's

183
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:38,880
basically

184
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,440
how azure gives for example key vault

185
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,440
access to your vms to be able to encrypt

186
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,320
their disks

187
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,759
so it's kind of like another way that

188
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,759
you can create your custom providers

189
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:48,000
that

190
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,840
will give you certain access to the

191
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,240
subscription so we we like to keep that

192
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,720
blocked to whatever we are comfortable

193
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,960
with in our baseline

194
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,280
resource creation or deletion we don't

195
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,280
want developers to create kind of like

196
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,800
their own vms or something in the

197
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,800
production subscription that it might

198
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,720
endanger the rest of the subscription or

199
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,240
delete something by mistake that might

200
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,840
be like your availability zone or

201
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,440
something so we want to detect on

202
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,360
any resource creation or um or deletion

203
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,280
we also have the change of group

204
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,880
membership that won't

205
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,400
there's an asterisk because we only

206
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,240
check first degree so if you have nested

207
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,000
groups we don't go through each group

208
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,400
and check

209
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,759
all their groups membership we just

210
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,680
check the membership of the first group

211
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,800
of

212
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,880
of any group that is i called anywhere

213
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,840
in your subscription from our back to

214
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,039
ade or sorry ada admins on sql

215
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:39,039
anything that we can find we'll add that

216
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:41,520
group and check it

217
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,600
sql firewall rule changes so if they add

218
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,680
or remove ips

219
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,680
sql server aad so basically i already

220
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,039
talked about it kind of like

221
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:51,919
if you change the aed only or if you

222
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:53,360
change the ad

223
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,880
administrator azure key volt

224
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,160
access policies changes and firewalls

225
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,599
so now let's talk about the elephant in

226
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,759
the room you i i can see you guys all

227
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:04,880
thinking

228
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,520
all right the guy was just talking about

229
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,280
azure security center so did i just

230
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,240
reinvent the wheel

231
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,039
and the answer is no you can have a

232
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:15,039
security score of 100

233
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,560
and still be vulnerable to these back

234
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,120
doors by for example azure security

235
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,639
center will tell you if like your

236
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,440
management port like port 22 is open

237
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,360
to the world but it won't tell you if

238
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,720
it's still closed but an

239
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,479
extra ip that is not in your corporate

240
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,000
ip address was

241
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,880
added so this one is an addition to

242
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,400
security center it does not replace

243
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,479
security center we use security center

244
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:40,479
and we also use cloud watcher

245
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:43,039
and then for the setup this is a great

246
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:44,000
image of how we actually

247
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,280
have it set up um we have multiple

248
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,400
subscriptions and they're

249
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,560
all talking uh they're all cloud

250
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,759
watching each other

251
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:54,080
and here for to simplify it i'm just

252
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,919
showing one of the cloud watchers

253
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,599
so you have this production subscription

254
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:58,960
that is the one that you want to

255
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,120
protect in this case then you have a

256
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,360
cloud watcher in the same tenant

257
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,199
that has reader access to this

258
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,039
subscription and hopefully this other

259
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:08,560
subscription has different identities

260
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,840
managing it so you don't have the same

261
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,479
admin

262
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:13,360
identities managing both subscriptions

263
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,879
and then you have the baseline we

264
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:17,759
actually have it in another tenant

265
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,479
that cloudwatcher only has read access

266
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:21,599
to pull from the

267
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,599
storage account and get the baseline

268
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:25,120
json and then

269
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,240
we run continuously every few minutes uh

270
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,240
to make sure that everything is still

271
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,080
the same and nothing has changed and if

272
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,519
a change is detected in any of the

273
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:34,799
subscriptions we'll

274
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,919
alert our engineers on it so

275
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,440
now let's talk about what's next what

276
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,719
what are the next things we want to

277
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:41,599
build

278
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,599
so one of the things is create a ui to

279
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,760
visualize your resources as i said

280
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,399
i don't think the security reviews right

281
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,080
now do like the best job on it

282
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,080
um i've never seen a red team go

283
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,080
against a security review and grab the

284
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,680
information from there they usually just

285
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,560
scanned

286
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,399
the actual infrastructure

287
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,880
so we want to create a ui to visualize

288
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,800
those resources and maybe add some

289
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,360
alerts saying like hey like we notice

290
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,680
that you haven't enabled sql aad do you

291
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,360
want to enable that

292
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,600
and or will you notice that you don't

293
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,760
have azure keyboard firewall rules and

294
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,560
just kind of

295
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,120
give you better ideas on how to protect

296
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,320
your

297
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,519
infrastructure add more resources so

298
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:28,800
right now we solely focus on sql and

299
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,720
azure key vault the reason for that is

300
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,320
those are the core for

301
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,640
our company but we want to grow it to

302
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,959
other azure services

303
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,200
and the last one is integrated with

304
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,640
gloomy terraform and

305
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,800
arm templates so basically we want to be

306
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,560
able to compare your baseline

307
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,120
to your infrastructure as code and read

308
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,839
the desired configurations to be able to

309
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,360
secure it from your desired

310
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,519
configuration to your baseline

311
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,200
to your actual infrastructure to make

312
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,399
sure all three match

313
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,560
and then thank you so much if you have

314
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,079
any questions please send them to the

315
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:02,880
discord

316
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,680
or send them on twitter uh here's a

317
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,959
github where you can find

318
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,399
the readme with all the information

319
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,320
about how to install it

320
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,399
and then we have the slides also we

321
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,000
posted them online

322
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,360
and we have a set of video that i

323
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,120
created on my youtube channel to

324
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,120
set you to guide you through all the

325
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,560
things you have to do if you prefer a

326
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,920
video other than

327
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:28,479
a written readme
