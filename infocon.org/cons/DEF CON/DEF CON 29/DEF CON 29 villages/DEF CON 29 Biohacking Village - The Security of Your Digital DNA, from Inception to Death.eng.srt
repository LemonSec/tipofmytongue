1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:02,800
hello it is such a pleasure to be

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,319
presenting for biohacking village at

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:06,640
defcon 29 today my name is gary

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,160
schumacher and i'm the cto and

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,559
co-founder of gene infosec where we are

6
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:12,719
working on technology to protect genetic

7
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:14,799
information i'm also a cyber security

8
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:16,400
engineer at valencia where we build

9
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,359
design test and secure medical devices

10
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:21,199
but today i'm here for one thing only

11
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:22,960
and that is to discuss the security of

12
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,640
your digital dna from inception to death

13
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,680
i'm going to begin with some quick

14
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,439
background information on what genetic

15
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:31,359
information and dna are

16
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:33,520
and how we use them for good and maybe

17
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,800
bad purposes

18
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,160
we're going to continue that discussion

19
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,160
by with a tour of the processes and

20
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,320
technologies required in order to

21
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,440
convert your dna into digital data as

22
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,120
well as discuss the threat surface along

23
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,160
the way

24
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,360
we'll conclude with some high-level

25
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,640
summaries for moving forward

26
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,079
so for those of you that slept through

27
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:53,520
biology class

28
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,640
dna is found in the nuclei of your cells

29
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,120
the nucleus is kind of like the brain of

30
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,960
the cell tells the cell how it's going

31
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,960
to be made how it's going to behave what

32
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,879
its functions are

33
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:07,360
your genome is made up of all the dna

34
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,280
found in your cells

35
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,200
it's about 7 billion ac's t's and g's in

36
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,159
length

37
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,240
your genetic code is converted into

38
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,560
digital data through a process called

39
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,759
dna sequencing

40
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,479
dna is present in nearly every life form

41
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,560
we generate genetic information

42
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,880
from humans from medical research from

43
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,400
plants and animals for agricultural

44
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,640
research and more and for microbes to

45
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,360
study disease

46
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
and genetic data is becoming incredibly

47
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,479
inexpensive to produce the cheaper it is

48
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,560
to produce this data the more of it will

49
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,479
produce and the more of it will use

50
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,720
currently in the us sequencing a human

51
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,799
genome cost right about a thousand

52
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:50,560
dollars i'm blocking that part of the

53
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,159
graph but currently today it's right

54
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,560
around a thousand dollars

55
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,880
however if you send your dna to china it

56
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,960
will only cost you one hundred dollars

57
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,439
to sequence your full genome

58
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,158
what a steal

59
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,719
human genetic data is providing us with

60
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,280
great benefits but each benefit brings

61
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,680
the potential for misuse

62
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,840
so consider ancestry research

63
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,280
it has brought us a better understanding

64
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,560
of our history

65
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,800
but it can also be used to identify

66
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,440
somebody from just their dna

67
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,440
and that dna can then be used by your

68
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,840
doctor to not only find out which

69
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,239
diseases you might be susceptible to but

70
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,879
also to potentially prescribe dna

71
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,640
specific treatments

72
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,720
however your genetic vulnerabilities

73
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,879
could likewise be used to cause you

74
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:39,120
illness or worse

75
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,640
furthermore we have to consider the

76
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,319
future biotechnology is rapidly advanced

77
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,000
advancing and offering us really cool

78
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,840
things like mrna vaccines designer

79
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,519
organisms but this same technology can

80
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,200
be applied to create bioweapons

81
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,760
so how easy is it to identify you based

82
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,920
upon your dna

83
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,800
well

84
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,040
just by having a relative in a public

85
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,599
database this can greatly narrow down

86
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,519
the potential sources of a dna sample

87
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,440
through genealogy

88
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,440
which is how mr d'angelo here was

89
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,800
finally id'd as the golden state killer

90
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,280
this solved a cold case that was it was

91
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,200
cold for over 30 years following his

92
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,159
final crime spree

93
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,879
and your face can already be

94
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,280
reconstructed from your dna alone using

95
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,120
artificial intelligence

96
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,360
these reconstructions are not yet great

97
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,280
but if you were to add a large database

98
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,120
of faces say if someone were able to get

99
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,720
their hands on a driver's license

100
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,400
database or similar

101
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,040
well now dna can be used to accurately

102
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,440
reconstruct uh sorry to actually

103
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,799
identify you

104
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,400
by coupling the dna data with the faces

105
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,159
as biotechnology improves

106
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,159
identifiability of dna will become

107
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:55,439
increasingly accurate

108
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,400
everyone has different needs for privacy

109
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,080
so this may have serious implications

110
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,239
for some more so than others for

111
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:03,680
instance just consider the case of

112
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,640
undercover operatives

113
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,599
john sotos gave a really great talk at

114
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,200
defcon 25

115
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,879
at the time he was the chief medical

116
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,360
officer of intel he went over many ways

117
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,079
in which families ethnicities and even

118
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,079
individuals could be targeted and

119
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,320
exploited through bioweapons

120
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,600
so if you don't plan on sleeping for a

121
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,960
few nights and you want to learn a bit a

122
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,720
little bit more about how bio weapons

123
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,720
could potentially be used against you or

124
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,639
your loved ones please watch us talk

125
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,720
google's deep mind group has open

126
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,960
sourced their ai based protein folding

127
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,759
prediction tool called alpha fold

128
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,440
this tool makes accurate protein

129
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,440
structure predictions based only on the

130
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,120
dna sequence

131
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,360
obviously this will of course lead to

132
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,280
amazing advancements

133
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,199
but can it also be used to design bio

134
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:52,320
weapons

135
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,000
the terrorists of the future may not

136
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,479
need to have any biological expertise as

137
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,720
we seem to be automating these processes

138
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,199
for them

139
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,479
and if the kobit 19 global pandemic has

140
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:06,639
been a difficult time then imagine what

141
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,479
our world would look like in the case of

142
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,759
a true bioterrorism or biowarfare event

143
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,080
cobit has given us just a taste of what

144
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,240
biowarfare could be like and has

145
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,080
potentially already inspired bad actors

146
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,880
to pursue bioweapons development after

147
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,759
seeing its global effects

148
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,080
if your dna is insecure you could find

149
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,680
yourselves on the front line of a bio

150
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,120
attack in the future

151
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,360
your dna is yours for life

152
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,840
and the threats we face today will pell

153
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,600
in comparison to these sci-fi like

154
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,360
threats that we could potentially face

155
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,120
in the future

156
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,720
so genetic information it's very

157
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,560
sensitive we've gone over many reasons

158
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,600
for that

159
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,600
so you would assume then maybe it should

160
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,880
always receive the highest levels of

161
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,600
protection then right

162
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,919
not always here's just one example of

163
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:53,440
thousands of genetic records being

164
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,520
exposed on public servers

165
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,280
there are many other breach and exposure

166
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,280
examples that have been disclosed either

167
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,680
affecting genetic information or maybe

168
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,840
not genetic information but definitely

169
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,720
companies that handle it

170
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,479
so how many breaches are yet to even be

171
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:09,840
discovered

172
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,160
as with most enterprises and industries

173
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,080
we do not know the true exposure of our

174
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,440
most sensitive information

175
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,479
genetic data is not tightly regulated in

176
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:21,840
the u.s

177
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,479
for instance the only time that hipaa

178
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,039
actually protects your dna is when a

179
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:29,440
diagnostic test is performed in the

180
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,680
clinic or by a clinician

181
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,600
it is not protected when you send your

182
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,600
dna off for research or recreational

183
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,960
purposes

184
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,800
nevertheless genetic data breaches can

185
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,280
have legal consequences for consequences

186
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,440
for organizations that mishandle this

187
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,759
data

188
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,199
the point of inception for genetic data

189
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,880
is in the laboratory

190
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,360
so genetic information security has to

191
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,800
begin there

192
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,880
but just how secure are these labs and

193
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,680
these environments

194
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,080
in 2019 we began investigating that

195
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,840
question by partnering with faculty and

196
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,599
students from the university of colorado

197
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:07,759
boulder to assess the cyber security of

198
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,840
labs and their infrastructure

199
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,919
specifically around genetic information

200
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:14,400
and dna sequencers

201
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,000
a really quick thank you to the numerous

202
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
people that donated time resources

203
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,960
thought

204
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,360
from gene infosec cu boulder volentium

205
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,319
and vto labs on this work especially to

206
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,880
my three students corey arya and ashish

207
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,520
pictured here

208
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,360
we started our research by first

209
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,639
reaching out to anyone that was

210
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,599
generating processing using regulating

211
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:37,520
genetic information

212
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,520
we interviewed professionals of various

213
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,199
departments and roles at these

214
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,560
organizations

215
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,560
but they all had one thing in common

216
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,639
they handled genetic information that

217
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,960
they themselves viewed as sensitive for

218
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,520
various reasons whether that be privacy

219
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,479
for monetary value for intellectual

220
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:58,800
property for regulatory reasons

221
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,560
most of these groups had a wet lab that

222
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,879
sequenced dna and we toured as many of

223
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,120
the facilities as we could we assessed

224
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,960
the labs and their equipment but many of

225
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,720
the clients were hesitant due to

226
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,879
specific concerns with contracts of

227
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:13,120
certain vendors of certain lab equipment

228
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,440
we'll come back to that

229
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,120
others though allowed us to dig deeper

230
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,280
into their systems and devices and we

231
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,120
even purchased a few sequencers to fully

232
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,120
disassemble and really dig in

233
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,039
so we've been in contact with with these

234
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:26,960
vendors to report our findings and

235
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,360
upgrades have been made to some to

236
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,039
mitigate some of the issues that we are

237
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:33,679
reporting today

238
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,519
so following this work we published a

239
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,440
paper in frontiers in bioengineering and

240
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,000
biotechnology it reviewed the threat

241
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,839
surface from literature but also from

242
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:43,679
our own findings and observations and

243
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,760
from the uh interviews that we had with

244
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,000
these with these people

245
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,279
i'll discuss what we published in that

246
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,800
paper and i'm also going to share some

247
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,160
new stuff with you today

248
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,720
to begin in the paper we provide a basic

249
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,720
data flow diagram and this describes the

250
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,040
process of generating and processing and

251
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,680
applying genetic information

252
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,360
instead of boring you with that diagram

253
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,040
i'm going to walk you through every step

254
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,399
of the process and we're going to

255
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:12,480
discuss that threat surface at each step

256
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,839
so first samples must be collected

257
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,240
in humans we really just need any cell

258
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,320
that contains dna

259
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,560
commonly we get that from blood saliva

260
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,880
tissue or even hair

261
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,240
most commonly you're probably most

262
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,000
familiar with saliva from direct to

263
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,720
consumer test

264
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,519
but fraud exists so be careful who you

265
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,600
send your dna to there are several

266
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,160
examples of dna samples being collected

267
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,920
never being accounted for and groups

268
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,279
being billed for services that were

269
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,080
never performed

270
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,399
another exploit already possible at this

271
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:49,360
early stage is was displayed by some

272
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,040
academic researchers

273
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,120
they were able to encode malware in

274
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,279
synthetic dna itself

275
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,760
so that when the dna was sequenced the

276
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,839
malware would reside in the resulting

277
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:01,279
data file

278
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,279
the researchers also then modified a

279
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:06,560
common analytical software tool so that

280
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,160
when the software tool analyzed the

281
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,399
sequence data containing the malware the

282
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:13,120
hosting computer would be remotely owned

283
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,279
through a reverse shell

284
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,120
now this may seem like a very academic

285
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,839
or difficult or unlikely exploit

286
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,240
but remember likelihood can never be

287
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,720
considered when malicious intent is

288
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,760
involved

289
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,240
and as we'll see later software tools

290
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,440
used in biology are easily tampered with

291
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,000
exploits such as this do present serious

292
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,680
concerns for synthetic biology

293
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,040
collected samples must then be

294
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,600
transported to labs and stored for use

295
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,880
usually this involves reduced

296
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,880
temperatures and controlled humidity and

297
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,560
gas levels

298
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,079
the research grade refrigerators that

299
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:52,640
i'm showing in the lower right have iot

300
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,360
sensors for monitoring sample storage

301
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:00,040
iot is everywhere in these environments

302
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,399
from the moment samples are collected

303
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,320
and delivered to a lab they're being

304
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,640
tracked using limbs or laboratory

305
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,200
information management systems

306
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,279
limbs which are generally depicted by

307
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:14,000
this crazy diagram here are integrated

308
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
into almost every step of the sequencing

309
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,720
process including sample tracking lab

310
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,480
and chemical processes the quality

311
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,880
insurance and quality control processes

312
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,800
in the lab all the way up to the human

313
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,560
resources and financial systems of these

314
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,560
institutions and even electronic health

315
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,120
care records in the clinical setting and

316
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,720
of course throughout all of the data

317
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,160
analysis

318
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,640
limbs touch it all please remember that

319
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:41,680
one such tool called dna limbs was

320
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,680
tested by shore break security and found

321
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,279
to have seven vulnerabilities in their

322
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,720
web app that are now tracked as cves

323
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,920
the vendor was notified in early 2017.

324
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,200
maybe you can see where i'm going with

325
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,360
this

326
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,519
of course over two years later these

327
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:59,519
vulnerabilities remain unpatched when a

328
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,440
story broke out of iranian hackers

329
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,279
exploiting this issue to compromise the

330
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,040
web app and its connected systems and

331
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,360
data

332
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,320
bad patching practices are very common

333
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,120
in these environments

334
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,240
now that samples are on site and a lab a

335
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,160
series of chemical processes must be

336
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,720
applied to samples to extract and purify

337
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,040
their dna prior to sequencing

338
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,880
we call these wet labs because they use

339
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,160
a lot of liquids versus dry labs that

340
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,760
have that are much more on the

341
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,720
computational analysis side

342
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,560
these labs depending on whether they are

343
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,120
academic or industrial have a lot of

344
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,560
people moving in and out of them

345
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,399
constantly

346
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,399
in our work we seem to always find

347
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,720
shared accounts between personnel

348
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,200
posted credentials near devices and

349
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,720
little to no bring your own device

350
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,480
policies or enforcement

351
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,240
there was severely limited physical

352
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,399
security in terms of authorized and

353
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,880
authenticated access video surveillance

354
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,279
weak locks there was pretty much uh

355
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,320
rarely anything to deter detect prevent

356
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,160
unauthorized access

357
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,600
and when and when they were implemented

358
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,120
it was very weak implementations

359
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,680
labs are also filled with the latest and

360
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,800
greatest tech

361
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,320
some of this is required for lab

362
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,959
operations so take the lo the robot on

363
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:19,440
the left there for example it automates

364
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,200
much of these processes instead of

365
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,120
pipetting a bunch it'll do it all for

366
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:23,920
you

367
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,000
devices like the these are even included

368
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,160
in the biohacking village device lab

369
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,680
which i applaud thermo fisher for

370
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,000
including a lab device in there so be

371
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,560
sure to check those out but a lot of the

372
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,040
devices in this industry are are old not

373
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,279
regularly updated and almost all of it

374
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:42,480
is connected to the internet

375
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,800
some of these latest and greatest

376
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,720
devices you will find however are

377
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,560
completely unnecessary

378
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,320
and they introduce some serious security

379
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,240
issues into the ecosystem

380
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,320
so for example this wonderful roomba

381
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,320
it's just wandering around many labs

382
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,440
that we saw

383
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,680
building a map of the facility using its

384
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,880
uh you know built-in camera mic wi-fi

385
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,399
bluetooth

386
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,880
for the sake of convenience security is

387
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,560
often overlooked in these environments

388
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,360
dna sequencers are a heart of genetics

389
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,320
labs

390
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,760
they are produced by a variety of

391
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,920
manufacturers and use many different

392
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,720
technologies to generate genetic data

393
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,079
some of the most common vendors and

394
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:23,519
platforms i have included here

395
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:26,079
especially in north america and europe

396
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:27,360
and they all have different

397
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,560
considerations for secure use sequencers

398
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,240
all run a different variety of operating

399
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,120
system

400
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,440
for example many of them run

401
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,040
can be introduced into a system that

402
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,160
runs windows linux or mac or they ship

403
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,720
with one of those distributions already

404
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,480
in them

405
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,320
there are even sequencers being built in

406
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,560
use with mobile phones so that

407
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,240
everything is becoming small and

408
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,079
accessible

409
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:53,519
sequencers may have external

410
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,440
workstations or internal computers to

411
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,279
control hardware and store and process

412
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,360
data and they are obviously incorporated

413
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,600
into many different networks

414
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,959
they all have connected cloud

415
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:05,040
infrastructure and

416
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,639
these devices are constantly connected

417
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,800
to the internet for operation for data

418
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,279
analysis for data storage and sharing

419
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,360
and even for device monitoring and only

420
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,199
some purposes

421
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,639
you can see our paper for more details

422
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:18,079
on these sequencing technologies and

423
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:20,079
products

424
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:22,399
but regardless of the product regardless

425
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:24,480
of the implementation there are certain

426
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,639
responsibilities that fall on the vendor

427
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,720
and certain responsibilities that fall

428
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,800
on the labs

429
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,639
these relationships are dictated through

430
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,560
service contracts very strict service

431
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,880
contracts which we will come back to

432
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,639
in general with these devices we find

433
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,720
security by implementation and not

434
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,199
security by design leading to a constant

435
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,120
cat and mouse game pinning these labs

436
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,440
against experienced threat actors

437
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,959
and even when we say security by

438
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:53,959
implementation it often was not done

439
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,079
when we dug into these systems we found

440
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:57,440
that they are not always configured or

441
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,639
maintained well

442
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:00,639
as late as last year there were

443
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,959
operational sequencers running windows 7

444
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:05,440
windows vista windows xp

445
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,519
and common security features that are

446
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:08,959
available in the products shipped with

447
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,519
the products were disabled

448
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,800
now we are under the impression that

449
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,160
these products have been upgraded to

450
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,040
windows 10 as of late last year

451
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,959
but at the end of the day

452
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:21,759
sequencers run a lot of third-party and

453
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:24,639
proprietary software so labs have to be

454
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:26,639
aware of all software operating within

455
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:29,199
their systems and of course vendors must

456
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:32,240
harden these products

457
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,320
the external workstations and data

458
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,160
stores of these devices can even leak

459
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,040
information for example the above grade

460
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,880
workstation on the left has removable

461
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,360
one terabyte hard drives

462
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,360
in that red box

463
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,320
so

464
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,160
just a friendly recommendation before

465
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,560
you ever sell a sequencer be sure to

466
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,480
actually wipe the data from it not just

467
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,639
move it to the trash bin not just delete

468
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:57,199
it once because you never know who might

469
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:59,199
purchase that sequencer later

470
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:00,959
luckily this time it was the good guys

471
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:02,720
but you never know

472
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,359
almost every sequencer we examined also

473
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:08,480
had external usb ports ethernet ports

474
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,079
many other

475
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,679
ports in

476
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,439
access capabilities that were largely

477
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:16,240
unrestricted physically or by software

478
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,559
we often found wireless keyboards mice

479
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:21,839
and wi-fi dongles being used as well

480
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,839
external power supplies and backups are

481
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:26,720
even common in case of power failure

482
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,799
shown by the black blocks in the left

483
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,840
image to the right of the gray

484
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,400
workstation

485
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,840
these products are also networked for

486
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,559
monitoring purposes and every power

487
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:38,960
supply that we found used in a lab with

488
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,720
a dna sequencer

489
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,440
was found to have disclosed cves

490
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,600
affecting their firmware and the

491
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,480
software residing on the host computer

492
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,320
this could obviously greatly impact the

493
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:54,240
availability of sequencing systems

494
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,160
physically disassembling these products

495
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,080
also proved useful in entangling how

496
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,280
they operate

497
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,799
programming and debugging interfaces

498
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:03,520
were plentiful and largely unrestricted

499
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,600
there were many pins and pads that were

500
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,679
available and and everything was so well

501
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,000
nicely labeled that i would have been

502
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,480
able to easily solder to them

503
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,760
provide the right amount the right power

504
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,679
play around figure out the pin out but

505
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,840
instead i decided to forget forgo that

506
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,160
because every single board in one of

507
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,200
these sequencers that we uh analyzed had

508
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,120
perfect little ports that fit my j-link

509
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:31,280
debugger default cable perfectly

510
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,720
even in one of these devices we found a

511
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,400
usb stick internal to one of the

512
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,240
machines and it wasn't hard for us to

513
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,000
figure out where it had been where it

514
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,160
had been what had been used for or who

515
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,240
had used it

516
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,960
we also the actual components processors

517
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,480
external flash

518
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,240
other internal components

519
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,080
they were so well labeled that we could

520
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,160
uh just read off of them the

521
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,880
the vendor the product name the firmware

522
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,640
version the firmware name

523
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,200
finding datasheets was was so easy

524
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,720
so for now i'll just summarize all of

525
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,799
this by saying that standards and best

526
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:04,720
practices are not always complied with

527
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,120
in these environments especially for

528
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:10,760
secure device development

529
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,840
flow cells are a necessary consumable

530
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,320
used in dna sequencers these are special

531
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,559
glass slides such as the ones shown on

532
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:20,160
the right image

533
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,240
and this is where dna molecules actually

534
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,960
sit in within the dna sequencer itself

535
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,400
so there's little special attachment

536
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,200
points on the glass dna sticks to them

537
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,679
so following a sequencing run dna

538
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:34,320
remains on those flow cells

539
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,480
we saw used flow cells everywhere in

540
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,559
labs they were on tables they were in

541
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,559
drawers they were everywhere and we were

542
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,160
even given a few as

543
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,320
fun souvenirs

544
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,799
so we wondered

545
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:48,720
could dna be recovered from these flow

546
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,160
cells and if so

547
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,600
then could dna be re-sequenced to then

548
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,160
leak that information

549
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,240
turns out it's far more simple than we

550
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,520
even dreamed of

551
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,880
just simply rinse the flow cells with

552
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,960
water and re-sequence the molecules

553
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,000
that's it

554
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,520
it's probably not the easiest way to

555
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,600
steal genetic information but that might

556
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,440
just depend on how badly someone wants

557
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,919
your data

558
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,080
of course it would be far easier to just

559
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,720
hack the system and target electronic

560
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,120
components in downstream data stores

561
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,600
where data is amassed

562
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,280
there are various ways that data is

563
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,520
stored following sequencing including

564
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,919
external hard drives computers and local

565
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:29,440
servers depending on operational

566
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,840
constraints we always saw a computer it

567
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,520
was a part of the actual sequencer

568
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,159
itself either internal or external plus

569
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:37,840
we always saw one other local method of

570
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,360
storage whether that be the hard drive

571
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,360
or the server

572
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,480
however we also always saw cloud storage

573
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,559
it's being used

574
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,080
more and more because of the large

575
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,240
amounts of data that these these

576
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,039
sequencers produce

577
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:55,760
every organization we we assessed used a

578
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,480
cloud platform provided by their dna

579
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,039
sequencing vendor and usually that lab

580
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:03,039
also implemented independent cloud

581
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:05,120
platforms of their own for further

582
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:08,000
storage and for other analyses

583
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,919
the cloud implementations we looked at

584
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:12,720
rarely had just simple things like

585
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,600
user authentication or deferring user

586
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,600
authentication role-based access

587
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,360
different accounts for every user

588
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,360
multi-factor authentication

589
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,799
along with many other controls and

590
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:24,640
configurations that were either not

591
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,440
enabled or misconfigured

592
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,440
these cloud platforms also

593
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,120
especially when dna sequencing vendors

594
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,480
provide them

595
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,880
host their own laboratory information

596
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,880
management systems which we looked at

597
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,679
everywhere saw how they touch everything

598
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:41,440
also these four these are for the

599
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,840
primary vendors of dna sequencing

600
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,240
technology they each provide their own

601
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,679
cloud platform

602
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:50,720
all running uh aws as the underlying

603
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,880
cloud infrastructure so we'll get to a

604
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,679
chain of custody concerns here in a bit

605
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:57,600
when dna sequencers are communicating

606
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,400
with

607
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,240
internet connected infrastructure like

608
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,039
the cloud we found outdated and insecure

609
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:05,679
protocols in place for example we found

610
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:09,039
tls version 1.1 being used by sequencers

611
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:11,679
still in late 2020

612
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:13,520
late 2020

613
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,840
while uh a while after being notified of

614
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,679
that and other issues the vendor has

615
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:19,600
since upgraded their stack

616
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,919
but in general we found week week

617
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:23,840
cryptography and use

618
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,360
low and medium strength keys of

619
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,799
insufficient size

620
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:28,559
flawed number generators and cipher

621
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:30,640
suites with known vulnerabilities and

622
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,159
these were used for critical things like

623
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,240
authentication encryption

624
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,480
pki

625
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,000
we also found labs that implemented

626
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,760
their own internal stacks for

627
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,400
transmitting data to local servers

628
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,200
server message block protocol version 2

629
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,159
was using was being used by a few labs

630
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:50,320
to transmit data to their local server

631
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,080
in plain text

632
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,039
so that anyone on the network could with

633
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:56,640
some

634
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,640
with a little bit of know-how could

635
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,039
sniff that data quite trivially and the

636
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:03,360
way that i got on the network was asking

637
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,600
people walking by hey i really need to

638
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,120
check my email can you can you give me

639
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,720
your wi-fi credentials

640
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,640
easy as that

641
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,240
file transfer protocol ftp not ftps was

642
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,559
also found in use

643
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,640
furthermore wi-fi capabilities for some

644
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,640
reason ship with these products even

645
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,360
though we have yet to see a single lab

646
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,240
use wi-fi for a dna sequencer they

647
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,799
produce so much data that and there's

648
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:30,320
there's a bandwidth requirement and

649
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,080
these systems are so sensitive and

650
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,679
important to the operations of labs that

651
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:36,400
they

652
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,799
we always saw them using a directly

653
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:41,600
wired ethernet connection

654
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,520
at the end of the day labs need to be

655
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,360
aware of the protocols necessary to keep

656
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,120
their data secure in motion and in

657
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,240
transit and much more and vendors must

658
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,840
design products so that labs are

659
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,919
actually able to securely implement and

660
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:56,480
operate them

661
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,799
once data is produced it must then be

662
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:00,000
processed

663
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,400
so raw sequencing data can range in the

664
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,760
gigabyte to terabyte size

665
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,760
it's from just from just sorry from just

666
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,760
a single sequencing run

667
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,760
so all of that data must undergo a lot

668
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,320
of quality control and a lot of analyses

669
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,640
for that useful information to be teased

670
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,679
out

671
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:20,159
bioinformatic pipelines are a series of

672
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:23,360
software tools that we use just for that

673
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,279
and also due to the large amount of data

674
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:27,520
they must process we're seeing more and

675
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,600
more of this go to the cloud as well as

676
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,480
be implemented within a dna sequencer so

677
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,799
that some initial processing is done on

678
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:36,559
on the sequencer and then everything

679
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,559
else is shipped off to the cloud as it's

680
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:42,320
generated and processed further there

681
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:46,080
so one such example of just the rampant

682
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,159
security issues with bioinformatics

683
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:51,520
software is the bureau wheeler aligner

684
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,600
sandia lab researchers uncovered a

685
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,679
buffer overflow vulnerability that could

686
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:57,279
lead to a man-to-middle attack

687
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:59,360
potentially exposing sensitive genomic

688
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,840
information or even tampering with that

689
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:06,000
information while it's being processed

690
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:08,480
every bioinformatic pipeline requires

691
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,640
several categories of tools for many

692
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,000
different functions which you can see on

693
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,200
that first left column

694
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,880
and several tools exist through each of

695
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,640
these categories

696
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,559
each by each pipeline is different

697
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:22,000
because they'll use different tools and

698
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,240
it all depends on the use case so a

699
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,320
research group examined these tools for

700
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,559
security and code quality and lo and

701
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:30,159
behold they found they are not very

702
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:32,320
secure this should not be a surprise

703
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,640
when you actually step back and consider

704
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,799
that all most of the software is

705
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:39,200
produced by academics hosted on public

706
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,440
repos with very little oversight and

707
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,360
security is not yet a primary concern

708
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,399
for these developers

709
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,120
almost every tool was found to use

710
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,279
functions that are known to be insecure

711
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:52,960
and lead to potential buffer overflows

712
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,480
and they all contain static buffers

713
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,400
so here's some actual snippets of code

714
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,840
we see strlin strcap and mem copy all

715
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,440
used without proper validation and

716
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,440
bounce checking which these are just

717
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,960
known to be insecure functions in the

718
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,960
first place they were not implemented

719
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,400
securely and they are um

720
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,400
and like memcop is a known insecure

721
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,840
intrinsic that should be avoided

722
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,360
once processed genetic data often ends

723
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,760
up being amassed in large databases

724
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,840
the access to these data stores data

725
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:29,039
stores can range from open to semi-open

726
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:31,200
to closed and some are much more

727
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,120
security-minded than others

728
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,520
so quick question do you actually know

729
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,159
where your genetic data is

730
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:39,919
oftentimes it can be very difficult to

731
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:41,120
find out

732
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,799
so with all of the parties we have seen

733
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:45,279
so far involved in these ecosystems this

734
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:47,200
does present real chain of custody

735
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,440
concerns because once a dna sample is

736
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,000
shared a large number of third parties

737
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,240
are involved in handling that material

738
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,279
or data

739
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:57,520
and we as consumers or patients have

740
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,200
very little control over where that

741
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,279
information goes

742
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:03,760
genetic data needs to be protected from

743
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,320
the ins from its inception throughout

744
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,880
your entire life perhaps even after your

745
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,679
death

746
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:11,760
to protect future generations that share

747
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,760
your dna

748
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,320
the genetics and genomics industries can

749
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,559
still create breakthrough advancements

750
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:20,799
without sorry while protecting these

751
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:23,039
sensitive information systems

752
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:25,200
we can we can better prepare for the

753
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,520
current and future threat landscape

754
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,600
and uh here's a few overarching

755
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,799
solutions for how this might be

756
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:32,880
accomplished

757
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,360
so really it falls on uh it's a shared

758
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,720
responsibility

759
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,440
but labs have to do everything they can

760
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,000
to first not not chase a bunch of

761
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,240
technical controls or technologies but

762
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,159
to start with the basics

763
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:47,440
you have to

764
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,360
give your personnel awareness and

765
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:52,159
training so that fishing links and and

766
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:54,320
other low-hanging fruit items can be

767
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,760
avoided

768
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,360
you have to

769
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,440
have the appropriate processes and

770
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,760
policies in place but appropriate

771
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,080
policies will actually enable a culture

772
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,159
of security and security can be a

773
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:08,159
process improvement tool if implemented

774
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:09,760
correctly

775
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,480
and then again before technical controls

776
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,840
can be applied

777
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,520
these groups really need to

778
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,000
sit down and consider their liabilities

779
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,840
consider their risk

780
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,279
understand their threat surface threat

781
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:22,720
model

782
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,240
and now that we've done that then then

783
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,440
you can start adding security

784
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,640
strategically throughout your

785
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,000
organization

786
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,520
this will be difficult to do it might be

787
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,279
scary for biologists who lack this

788
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:33,039
expertise there are security

789
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:34,799
professionals out there who want to help

790
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:36,720
you

791
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,120
of course this is not solely fallen labs

792
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,720
vendors and developers

793
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,720
have to adhere to best practices this

794
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,360
will not only uh protect their ip but it

795
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,360
will protect their clients ip allow

796
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,520
their clients to securely generate and

797
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,360
handle their their own data add

798
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,799
marketing opportunities to their

799
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:54,799
products and of course enable

800
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:57,279
drastically needed biosecurity and this

801
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:58,799
starts with just adding security to the

802
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:01,039
entire development life cycle of every

803
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:03,440
product from the when you're first

804
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,120
thinking about user needs

805
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,559
all the way through when that device

806
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:08,320
becomes decommissioned through its end

807
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,200
of life

808
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,799
uh you know that's that that means

809
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:12,960
regular testing early and throughout

810
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,559
that means threat modeling before

811
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:16,960
anything is ever built or compiled

812
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,440
that means looking at best practices and

813
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,520
conventions and standards and following

814
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:24,159
them and using methods to ensure that

815
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:25,520
you are

816
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,960
now many of the speakers of this year's

817
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,559
biohacking village will discuss these

818
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,720
technical concepts in much much more

819
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,440
detail than i

820
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,880
and of course in order to drive all of

821
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,279
this industry wide regulations will be

822
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:39,840
critical the medical device industry is

823
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,520
miles ahead it's not perfect but it's

824
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,600
miles ahead of most other similar

825
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,840
industries in terms of product security

826
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,559
and this is because the fda now mandates

827
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:50,320
that every product that goes through a

828
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,640
submission process has artifacts and

829
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,360
documentation and analyses done in order

830
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,760
to ensure that that product can be used

831
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,080
safely and effectively with patients and

832
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,600
in hospitals

833
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,120
we similarly need to require the

834
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,760
protection of diagnostic data and also

835
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,159
the entire ecosystem that processes that

836
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:10,399
information

837
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:11,679
so with all these challenges and

838
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:13,919
potential solutions we believe that the

839
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:15,600
clearest solution is to apply

840
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,080
cryptography directly to dna molecules

841
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,080
so that information can be protected

842
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,320
before it ever touches a dna sequence or

843
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,760
computer but you'll have to wait till

844
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,679
our next talk to learn more so thank you

845
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:27,279
to defcon thank you to biohacking

846
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:29,120
village please reach out to us if you

847
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,960
have any questions or concerns and i

848
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,039
hope you all enjoyed this and learned a

849
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:34,640
bit about how genetic information is

850
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,960
used the good the bad the ugly

851
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,559
so i leave you with this

852
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:41,039
as consumers and patients as users

853
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:43,520
awareness will be the biggest key you

854
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,000
must research and can seriously consider

855
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,799
the risk first versus the benefit before

856
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:50,640
sharing your genetic data with anyone

857
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,640
and you have to look at everyone that

858
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,679
touches it as much as possible

859
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:57,440
as hackers as technologists as

860
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,519
biologists we all must play our part

861
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:01,840
improving these systems so that we can

862
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,600
cure diseases so that we can improve

863
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,880
life without compromising on safety

864
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,120
health or privacy

865
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,039
we all have a shared responsibility to

866
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:13,760
protect genetic information today and in

867
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,799
the future

868
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:18,679
thank you stay safe
