1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,600
hi and welcome to our biohacking village

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,279
panel um my name is mike murray i'm the

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:06,560
founder and ceo of a company called

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,800
scope security but more importantly um i

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,240
wanted to pull this panel together

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,080
because i'm really excited to hear the

7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,000
conversation that we have with all the

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,840
folks on the on the call and anybody

9
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,520
who's dealt with medical device security

10
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,039
over the last few years

11
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:23,760
has probably heard the varying opinions

12
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,599
that come from

13
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:28,400
uh alternate alternately the regulators

14
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,359
the medical device manufacturers and the

15
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:33,440
people who have to live with the

16
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,120
regulation and the medical devices the

17
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,640
hospitals themselves

18
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,000
and so i thought it would be really

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,920
great to put a panel together where we

20
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,000
could have folks from the fda

21
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,840
folks from the medical device

22
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,680
manufacturers who have to build medical

23
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,079
devices according to fda regulations and

24
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,000
folks from the hospital who have to take

25
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,079
the security patches and

26
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,320
um and apply them to the devices and

27
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,239
really get to the bottom of it you know

28
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:58,079
the fda has been long on record as

29
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,480
saying security patches don't require

30
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,879
fda approval and if you talk to the

31
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,959
device manufacturers they have a very

32
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,640
different story and if you talk to the

33
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,360
hospitals they hear both the fda and the

34
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,960
device manufacturers telling them

35
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,360
different things and they have to live

36
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,000
in this ambiguity and frankly live with

37
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,640
a risk that is hard to manage so we want

38
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,479
to get to the bottom of this so today we

39
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,560
have literally all three groups on the

40
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,000
phone and i'm not going to introduce the

41
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,520
illustrious panelists i'm going to let

42
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,439
each of them introduce themselves but

43
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:28,880
maybe we can start with the folks from

44
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,360
the fda afton did you want to start by

45
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,119
introducing yourself

46
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:34,880
thanks mike and thanks for giving us an

47
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,920
opportunity to participate in the panel

48
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,880
my name is afton ross and i'm a senior

49
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,119
special advisor for emerging initiatives

50
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:46,479
and fda's cdrh i'm had the opportunity

51
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:49,520
to work on quite a few cyber security

52
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,439
policy and collaborative initiatives

53
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,439
over the last few years so very happy to

54
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:56,399
be on the piano today

55
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,880
matthew

56
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,520
hi everyone i'm matt hazlett i'm the

57
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,840
cyber security policy analyst within the

58
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,000
office of product evaluation and quality

59
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,720
within cdrh so i work on cyber security

60
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,878
policy development and implementation

61
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:14,560
across the various review offices

62
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,680
and our medical device manufacturer

63
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,200
expert

64
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,440
i am tara larson i've been in medical

65
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,760
device security for going on 15 plus

66
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,680
years now so i i feel like i'm

67
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,120
well-versed enough to talk about this

68
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,800
challenge and how it impacts both sides

69
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,640
of the fence

70
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,879
and now from the hdo side of the world

71
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,800
and actually eric you're you you've

72
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,040
straddled both you've actually led some

73
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,800
regulatory style initiatives and worked

74
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,800
on some projects there and you're a cso

75
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,800
at a major health system so maybe you

76
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,680
want to start out sure so

77
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,599
uh i'll start off with the day job you

78
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,040
know the thing that

79
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,680
gives me bread for my butter

80
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,920
uh that would be on the ciso for

81
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,599
intermountain healthcare which is an

82
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,920
integrated delivery network uh located

83
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,480
in the mountain states so primarily in

84
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,879
utah salt lake city that's the home base

85
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,280
but surrounding areas in nevada idaho

86
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,720
and others

87
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,640
um my uh my pro bono work is what you

88
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,840
just described so i i am uh a couple of

89
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,760
things on the health sector coordinating

90
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,920
council i am an executive committee

91
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,560
member of the executive council there

92
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,200
and uh specifically within one of the

93
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,440
task groups that is organized under that

94
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,080
uh initiative i'm the co-lead for the

95
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,360
industry league for the 405 d initiative

96
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,599
45d is a

97
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,440
joint partnership with health and human

98
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,519
services i have a government counterpart

99
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:38,959
julie chua

100
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,040
we've been established for about

101
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,760
four years now produced a document

102
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,599
called hiccup the health industry cyber

103
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,519
security practices

104
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:48,720
which we talked about medical device

105
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:53,680
security in there and that was recently

106
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,799
recognized as a cyber security best

107
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:59,040
practice under a new law

108
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,159
public law 116 321 which ultimately

109
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,959
amends high tech and instructs the

110
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:07,280
office for civil rights to consider

111
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,120
recognized practices during any

112
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,120
enforcement actions so

113
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,720
long-winded way of kind of getting into

114
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,239
some policy stuff kind of getting into

115
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:15,840
some of the industry stuff but there's a

116
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,478
lot of work that i do on that side

117
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:21,680
great and last but not least sam

118
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,840
hi guys i'm dr samantha jocks i'm the

119
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,600
vice president for clinical engineering

120
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,080
at mclaren health we're a 15 hospital

121
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,720
system in michigan and in ohio and my

122
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,560
role is to maintain all the medical

123
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,479
devices throughout our entire integrated

124
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:36,000
system as well so

125
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,320
i too like eric work very closely with

126
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,440
the healthcare sector coordinating

127
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,919
council on their subgroup around legacy

128
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:43,759
medical devices and you know devices

129
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,759
that are no longer supported so

130
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,680
i appreciate mike you're you're pulling

131
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,360
all this all together and i'm ready to

132
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,720
get started

133
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,520
me too me too and so let's let's just

134
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,240
dive right in and at fda folks the the

135
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,759
first ones to you

136
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,479
what does it mean when the fda says

137
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,639
security patches do not require fda

138
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,240
approval

139
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,160
thanks mike for the question and i think

140
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,240
it's very timely question to start the

141
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,560
panel with i'm going to start and then

142
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,680
i'll turn to my colleague matt to add on

143
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,280
so first i think it's very important

144
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,840
that we emphasize that fda's approach is

145
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,680
really meant to benefit

146
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,160
public health and safety by trying to

147
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,880
incentivize incentivize manufacturers to

148
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,680
respond quickly to identify and address

149
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,600
cybersecurity concerns

150
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,440
we really think that doing so is in the

151
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,360
best interest of patient safety and

152
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,880
patients really are at the center of

153
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,120
everything that we do and i think both

154
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,720
the government and manufacturers can

155
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,080
agree with that

156
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,960
um fda requirements sometimes were put

157
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,759
forward as rationale for not addressing

158
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,360
a cybersecurity vulnerability and so we

159
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,639
thought it was very important that we

160
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,560
clearly articulate

161
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,800
that fd requirements should not be a

162
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,120
barrier for addressing cyber security

163
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,800
concerns and we do this in a bunch of

164
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,240
different ways certainly in talks like

165
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,360
this um but also on our webpage we have

166
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,280
a myth buster sheet

167
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,080
as well as in our guidance where we have

168
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,560
tried to incentivize um in our guidance

169
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,199
for manufacturers to again identify and

170
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,080
address

171
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,639
issues quickly um and i really try to

172
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,319
emphasize in this that fda does not

173
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,560
typically need to review

174
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,800
on the changes that are being made as a

175
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,199
result of a cyber security concern and

176
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,960
i'll turn to matt now let him talk a

177
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,600
little bit more about those policy

178
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,240
implications

179
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,400
sure thanks clapton

180
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,199
um so as she said typically if a change

181
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,440
is made solely to address the cyber

182
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,280
security concerns those typically don't

183
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,919
require an fda submission

184
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,440
we definitely want to make sure that

185
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,840
manufacturers are able to

186
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,720
address cybersecurity concerns quickly

187
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,160
and with

188
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,479
as little regulatory oversight as needed

189
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,479
that being said there definitely are

190
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,960
instances where a submission may be

191
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,080
required if there's a substantial change

192
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,880
to the system so if you're changing your

193
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,599
authentication protocol or if there's

194
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:09,840
something where

195
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,280
the change being made introduces other

196
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,080
potential safety breaks where fda would

197
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:16,880
be

198
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,960
concerned about what those risk could

199
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,120
impose on the patients that's where you

200
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,160
start getting into that area of fda

201
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,880
wanting to see that in a regulatory

202
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,280
pre-market submission

203
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:33,280
that being said um we also do encourage

204
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,160
that if manufacturers find themselves in

205
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,880
that type of situation to reach out to

206
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,759
us quickly as we definitely want to

207
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,400
facilitate those review processes when

208
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,120
they're there as quickly as possible to

209
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,479
ensure that

210
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,759
we're not the long hold out in terms of

211
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,759
the delay getting those patches we want

212
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,720
to work with you on trying to

213
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,560
get those released as quickly as

214
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,879
possible

215
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,960
tara you were smiling through that and

216
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,960
uh and i i think you knew i was going to

217
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,960
call on you next because i i think

218
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,639
especially a lot of our audience and a

219
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,479
lot of our audience has heard you know a

220
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:13,120
lot of those sorts of points before but

221
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,400
very few of them probably understand

222
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,599
what it's like on the inside of a

223
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,280
medical device manufacturer to try and

224
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,120
respond to this right and to try and be

225
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,800
on on that side of the fence maybe you

226
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,479
can tell that story

227
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,400
i just i'm not laughing at a disrespect

228
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,919
i promise i'm laughing because i'm like

229
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:28,319
oh this is so common um

230
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:29,680
i think the challenge obviously the

231
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,520
medical device manufacturers we would

232
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,120
love to just push a patch out but those

233
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,519
matches said it's not always that simple

234
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,839
um patches don't just patch an operating

235
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:39,839
system they manage services they manage

236
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:41,360
calls they manage medical device

237
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,958
functions they manage multiple different

238
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,680
things in that ecosystem so if we patch

239
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,680
something and we don't break and we

240
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,360
break it and we haven't tested it now

241
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,800
we've got a bigger problem so that's why

242
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,399
the timing is timeless is such a

243
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,399
challenge is we have to test we have to

244
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,800
validate only then when that process is

245
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,640
completed are we then able to say we

246
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,480
know this is just a straight up security

247
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,560
patch and that way we can follow the fda

248
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,640
guidance for patching directly

249
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,560
if that patch impacts more than just

250
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,240
cyber security though obviously we have

251
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,519
to go through the submission process

252
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,519
working with our counterparts at fda to

253
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:12,959
kind of say you know what is the balance

254
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,080
here what does the timeline look like

255
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,680
and work with them to do a submission or

256
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,680
not do a submission to drive it so the

257
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,200
process internally

258
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,360
to apply a simple patch is

259
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,519
awesome but it's never quite that simple

260
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:24,800
so then we get a lot of the feedback

261
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,240
from customers asking well how come i

262
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,080
just can't apply that patch well because

263
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,080
if you do and you break it we have to

264
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,600
work with the fda to understand what

265
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,040
happened and why that happened so that's

266
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,560
where people hear about recalls

267
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,959
happening it's not necessarily recalls

268
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,880
but it's more a matter of what broke

269
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,720
down and why didn't you catch it sooner

270
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,200
does that

271
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:45,920
sam how how does that play out on the

272
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,080
other side or eric whoever wants to jump

273
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,760
in i i don't have to i don't have to

274
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,800
moderate

275
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,320
everything whoever wants to jump in and

276
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,200
respond to that go for it so so i

277
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,720
appreciate afton because she has a

278
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,720
mythbusters kind of mentality that goes

279
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,320
on in the fda and i think one of the

280
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,000
things that people don't understand on

281
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,320
our side from the medical device side is

282
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,839
right the myth is that there's one

283
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,560
process for us to patch there's not one

284
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,040
process there's probably 15 different

285
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,440
processes that we have to follow and so

286
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,680
right if a vulnerability comes out right

287
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,760
we can follow either a proactive or a

288
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,720
reactive right stance if it's proactive

289
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,320
right and we know we have devices that

290
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,920
are affected by this obviously we'll

291
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,680
work with our mdm partners to try and

292
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,519
figure out when which is always our

293
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:28,720
question when am i going to get the

294
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,959
patch when is it going to be available

295
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:33,920
um but if it but if we don't necessarily

296
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,480
know that the the vulnerabilities were

297
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,640
part of some of the devices we have we

298
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,320
might end up in a reactive stance where

299
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,720
all of a sudden we'll just get a

300
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,120
security patch that pops up right on a

301
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,360
vendor portal or an email from a vendor

302
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,760
saying hey you need to implement this

303
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,839
that communication can sometimes be very

304
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:53,680
challenging right there's no standard

305
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,839
way for mdms and hdo's to communicate

306
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:57,519
which is very problematic in the

307
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:58,959
security world

308
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,800
and then after we actually know

309
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,880
something needs to be done how you go

310
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,720
about doing it is incredibly painful

311
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,839
right so

312
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:08,399
do my staff go out and physically touch

313
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,720
every device does the vendor have to

314
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,920
come out and we've got a schedule for

315
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,839
them to touch every device

316
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,440
patching in the medical device world is

317
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,839
not like patching your laptop where it

318
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:20,399
can sit in the in the dark room and hit

319
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,160
a button and via the network everything

320
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,880
goes out 99 of our patches you

321
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,880
physically have to touch every device we

322
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,000
have to patch it and so the simplicity

323
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,480
and the idea that patching is a panacea

324
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,480
solution from a security perspective is

325
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,760
just false

326
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,399
we can't patch everything we don't have

327
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:41,839
any uh ability to monitor and to

328
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:43,760
proactively go out and say all of this

329
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,000
stuff needs to be patched uh to go ahead

330
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,680
and reduce the risk we have so we just

331
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,680
end up juggling that risk the best we

332
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,800
can

333
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,560
yeah i totally begin to build on that

334
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,079
sam i think i think the reality that

335
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:55,920
you'll understand also is medical

336
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,519
devices aren't just in hospitals they're

337
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:59,279
in bodies their homes and until that

338
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:00,959
gets connected you can't apply that

339
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:02,720
patch so until and we don't have the

340
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,560
authority to say to somebody you have to

341
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,320
connect this system every day of your

342
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,160
life this is not our right so that's the

343
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,680
other challenge that people don't always

344
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,000
recognize

345
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,760
yeah so i'm going to jump in on this as

346
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,279
well and and

347
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,680
talk about maybe two challenges in this

348
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,200
space so

349
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,160
um

350
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,720
so first of all i i certainly respect

351
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,519
the

352
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,200
the progress that has been made over the

353
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,279
last several years both uh from the fda

354
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,959
providing you know very clear guidance

355
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:31,279
on uh what what we should be doing to

356
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:32,959
the mdm's coming to the table you know

357
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:34,800
and recognizing you know we've got to

358
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,240
solve for the problem and the hdo is

359
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,760
honestly stepping up and saying hey this

360
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,440
is part of our issue as well

361
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,720
uh you know

362
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,800
five seven years ago it was like a

363
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,040
knuckle fight you know drag out fight on

364
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,959
who's doing what who's responsible and

365
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:48,320
and everybody was pointing at everybody

366
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,920
else so it's gotten way better like

367
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,920
that's not happening anymore so that's

368
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:52,959
good

369
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:54,880
um there's some challenges

370
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,720
so you know sam just talked about the

371
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,240
operational issues i actually didn't

372
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,800
know how how hard it is on that side of

373
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,519
the house to actually get the patch in

374
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:07,040
um we you know i i want to sort of

375
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,880
from an hdo's perspective there's

376
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,000
obviously a lot of things that we need

377
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,560
to do to protect devices and

378
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,639
um you know at the end of the day the

379
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,720
patch is the thing that we want to get

380
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,160
in there to inoculate it's like the

381
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,360
vaccine you know so um we

382
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,760
we we will put other risk compensating

383
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,399
controls in place to make it work in a

384
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,800
in a temporal you know bridge type of

385
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,200
solution but we need an end state where

386
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,880
that the the final patch can get

387
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,360
deployed we don't want patches to cause

388
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,839
harm to the patients we don't want it to

389
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:38,880
you know disrupt the clinical

390
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,399
effectiveness of the device there's

391
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:41,839
obviously got to be quality control and

392
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:43,760
all that stuff has to happen

393
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,839
one of the challenges that we have today

394
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:47,360
um is

395
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,160
the the the signal for

396
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,800
uh the the vulnerable the criticality of

397
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,040
that patch is entirely driven by the

398
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,399
mdms

399
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,160
so if something if there's a new

400
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,399
vulnerability that pops out and you know

401
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:02,000
there's and it's bad you know maybe

402
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,360
there and there's my gosh there have

403
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,600
been so many bad ones this year i i just

404
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,920
can't i'm so surprised by it uh

405
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,760
especially like so many zero days within

406
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,000
microsoft and and so forth

407
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,079
uh you know the mdms will take this tara

408
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:16,160
maybe correct me if i'm wrong uh the

409
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,760
mdms will take this

410
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,680
conduct the risk analysis determine you

411
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,839
know uh pursuant to the fda post-market

412
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:24,079
guidance determine if the there's a

413
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,320
underlying critical effectiveness you

414
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,760
know issue

415
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,800
and if it deems if it's deemed as uh an

416
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,079
uncontrolled risk then they'll go

417
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:33,920
through their process of like emergency

418
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,240
off emergency processes

419
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,760
if it's a controlled risk it sort of

420
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,320
falls into a normal cycle now here's the

421
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,320
problem

422
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,279
the uncontrolled risk is specifically my

423
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:47,199
mind's eye is specifically designed

424
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:49,440
around can you tamper with the device to

425
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,839
have the device cause direct harm

426
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:53,519
the issue that we are facing within

427
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,000
hdo's is not so much the direct harm on

428
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,160
the device connected to the person as it

429
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,560
is the device is part of an ecosystem

430
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,720
that when it's weak breaks the entire

431
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,800
system and then suddenly we're unable to

432
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,240
care for our patients because that one

433
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,000
device that's over here in a corner that

434
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,880
was deemed as a controlled risk was used

435
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,639
as a beach head and you know blew

436
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,079
through everything

437
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,079
and so it's it we're not having the risk

438
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:18,639
conversation at the ecosystem level and

439
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:20,880
and the both post-market guidance isn't

440
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,560
you know driven that way

441
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,720
the mbms are you know are talking about

442
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,440
it again pursuant to the guidance

443
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,800
and um

444
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,720
and and then we're stuck with this sort

445
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,720
of quagmire of of vulnerability and the

446
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,320
answer is well just put a firewall in

447
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,600
front of it and you're fine and it's

448
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,519
like oh my god you know and oh by the

449
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,440
way us mdms we're going to use our

450
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,880
remote access tools and we're just going

451
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,160
to connect into that thing that you're

452
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,320
not even going to know about it and

453
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,680
we're going to manage it and so then

454
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,320
again go oh my gosh you know like how

455
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,240
how much stuff is happening in my

456
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,839
environment that i don't even have

457
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:56,000
visibility into control over

458
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,600
and what happens if it's in the middle

459
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,000
of an or when a surgery is going on and

460
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
you know and we're not controlling for

461
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,120
that so

462
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,079
um

463
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:05,920
yeah that's so that's that's my sort of

464
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,519
challenging statement and of reality

465
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,199
so i can i can build in a little bit i

466
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:12,320
think you know i think a lot of the

467
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,560
larger mdm's you know the bigger ones

468
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,560
not the smaller the big ones are really

469
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,720
really cognitive that fact and as they

470
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,399
do their csras they're really looking to

471
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:21,920
make sure they don't become that pivot

472
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,360
point into your network not not just

473
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,800
because patient harm they don't want the

474
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,040
reputational risk either um i know that

475
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,720
i've been pushing really hard to look at

476
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,639
the entire ecosystem and not just the

477
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:33,440
device itself so we're trying to help

478
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,959
i agree that putting a firewall in front

479
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:36,639
of it is a band-aid it doesn't actually

480
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:38,639
solve the problem it just pushes it down

481
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,399
the line longer so i think the way to

482
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,040
really solve that is as devices do more

483
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,120
of the csras they need to cyberkey risk

484
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,440
analysis they need to look at all the

485
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,360
way this ecosystem interfaces interact

486
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,959
with that device and then even if it's

487
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:53,040
not being used for patient care at that

488
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,480
point in time they need to make sure

489
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,079
that it's not being used as a way to get

490
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:57,680
to another patient and care on another

491
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,920
system and i think that's what the csas

492
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,360
are starting to really get to the bottom

493
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,120
of so i do see a lot of changes

494
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,240
happening there and i do think it's

495
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,720
going to get a lot better soon

496
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,799
so fda let me pull up that some more

497
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:10,240
sorry

498
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,520
i think as you see more connected

499
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,199
systems coming on board with the with

500
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,919
iot being everything you can't just say

501
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:17,599
it's a standalone device anymore nothing

502
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:20,639
is standalone anymore

503
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:23,919
everything connects to the ehr these

504
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:27,199
days pretty much right so um fda folks

505
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:28,720
i've noticed we've started to talk about

506
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,400
postmarket guidance eric brought up

507
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,160
controlled and uncontrolled risk there's

508
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,600
probably a lot of people in the audience

509
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,600
that don't actually understand the

510
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,919
post-market guidance or what what is

511
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:39,120
different about controlled and

512
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,640
uncontrolled risk and what even that

513
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,160
means and i i don't know if you guys

514
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,000
want to stop and explain and maybe talk

515
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,400
a little bit about how that has how that

516
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,000
has gone how that whole process has

517
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,480
played out

518
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,880
sure um so

519
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,320
largely when you're looking at

520
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,840
controlled and uncontrolled there are

521
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,240
kind of these terms that we introduced

522
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,919
in the post-market guidance to discuss

523
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:04,559
the way to characterize the residual

524
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:07,520
risk from the vulnerability so if you're

525
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,320
in

526
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,400
the controlled level you have an

527
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,960
acceptable level of residual risk with

528
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,760
the vulnerability existing in the system

529
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,160
and naturally with uncontrolled it's an

530
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,400
unacceptable residual risk so that

531
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,919
increases the priority in which

532
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:26,840
those issues should be addressed by the

533
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:30,360
manufacturer one of the common kind of

534
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,960
misconceptions that we've seen with the

535
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,520
implementation of the guidance is that

536
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,760
some manufacturers will classify

537
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,840
something as a controlled risk and they

538
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,200
view it as okay this never needs to be

539
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,720
addressed in my system ever um that's

540
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,880
not the intention of the guidance the

541
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,039
guidance is meant to address the

542
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:55,120
priority so it's expressing the urgency

543
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,600
with which a uncontrolled vulnerability

544
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,880
needs to be

545
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,240
um addressed um definitely with the

546
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,480
greater safety risk those

547
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,280
um risks should be handled faster but it

548
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,080
definitely is not intended to be a we're

549
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,919
in the controlled section this never

550
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:13,360
needs to be addressed and that

551
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,200
definitely points to

552
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,799
some of the discussions around the

553
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,720
larger system

554
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,039
and definitely from the direction the

555
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:22,880
fda's been going and how we're

556
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,679
addressing cyber security both in the

557
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:27,360
pre-market space and also in the

558
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,679
post-market space we're definitely

559
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:32,640
looking at the larger ecosystem

560
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,840
um and more and more of our interactions

561
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,760
so a lot of our messaging is around

562
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,320
looking at the ntn system looking at all

563
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,320
the different pieces that come into play

564
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,760
looking at those

565
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,360
remote support interfaces looking at

566
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,679
the connections to the network to the

567
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:51,039
cloud

568
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:53,120
services that are being used so we

569
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,480
definitely are

570
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,360
um

571
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,320
ramping up and increasing kind of our

572
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,559
cyber security considerations beyond

573
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:02,799
just the end device and really looking

574
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:05,360
at that system level approach

575
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,600
of how these different elements come to

576
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,639
impact those risks

577
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,240
so in the post market guidance there was

578
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,360
the 30 and 60 day time frames for

579
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,600
security assessment and and patch

580
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,679
delivery um

581
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,600
do you all believe that that's still an

582
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,520
appropriate time frame how did that how

583
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,679
is that working out in practice

584
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:28,640
and

585
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,240
you know start with the fda folks but

586
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,919
then i i really want to talk about what

587
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:33,360
that looks like on the inside of all

588
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,240
these organizations

589
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,520
yeah

590
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:41,600
so i can start so definitely from

591
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:46,080
the standpoint of the 30 day timeline

592
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,640
30 60 day timeline we know that there's

593
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,919
very few instances where these

594
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:54,640
criteria have been met to meet that

595
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,039
enforcement discretion barrier of not

596
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:59,120
issuing a recall

597
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,760
there's been a lot of maturity

598
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,840
developing over

599
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,400
the medical device sector since that

600
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,559
guidance went out i think when it came

601
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:10,480
out we knew that that was

602
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,080
a high bar but

603
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,720
trying to drive that evolution from the

604
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,520
ecosystem to better

605
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,760
message and also start

606
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,960
driving for movement from manufacturers

607
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,440
to give them a reason to start to move

608
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,400
faster put that um essentially an

609
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,720
incentive there to drive

610
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,600
um culture changes to be able to more

611
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,520
rapidly

612
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,520
respond and address cyber security

613
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,360
vulnerabilities as they come out so

614
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,280
definitely we acknowledge it hasn't been

615
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,799
hit much

616
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:44,640
there's definitely been

617
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,320
um significant strides in the sector to

618
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,600
drive in timelines and better approach

619
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,400
um being able to meet those thresholds

620
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,480
and definitely every vulnerability is

621
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,679
different you're not going um to address

622
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:02,880
every vulnerability in 60 days we know

623
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,360
that there's somewhere in order to

624
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,000
develop a patch and

625
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,960
be able to test and deploy it it's just

626
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,440
going to take longer with some of

627
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,520
these different types of systems if you

628
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,159
have an implant it's definitely a

629
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:20,720
different time frame than if you're a

630
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,520
software as a medical device application

631
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,080
existing on a mobile phone um so there's

632
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,840
different considerations there but i

633
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,760
think we're definitely

634
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,400
seeing a lot of movement in terms of

635
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,600
companies getting closer to that bar

636
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,200
but we definitely acknowledged that it

637
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,559
was a aggressive change from the status

638
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,880
quo when we released the guidance in

639
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,600
2016.

640
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,919
tara maybe you can give some shed some

641
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:50,640
light on and and i i'll i'll throw i'll

642
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,480
throw some color in of my own i remember

643
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,720
when we when i when that guidance came

644
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,799
out i was still at ge and

645
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:57,520
i

646
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,240
i will say that the 30-60 day thing

647
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,640
almost provoked laughter in uh some of

648
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,320
my colleagues because

649
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,760
you know when you get a vulnerability

650
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,919
report for a product that was developed

651
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:10,480
in 2008 and there's not anyone who's

652
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,080
written a piece a line of code on that

653
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,320
product in a decade

654
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,559
you know even finding someone who knows

655
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,559
what knows about the software can take

656
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:21,360
more than 30 days so i i'd love to hear

657
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,280
tara's experience on that same sort of

658
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,919
space yeah so um

659
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:28,159
so i think you know i was at a large

660
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:30,000
manufacturer when the first guidance

661
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,600
came out and there was definitely a lot

662
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,760
of what and again about this

663
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,080
um and it wasn't that it was impossible

664
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,360
but like you said there was there was

665
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,280
code that people hadn't looked at in 15

666
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,760
years because they had all retired so

667
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,679
the challenge was not only finding

668
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:45,120
finding someone who knew it but figuring

669
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,640
out what was actually going on the first

670
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,000
process if it was controlled or

671
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,039
uncontrolled or whatever was going to

672
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:51,200
happen i think you know fast forward 10

673
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,960
years from that point or whatever five

674
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,400
years we're out now but i think we're

675
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,240
starting to see that while 30 and 60

676
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,720
days is not easily attainable it has

677
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,320
opened up the conversation to where now

678
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,640
we actually have cyber security releases

679
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,000
planned in our development cycles we

680
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,760
never had that before so we are looking

681
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,720
at all of those vulnerabilities that

682
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,320
we're finding and scanning and you know

683
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,919
our penetration tests whatever else and

684
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:11,360
we're actually looking at all of that

685
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,039
finding ways to slot those in for

686
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:15,200
development fixes which is a huge

687
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,600
improvement i mean i'm sure ge when you

688
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,520
were there mike you remember

689
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,520
we didn't have that kind of r d didn't

690
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,600
think like that r d never considered

691
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,440
going back and touching an existing

692
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,880
product that was a sustaining initiative

693
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,559
and that was somebody else's problem so

694
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:30,000
that mindset my

695
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,559
shift has happened um most medical

696
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:34,640
manufacturers now have slotted plans

697
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,880
where every release is planned to either

698
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,039
bring in cyber security updates or

699
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:41,600
address legacy cyber security design so

700
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,039
that's happening is it going to happen

701
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:44,960
in 60 days i don't know about that you

702
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,400
know because then it comes down to

703
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,840
balancing the other product feature

704
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,760
needs so we're in that same conversation

705
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,600
of balancing all of the needs of that

706
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,279
feature set of products that you know

707
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:54,720
other customer asks all the things that

708
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,960
go into that and i think that is where

709
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,080
we're seeing the improvements but it's

710
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,360
going to be more realistically every six

711
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,120
months that will push out an update and

712
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,480
then you get into the whole marketing

713
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,840
side of who pays for that and how that

714
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,520
happens but that is not on my plate so i

715
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,200
mean yeah i think it's it's definitely

716
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,120
it's better it's getting better but 60

717
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,400
days is going to be very difficult to

718
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,919
meet

719
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:12,960
i can

720
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,039
go for it sorry so i'll be brief and

721
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:16,799
then maybe um

722
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:18,799
so something that i've done in my past

723
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:23,039
lives was uh embedded that 30 60 90 into

724
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:24,720
contract which is always an interesting

725
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,640
conversation when we got down with the

726
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,039
mdms so some of the mdms and there's

727
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:31,360
there's a lot you know so some of them

728
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,880
signed it you know and they're like yep

729
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,640
we'll do it no problem no questions

730
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,240
asked and the way that i did it by the

731
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,520
way was

732
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,679
stipulated uncontrolled risk you know

733
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:41,120
and then in that uncontrolled risk

734
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,240
category it's like straight out of the

735
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,640
fda you know post market guidance you do

736
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,159
this within 30 days you do this within

737
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:47,360
60.

738
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,520
um the more sophisticated mdms turned

739
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,799
around and said we're not actually

740
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,559
required to fix this within 60 days for

741
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:54,000
an uncontrolled risk

742
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,360
we'll recall

743
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,760
and and so i

744
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,679
responded back to that with you know say

745
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:01,279
say like a linear accelerator you know

746
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:03,120
like we build rooms around linear

747
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,640
accelerators like you're not recalling

748
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,919
that thing

749
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:07,200
you know so

750
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,880
but you know and it's

751
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,559
it's like okay

752
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:13,200
so that's fine but you're telling me now

753
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,600
then that you've got essentially uh as

754
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,080
much time as you possibly want

755
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,159
uh to work through this issue and what

756
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:21,840
am i doing in the meantime i'll just put

757
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,480
a firewall in front of it and and that's

758
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,960
the the mitigating control so

759
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,679
some vulnerabilities that's fine um i i

760
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:30,960
know this is

761
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,799
really old at this at this point in time

762
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:33,919
but

763
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:34,880
the

764
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,880
when wannacry happened many many years

765
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,679
ago um i was working with

766
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:41,520
all the mdms to try to get the patch

767
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,240
installed for for the underlying issue

768
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,480
there and none of the mdms deemed that

769
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,960
as an uncontrolled risk and

770
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,360
you know and i responded back with i'm

771
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,840
sorry this was like at the time the most

772
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,600
impactful cyber attack that the globe

773
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,360
has ever faced and you don't see that as

774
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,320
an uncontrolled risk so

775
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,400
you know so again still in a little bit

776
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,200
of this state of flux of you know like

777
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,840
what's the actual reality here and how

778
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,919
how we define it i will say though just

779
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:12,720
to be positive um you know the mdms have

780
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,960
actually done a really good job of

781
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,960
notifying and pushing patches and

782
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,279
notifying customers of this is something

783
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:21,200
that needs to happen because of you know

784
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,440
our own determinations of risk so they

785
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,679
haven't ignored the issue uh it's it's

786
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:28,480
really more of a precision point i think

787
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,720
at this point anyways sam

788
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,559
yeah so i'm gonna i agree with your

789
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:33,840
beginning points because that's exactly

790
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,279
what i was going to say right like you

791
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:36,159
know

792
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:37,919
i completely agree 100 but i'm going to

793
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:39,679
disagree with your last point because i

794
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:40,880
do think

795
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,440
the mdm ecosystem out there is very

796
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,840
different as you go from mdm to mdmdm

797
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,080
you know you have you have a true bell

798
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,679
curve there are ones that are out there

799
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:51,840
leading trying to get us to where we

800
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,600
need to be and truly partnering with

801
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,799
hdos to to you know sign agreements and

802
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:59,039
get us communication channels and figure

803
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:01,679
out how that goes and then you have mdms

804
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:04,399
that really haven't started that process

805
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:06,399
that tara talked about we still don't

806
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:09,200
have you know security as a forethought

807
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,279
we don't have security as part of design

808
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:13,760
and there's stuff rolling off the the

809
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,440
construction belt today that i'm

810
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,919
purchasing today where we have mdms that

811
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:19,840
still haven't haven't bought in they

812
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,679
haven't figured it out and we have to

813
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:23,200
deal with those just as well as we have

814
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,480
to deal with the ones that are ahead of

815
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,320
the curve and so you know the majority

816
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,760
of them i would tend to agree we're

817
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,000
moving in the right direction um you

818
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,919
know but but those of us in the hdo

819
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:33,520
world we've got to deal with all of it

820
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,919
not just one individual mdm and that can

821
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:38,159
be incredibly challenging when you're

822
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:40,640
trying to mitigate risk on an ecosystem

823
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,960
level

824
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,440
so i wanted to respond to one point from

825
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,720
eric and then one point from sam so the

826
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,640
first thing i just wanted to clarify is

827
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,559
that a recall does not necessarily mean

828
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:58,559
removal there are lots of different ways

829
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:01,120
that you can address a recall

830
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,120
and a lot of those actually involve the

831
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,720
product potentially staying right where

832
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,799
it is and having some other

833
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:08,240
fixes that don't necessitate it coming

834
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,600
out so i just want to make sure that one

835
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,000
point is clear and then with regard to

836
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,279
you know what sam you know is saying

837
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:15,840
about there being you know a bell curve

838
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:18,080
um a manufacturer's um with regard to

839
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,080
their maturity um this is part of the

840
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,919
reason why we have said from the very

841
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:23,200
beginning that we think that

842
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,600
collaboration is key here because there

843
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,279
are a lot of different maturity levels

844
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:28,799
in the various stakeholder groups that

845
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:31,679
we have from the mdm side from the

846
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:33,600
hospital side and that's why we think

847
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,840
collaborations um that have happened for

848
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:36,960
example under some of the different

849
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,480
healthcare sector coordinating council

850
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,000
efforts some of the work that eric

851
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:40,960
helped to

852
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,520
coach here and lead through the 405 d

853
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,720
and the other collaborative you know

854
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,840
workshops and things that are happening

855
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,320
it's very important for the ecosystem as

856
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,919
a whole to be engaged so that if you

857
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:51,279
have a little bit less experience you

858
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:53,360
can get some additional insights from

859
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,640
those who might have a little bit

860
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,159
greater maturity and i think that that

861
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:58,080
has been one of the benefits for our

862
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,760
sector part of the reason we have made

863
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,080
um such positive progress in a

864
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,840
relatively short amount of time is

865
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,919
because there has been a lot of

866
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:07,360
collaboration among those who have a

867
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,880
little bit more maturity trying to bring

868
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,960
along those who might not have as many

869
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,120
resources or as much awareness to try to

870
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,640
level the playing field a little bit but

871
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,320
certainly there's still um quite a bit

872
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,960
of work to do

873
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:23,440
maybe i could throw a a bit of a

874
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,799
fall into the air and see if it would be

875
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:25,840
caught

876
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,000
um so there was awesome work that was

877
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,840
done under the healthcare sector

878
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:33,200
coordinating council specifically around

879
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,600
uh product lifecycle and security

880
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,200
product lifecycle management of medical

881
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,279
devices the the joint security plan and

882
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:42,080
afton was a co-lead on that and we had

883
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,799
representation you know from hdos uh the

884
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:47,679
mdms and the fda

885
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,159
why can't that just be a requirement

886
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:52,240
like why do we have to fight

887
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,840
for that on that bell curve for those

888
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,520
who haven't adopted those who are

889
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,960
rejecting and look at that and say well

890
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,320
that's nice guidance

891
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,360
i'm not going to use the word guidance

892
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,480
because that means something very

893
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,039
specific in federal parlance that's a

894
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:06,799
nice idea you know uh but we're not you

895
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:09,200
know focused on that i find that

896
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,279
in some cases you just need you know the

897
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:13,679
rules to be set and and then that's and

898
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:16,080
that's where it goes so are we

899
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,559
is it is it possible no

900
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:20,080
no it is possible here's the challenge

901
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,159
and i'm just going to speak freely um so

902
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:23,840
mike left medical devices and went to go

903
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,519
start his own company and after that

904
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:26,640
everyone else left too we have a

905
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,039
resource problem um there's

906
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:30,559
i get calls constantly from those

907
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:32,399
smaller manufacturers asking if i can

908
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:33,840
come work for them or consult them or do

909
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,600
whatever else and obviously i can't

910
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,279
because of other issues but there's just

911
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:38,880
not enough people that do it and the

912
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,960
challenge is medical devices aren't

913
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,960
enterprise security and until you can

914
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,320
make that shift in your mind to

915
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,320
understand that you don't own where this

916
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,480
thing is going to live it's very hard to

917
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,399
design security in and people don't have

918
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:52,720
that skill set so it's it's a huge

919
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,480
challenge for the smaller manufacturers

920
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,240
but so that's why we have to use those

921
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,559
frameworks and all the other things that

922
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:00,159
we've done the last five years to help

923
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:01,840
them understand how to at least build it

924
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,000
without having dedicated cyber folks

925
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,360
they just don't have those people and

926
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,640
there's just not enough of them out

927
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,799
there um i think that there's a lot

928
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:10,399
happening in some of this and well at

929
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:11,840
least here in twin cities at the

930
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,360
university level to get more people

931
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,600
focusing on just medical device security

932
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,440
because it's such a huge challenge and

933
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,279
that's i think honestly what the problem

934
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:22,720
is going to be the resources

935
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:23,679
so

936
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:25,519
just i'm throwing a random question in

937
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:27,840
here because it's ultimately the hdos

938
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,840
who have to live with all of these

939
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:32,559
these levels of maturity like how how is

940
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:35,120
sam and eric how do you live with you

941
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,279
know i have one vendor that issues my

942
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:39,200
patches within 60 days and i have

943
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,960
another vendor who has decided that

944
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,480
there's no such thing as an uncontrolled

945
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,640
risk in their world unless the entire

946
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:47,519
machine explodes you know and and so i

947
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:49,360
never issue patches like

948
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,600
you all live with the insecure things on

949
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:56,399
your network every day what do you do

950
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:58,000
so

951
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,679
you know i think ultimately just like

952
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:01,360
the medical device manufacturers we have

953
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,360
to risk rank things right everything is

954
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,039
is a risk and you've got to figure out

955
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:06,399
what the highest risk is and that's what

956
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:08,559
we're going to truly focus on but right

957
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:10,399
in eric's perspective i agree with him

958
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:11,679
ultimately everything sits in an

959
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:14,399
ecosystem and i could argue the point

960
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:16,559
that even if i don't risk rank one

961
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:18,640
device high it's still an entry point to

962
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,320
my network and it can completely take

963
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,559
down our entire system and so you know

964
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:25,360
we struggle truly on a daily basis when

965
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,039
we look at risk to decide what we're

966
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:28,640
going to focus our resources on because

967
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,840
tara's right we don't have enough

968
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,640
resources as well on the hdo side um you

969
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,360
know we need to figure out what truly is

970
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,919
is the risk we're willing to accept and

971
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:39,519
i hate to tell you everything else falls

972
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:41,440
off the table right and we'll get to it

973
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,960
someday and we hope that there's not

974
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,360
going to be an issue and and we hope is

975
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,440
not a plan like we're all very aware

976
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,919
that hope is not a plan but we have no

977
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:51,840
other mechanism at this point besides

978
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:54,080
hope uh and so you know we'll do the

979
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,840
best we can and we have been for years

980
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,360
and everybody on this panel is correct

981
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,960
it's getting better it's better than

982
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,559
it's been in the last five years but

983
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:02,320
it's still not great i don't even know

984
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:05,279
if i'd call it good at this point

985
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:07,919
yeah so i'll plug uh hiccup here for a

986
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:10,239
second and then i'll talk about reality

987
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:11,440
um

988
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,760
so so hiccup um

989
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,320
practice nine uh is talked about medical

990
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,079
device security and you know you can

991
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:19,359
almost think about it as like hygiene

992
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:20,719
you know there are absolutely things

993
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:22,639
that we have to do within the hdos we

994
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:24,320
are we have accountability

995
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,839
uh you know network segmentation

996
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:27,679
changing default passwords

997
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:30,399
inventorying and you know having asset

998
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:32,480
you know components

999
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,000
understanding the vulnerability posture

1000
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,520
of these things you know these are all

1001
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,440
things that we need to do to do exactly

1002
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,280
what sam just talked about

1003
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,359
uh we have to treat medical devices as

1004
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:43,679
part of an iot you know ecosystem you

1005
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:45,440
know just like

1006
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,719
you know we're concerned of the medical

1007
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:48,879
devices is uh we're also concerned with

1008
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:50,639
the cameras that are connected onto the

1009
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:52,960
network and the building you know hvac

1010
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,960
systems i mean you could think about it

1011
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,719
this way you could break into a building

1012
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:59,520
hvac system crank up the heat in an or

1013
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:02,079
and suddenly boom you got a huge problem

1014
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:04,160
uh on your hands

1015
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,040
um

1016
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,599
so so that's you know there there is a

1017
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:09,920
pathway there is a statement you know a

1018
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,320
document that you can pick up and and

1019
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,359
follow

1020
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:15,119
uh and and you should

1021
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:17,359
uh the the challenge that we have is a

1022
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:20,880
telemetry issue and an operational issue

1023
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,640
so we

1024
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,680
so there's so much of these devices that

1025
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,160
are out there and and having visibility

1026
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:31,839
into those in real time is a big problem

1027
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:34,800
and it all starts with that inventory

1028
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,079
uh and how accurate you can keep it in

1029
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:40,640
real time through automation and sam i'm

1030
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,720
sure knows hard

1031
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,599
uh

1032
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:45,680
so so there's that right you know and

1033
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,839
you know cmms systems are very good at

1034
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:49,359
you know helping with that and and

1035
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:50,720
should be used

1036
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:53,119
uh then it's a segmentation issue and

1037
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:55,200
and this is where i'm gonna call it a an

1038
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,200
operational challenge

1039
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,520
it's it's a process problem so you have

1040
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,040
things that should be segmented but

1041
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,560
segmenting means that you need to like

1042
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,480
actually understand flows and data paths

1043
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,880
and all that in order for it to work or

1044
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,800
you know sometimes things just magically

1045
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,320
show up on a general access network

1046
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,720
because lo and behold it's accessible

1047
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,400
you know and so then you're playing this

1048
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,240
game of like trying to understand where

1049
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,000
it is where it's at and yank it out and

1050
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,800
move it over and and these are

1051
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,320
these are cat and mouse games you know

1052
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,920
and it's and it's hard to play and you

1053
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,480
need systems to be able to do that

1054
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,000
so i mean there are tools that are out

1055
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,960
there these days that um that do

1056
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,800
discovery and and can help you sort of

1057
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,320
understand placement

1058
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,560
uh you have to have solid architecture

1059
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,320
in the hdo to know like where your

1060
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,480
segment zones are you got to have solid

1061
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,800
education with your clinical engineering

1062
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,320
folks your architecture folks and

1063
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,720
everybody with your supply chain people

1064
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,880
so as things are coming in you know you

1065
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,560
know where they're going and how you're

1066
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:53,359
how you're tying it together

1067
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:55,359
and it's you know i'm gonna just call

1068
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:57,920
this a standard process issue

1069
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,440
uh you know you can set all the right

1070
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:02,240
designs uh but you gotta you gotta apply

1071
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,400
that scrutiny on this continually

1072
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,960
otherwise entropy enters the system and

1073
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:10,160
it just things just happen

1074
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,000
so i'm going to switch gears a little

1075
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,760
bit we've talked a lot about past and

1076
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,200
we've talked a little bit a lot about

1077
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,640
the present let's talk a little bit

1078
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:19,200
about the future so fda folks there's a

1079
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:22,079
new pre-market draft guidance that is on

1080
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:24,560
the way at some point there's also the

1081
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,320
recent executive order pushing the use

1082
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:29,040
of s-bomb how how do you all see the

1083
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,440
future of this and and especially those

1084
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,960
two developments but anything else you

1085
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,520
all are working on to to how is that

1086
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,359
going to change the hdo experience how

1087
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:38,960
is it also going to change the mdm

1088
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,960
experience as as time goes forward

1089
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:47,040
sure um i can start i'll probably start

1090
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,720
with discussing the guidance and then

1091
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:51,119
pivot to afton on some of the s-bomb

1092
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:52,240
pieces

1093
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:55,280
um in terms of the pre-market guidance

1094
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,359
definitely there's been a lot of

1095
00:37:57,359 --> 00:37:59,920
discussion across the sector around

1096
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,320
um getting the revised pre-market

1097
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:05,200
guidance out we've indicated previously

1098
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:08,720
that we'll be re-releasing it in draft

1099
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:12,880
from a high level in terms of what

1100
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:15,920
we're looking at in terms of

1101
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,320
the guidance definitely clear messaging

1102
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,880
in terms of cyber security is a part of

1103
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,760
your safety and effectiveness evaluation

1104
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,160
um that when you're looking at these

1105
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,720
device risks safety and effectiveness

1106
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:32,079
are the core of what fda's evaluation of

1107
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:34,320
cyber security are

1108
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,599
um

1109
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:38,079
definitely looking at m10 connections

1110
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:40,160
and the various use cases

1111
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,640
of how cyber security risk can impact

1112
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:46,160
the system um definitely threat modeling

1113
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:49,000
and looking at the entire system for

1114
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,200
identification of threats and

1115
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:54,880
mitigations is definitely um central to

1116
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,680
both how fda is approaching reviews

1117
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:00,480
currently and also will be central to

1118
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,880
um how we're looking at things moving

1119
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,920
forward um i think kind of one of the

1120
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,560
largest character

1121
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:09,440
characterizations is

1122
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,720
the current 2014 final guidance that's

1123
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:16,240
out there is very high level it says

1124
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,800
essentially you should be addressing

1125
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:22,000
cyber security and your risk management

1126
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,920
i'd say that this

1127
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:27,359
next revision is definitely going into

1128
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:30,240
far more detail around exactly what that

1129
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,560
those documentation expectations are

1130
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,880
exactly what those design considerations

1131
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,160
are going to be

1132
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,839
um if

1133
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:40,240
uh you consider the

1134
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,720
2014 guidance to be an x-ray of cyber

1135
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,520
security this is the mri um we're

1136
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,359
definitely getting into the details

1137
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:50,240
getting into the nitty-gritty uh in

1138
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:52,720
terms of how both cyber security fits

1139
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,960
into design considerations but also how

1140
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,960
it fits into the quality system

1141
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:00,160
regulation compliance aspects

1142
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,160
ashton do you want to take the f-bomb

1143
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,920
piece

1144
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,440
absolutely

1145
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,880
and you're going to hear a similar i

1146
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,119
think refrain with regard to some of the

1147
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:10,880
things i'll say about you know s-bomb

1148
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:13,680
here similar to how we worked in other

1149
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:16,079
challenging areas um for medical device

1150
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:18,000
cyber security um certainly have tried

1151
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,760
to take collaborative approach here as

1152
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,240
it relates to s-bomb um as well trying

1153
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,560
to get feedback and insights from

1154
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,960
various stakeholders by participating in

1155
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,800
different collaborative

1156
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:29,760
efforts

1157
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,680
we recognize really very much the

1158
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,040
criticality

1159
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,960
of having an s-bomb because it helps

1160
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,599
organizations understand

1161
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:40,560
their cyber security risks and whether

1162
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,560
or not they might be impacted and this

1163
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,480
is critical to taking action if you

1164
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,400
don't even understand

1165
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,240
potentially what's in your what's in

1166
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,319
your system what's in your network and

1167
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:52,480
so we have been very much proponent um

1168
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,720
of um s bomb and participated in a lot

1169
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,920
of collaborative activities such as

1170
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:00,400
ntias um trans software transparency

1171
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,920
activities as it relates to the

1172
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,319
healthcare concept um i think there have

1173
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:06,480
been definitely some strides made as a

1174
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,839
result of that because basically this

1175
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:10,079
group said we're not going to sit here

1176
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:12,960
and um debate all the house let's just

1177
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,480
talk about what it needs to do and let's

1178
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,480
actually you know pressure test it and

1179
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,839
see what we get out of it i think that

1180
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:19,760
really has helped to make a lot of

1181
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,040
positive

1182
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,400
progress because now we're not talking

1183
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,400
about if we need s-bomb but we're

1184
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,760
talking about actually how to do it how

1185
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,960
to operationalize it um we also

1186
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,520
on fda's side recognize that cyber

1187
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:34,240
security bits are not

1188
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,160
constrained to the u.s and that this is

1189
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,599
an international cyber securities

1190
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:40,079
international challenge so we've also

1191
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:42,640
been working as a co-chair of the

1192
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:46,000
international medical device regulators

1193
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,079
regulators forum on a cyber security

1194
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:50,560
work group that's actually working on a

1195
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,560
work product related to

1196
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:55,119
s-bomb as well as a best practice um

1197
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:58,079
trying to get additional insights um out

1198
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:00,560
to the global community as it relates to

1199
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,480
that because we know it's easier

1200
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,680
in particular for some of the larger

1201
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:06,640
multinationals um to have some um

1202
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,480
regulatory you know convergence on what

1203
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,000
some of the at least some of the general

1204
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,359
principles are

1205
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:13,040
going forward and so we definitely think

1206
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:15,280
you know s-bomb is one of those items

1207
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,880
and then even thinking about you know

1208
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:18,160
what's been happening you know

1209
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:21,599
nationally um with some of the recent

1210
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:23,839
executive orders that have come out such

1211
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:25,839
as the one on improving on the nation's

1212
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:27,760
cyber security which includes s-bomb as

1213
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:30,480
a component i know that um that one is

1214
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,400
very much you know focused um has one

1215
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,680
component that's talking about how do

1216
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:36,480
you enhance um the software supply chain

1217
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,440
um security and um s-bomb certainly is

1218
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,119
called out there and while this might

1219
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:43,599
not be explicitly um you know directed

1220
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:45,359
to an individual sector because it's

1221
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:48,480
focused on um the government working

1222
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,000
together the private sector as it

1223
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,640
relates to government systems certainly

1224
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:54,720
um as various parts of critical

1225
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,240
infrastructure

1226
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:59,280
are implicated here that this has um

1227
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,280
downstream implications for other parts

1228
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,520
of critical infrastructure um as well

1229
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,839
and there can only be benefits for the

1230
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:07,760
health sector as a whole if we all think

1231
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:10,560
about um the power of an s-bomb and how

1232
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:12,800
that can help us um increase our

1233
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,319
maturity our response our risk

1234
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:16,240
assessment and to better again protect

1235
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:19,760
patients which is our all of our goals

1236
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:22,319
so tara i i know

1237
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:25,599
s-bomb especially has its own has uh

1238
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:27,680
has some implications for medical device

1239
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:29,359
manufacturers what what are your

1240
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:30,800
thoughts

1241
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:33,440
i have many you know uh s bond has

1242
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,440
actually been a blessing and a disguise

1243
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:38,000
and i say that kindly actually because

1244
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:38,880
so

1245
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,880
it forced medical device manufacturers

1246
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,960
to really look at what they're using in

1247
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,640
their design and force people to

1248
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:46,160
simplify because if they started to have

1249
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:48,079
to maintain the s-bomb for all of these

1250
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:50,160
devices it got pretty big

1251
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,640
um so for me i'm using it

1252
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:54,480
in my future designs as a way to reduce

1253
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,240
complexity to say you know what let's

1254
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:57,839
only use stuff that we know has a good

1255
00:43:57,839 --> 00:43:59,200
supply shine behind it so we don't have

1256
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,920
to manage more vendors um let's actually

1257
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,760
use this to make our designs better so

1258
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:05,599
that's what i'm using it for on the

1259
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:07,839
other hand the the other side is oh my

1260
00:44:07,839 --> 00:44:09,359
god we found a lot of stuff out there

1261
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:11,200
that has not been you know people use

1262
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,960
open source software for everything and

1263
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,960
that's been a challenge

1264
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,960
because to help to the hdos when they

1265
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,560
say you have to give us an s bomb it's

1266
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:21,040
like okay you know so you're giving them

1267
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:22,640
the zest bomb with open source software

1268
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:24,240
in there and that you know hasn't been

1269
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:25,920
touched in a long time and that's a lot

1270
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,440
of uncomfortable conversations of how

1271
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:28,800
you man do that so i think it's really

1272
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:29,760
helped

1273
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,440
open up our eyes as to what's actually

1274
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,440
gone on in the past and in the cowboy

1275
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:34,720
way if you will

1276
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:36,000
and what are we going to do about in the

1277
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,599
future to make it so that we actually

1278
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:39,040
have less

1279
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:41,119
intensive designs and less complexity in

1280
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:42,640
our system so that we do know what's

1281
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:43,599
actually in there so that when a

1282
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:46,800
vulnerability does happen we can say 100

1283
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,160
certainty that it is either controlled

1284
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:49,359
or uncontrolled what never gonna do

1285
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:52,319
about it that's the part of it um

1286
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:54,319
personally what i would love to see from

1287
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:56,160
my friends at the fda though is to get

1288
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,760
this guidance out because the

1289
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:00,160
uncertainty of everything going on is

1290
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:01,520
giving design teams the ability to say

1291
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:02,800
well we don't have that yet we don't

1292
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:05,040
have that enforced yet so we need that

1293
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:06,079
so that we can continue making the

1294
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:07,839
progress to go forward

1295
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:09,440
um because the s-bomb's in there and

1296
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,040
they're like well no one said anything

1297
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:12,319
we have to say yeah it's like yes it's

1298
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:13,839
coming we know it's coming we know it's

1299
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:15,680
going to be the mri if you will and we

1300
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,280
need that because that detail's got to

1301
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:18,400
be there again

1302
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:21,119
so please hurry please

1303
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:22,880
but that's just my two cents i mean

1304
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:24,720
s-bomb is good and bad and there's a lot

1305
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,240
of benefits to it and i fully support

1306
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,319
doing it actually

1307
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:29,920
i don't think there's anyone that wants

1308
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:33,280
this guidance out faster than fda does i

1309
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:36,880
am trust me i know man i know i'm sorry

1310
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:39,520
anything i can do i am doing it let me

1311
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:42,160
know if i can help

1312
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:44,720
uh the hdo folks how do you plan to use

1313
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:47,599
s-bomb i mean i i think i have a hunch

1314
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:49,119
but let's let's hear what you're

1315
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:50,640
thinking as far as some of this new

1316
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:53,440
stuff that's coming out

1317
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,480
so i can let eric go first because you

1318
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:59,040
know my perspective is very operational

1319
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:01,520
right i i want to see it because it's

1320
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:03,760
going to be very helpful to us but i

1321
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:06,160
also manage a ridiculous number of

1322
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:07,839
manufacturers in a ridiculous number of

1323
00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:10,319
devices so i have truly operational

1324
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:12,240
concerns about how i'm going to ingest

1325
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:14,720
this information and actually mine it

1326
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:17,680
for useful pieces of data um you know i

1327
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:19,359
really want to start having some initial

1328
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:22,319
conversations with cmdb and cmms vendors

1329
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:24,079
right how are we going to make this easy

1330
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:25,520
because at this point you know we're

1331
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:26,560
going to get it and it's going to be

1332
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:28,240
great when we first get it and then

1333
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:29,280
we're going to have a stack of paper

1334
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:30,880
this high trying to figure out okay well

1335
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,880
again how am i going to risk rank right

1336
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:34,560
when everybody gives me the same type of

1337
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:36,079
information it's not going to be in the

1338
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:37,680
same format it's not going to be you

1339
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:41,359
know easily ingestible so you know i i

1340
00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:43,599
applaud all the work moving towards

1341
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:45,119
right and s bomb because that's exactly

1342
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:47,440
where we need to go um but we still have

1343
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:48,720
work to do from an operational

1344
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:51,040
perspective on actually making it very

1345
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:54,560
useful for those of us in the hdo world

1346
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:58,560
that's exactly where i'm at sam

1347
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:02,079
so uh i i've seen some early iterations

1348
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:04,160
of s-bombs that uh some of the leading

1349
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:06,560
manufacturers have produced and that's

1350
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:07,839
it's pretty cool you know seeing sort of

1351
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:10,160
the format of it and the componentry of

1352
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,960
it and we now have a massive data

1353
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:14,000
problem

1354
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,319
you know which is how does this all tie

1355
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:18,240
i mean i i actually you know to a degree

1356
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:19,599
think about it as like the passive

1357
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:22,079
vulnerability scanners of old like

1358
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:24,640
old nessus if you recall it did banner

1359
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:26,480
grabs there was a database in the back

1360
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:28,640
end it said you know these are the

1361
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:30,240
vulnerabilities of this particular

1362
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:32,559
system spits out a report and then you

1363
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:34,079
go out and rationalize that you're like

1364
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:37,040
oh now the banner was off or oh you know

1365
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:39,359
that we didn't update that field sorry

1366
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:41,520
you know and and so the reality of the

1367
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:44,559
vulnerability was sort of in question at

1368
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:45,440
times

1369
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,599
i don't want to poo poo the the

1370
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:49,119
initiative though i mean it is it is

1371
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:52,960
absolutely the first step in unpacking

1372
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:56,400
the problem but now we have a large data

1373
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:59,280
problem that has to come at hand

1374
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:01,200
and i agree with sam this is entirely

1375
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,760
like an operational challenge so we need

1376
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:04,559
a

1377
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:06,559
a consistent way of bringing this in

1378
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:08,559
from multiple sources

1379
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:09,599
we need

1380
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:10,480
uh

1381
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:13,280
trust and fidelity of the data elements

1382
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:15,200
itself to know that it's actually up to

1383
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:18,000
date and accurate so whatever that cycle

1384
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,359
is going to be that the mdms are going

1385
00:48:19,359 --> 00:48:21,359
to be producing this is it going to be

1386
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:24,000
the same 30 60 90 patch cycle you know i

1387
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,760
mean are you when when there's a new

1388
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:27,040
component that happens does it

1389
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:29,119
automatically push and come over or do

1390
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:31,280
we have to wait a quarter or two you

1391
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:33,520
know for that for that information so

1392
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:35,760
there's a there's a lag sort of

1393
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:37,839
challenge in inside of it

1394
00:48:37,839 --> 00:48:39,359
um

1395
00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:41,200
we all like i said at the beginning we

1396
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:43,119
have issues just around inventory in the

1397
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:45,280
first place you know so like tying into

1398
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:48,640
the inventory and and and all of that uh

1399
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:49,520
and

1400
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:51,599
and then the telemetry associated to it

1401
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:53,599
now there are um

1402
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:55,359
there are products that are out there

1403
00:48:55,359 --> 00:48:57,200
that are already thinking about this you

1404
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:59,040
know there's there's like the

1405
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:00,720
the medical device specific iot

1406
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:02,880
management devices that

1407
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:04,800
are out there already trying to

1408
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:06,880
understand the flows and and the

1409
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:09,119
vulnerability status of those things and

1410
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:10,800
those you know those

1411
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,960
more forward-thinking companies are

1412
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:14,800
looking at how to incorporate s-bomb

1413
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:16,880
into the mix of all that and that's

1414
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:19,200
exactly what you they should be doing

1415
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:20,960
um you know

1416
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:23,280
my perspective is i'm looking for a a

1417
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:25,440
service or a product that's going to

1418
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:28,720
manage all that work underneath it for

1419
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:30,880
me because back to the

1420
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:32,559
challenge of resources that we had

1421
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:35,200
before if we have to put people on this

1422
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:37,520
you know to pick apart all the data

1423
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:39,440
inside of it

1424
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:41,599
i don't know you know so

1425
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:42,720
um

1426
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:45,119
and then i'll say you know i i predict

1427
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:47,599
putting my future lens in place that

1428
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:48,960
we're going to come back to some of the

1429
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:51,040
same challenges that we have today

1430
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:53,359
which are the s-bomb is going to expose

1431
00:49:53,359 --> 00:49:55,200
a vulnerability and there's going to be

1432
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,880
a disagreement about is that

1433
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:58,800
vulnerability controlled or uncontrolled

1434
00:49:58,800 --> 00:49:59,839
and then we're going to be going back to

1435
00:49:59,839 --> 00:50:01,359
the manufacturers and having the same

1436
00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:02,720
conversation again we just have more

1437
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:05,599
data you know at our hands which is good

1438
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:08,000
we always should have more data uh and

1439
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,760
and but we're gonna we have to work out

1440
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:12,000
a a new process on sort of what that

1441
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,760
means

1442
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,440
all right we're coming up on time and i

1443
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:17,680
want to i want to leave a couple minutes

1444
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:19,119
for everyone to go around we're going to

1445
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:21,280
go around and and i want you all to do

1446
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:23,119
two things one

1447
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:25,760
one or two sentences of the the point

1448
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:27,680
you want to leave the audience with and

1449
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:29,839
then more importantly where can the

1450
00:50:29,839 --> 00:50:31,599
audience find more of each of you

1451
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:33,280
because i'm sure there are people who

1452
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,640
are going to want to talk to you all on

1453
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:37,520
social media or email or find you out in

1454
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:40,000
the world and so um

1455
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,079
we'll go around and maybe we can go in

1456
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:42,960
uh

1457
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:44,720
in a different order i'm just gonna go

1458
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:46,960
sort of counterclockwise sam let's start

1459
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,800
with you

1460
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:50,720
yeah so probably the one thing to take

1461
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:52,880
away from this is you know we've made

1462
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:54,559
progress right i don't think any of us

1463
00:50:54,559 --> 00:50:56,480
on this panel can disagree with the fact

1464
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:58,559
that it is a vastly different ecosystem

1465
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:00,960
than it was five years ago but we still

1466
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:03,119
have a long way to go and so i think

1467
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:04,960
these types of talks getting the

1468
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:06,559
information out there so that everybody

1469
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:08,079
understands exactly where we are and

1470
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:09,839
exactly where we want to go is the best

1471
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:11,280
thing we can do at this point we need to

1472
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:13,359
continue to communicate and collaborate

1473
00:51:13,359 --> 00:51:14,880
uh and we need to continue to make

1474
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:17,440
things better and easier for all of us

1475
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:19,920
uh in this entire ecosystem so thank you

1476
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:21,280
mike for putting this together that's

1477
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:24,640
awesome um you guys can find me uh i'm

1478

1479
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:29,680
last name jocks at mclaren or i'm on

1480
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:31,040
linkedin if you guys want to connect on

1481
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:32,960
linkedin that's great

1482
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:35,960
matt

1483
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:40,880
sure um i'd say from my standpoint

1484
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:43,520
definitely in terms of the sectors

1485
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:46,079
getting better i'd say manufacturers are

1486
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:48,720
doing significant culture changes that

1487
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:50,800
continuing support to taurus point

1488
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:52,319
earlier

1489
00:51:52,319 --> 00:51:54,319
was not really built into the business

1490
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:56,960
model so companies have been doing a lot

1491
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:58,880
in terms of changing their team

1492
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:00,960
configurations to

1493
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:03,359
support devices so that's definitely a

1494
00:52:03,359 --> 00:52:05,680
critical piece to getting patches out

1495
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:08,160
quickly so where you've come a long way

1496
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:10,160
but still have a ways to go

1497
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:14,000
um and definitely i think in terms of

1498
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:17,200
the broader ecosystem with the

1499
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:19,040
threats that we're seeing with all of

1500
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:20,720
the different attacks we've been seeing

1501
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:23,760
in healthcare it's only going to be a

1502
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:26,480
more critical process moving forward and

1503
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:29,119
i think that the industry is going to

1504
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:30,160
have to

1505
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:32,800
continue to step up and make sure that

1506
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:35,280
we're able to address these uh

1507
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:37,599
vulnerabilities quickly to ensure that

1508
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:40,160
patient safety is continued

1509
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:42,400
in terms of finding me i'm on linkedin

1510
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:43,839
or my

1511
00:52:43,839 --> 00:52:46,000
fda email

1512
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,200
which is easily findable

1513
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:51,680
because government employees

1514
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:54,559
so either of those locations

1515
00:52:54,559 --> 00:52:56,880
sorry

1516
00:52:57,119 --> 00:53:00,800
yeah i mean so i think that the uh

1517
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:02,720
the divide that we used to have five

1518
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:05,359
years ago between manufacturers

1519
00:53:05,359 --> 00:53:07,520
fda and hdos has gotten a lot smaller

1520
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:08,960
and not a moment too soon because as

1521
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:10,559
moved to connective care and everything

1522
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:12,480
that we do we've got to continue that

1523
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:14,240
partnership i think our engineers

1524
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:16,079
internally are much more advanced now as

1525
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:17,440
understanding cyber security and they

1526
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:19,200
definitely realize that they have to do

1527
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:21,359
it and that's been huge i mean i

1528
00:53:21,359 --> 00:53:22,720
personally got to watch this journey and

1529
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:24,079
believe me it's huge that those

1530
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:26,000
engineers are now on board um i think

1531
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,680
going forward that partnership and

1532
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:29,040
engineering background is going to just

1533
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:31,680
be going it's going to be necessary and

1534
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:32,960
that's going to help people be able to

1535
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:34,800
grow cyber security internally and not

1536
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:36,319
have to have dedicated cybersecurity

1537
00:53:36,319 --> 00:53:38,160
resources for every team that's going to

1538
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:41,359
be the way it goes forward

1539
00:53:41,359 --> 00:53:42,640
and if you want to find me i'm on

1540
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:45,839

um

1543
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:51,839
i would just uh encourage you to look at

1544
00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:53,200
the health industry cyber security

1545
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:55,119
practices or hiccup

1546
00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:56,640
practice nine is the medical device

1547
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:58,880
security state you know htos we have an

1548
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:01,040
obligation here and and that is your

1549
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:04,240
path if you haven't set a path yet

1550
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:05,359
uh

1551
00:54:05,359 --> 00:54:07,440
if you you could find it by uh you know

1552
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:11,359
google 405d hhs 405d it'll take you to

1553
00:54:11,359 --> 00:54:13,920
phe.gov and and the publication is

1554
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:15,440
located there

1555
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:17,680
um you can find me on linkedin that's

1556
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:20,160
mostly where i'm located i have like the

1557
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:22,160
tiniest of twitter presents i haven't

1558
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:24,000
really gotten into twitter yet but i am

1559
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,720
eric decker13 on twitter you'll see that

1560
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:28,319
i have like five people following me

1561
00:54:28,319 --> 00:54:31,599
it's better to follow me on like that

1562
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:33,280
and

1563
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:35,760
the last word to afton

1564
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:37,200
thanks mike

1565
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:40,000
so i think that my last words are going

1566
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,319
to really um focus on the whole reason

1567
00:54:42,319 --> 00:54:44,079
that we're all here that we all

1568
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:45,920
recognize that medical device cyber

1569
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:47,760
security really is a patient safety

1570
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:50,480
issue and it's complex and challenging

1571
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:52,880
which means that we need to continue

1572
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:54,040
these

1573
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:55,640
multi-party

1574
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:58,240
multi-stakeholder collaborations

1575
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:00,000
to bring forward the different

1576
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,960
viewpoints so that we don't build tools

1577
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:04,240
processes

1578
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:05,839
or bring on people that are not going to

1579
00:55:05,839 --> 00:55:08,160
benefit what actually some of our key

1580
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:09,839
challenges are

1581
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:11,760
and so really want to make sure that

1582
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:14,160
we're actually building solutions that

1583
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:17,040
will be helpful in advancing us forward

1584
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:20,400
and continue to accelerate on the pace

1585
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,720
at which we are acting because the

1586
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:24,400
threats continue to accelerate and so

1587
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:27,119
we've got to try to match that pace as

1588
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:29,440
much as we can and then um for me

1589
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:31,119
certainly you can find

1590
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:36,040
me at my fda address my my name at

1591
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:39,040
fda.gov and then also we have a team

1592
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:41,200
cybersecurity mailbox too that's staffed

1593
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:44,799
by several um people cyber med

1594
00:55:44,799 --> 00:55:46,720
fda.hhs.gov

1595
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:49,280
and that's also a good way to get in

1596
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:50,640
touch with the team and certainly like

1597
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:52,240
everyone else are on linkedin and i'm

1598
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:55,760
like eric i haven't got to twitter yet

1599
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:58,079
all right i'm gonna wrap this up and say

1600

00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:05,680
the work of of health care cyber

1603
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:07,839
security so to take an hour to talk to

1604

and the work that nina and all the folks

1609

behind the biohacking village have put

1610
00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:23,599
in over the years you know 10 years ago

1611
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:25,680
this would have been

1612
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:28,160
this forum didn't even exist for us to

1613
