digital technologies to improve lives i

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,800
am delighted to be co-presenting um with

10
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,279
my colleague my longtime collaborator

11
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:29,359
and great friend jessalyn dunn jesse do

12
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:30,400
you want to introduce yourself to

13
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,520
everyone sure thanks so much jen um my

14
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,280
name is jessie lynn dunn i'm an

15
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,280
assistant professor at duke in the

16
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,440
departments of biomedical engineering

17
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,160
and biostatistics and bioinformatics i

18
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,280
run the big ideas lab at duke um and i'm

19
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,680
thrilled to be presenting at this venue

20
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,239
and presenting alongside jen

21
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:52,640
fantastic so the way we'll run this

22
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,840
today um i will start by um presenting a

23
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,600
little bit on sort of current state of

24
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,840
the field and specifically digital

25
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,640
clinical measures um then what i'll do

26
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,559
is i'll hand over to jessalyn to take us

27
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,119
through some of the science that we use

28
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:09,680
to ensure that when we are using digital

29
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,600
technologies digital tools to measure

30
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,400
health

31
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,000
we can be certain that those measures

32
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,560
are trustworthy then jessalyn will hand

33
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,560
that to me i'll keep it short at that

34
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,439
point

35
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,040
and we'll just reflect on what needs to

36
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,520
happen to take all of this to scale and

37
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,360
importantly jessalyn and i actually

38
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,159
recently collaborated um on some uh

39
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,119
research we have some data on the state

40
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:33,360
of the field and in particular uh

41
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,840
security research um that we thought it

42
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,439
might be interesting to share so that's

43
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:40,159
how we'll close out so with that in mind

44
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:42,479
let me go ahead and start sharing my

45
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,560
screen

46
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,560
jessalyn can you see that

47
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,360
yes

48
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,200
fantastic all right so let me go ahead

49
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,520
and dive in so we're going to be talking

50
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,200
about digital clinical measures today

51
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,960
and specifically what's the current

52
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,560
state of the field and how can we

53
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,040
anticipate them evolving in sort of what

54
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,360
hopefully will soon be a post-covert

55
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,159
error

56
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,159
what's interesting is if we look to the

57
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,719
um if we look to the press for example

58
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,280
we'll see that many of our sort of uh

59
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,440
terrific scientific sort of journalist

60
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,120
colleagues will say that healthcare is

61
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,080
undergoing a monumental shift towards

62
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,319
remote patient monitoring during the

63
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,239
last year three of the five biggest

64
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,720
companies in the world have announced

65
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,879
new remote monitoring products we've

66
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:27,200
seen amazon put their halo out that was

67
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,319
launched last uh last summer um google

68
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,800
now owns uh the fitbit sense they are

69
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,160
actually ha a cleared technology um so

70
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,560
in some ways they are a regulated device

71
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,200
their ecg app is a clear product

72
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,879
although that is the only part of their

73
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,400
sort of measurement suite that is

74
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,360
cleared

75
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,239
there's also apple who have um developed

76
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,080
a phenomenal amount

77
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,400
of health measuring capabilities through

78
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,879
their smart watch um they also have a

79
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,879
clearance specifically for pulse ox

80
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,440
monitoring

81
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,640
let's think about how these tools have

82
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,319
been used recently though and i think

83
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,720
this is really important for us to pause

84
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,800
and think about um

85
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,640
there's been a lot of use of technology

86
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,720
in healthcare but the digital clinical

87
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,040
measures piece in particular um where is

88
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,440
that um in its development

89
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,159
during the pandemic at its height we saw

90
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:22,959
telehealth increased by nearly um 1200

91
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,280
at the same time of those telehealth

92
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,560
visits only 11 of those relied on remote

93
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,159
patient monitoring

94
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,599
now there's a couple of things there

95
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,360
first of all i actually don't think by

96
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,959
any stretch of the imagination that

97
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:36,720
every single telehealth encounter needs

98
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,920
to be based on or reference um sort of

99
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,760
digital clinical measures data we don't

100
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,440
have to be reliant on remote patient

101
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,920
monitoring for every telehealth visit

102
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,799
however 11 does feel low

103
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:50,959
kudos to our clinical colleagues all of

104
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:52,640
this care during the pandemic delivered

105
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,439
by telehealth they turned on a dime to

106
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:57,439
be able to deliver that care so there's

107
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:58,959
definitely some aspects there that

108
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:00,480
perhaps those tools and technologies

109
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,480
weren't deployed and weren't available

110
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,040
but that 11 number does seem low it

111
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,040
shows that there's a lot of work to do

112
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,879
to integrate these tools

113
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,799
safely effectively

114
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,959
into clinical workflows

115
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:14,959
i think it's also worthwhile um to look

116
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,798
at some additional data we collected and

117
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:20,399
published um around how those uh digital

118
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,199
data are being used when remote patient

119
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,720
monitoring um

120
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,400
uh is happening

121
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,360
really interestingly um when those 11 uh

122
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,199
when we're uh sort of leveraging that

123
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,440
data we found that the vast majority of

124
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,560
times

125
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,199
it wasn't that um clinical care was

126
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,720
actually taking advantage of the

127
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,520
continuous nature of those data streams

128
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,520
rather they were being referenced and

129
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,440
they were being used in exactly the same

130
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,000
way that we would treat a stock data

131
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,960
point

132
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,280
captured in the clinic

133
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,440
what this tells us is on the healthcare

134
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,600
side there is enormous potential but we

135
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,840
haven't yet harnessed the power of these

136
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,160
technologies through a redesign of the

137
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,400
clinical workflow flow through truly

138
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,080
monitoring patients outside of the

139
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,880
clinic during activities of daily living

140
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,720
we aren't tracking the monitoring to see

141
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,639
if there's a spike or a within patient

142
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,960
change that should trigger some outreach

143
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,720
that should trigger additional care

144
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,520
we're not there yet it's certainly um a

145
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,919
powerful way that these tools will

146
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,560
transform the way we think of healthcare

147
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,160
but it's important to realize where we

148
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,919
are today

149
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,720
so that's over on the um healthcare side

150
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,039
of the shop where are we in the sort of

151
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,039
clinical research side where are we

152
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:35,120
specifically in terms of medical product

153
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,400
development

154
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,039
um if we go back just a year and a half

155
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,160
in october 2019 my organization dime

156
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,080
launched a crowdsourced library of

157
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,240
digital endpoints being used in

158
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,080
industry-sponsored trials of new medical

159
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,000
products and we were absolutely

160
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,600
delighted to see that there were 12

161
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,639
sponsors

162
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,960
um who were sort of actively collecting

163
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,960
these measures and that 34 unique

164
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,639
endpoints were

165
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,639
being used to answer clinical questions

166
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:03,199
about uh new therapies

167
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:05,280
we were so excited in fact we went ahead

168
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,680
and we published an op-ed um in stat

169
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,280
news saying you know this is not the

170
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,520
stuff of the future this is here today

171
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,360
but when we actually look just 18 months

172
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,759
ahead the growth has been absolutely

173
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:18,000
astronomical what we can see is we've

174
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,880
gone from 12 to 62 sponsors relying on

175
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,120
these digital clinical measures to make

176
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,960
decisions about whether we take a drug

177
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,080
to market

178
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,039
we can see that over 50 so over half of

179
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:31,520
these um

180
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,479
measures are being used uh in critical

181
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,800
phases of drug development and we can

182
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,960
also see that the growth in the number

183
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,840
of measures themselves has gone from in

184
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,639
uh

185
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:45,520
from 34 up to 207

186
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,919
absolutely extraordinary growth not only

187
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:51,120
in the number of measures but also in um

188
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,319
sort of

189
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,400
the trust essentially by many many more

190
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,479
organizations to

191
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,479
rely on the data from these digital

192
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:00,319
clinical measures in their decision

193
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,240
making in their product development

194
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,800
pipeline in their r d

195
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,800
um if this data is interesting to you

196
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,639
this is all open source and you can

197
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,360
access these data on the dime website

198
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,880
these slides will be available and we'll

199
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,039
make sure you get all of the links

200
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,960
i do think it's worthwhile pausing for

201
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,120
one second though what's interesting as

202
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,759
you mine the database is um you'll see

203
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:24,240
that every single one of those 207

204
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,120
measures is unique and this while the

205
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,680
growth is impressive this does give me

206
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,720
pause

207
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,240
we've got to think about measuring

208
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,240
things that matter i don't think that

209
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,120
there are 207 unique measures of health

210
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,280
that are critically important

211
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,479
we see over 50 unique measures of sleep

212
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,960
certainly sleep is a complex um a

213
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,160
complex sort of uh domain of health it's

214
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,080
unlikely that there's just one measure

215
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,919
that will account for it perfectly in

216
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,160
all therapeutic areas but the idea that

217
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,000
there are 54 measures that warrant

218
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,639
development i have questions about the

219
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,400
same is true for physical activity i

220
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,400
think we've got over 70 measures of

221
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,120
physical activity in this library and i

222
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,360
think it's really important that we're

223
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,199
focused not only on our capability of

224
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,879
measuring health but actually making

225
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:14,319
sure that we are measuring things that

226
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,000
matter and we'll return to that in just

227
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,560
a little bit

228
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,039
and so you know jeslin and i talk about

229
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,360
this a little bit but you know

230
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,680
the reason that we're excited about sort

231
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,360
of the field of digital clinical

232
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,199
measurement generally is

233
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,440
we imagine because these measures

234
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,958
because our understanding of health can

235
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,799
be developed outside of the walls of the

236
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,640
clinic because it can be developed

237
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,760
during a patient's everyday life

238
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,679
we can imagine a future state of

239
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:44,240
healthcare where

240
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,839
healthcare is good because we keep

241
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:47,360
people healthy and we keep them out of

242
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,360
the doctors healthcare is no longer

243
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,920
measured by how well are we able to dive

244
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,000
in and add the assist once someone is

245
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,440
sick once they need to come to the

246
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,519
clinic or come to the hospital

247
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:58,880
and i wanted to give a couple of

248
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,839
examples just to underscore this so

249
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:03,920
first of all in current state if a

250
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,160
patient needs a bone marrow transplant

251
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,399
in the two weeks preceding that visit

252
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,160
they have to come into the clinic

253
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,959
roughly five times simply to have vitals

254
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,560
measured to make sure that they are

255
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,040
stable and healthy enough for surgery

256
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,120
there is absolutely nothing right now

257
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,279
technically stopping us from measuring

258
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:24,000
all of those vital signs with a high

259
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,399
degree of certainty while that patient

260
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,480
is at home without dragging them into a

261
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,240
clinic while they're immunosuppressed

262
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,920
without asking their care partner to

263
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,480
take more time off work taken and bring

264
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,640
them into the clinic without sort of

265
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,560
adding to the stress and the time and

266
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,839
the fatigue

267
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,839
that these continual clinic visits rely

268
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,000
on and to me that's actually something

269
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,160
that at some point it becomes unethical

270
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,200
to to to choose not to use those tools

271
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,959
to keep bringing that patient in for

272
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:53,760
fee-for-service lab visits as opposed to

273
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,680
simply monitoring their status at home

274
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,000
as they prepare for that surgery

275
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,760
um another example is in duchenne's

276
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,920
muscular dystrophy and for folks who

277
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,440
might not be familiar with the natural

278
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,000
history of duchenne's um it's

279
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,760
a pretty awful condition that affects

280
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,399
primarily boys and young men um the

281
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:12,800
natural history is diagnosis is

282
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,800
typically around seven years of age

283
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,480
unfortunately these boys are usually in

284
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,480
a wheelchair um

285
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,480
struggling to sort of walk independently

286
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,240
by the time that they're 13 and

287
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,079
unfortunately life expectancy is in the

288
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:25,440
early 20s

289
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,240
so

290
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,320
how are we currently measuring this we

291
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,360
use um the six minute walk test um that

292
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,440
systematically excludes 60 of the um

293
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,600
population of those boys and young men

294
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,279
from participating in any kind of

295
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:40,959
research that means that we aren't

296
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:43,600
developing medical products that target

297
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,519
those individuals and whether in

298
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,440
research or in care we aren't thinking

299
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,360
about

300
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,680
the pieces of their condition that maybe

301
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,200
matter a lot to these boys we're not

302
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,320
thinking about whether they can text

303
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,160
their friends play video games whether

304
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,680
they can feed themselves whether they

305
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,120
can do their homework whether they can

306
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,959
take themselves to the toilet their

307
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:02,399
dignity

308
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,480
we have the capabilities to measure that

309
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,160
using things like smart watches smart

310
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,160
rings and yet we still rely on the six

311
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,399
minute walk test and the last example

312
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:11,839
that i wanted to share to really

313
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:14,079
underscore why what jessalyn and i are

314
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:15,600
talking about today these digital

315
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,120
clinical measures of health are so

316
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,320
important

317
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,959
um parkinson's disease

318
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,959
unfortunately the number of people

319
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:24,800
affected around the world by parkinson's

320
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,519
is growing rapidly in the u.s most

321
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,360
people with parkinson's are diagnosed

322
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,560
incorrectly four or five times before

323
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,640
they get that correct diagnosis and then

324
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,800
once they are diagnosed due to the

325
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,560
maldistribution of specialist

326
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,800
neurologists and the patients who need

327
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,600
them 40 of parkinson's patients pass

328
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,640
away before they ever seen a neurologist

329
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,720
imagine the power of

330
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,920
a suite of uh sort of digital clinical

331
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,079
measures measuring things like tremor

332
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:56,399
freezing of gait measuring things like

333
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:57,440
um

334
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,320
uh cognitive decline measuring uh tenor

335
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,760
and toner voice

336
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,839
all of those data could be collected in

337
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:05,200
the home of the patient and then we

338
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,600
could use telehealth to connect those 40

339
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,079
of patients who never see a neurologist

340
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:11,360
to a specialist who can more

341
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,519
appropriately care for them it would

342
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,839
also allow us to develop a disease

343
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:17,760
modifying treatment which to date we've

344
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,920
had no luck doing that's why i think

345
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,680
this is so important that's why we have

346
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,680
to focus on those measures that matter

347
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,839
we can harness all of this data right

348
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:28,240
now those sort of continuously captured

349
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,440
currently invisible data points um using

350
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,079
uh using these tools

351
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:36,240
but what we have to do is make sure that

352
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,480
we are generating powerful meaningful

353
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,320
signal and not simply adding to the

354
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,519
noise

355
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,040
and to make sure we're doing that i'm

356
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,040
going to go ahead and stop sharing um

357
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,279
and jessica lynn who's lab absolute

358
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:50,399
experts in doing all of this work um

359
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:51,839
she will dive into some of the tools

360
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,600
techniques and science that they use to

361
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,720
make sure that these measures are

362
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,240
trustworthy

363
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,800
thanks so much jen um this was a a

364
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,480
perfect um tee up to what what we're

365
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,720
diving into next um

366
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,079
so i'm just gonna turn on um full screen

367
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,399
and hopefully you're seeing

368
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:13,680
no notes and just slides

369
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,639
perfect

370
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:15,519
great

371
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,920
all right um so

372
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,240
jen said it perfectly there is immense

373
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,839
potential for

374
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:24,720
these digital technologies that is

375
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,560
currently going untapped for the most

376
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,680
part um so in my lab we're called the

377
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,839
big ideas lab it actually stands for

378
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:32,959
something

379
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:34,880
which describes what it is that we do

380
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,839
which is biomedical informatics data

381
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:39,600
integrating data engineering and

382
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,959
analytics and with that we're trying to

383
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,920
take these existing technologies and

384
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,320
develop new infrastructure

385
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,800
to capitalize on that data for early

386
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,199
detection intervention and prevention of

387
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:54,880
disease

388
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,320
i don't think at this point in time we

389
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,839
really need a reminder about how

390
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:00,320
important this is we're living in a

391
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,199
global pandemic um and what's

392
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:05,600
fascinating is that there have been many

393
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,560
existing and ongoing efforts to try to

394
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,639
harness and leverage our existing

395
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:13,199
digital infrastructure to curb the

396
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:15,600
spread of cobit 19.

397
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,519
um there are a lot of different areas

398
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,440
that digital infrastructure can be

399
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,920
useful for so i just gave a few examples

400
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,440
here on screen

401
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,560
um where you know our current standard

402
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,600
of

403
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,720
uh care or standard of

404
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,440
exploring who might be infected is

405
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,560
contact tracing so getting on the phone

406
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,040
and calling up people and finding out

407
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,199
who they've been in contact with there

408
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:42,959
have been a lot of efforts to try to

409
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,880
automate this process because we all

410
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,160
carry smartphones those smartphones have

411
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,760
the ability to know when they're near

412
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:53,440
other smartphones or other um

413
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,160
technological systems and so this is one

414
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,399
area where we've we've realized the

415
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,360
power of the tools that we use passively

416
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,040
in our everyday lives

417
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,399
um there are many many other areas and

418
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:07,519
today

419
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,000
i will give an example of how we can use

420
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,519
wearables um and you know wearables can

421
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,920
be useful also in a variety of different

422
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:16,800
ways

423
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,079
um from the detection and monitoring of

424
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:23,279
infectious disease or chronic disease

425
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:26,079
all the way to the interventions to

426
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:28,480
deliver information at just the right

427
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,399
time to the right person

428
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,519
again there are so many opportunities to

429
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,759
apply this technology i'm going to focus

430
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:41,040
here in my talk on early detection but

431
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,920
you can imagine how jen mentioned the

432
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,000
possibilities for at-home monitoring for

433
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,079
a variety of different disease types we

434
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:49,600
can also expand this to public health

435
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,839
monitoring because if we have a huge

436
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:54,000
population already wearing devices or

437
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
carrying devices there's a ton of

438
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,680
information that's being passively

439
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,920
collected that could be leveraged to

440
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,240
realize where there are hot spots of

441
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,519
infection outbreaks before people are

442
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:07,120
exhibiting symptoms

443
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,240
um so again so many opportunities for

444
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,560
this technology so first i want to

445
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,959
explain a couple of terms um to dive

446
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:16,800
into some vocabulary when we talk about

447
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,600
digital biomarkers what we actually mean

448
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,279
um

449
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,440
first i like to back up and just revisit

450
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,639
this concept of a biomarker because many

451
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:29,519
folks who are working in this uh space

452
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,279
maybe don't have sort of the traditional

453
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:32,720
view of

454
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,639
what we think of a biomarker when we

455
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:36,800
think about a clinical use case so

456
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,959
biomarkers typically have diagnostic

457
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:41,680
capabilities and can also help us to

458
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,160
learn new things about physiology so you

459
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,079
might think about an existing clinical

460
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,880
biomarker like a blood glucose

461
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,519
measurement and that allows us to know

462
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:54,639
who may have diabetes or not how bad

463
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:57,519
that diabetes may be and if we give

464
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:59,680
somebody a treatment like metformin we

465
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,320
can track how well that treatment is

466
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,720
controlling the diabetes status

467
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,559
we also through

468
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,319
many new technologies allowing us to

469
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,520
measure large quantities of biomolecules

470
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,000
can discover new biomarkers that are

471
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,480
associated with disease and that allows

472
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,760
us to learn something new about

473
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,160
physiology so for example we might see

474
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,959
that there is a gene that is associated

475
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:27,119
with diabetes onset in young people that

476
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:29,840
is a biomarker that can then be used to

477
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,559
predict who might later come down with

478
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,000
diabetes

479
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,679
so we can extend this concept of a

480
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:38,240
biomarker to a digital biomarker which

481
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,320
means that rather than taking a physical

482
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,880
sample of blood or urine we're actually

483
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,360
taking a digital sample so we're

484
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,760
measuring something about physiology for

485
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,919
example heart rate from a vital sign

486
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:52,480
monitor that we can transform into an

487
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,400
indicator of health

488
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,400
so what that looks like on a very

489
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,799
pseudo-mathematical level is that we

490
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:02,400
have some uh outcomes and we develop

491
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,200
this function of these digital measures

492
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,360
and so these outcomes might be more of

493
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,960
our traditional

494
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,760
targets like blood glucose for example

495
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,320
or other clinical measurements it could

496
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,720
be survey data it could be illness

497
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,760
events

498
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,679
and the input data that we have here can

499
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:22,320
be anything that is collected digitally

500
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,880
from a smart watch a smartphone from

501
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,880
digital online traces

502
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,240
um you name it we have a ton of passive

503
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,039
sensors in our environments and that

504
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:35,120
information can tell us things about our

505
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,160
health

506
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,000
and so this isn't just a futuristic

507
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,240
vision there are a lot of digital

508
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,320
biomarkers being developed in practice

509
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,880
and this slide is a little bit old um so

510
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,360
it's just an example of what already

511
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,360
exists today

512
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,520
but we and others have been developing

513
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,280
digital biomarkers ranging from

514
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,280
infection detection

515
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,520
um all the way to chronic disease

516
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,160
detection and monitoring and you can see

517
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,160
that a lot of these digital biomarkers

518
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,320
have commonalities in the types of

519
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,640
sensors or measurements that they use

520
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,200
many surround heart rate and blood flow

521
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,280
many surround temperature measurements

522
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,080
or movement measurements and a lot of

523
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,760
the machine learning algorithms that we

524
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,360
apply to that data also have

525
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,320
commonalities um so we use

526
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,600
um

527
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,760
basic regression strategies we use

528
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,000
random forest neural networks and we

529
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,880
bring these common elements together to

530
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,960
develop these new predictors of health

531
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,640
and disease

532
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,039
so with that i want to pivot for a

533
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,200
moment and and introduce a little bit of

534
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,520
vocabulary that will help us to kind of

535
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:43,600
get through the rest of this talk um so

536
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,880
we worked extensively with um

537
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,320
jen and the team at dime and a team of

538
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,880
experts kind of from around the globe on

539
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,960
developing a common language that we

540
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,360
could use to describe these digital

541
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,400
clinical technologies that are enabling

542
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,000
us to capture these kinds of

543
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,760
measurements so

544
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,320
this idea of a biomet is essentially a

545
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,799
connected digital medicine tool and when

546
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:10,640
i say connected i mean that it has some

547
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,840
sort of wireless or even a wired

548
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,480
connection but it sends data from its

549
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,720
own location to somewhere else

550
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,200
and it processes data that is captured

551
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,440
by a mobile sensor and that there are

552
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,919
algorithms that are on board that

553
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:28,480
translate this these sensor measurements

554
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,240
into measures of behavioral or

555
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,480
physiologic function

556
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,360
so this sounds like a very very detailed

557
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,480
definition and it is because when we try

558
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,600
to think about these different

559
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,400
technologies that exist in our world

560
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,679
today it's hard to know what we classify

561
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:47,039
as a

562
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:50,720
um a wearable or a mobile device it's

563
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,039
hard to know what's regulated by the fda

564
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:56,080
versus what is categorized as a wellness

565
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,640
technology and so by introducing some of

566
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,280
this very specific language our hope is

567
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,520
that we can start to develop standards

568
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,440
surrounding these biomats which i'll

569
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,440
talk about in a second

570
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,120
um but one of the things that i like to

571
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,000
mention here is that a biomat is not

572
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,919
just what we see on the outside right

573
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:16,080
it's not just a fitbit or an apple watch

574
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,440
or a garmin device that's sitting on

575
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,600
someone's wrist but there's a whole lot

576
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,919
going on under the hood and i think for

577
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:24,240
this audience in particular it's really

578
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,559
important to recognize all of the data

579
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:28,960
transformations that can take place

580
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,880
on the device itself and then in the

581
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,080
process of transferring data from that

582
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,280
biomet to wherever that data is headed

583
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,679
um and so there are a lot of

584
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:41,360
considerations for

585
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,200
what is going on with that data are

586
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,200
there transformations that are taking

587
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,600
place are we compressing data are we

588
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,760
down sampling data

589
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,480
are there security and privacy concerns

590
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,840
at these onboard transformations or at

591
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,919
transformations or processing to push

592
00:21:57,919 --> 00:21:59,679
data to somewhere else

593
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:01,840
so there's a lot happening under the

594
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,720
hood

595
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,440
and in order to make accurate digital

596
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,080
biomarkers that can outlast the product

597
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,400
life cycle it's very important for us to

598
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,120
understand how each of these stages of

599
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,080
data processing affect the final digital

600
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,000
biomarker

601
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,679
so then that begs the question of how do

602
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:22,080
we evaluate these biomets and digital

603
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,200
biomarkers so if we see that

604
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,159
a smartwatch company is advertising

605
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:30,480
their heart rate detection algorithm as

606
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,000
clinically validated what does that mean

607
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,919
so one of the major challenges here is

608
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:38,159
that there really is not a standard

609
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:41,120
right now for um

610
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,039
for the terminology surrounding the

611
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:45,840
evaluation of these these biomets and

612
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,000
these digital biomarkers and so with the

613
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,159
dime society this is what we set out to

614
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:51,280
develop

615
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,559
um we again develop some of these more

616
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:56,720
systematic terminologies like the data

617
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,720
supply chain which i was showing you on

618
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,400
that previous slide

619
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,960
shows us how data flows through the

620
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,640
biomet

621
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,080
and then

622
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,760
these ideas of uh evaluation processes

623
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,200
so we have verification and validation

624
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,440
that we've organized into a really nice

625
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,400
framework that we refer to as b3 that

626
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,880
helps us to determine whether a

627
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,039
technology or a biomet is fit for

628
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:24,159
purpose

629
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:26,000
and so when we say fit for purpose we

630
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,120
mean that

631
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,000
the final

632
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,960
experiment or

633
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,520
implementation in the clinic fits the

634
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,720
way that

635
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,039
device or that biomet or that digital

636
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:42,080
biomarker was evaluated

637
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,960
so so what this v3 framework entails is

638
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,919
essentially a verification process an

639
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:50,000
analytic validation process and a

640
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,480
clinical validation process

641
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,120
the example we like to give in this case

642
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,000
is of an accelerometer where we might

643
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,520
have an accelerometer that we would

644
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,600
place on a shake plate in the lab and we

645
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,440
expect that the rpm that that shake

646
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,679
plate is set to is what the

647
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:08,480
accelerometer itself would measure

648
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,960
now ultimately our goal might be to use

649
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,799
this accelerometer to distinguish

650
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:15,039
between health and disease of a specific

651
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:16,159
disease

652
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:18,080
but in order to do that we want to know

653
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,159
what is the movement that we're trying

654
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:23,440
to capture so let's take ms for example

655
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,520
and say that we want to use step count

656
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,000
to capture who's likely to have ms and

657
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,200
who's not

658
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,720
well we want to make sure then that this

659
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,720
accelerometer can actually accurately

660
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,440
capture a step so what we do is we have

661
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,640
a gold standard evaluation process like

662
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,720
a person actually watching a video and

663
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,039
marking steps and we compare that to the

664
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:45,520
accelerometer and that's the analytic

665
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,520
validation it means that when we put the

666
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,600
accelerometer on a human being it

667
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,000
measures what we expect it to measure

668
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,600
and then finally we have that level of

669
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,320
clinical validation which is if we put

670
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:00,159
this technology on a patient are we able

671
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:02,000
to distinguish between a disease state

672
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,480
and a healthy state for example can this

673
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,400
accelerometer distinguish between people

674
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,520
who have ms and people who do not

675
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,679
and what's really tricky about this

676
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:14,159
process is that we know that these

677
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:16,880
technologies are not static so there are

678
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,960
firmware updates there are hardware

679
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,880
updates there are new generations of

680
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,840
devices coming out constantly and so how

681
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,760
can we ensure that this

682
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,159
v3 framework is followed for all of

683
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:29,760
these different iterations of these

684
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,960
devices

685
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,279
and so really the take home message here

686
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:35,279
is that

687
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:37,919
these steps need to be redone when any

688
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:40,080
change is made to the biometric

689
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,559
monitoring technology and so if there

690
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:44,400
are changes to hardware if there are

691
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,480
changes to firmware which often occur

692
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,039
over air and many people don't know

693
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:52,240
about them that changes the data and so

694
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,480
it's very very important that that gets

695
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,919
taken into consideration when any of

696
00:25:57,919 --> 00:25:59,440
these

697
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,480
these

698
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,480
biomets are being employed in practice

699
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,919
so that we know that they're fit for

700
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:05,840
purpose

701
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,159
so i want to switch gears for a moment

702
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:10,159
and talk about an implementation of a

703
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:11,919
digital biomarker so that we can see an

704
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:14,159
example of how this would actually be

705
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:16,000
useful um

706
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,320
so there was a lot of press around this

707
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,559
um sort of first

708
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:23,360
example of how we might be able to use

709
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,360
wearables to detect illness before a

710
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,960
person themselves might know that

711
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,320
they're sick

712
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,640
um so i always give the spoiler alert

713
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,400
before i actually explain the details of

714
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,960
what we did and so this was work that i

715
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,520
did alongside mike snyder

716
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,760
and his team at stanford

717
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,880
um where we um

718
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,080
collected a lot of data from a cohort of

719
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,919
people there were about a hundred

720
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:50,720
individuals wearing these smart watches

721
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,559
for

722
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:53,600
between

723
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,600
three and five years

724
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,600
um this was an interesting study because

725
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,000
a proportion of this population was

726
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,640
pre-diabetic um that's not what i'm

727
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,480
going to be talking about today today

728
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,559
i'm talking about infection detection

729
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:08,400
but that's initially why this study was

730
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,440
launched

731
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,480
um and so there were samples that were

732
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,240
given from these folks in the lab um

733
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,960
four times per year and then we also had

734
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,000
people come in to give samples when they

735
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,559
had anything kind of anomalous happen in

736
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,640
their lives so viral infections

737
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,279
stressful events dietary changes and so

738
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:30,880
what we can do with this is we can

739
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,640
capture what it looks like on a

740
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,679
biomolecular level to see health and to

741
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:37,360
see disease

742
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,919
so this was the setup for this study

743
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:41,600
where we developed these digital

744
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,559
biomarkers of infection

745
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:45,279
so

746
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:47,200
what i'm showing here is kind of just an

747
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,360
overview of what that data looks like we

748
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:52,240
have data from 43 people who are wearing

749
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,799
this intel basis watch it's measuring

750
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:56,720
three different things heart rate

751
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,200
temperature and accelerometry and you

752
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,799
can see here

753
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:03,520
that um showing in blue the skin

754
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,440
temperature data and then in these red

755
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,760
circles the heart rate data

756
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,520
these black squares here are showing the

757
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,600
number of days monitored

758
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,919
and so what you can immediately see is

759
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:15,600
that there's a big difference in the

760
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,520
variation between the skin temperature

761
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,240
measures and the heart rate measures

762
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,919
this makes a lot of sense because we

763
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:24,159
know that temperature cannot vary that

764
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:26,399
much and still sustain life

765
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:28,480
but heart rate we know can actually vary

766
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,640
dramatically between different people

767
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,279
and within a particular person

768
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:34,960
so this becomes challenging when we

769
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,440
think about how we can detect anomalies

770
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,039
within an individual

771
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:41,919
for example if we have two people let's

772
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:44,720
take this person here and this person

773
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,520
here that have very similar

774
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,520
resting heart rates

775
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,919
a measurement that's out here

776
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:54,399
for this person would be very anomalous

777
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:57,039
it does not fit within their

778
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:00,480
uh their sort of um confidence interval

779
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,279
of of their data whereas for this person

780
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:05,360
it would be very normal because it fits

781
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,039
within their typical

782
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:09,440
uh variation of their own body

783
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,399
so when we're developing these anomaly

784
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:14,559
detection algorithms it's very important

785
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:16,880
that we have a personalized look at this

786
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,880
and i can show this even a step further

787
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,360
if we look at some of the circadian

788
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,960
changes that occur

789
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,200
um with heart rate which i'm showing

790
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,080
here in pink or skin temperature which

791
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,320
i'm showing here in blue that at night

792
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,919
time we know when people are sleeping

793
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:33,840
their heart rate tends to dip down their

794
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,159
skin temperature tends to increase but

795
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:38,240
again this is true to different extents

796
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,159
for different people and even for some

797
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:42,880
people the opposite is true so it's

798
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,480
really important that when we're trying

799
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,640
to detect something that's abnormal in

800
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,720
an individual we know what normal looks

801
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,520
like for that particular person

802
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,840
so all of this is leading up to how do

803
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,240
we detect an infection in a person using

804
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,720
just smartwatch data

805
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,720
so the method that we developed here is

806
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,720
called the change of heart method and

807
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,039
the idea is that we have

808
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:06,720
um

809
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,200
outlier periods of time that we want to

810
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,200
try to detect from an individual

811
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,120
baseline so

812
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,039
the algorithm that we developed here

813
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:16,720
essentially goes based off of the

814
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,039
individual mean and standard deviation

815
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:20,720
and you can imagine that we could have

816
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,520
sliding windows where we take a a

817
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,120
sliding mean or a sliding standard

818
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:28,000
deviation and what we're looking for

819
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,640
are measurements that fall way outside

820
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,039
of what we deem to be normal

821
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:34,799
what's tricky about this is with a

822
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:36,640
smartwatch that measures one measurement

823
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,520
per second every day we get 86

824
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:42,640
400 measurements per sensor per day

825
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,399
the likelihood of any one of those

826
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:46,320
measurements falling well outside of the

827
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,080
norm is pretty high

828
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,799
um that's due to miss wear that's due to

829
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:52,799
all sorts of things that can happen and

830
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:54,480
so what we want to do instead is figure

831
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,640
out the proportion of measurements that

832
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,720
are falling outside of the norm so that

833
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,960
we're smoothing over these sort of

834
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,840
outlying events that are not due to a

835
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,080
change in physiology and so that's what

836
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,519
these the size of these circles is

837
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:09,039
showing essentially the size of this

838
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:10,559
circle is showing

839
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:13,360
how uh much the

840
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,039
the the proportion of measurements is

841
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,720
deviating from the baseline for that

842
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,679
particular person on that day

843
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:22,480
so employing this change of heart method

844
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,360
we were able to show in this this data

845
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,760
set from this ipod study at stanford

846
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:31,120
that um we were able to detect infection

847
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,039
in all of the participants where

848
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:35,120
infection occurred

849
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,360
what's tricky about this is that this

850
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:40,720
was a sort of real life study where

851
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,960
people were getting sick naturally and

852
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,440
so we didn't have an intervention where

853
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,840
people were actually infected

854
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,159
and and we kind of had to rely on what

855
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:52,640
naturally happens in the environment

856
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:56,000
um but we were able to develop these

857
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
these outlier detection algorithms that

858
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,760
did indicate when people had some sort

859
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,320
of influenza-like illness

860
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,559
and the way that this worked was that we

861
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:07,200
have these individual baselines based on

862
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,519
that we develop these digital biomarkers

863
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:11,360
and that leads us to this early

864
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,120
identification of acute and chronic

865
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,399
illness

866
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:16,799
so there's obviously a situation now

867
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:19,039
where there are a lot of people getting

868
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:20,159
sick

869
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:22,960
unfortunately we have a huge widespread

870
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,799
respiratory infection

871
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:27,919
um that is enabling us to to really see

872
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:30,240
in real time if we can detect these

873
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,159
signatures of infection from smart

874
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:34,080
watches alone and i'm showing here on

875
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,919
the screen just a sampling of studies

876
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:38,480
one of them is run by my group at duke

877
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,600
um cove identify but there are many

878
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,360
other studies that are going on in this

879
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,519
space trying to understand whether we

880
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:47,760
can actually detect infection before

881
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,320
people themselves know that they're sick

882
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,480
um and the idea there is that if you can

883
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,000
tell somebody they're sick even if

884
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,559
they're asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic

885
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:58,399
you can prevent them from going out and

886
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:01,600
spreading the virus so that is the goal

887
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,679
of this infection detection digital

888
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:05,919
biomarker work

889
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:07,600
all right so with the last couple

890
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,559
minutes here i want to talk about uh the

891
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:12,640
goal of digital biomarker discovery some

892
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,480
of the open source methods that we're

893
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:17,039
working on in this space and where all

894
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:19,120
of this can take us

895
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,919
um so so with digital biomarker

896
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:24,480
discovery really our goal is to extract

897
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,720
useful information and knowledge from

898
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,600
large volumes of biomet data in order to

899
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,480
improve

900
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,720
medical decision making or provide

901
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,360
insights for health decisions

902
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,760
and so some of the specific questions

903
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:40,159
that my group is looking at are can we

904
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:42,559
develop digital biomarkers to detect or

905
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:43,679
predict

906
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:45,919
improvements from sleep or exercise

907
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:49,120
pre-diabetes prior to symptoms

908
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,360
issues around infection how contagious a

909
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,360
person is or how susceptible they are to

910
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,679
contracting illness which becomes very

911
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:57,519
important if we think about sending out

912
00:33:57,519 --> 00:33:59,120
warfighters into

913
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,600
a field setting so so knowing different

914
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,240
baseline physiology is really useful

915
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,080
we also are looking at circadian

916
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,159
destruction and shift workers and risk

917
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:09,839
of preterm birth and other women's

918
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,199
health issues

919
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:12,639
so what's interesting about this if we

920
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:15,119
think back to kind of the the beginning

921
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:17,520
uh slide that i mentioned where we are

922
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,800
developing these different digital

923
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,119
biomarkers a lot of these are using very

924
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:23,760
similar sensors and very similar machine

925
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,679
learning methods so there's a lot of

926
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:27,839
commonalities amongst these digital

927
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:30,719
biomarkers that we can capitalize on to

928
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,879
make the downstream process easier and

929
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:35,040
more standardized and for those of you

930
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,639
who have worked in the bioinformatics

931
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:39,199
room before potentially in genomics this

932
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:41,918
might feel reminiscent because a lot of

933
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:44,079
this is akin to the early days of

934
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:46,639
genomics where there there were a lot of

935
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:48,800
common methodologies being developed in

936
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,960
parallel and there was a realization

937
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:51,918
that

938
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:53,199
groups could actually come together and

939
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:55,280
do a better job and so we've been

940
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,359
working on this initiative called the

941
00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:00,000
dbdp or the digital biomarker discovery

942
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,040
pipeline

943
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:04,320
which is an online environment that

944
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,200
aggregates open source software

945
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,280
algorithms data sets

946
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,599
and is working to develop

947
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:13,760
best practices for

948
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,920
developing new digital biomarkers and

949
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,560
evaluating them and so i'm just going to

950
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,920
throw this out there that you can go to

951
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,560
dbdp.org

952
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,160
and you can take a look this is actually

953
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,160
an older snapshot but

954
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,640
since since the snapshot we've added

955
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,040
more modules and actually our hope is

956
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,119
that the community continues to come

957
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:35,280
together and contributes more and more

958
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,839
modules to the dbdp

959
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:40,960
um right now this does require a level

960
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,359
of coding experience because all of the

961
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:45,680
digital biomarkers are written as code

962
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,000
modules on github but we do have some

963
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
really great documentation and resources

964
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,440
for people who are

965
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,800
new to

966
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,119
wearables or biomats or digital health

967
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:57,359
and wanna figure out where to get

968
00:35:57,359 --> 00:35:59,760
started um i highly recommend checking

969
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,640
out the user guide and and some of our

970
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:06,079
sort of um getting started guides to

971
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:09,040
understand where to begin and and how to

972
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:12,480
become hopefully a long-term contributor

973
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,160
one of the other plugs that i'll push

974
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,960
here is as jen mentioned um there's a

975
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,599
huge need for work in privacy and

976
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:20,960
security

977
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,960
and that is an area where we really have

978
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,440
not done a lot and could really envision

979
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,520
some beautiful contributions

980
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,480
so

981
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,800
finally you know looking to the future

982
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,040
there's there are ever expanding options

983
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,359
of measurement for biomats um we have

984
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:38,400
smart textiles we have smart inc

985
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,359
um the ability to collect information

986
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:43,520
about our physiology and behaviors is

987
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,839
only going to increase as time goes on

988
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:48,320
so the hope is that this data gets used

989
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:51,200
for these four purposes um and and

990
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,599
nothing nefarious which is hopefully

991
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:57,119
what everyone here is working to ensure

992
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:58,960
but leading to patient empowerment

993
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,960
precision therapies just-in-time

994
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,720
interventions and improved access to

995
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,680
care

996
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:06,079
so i'll pop this last slide on here just

997
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:08,320
to say thanks to lots of folks who

998
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,680
contributed to some of the work that i

999
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,200
showed today

1000
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,839
and i will turn it back over to jen

1001
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:17,040
for a nice wrap-up

1002
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:24,000
i had to do it at some point um i was

1003
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,160
gonna say that was terrific and

1004
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,760
um i'm lucky enough to sort of see your

1005
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,440
work up close often but to see it sort

1006
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,040
of presented and see the body of work

1007
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,520
you've done is absolutely phenomenal let

1008
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,440
me go ahead and

1009
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,280
as you said round us out with a few

1010
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,240
thoughts

1011
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,599
um

1012
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:41,680
what you showed us jessalyn was that you

1013
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,760
know these technologies the measurement

1014
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,960
capabilities using digital tools are

1015
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,440
um not only extraordinary but they're

1016
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,560
actually

1017
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,800
largely ready for prime time the science

1018
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,240
is there

1019
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:57,040
but i

1020
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,040
i think this place is at a place as us

1021
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,800
at a crossroads right

1022
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,800
how now we have these new tools in the

1023
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,119
toolbox now we have these capabilities

1024
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:06,880
how do we ensure that we actually use

1025
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,520
them to improve individuals care right

1026
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:13,200
do that um sort of precision medicine um

1027
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,280
and not violate individuals privacy how

1028
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,640
do we make sure that we're taking a

1029
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,320
data-driven approach to public health

1030
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,320
just like you showed us jessalyn and

1031
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,440
make sure that we're not just

1032
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,440
facilitating harmful surveillance how do

1033
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,480
we make sure that we use these tools

1034
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:29,280
that can extend by place that can extend

1035
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,520
by capabilities that can connect

1036
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,440
clinicians and experts with patients

1037
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,440
wherever they are people during their

1038
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,680
daily lives and make sure that we use

1039
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,359
that to improve access and improve

1040
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:40,079
health

1041
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:42,400
equity and not just um sort of

1042
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,520
exacerbate existing disparities

1043
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:48,960
along the digital divide

1044
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,320
and i think there are a few issues that

1045
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,839
it's really important that we start to

1046
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:56,000
address um some questions that we're

1047
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,320
asking ourselves here at dime um that i

1048
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,320
want to share with folks is you know

1049
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,000
should we be thinking about broadband

1050
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,400
access as a social determinant of health

1051
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,640
we can see here a snapshot from the um

1052
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,520
dartmouth atlas of help where you health

1053
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,680
where you see red health is typically

1054
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,920
better and where you see dark blue over

1055
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,079
here we can see that broadband access is

1056
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:17,359
much higher

1057
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:19,440
these two areas correlate so if all we

1058
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,200
do is roll these tools out to folks

1059
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,720
where the technology infrastructure

1060
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,160
already exists

1061
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,400
we're simply helping the privileged few

1062
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,880
rather than improving care for all

1063
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,480
and this is something that extends well

1064
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:33,680
beyond um sort of just broadband access

1065
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,440
we have to think about other issues of

1066
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,839
health equity digital literacy and other

1067
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:39,680
social determinants of health and

1068
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,760
there's a really terrific paper

1069
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:42,640
that was published through a

1070
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,480
collaboration between the ohio state

1071
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,560
university and the national digital

1072
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,800
inclusion alliance that i would highly

1073
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,880
encourage everyone to take a look at the

1074
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,480
link is here and it's absolutely

1075
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,839
terrific

1076
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:55,520
in our own work here at diamond

1077
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,440
specifically through our collaborative

1078
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,400
community data cc we're exploring the

1079
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,040
idea of a new term we're thinking more

1080
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,720
about less about sort of health

1081
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:07,200
disparities it seems like a statement of

1082
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,280
fact and trying to take us towards a

1083
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,680
more action-oriented language let's

1084
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:14,160
think more about digital inclusion let's

1085
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,920
think you know and how that applies in

1086
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,079
digital health measurement we would say

1087
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:19,680
that it refers to activities and

1088
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,000
practice throughout product development

1089
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,520
deployment evaluation and

1090
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:26,720
commercialization that are necessary not

1091
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,599
optional but necessary to respond to the

1092
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:31,839
needs of all populations

1093
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:33,680
and to enable all individuals

1094
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,760
communities to benefit from these

1095
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:38,000
digital health measures again go back to

1096
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,599
the power of these technologies that

1097
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:42,079
jessalyn shared and think about how we

1098
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:44,720
can um sort of deploy them

1099
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:47,359
for everyone

1100
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:49,280
data rights are increasingly important

1101
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,520
we have to build trust in the health

1102
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,200
data ecosystem and there's another

1103
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,800
really terrific paper here around

1104
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,280
privacy protections that encourage the

1105
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,920
use of health relevant digital data

1106
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,359
right and i think that's the other piece

1107
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:04,160
too we are awash with data right now not

1108
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:06,160
only are we making sure that these data

1109
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,240
are being used to help not harm us how

1110
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,839
are we making sure that we're not just

1111
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:12,800
adding to the noise

1112
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,880
there's a concept and actually we spoke

1113
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,160
a little bit about this last year with

1114
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,000
my colleague dina mendelson you know

1115
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,640
said if this idea of redefining patient

1116
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,880
safety in the digital era and this is

1117
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,240
something we've considered we've

1118
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,880
continued to explore here at dime the

1119
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,640
definition of patient safety i actually

1120
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,319
think is excellent

1121
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:32,079
but there are new kinds of harm there

1122
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:34,480
are new kinds of risks and the

1123
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,560
definition of safety is contingent on

1124
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,400
sort of current knowledge

1125
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,400
of resources available and the context

1126
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,640
in which care is delivered well current

1127
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,720
knowledge is limited in this

1128
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:47,200
interdisciplinary field clinicians

1129
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,839
knowledge of cyber security for example

1130
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:52,079
is limited we're not collaborating well

1131
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:53,599
enough yet there isn't sufficient

1132
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:55,280
knowledge sharing we need to do much

1133
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,520
better at knowledge exchange in forums

1134
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:00,000
like this um we need to think about all

1135
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
of the different resources available

1136
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,920
jessalyn mentioned some we produce a lot

1137
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:06,079
of dime but there's a lot of silos of

1138
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:08,480
resources unfortunately we also need to

1139
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,640
think about new context of care care

1140
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,480
isn't always delivered in the clinic

1141
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,480
anymore and that means the data isn't

1142
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,480
always confined to a locked filing

1143
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,400
cabinet in the clinic either there are

1144
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,319
all sorts of harms that now exist and we

1145
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:21,839
want to make sure that we reap all of

1146
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:23,440
the benefits of digital clinical

1147
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:26,560
measures and limit those harms as far as

1148
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,319
possible

1149
00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:30,000
there are other challenges around the

1150
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,520
sort of um

1151
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,440
lack of standardization the challenges

1152
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:36,240
around integrating um these data into

1153
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,920
the traditional clinical data sets

1154
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:40,880
whether that's an edc an electronic data

1155
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,960
capture system on the research side or

1156
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,240
whether that's the electronic health

1157
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:46,880
record on the care side

1158
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,400
and perhaps one of the most important

1159
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,920
things and something we focus on a lot

1160
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,640
at dime is we have to build the digital

1161
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:55,119
workforce necessary to actually support

1162
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:57,280
the field we have to think about this

1163
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,119
sort of big tent thinking to make sure

1164
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:00,319
we have

1165
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:02,640
all of the technical skills necessary

1166
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,240
alongside the traditional clinical

1167
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:06,640
competencies and importantly be making

1168
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,560
sure that we're now attentive to the

1169
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,560
patients we're all here to serve

1170
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:12,400
this emerging um sort of group of

1171
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,560
powerful citizen scientists and

1172
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:16,319
ethicists are pretty critically

1173
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:18,480
important in all of this work

1174
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,319
we need to think about how we're

1175
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:22,000
actually training the next generation

1176
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
intentionally we can't hope is not a

1177
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,760
strategy we really need to start

1178
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:26,800
upstream

1179
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,720
with the future workforce and we need to

1180
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,800
do some re-scaling retooling of the

1181
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,480
current workforce

1182
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,720
and perhaps you know most importantly as

1183
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:36,160
we think about making sure we're

1184
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:38,000
ameliorating as far as possible health

1185
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,400
disparities we have to have a commitment

1186
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,240
to diversity in this workforce that goes

1187
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:44,560
beyond just lip service on the technical

1188
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,160
side of the shop on the clinical side of

1189
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,760
the shop these workforces are not

1190
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,599
terribly representative of the patients

1191
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:51,920
we serve right now we have to make sure

1192
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,160
as we combine them we improve that not

1193
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:56,400
exacerbate um there's a sort of lack of

1194
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,800
representation in the experts who are

1195
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,640
working to develop digital health as a

1196
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:02,960
field

1197
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:05,440
i wanted to talk a little bit and the

1198
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,280
last piece of data i'll present was from

1199
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:09,760
an enormous collaboration that jessalyn

1200
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,359
and the lab were part of and that we

1201
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:13,520
were lucky enough to host the digital

1202
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:16,240
clinical measures playbook um really

1203
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:19,359
this is the essential guide for um sort

1204
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:22,560
of the uh development and successful

1205
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,480
development and deployment of digital

1206
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:27,119
clinical measures across public health

1207
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:29,760
across clinical care and across research

1208
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:32,560
um and

1209
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:35,280
what we sort of uh what we came up with

1210
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:38,079
was a several hundred side playbook that

1211
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:40,560
gets into every facet of thinking about

1212
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:43,040
these measures from the sort of uh sort

1213
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:45,680
of the v3 process that just uh jessalyn

1214
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,680
mentioned um all the way through to the

1215
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:50,240
ethical considerations and a variety of

1216
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:52,240
different uh operational and technical

1217
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:54,560
issues in between we really dive into

1218
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:55,760
this

1219
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:58,520
there are um also

1220
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:01,839
110 i believe action-oriented tools from

1221
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:03,520
educational curricula all the way

1222
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:05,119
through to checklists and toolkits that

1223
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:07,440
i encourage you to take a look at

1224
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:09,440
and we also did some work really

1225
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,599
thinking about the key archetypes the

1226
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:13,520
key experts who need to be involved in

1227
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:16,079
this process for it to be successful

1228
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:18,079
we recognize that our academic

1229
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:20,160
colleagues were a particularly important

1230
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:21,599
cohort

1231
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:23,440
in advancing the field of digital

1232
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:25,359
clinical measures and making sure that

1233
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:27,200
not only as we develop them but we

1234
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,359
deploy them we can be confident that

1235
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:31,200
they are trustworthy

1236
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,440
um and so really there's some

1237
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:35,359
fascinating data that i want to share in

1238
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:37,520
closing this is data extracted from a

1239
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:41,280
pre-print um currently um in a uh

1240
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,040
gemma the journal of medical internet

1241
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:46,160
research um and what you can see is the

1242
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,079
kind of work that jessalyn discussed

1243
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:49,839
around verification analytical

1244
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:52,000
validation clinical validation that sort

1245
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,280
of um that piece of the tech stack

1246
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:57,119
they're doing great work there

1247
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:58,720
importantly we're doing the work to make

1248
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:00,079
sure that we're measuring things that

1249
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:02,560
matter we're starting to get

1250
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,319
sophisticated around how we

1251
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:05,680
operationally

1252
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:07,359
sort of deploy these

1253
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:09,599
but there are some frankly alarming gaps

1254
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:12,560
when we look at the last two years

1255
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:14,480
of published literature

1256
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,960
by academic researchers

1257
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:19,760
as we can tie um security research

1258
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:21,440
specifically to digital clinical

1259
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:23,760
measures there was one study there was

1260
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:26,160
only one published study really diving

1261
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:27,599
into issues of data rights and

1262
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:30,160
governance there was not a single paper

1263
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:31,520
examining

1264
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,599
their ethics of advancing these digital

1265
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:36,640
clinical measures we also saw a death of

1266
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:38,880
work trying to establish standards there

1267
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,480
was limited work ensuring that these

1268
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:42,560
things are economically feasible

1269
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,079
and when we think about the operations

1270
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:46,480
of deploying this in care vis-a-vis

1271
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:49,119
research we saw that that was a lagging

1272
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:50,960
sort of indicator too and if we think

1273
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:52,720
back to how these measures are being

1274
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:54,079
used in care right now without

1275
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:56,640
reorganizing the workflow that shouldn't

1276
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:59,280
be terribly surprising

1277
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:01,440
and the last slide um before we close

1278
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:03,119
out and i think that this gives us a

1279
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:05,280
real call to action here is how are

1280
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,960
these studies that are published how is

1281
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:08,720
this research in the field of digital

1282
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:10,880
clinical measures being funded

1283
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:12,400
we can see that

1284
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,560
there is robust government funding most

1285
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:16,480
of it is going into operations of

1286
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:18,800
research but we can see that government

1287
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:22,240
funding is supporting these areas of v3

1288
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:24,800
and identifying measures that matter

1289
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,240
however

1290
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:27,839
they are not supporting them in quite

1291
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:29,680
the same way as we see other areas of

1292
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,599
sort of medical research we're relying

1293
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:34,240
heavily on independent foundations and

1294
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:36,960
also on the hard work of academic

1295
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:39,040
colleagues and labs like jessalyn to

1296
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:40,720
find the resources internally from

1297
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:43,599
investigative funds to do this work

1298
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:46,160
we can see that 100 of the security

1299
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:47,680
research is government funded but when

1300
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:49,839
that's in one study that's not enough

1301
00:47:49,839 --> 00:47:52,559
it's critically important that we see

1302
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:55,599
funding agencies start to identify

1303
00:47:55,599 --> 00:47:58,079
how important it is that we move to plug

1304
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:01,280
this gap quickly we need to start having

1305
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:03,119
requests for applications for grant

1306
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:05,599
funding that address security that

1307
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:07,280
address data rights and governance and

1308
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:09,359
that address ethics and until we get to

1309
00:48:09,359 --> 00:48:11,920
that point the promise of this field to

1310
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:13,839
deliver on everything it can bring to

1311
00:48:13,839 --> 00:48:15,920
improve health and health equity is

1312
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:18,559
going to be limited by these risks

1313
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:20,640
so with that that's why jail and i have

1314
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:22,400
been so excited to come and join you

1315
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,480
today this field is absolutely mission

1316
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:27,200
critical to take all of this to scale so

1317
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:29,200
with that i'll stop sharing i'm about to

1318
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:31,359
get the sun right in my eyes i can see

1319
00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:33,359
it setting it's i'm about to go blind so

1320
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:35,520
the timing is perfect thank you so much

1321
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:37,200
for having us jessalyn would you like to

1322
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:39,440
close out with any final remarks

1323
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:42,480
oh this was great um thank you for this

1324
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:44,480
community and hopefully this inspired

1325
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:47,359
some um some interest in this work

1326
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:49,920
because there's a lot that's needed

1327
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:51,119
thanks

1328
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:54,119
fantastic
