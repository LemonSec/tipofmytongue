1
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,759
welcome everyone to

2
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:08,240
leveraging sbom software build materials

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,920
for ics security

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,840
uh looking forward to sharing some of

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,840
this uh material and content with you

6
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:14,240
guys

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,920
i appreciate everyone taking some time

8
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,240
out of their day um during defcon and

9
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,640
this virtualized um

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,080
you know experience that we're all going

11
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,160
through together uh and i i just really

12
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,119
appreciate you guys

13
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:28,840
attending this so kind of jump into

14
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,960
things

15
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,880
first off just by way of introduction my

16
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,719
name is tom pace i'm the co-founder

17
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:37,280
and ceo of netris uh we are a startup

18
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,440
that is focused on providing visibility

19
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,160
to a

20
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,640
class of devices that has historically

21
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,680
not had

22
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,719
very good visibility within them so

23
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:47,520
things like

24
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,800
iot ics networking devices

25
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,120
embedded systems medical devices things

26
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,160
of that nature

27
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,760
so prior to that i was the global vice

28
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,120
president of enterprise solutions at

29
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,079
silence where

30
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,239
i traveled the world basically helping

31
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:04,319
clients uh solve problems related to

32
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,159
product services threat research

33
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:09,520
all manner of things um during that time

34
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,040
also i handled

35
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,119
a ton of incident response engagements

36
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:14,400
um specifically

37
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,600
uh a many regarding ransomware so

38
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,840
that that garnered me a bunch of

39
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,439
attention and i ended up getting uh

40
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:22,799
interviewed on 60 minutes for some of

41
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:23,920
the work that i did there which was a

42
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,640
really cool

43
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,720
and fun experience prior to that i

44
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,479
worked at the department of energy doing

45
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:30,159
industrial control system security

46
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,439
and other security engineering things um

47
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,119
and then uh before that i worked in a

48
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:37,280
bank and then prior to that i was in the

49
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,799
marine corps where i spent most of my

50
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,079
time in the middle east

51
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,640
doing uh not cyber security things

52
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,520
essentially

53
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,439
so i've also done a bunch of things at

54
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,200
rsa black hat um

55
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,560
other other conferences of the like

56
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,439
so uh speaking of uh my time in iraq

57
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:54,240
actually

58
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,719
um it's always fun to share a picture of

59
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:59,360
me and chuck norris over there in 2007

60
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,240
so uh it wasn't wasn't all so bad it's a

61
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:02,799
much

62
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:05,759
much younger and youthful looking

63
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,479
version of myself so

64
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,239
from an agenda perspective what is a

65
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:12,000
software build materials uh then we'll

66
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,440
go into

67
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,000
uh market trends that are driving uh

68
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,080
software build materials like why now uh

69
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,440
why is it important now

70
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,959
um what what things have happened that

71
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,040
are driving this adoption

72
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,879
in need device risks um associated with

73
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,840
not having a software bill materials or

74
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,440
risks that could be reduced by having

75
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,400
one

76
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,640
attacks that that have occurred and

77
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,680
attack types

78
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,840
and then we'll move into identifying and

79
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,120
discussing

80
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,959
the value proposition the use cases that

81
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:42,720
software bill materials can

82
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,120
uh can provide how do we generate and

83
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,560
consume an s bomb

84
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,959
uh the the the challenges associated

85
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:49,680
with such

86
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,879
and then what do i do once i have one so

87
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,959
to jump into it a software build

88
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:56,400
materials is basically a

89
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,080
complete formally structured list of

90
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,640
components libraries modules that

91
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,800
are required to build which essentially

92
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,159
would mean compile and link a given

93
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:05,440
piece of software

94
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,280
in the various supply chain uh

95
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,720
relationships between them

96
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,080
and so in the bottom left here you can

97
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,480
see the relationships

98
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,760
um of the acme application uh where you

99
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,680
basically have you know bingo buffer or

100
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,879
bob's browser

101
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,239
carol's compression engine things like

102
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,319
that this is an example

103
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,519
that is used by the ntia

104
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:27,599
which is a part of the department of

105
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,040
commerce that has really been

106
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:29,920
spearheading

107
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,519
the software bill of materials working

108
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:33,519
group of which uh i've been a member for

109
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:34,319
roughly

110
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,560
eight months or so they're doing amazing

111
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,280
work and it's a a really exciting thing

112
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,879
um that they that they've done there and

113
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,159
what they've done for the community in

114
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:42,720
general

115
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,360
so uh on the right-hand side here you

116
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,720
see

117
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,400
um basically a an adaptation of a um

118
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,360
an ingredients label uh for for food

119
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:53,680
that

120
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,239
that could could be modeled uh for

121
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:57,040
software

122
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,599
and so you know an example here would be

123
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,599
uh imagine a scenario where you have a

124
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:02,560
peanut allergy

125
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,720
as an example and you go into a bakery

126
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,640
and basically ask the baker hey

127
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,760
uh i have this severe peanut allergy

128
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,239
i need to know if any of this cake that

129
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:13,519
i want to buy or

130
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,599
cookies or whatever have been made

131
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:16,959
within the vicinity of peanuts or

132
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:17,839
something like that because you have

133
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,199
like a very intense allergy

134
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,880
and then basically not being able to

135
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,720
tell you so you have

136
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,880
you now have to basically make the

137
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,720
decision on whether or not you're going

138
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,080
to accept the risk

139
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,720
of purchasing this this baked good and

140
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,360
putting your

141
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,440
your health at risk well that's

142
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,280
essentially the state of affairs that we

143
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,000
are in

144
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,120
uh from a software perspective now all

145
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,080
companies aren't

146
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,240
don't have that uh problem to that

147
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,120
extent but

148
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,759
generally speaking uh software build

149
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,520
materials are not available for

150
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,560
uh or distributed to the great for the

151
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,160
great majority of software that is

152
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,639
that is created so uh and this provides

153
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:55,840
a bunch of problems which we'll kind of

154
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,199
dive into

155
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,800
so these are things that we do have a

156
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,400
bill of materials for

157
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,639
food obviously nutrition labels

158
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:03,840
ingredients

159
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,880
um you know various

160
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,440
sizes and dosages of different things uh

161
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,400
hardware

162
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,840
so this these are the this is the bill

163
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,919
of materials for a red wagon

164
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,680
um so it has all the components parts

165
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,520
required and then also

166
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,600
chemicals now this is this is less of a

167
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,759
specific list of ingredients for

168
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,360
chemicals but it is

169
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,720
a hey here are the things that you need

170
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,680
to be aware of

171
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,080
uh if you get if this happens to you

172
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,280
from a prevention

173
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,759
reporting storage disposal perspective

174
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,440
it has here are the hazards associated

175
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,240
with this

176
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,880
and so you these would basically uh you

177
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,639
could think about these as potentially

178
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:43,280
like

179
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,639
from a comparison perspective

180
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,080
vulnerabilities associated with the

181
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,039
software component

182
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:48,560
from the chemicals perspective so these

183
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,320
are all examples of things

184
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,560
that we have a list of ingredients a

185
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,400
list of risks a list of harms

186
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,720
potentially associated uh with different

187
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,080
things in our lives

188
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,319
so but what we don't have this for in

189
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,440
many cases

190
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,800
um are our software and even less so

191
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,800
for industrial control systems

192
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,080
operational technology

193
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,080
things like that so the things that are

194
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,440
driving and

195
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,319
providing critical functionality for

196
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:15,680
critical infrastructure

197
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,080
and oil and gas and power and utilities

198
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,120
and things like that

199
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,680
are are especially deficient in this

200
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,240
realm

201
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,400
so which one is more important having a

202
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,240
bill of materials for a red wagon

203
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,240
or having a bill of materials for a

204
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,919
programmable logic controller

205
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:32,720
uh it's obviously a you know facetious

206
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,440
question

207
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,600
but as you can see we do have a build

208
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,280
materials for a red wagon and we don't

209
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,800
for a programmable logic controller in

210
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,600
many cases

211
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,720
and that's a problem so diving into the

212
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,479
market drivers and trends why do s bombs

213
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,199
matter and why now

214
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,800
so the executive order that recently

215
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,440
came out um which was a huge

216
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,199
uh step in the right direction direction

217
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:54,560
from a software bill materials

218
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,000
perspective

219
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,039
uh has the has the phrase s bond

220
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:00,400
mentioned 11 times

221
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,919
uh operational technology is

222
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:03,520
specifically called out

223
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,479
it also highlights various use cases of

224
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,080
a software bill of materials

225
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,560
vulnerability and license analysis risk

226
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,080
management use cases

227
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,479
centralized storage and aggregation of

228
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:15,759
software bill materials

229
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,759
so that you can do things like a higher

230
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,520
level analysis and and have

231
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,720
all this data in one place uh 5g

232
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,360
deployment

233
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,319
in adoption is a huge driver here uh

234
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,240
we're talking about a significant

235
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,720
increase in overall telecommunications

236
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,680
infrastructure

237
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,199
that we're going to need visibility into

238
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,120
um and that we traditionally don't have

239
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,319
visibility into

240
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:41,280
so smart cities are are going to be

241
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,479
heavily reliant on this

242
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,080
and we know that there is a enormous

243
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,759
push for that kind of

244
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,000
technology in cities um the

245
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,599
infrastructure alone here is is

246
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,080
enormous to to to even just rolled out

247
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,039
5g

248
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,520
from a like cell phone perspective let

249
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,960
alone all of the other things that

250
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,080
people want to do

251
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,800
from a uh from a smart cities um

252
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,680
perspective

253
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,319
so uh the other problem here is the

254
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,400
adoption from 5g is going to be much

255
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,960
faster uh than than 4g because there's a

256
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,160
higher desire

257
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,840
to gain the additional technical

258
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,000
capabilities that 5g can provide

259
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,199
so uh that's going to increase a huge

260
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:18,080
attack surface

261
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,039
that then currently exists uh i already

262
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:22,319
kind of mentioned smart cities

263
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,360
but the idea here is right this is uh

264
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,680
um the problem you have here is there's

265
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,360
a

266
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,159
adoption and time to market are really

267
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:32,479
prob

268
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,159
are almost certainly going to supersede

269
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,599
security requirements

270
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,000
and that becomes less of an issue if we

271
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,839
have software bill materials and we have

272
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:41,679
all this data available to us

273
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,120
that can provide us insight into the

274
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,120
things that are going on um

275
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,560
so if we are gonna get things to market

276
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,760
really quick and ignore

277
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,360
security at least at the beginning at

278
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,959
least we have visibility into these

279
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:54,240
things

280
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,399
uh digitization of manufacturing like we

281
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,560
are here digital manufacturing exists

282
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,959
obviously uh the this combination of

283
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,160
cyber physical systems

284
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,240
is is a common trend that that's being

285
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,839
discussed very often

286
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:07,920
um but once again security is kind of

287
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,600
viewed as an afterthought here

288
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,760
uh even though we all know how important

289
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,040
it is um

290
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,360
and that's security is hard baking these

291
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,480
things into the

292
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,480
into the build pipeline is hard this

293
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,760
isn't a

294
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,920
discussion necessarily that all of these

295
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:22,959
things are like

296
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:24,959
the easiest things in the world but it

297
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:26,480
is important to highlight that these

298
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,320
things are incredibly important

299
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,519
um the manufacturing environment uh

300
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,080
impacts that that can potentially occur

301
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,040
are huge here

302
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,000
i mean you have something like the

303
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,120
colonial gas pipeline which was not

304
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,800
the ot infrastructure was not

305
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,040
compromised but the ot infrastructure

306
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,200
was made unavailable as a result

307
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,720
of uh a i.t compromise and that

308
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,320
dovetails into the last bullet there

309
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,399
around it and ot convergence

310
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,720
so um even though the ot environment was

311
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,480
not particularly we're not specifically

312
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,920
compromised in that attack

313
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,240
it was still made unavailable which

314
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,480
clearly violates the cia triad

315
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,800
specifically availability so these kind

316
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,519
of issues

317
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,720
are becoming more and more common and we

318
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,320
can't really

319
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,360
um you know allow these kind of things

320
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,160
to keep happening

321
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,640
otherwise uh not having the east coast

322
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,760
be able to

323
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,360
get gasoline and other oil-based

324
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,720
products is obviously a pretty big

325
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,399
problem

326
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,399
legal regulatory and compliance issues

327
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,000
so there's a huge push here

328
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,560
from a legal compliance perspective uh

329
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,079
you have the iot cyber security

330
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:31,920
improvement act that got signed into law

331
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,680
in december of 2020

332
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,360
um you have the fda um

333
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,839
using the underwriter's laboratory

334
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,680
standard 2900-1

335
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,200
which is a standard for medical devices

336
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,720
which can also be used for other

337
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,440
device types as well you have a handful

338
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,160
of nist

339
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,760
um special publications that um

340
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,040
that approach

341
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,760
the like either iot or firmware

342
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,800
specifically

343
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,800
or other kinds of device types and in

344
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,720
specific environments in which this is a

345
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,360
problem

346
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,640
and then you have international

347
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,720
standards standards as well like iso

348
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:11,279
iec and uh nissa as well

349
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,120
so from a device risk perspective

350
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,279
how are the market trends driving the

351
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,200
risk of maintaining our current approach

352
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,720
device security now we talked about this

353
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,399
a bit already in terms of like more

354
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,240
devices and things like that but let's

355
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,680
dive into a couple

356
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,360
specific examples so a real lack of

357
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,880
visibility here now if we're talking

358
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,600
about firmware specifically which

359
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,720
is i think fair to say the overwhelming

360
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,000
uh set of software that needs

361
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,480
that we need visibility and a software

362
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,079
build materials for especially related

363
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:45,279
to

364
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,399
uh ics and um operational technology

365
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:51,200
so the the firmware and the devices that

366
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,040
are being powered by firmware that are

367
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,560
running these devices are often treated

368
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,040
as a black box um

369
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,839
so does a device exist and where does it

370
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:01,760
exist or common use cases

371
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,079
um that's important obviously that's why

372
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:05,440
that's the critical security control

373
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,320
number one

374
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,120
uh but this ignores the the risk within

375
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,480
the device itself

376
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,040
so it's great if we know where a device

377
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,160
is and what it is

378
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,680
and all of that but we also need to

379
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,440
understand what's on the inside so we've

380
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,639
been approaching this problem from an

381
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,160
outside in and now we also need to

382
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,399
approach this problem from an inside out

383
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,880
also fully updated firmware that's

384
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,079
perfectly patched

385
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,160
does not always indicate it is without

386
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,079
risk whereas if you look at something

387
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,760
like windows

388
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,600
if you do have a fully patched windows

389
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,800
operating system

390
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,079
that does provide you a reasonable

391
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:39,760
like modicum of security like you you

392
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,360
can say hey

393
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,440
all of the vulnerabilities that are at

394
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,800
least known

395
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,000
have been patched on my windows

396
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,200
operating system now that doesn't

397
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,480
prevent you against zebra days and all

398
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,839
of those other things of course

399
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:52,480
but for for these kinds of devices

400
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,480
they're not even given that luxury

401
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,959
meaning there could be a litany of

402
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,240
vulnerabilities that are

403
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,200
very old um you know five ten years old

404
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,480
known as end days

405
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,959
um and those are not patched and

406
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:06,320
maintained in the same way as like a

407
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,519
windows operating system and there's

408
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:08,800
lots of reasons for that

409
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,880
but not having visibility into that is

410
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,000
is a big problem

411
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,079
uh obviously no building materials

412
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:15,360
passing the risk to the submit to the

413
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,399
manufacturer

414
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,399
i have i talked to a lot of people who

415
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,160
mentioned to me hey we're

416
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,160
we're uh passing the risk off to the

417
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,600
manufacturer

418
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,440
just to be totally frank no no you're

419
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,800
not um

420
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,120
if you buy a device and are using that

421
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,959
device if you buy anything

422
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:32,639
anything in the world you have just

423
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,480
chosen to accept that risk

424
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,680
uh to go back to the um the example

425
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,600
around going into the bakery

426
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,920
if i buy that cupcake and i have a

427
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:42,880
peanut allergy

428
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,519
and there's peanuts in it or whatever

429
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:46,800
and i eat it

430
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,760
like the bakery doesn't get sick i get

431
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,320
sick

432
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,720
i chose to accept the risk so this idea

433
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,000
that we're passing the risk off to the

434
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,120
manufacturer is just

435
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,120
totally false it's just it's not what's

436
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,639
happening and

437
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:00,639
we need to just stop saying that it is

438
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,480
uh and this to

439
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,920
compare again to microsoft um

440
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,800
no one says hey we're just relying on

441
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,160
microsoft to

442
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,480
make sure that nothing bad happens here

443
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,199
we spend

444
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:15,680
millions of dollars installing agent

445
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,440
after agent after agent on these

446
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,360
operating systems to provide visibility

447
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,680
provide telemetry and give us an idea of

448
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,720
the overall risk

449
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,279
posture of a given computer but we don't

450
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,399
do the same thing

451
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,160
for these kinds of devices now you can't

452
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,600
install agents on all these devices and

453
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,000
things like

454
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,920
that but there are things that you can

455
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,040
do and so

456
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,560
that's that's that's the important piece

457
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,320
so this just kind of highlights uh what

458
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,440
i kind of just mentioned around

459
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,959
traditional endpoints versus ics

460
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:42,560
endpoints this is not an exhaustive list

461
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,760
and not a column

462
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,000
but the point being you have a lot more

463
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,399
options to provide a lot more visibility

464
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:50,480
on a traditional endpoint than you do an

465
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,240
industrial control system endpoint

466
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,440
so like i mentioned most of the analysis

467
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,600
is done from a network layer perspective

468
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,120
outside in

469
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,800
you have limited options and technical

470
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,399
capabilities for endpoint telemetry

471
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,279
because

472
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:05,040
you a lot of these devices just can't

473
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,959
even support an agent

474
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:08,399
infrequent updates and patch cycles

475
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,160
whereas on traditional endpoints you

476
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:10,399
have

477
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,720
a million opportunities to to gain

478
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,600
visibility

479
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,399
as um as everybody you know as everybody

480
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:17,360
obviously knows

481
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,160
so uh here's another example that uh

482
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,519
something i experienced

483
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:22,959
uh while i was working at department of

484
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:24,720
energy

485
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,240
one of the things i was tasked with was

486
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,360
determining the impact of

487
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,880
vulnerabilities such as shell shaw

488
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,560
carplete others

489
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,600
we had no visibility into into our own

490
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,720
uh uh devices no proactive announcements

491
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,160
about what was happening

492
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,720
um i had to reach out to you know all of

493
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,079
the vendors that were

494
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,720
that were running various uh device

495
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,360
types

496
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,320
um with within the the environment and

497
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,320
it took a long time to even get answers

498
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,680
that were

499
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,920
somewhat confident uh not even perfectly

500
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,759
confident which was another problem

501
00:15:55,759 --> 00:16:00,000
i uh i i've i had the opportunity to

502
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,920
talk with a handful of people who were

503
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:02,959
on the front lines of this from a

504
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:04,480
manufacturer perspective

505
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,079
and one anecdote i received was uh from

506
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:09,759
a very large

507
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:12,560
ot ics manufacturer that they had to

508
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,720
email

509
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:16,959
635 people internally

510
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:20,240
to ascertain you know where

511
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,320
specific versions of you know an open

512
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,360
ssl

513
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,079
binary was being utilized so needless to

514
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:26,560
say

515
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,639
that is a that is a not scalable

516
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:30,160
approach and

517
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,480
um makes makes dealing with this problem

518
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,440
even even more challenging

519
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,360
so an inability to answer are we

520
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,120
affected which piggybacks on that

521
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,199
so if if we determine a vulnerability

522
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:42,880
exists instead of credentials exist an

523
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,240
expired certificate

524
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,880
uh is there whatever it is we don't have

525
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,720
like a repeatable consistent process to

526
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,279
determine

527
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:51,440
if you're affected uh answering

528
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,560
questions can be hard

529
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,720
right companies acquired don't have an

530
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,320
inventory so this is something that we

531
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,440
can help solve

532
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,519
um manufacturers have the same problem

533
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:00,560
as the end user

534
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,600
they're not most manufacturers don't own

535
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,039
their entire supply chain

536
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:07,439
they are relying on other third-party

537
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:09,599
vendors for components and hardware and

538
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:10,799
software

539
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:13,520
and open source things just like other

540
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,079
people

541
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,000
so they actually have the same problem

542
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,599
as the end user in many cases

543
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:20,799
which is an important thing to note um

544
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:23,599
most organizations have 30 plus vendors

545
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,520
probably conservatively

546
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,000
so being able to manage all of this is

547
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,679
time consuming

548
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:32,240
not comprehensive and not done in in a

549
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:32,880
way that

550
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,280
that really scales so there's no

551
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,960
continuous monitoring or analysis

552
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,760
which which is is i suppose fairly

553
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,320
obvious

554
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,240
if we don't have visibility into things

555
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,679
uh we have no way to continuously

556
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,039
monitor and analyze them

557
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:47,120
so what you'll see is a lot of

558
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,480
organizations will do this via a

559
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,919
consulting engagement which is not

560
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:51,600
continuous not comprehensive

561
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,200
and only focus on really what's outlined

562
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,760
in a statement of work so

563
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,440
aspects that need to be continuously

564
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,799
monitored here

565
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:01,200
in no particular order vulnerability

566
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,320
identification

567
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,679
compliance risk tracking the ability to

568
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:07,440
just ask questions of this data

569
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,080
so here's a particular example with

570
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,080
related to a siemens

571
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,160
vulnerability that came out in april of

572
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,760
2020 that highlights that this

573
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,440
continuous monitoring and analysis is

574
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,400
not occurring

575
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,440
so the device notice date is

576
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,799
april of 2020. the vulnerability release

577
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:25,679
date

578
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:28,240
is from august of 2018. this is what i

579
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,760
mentioned as an end day like

580
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,280
this is not a zero day this is not a new

581
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,960
vulnerability this is an old

582
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:33,760
vulnerability

583
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,840
that is just identified and it was

584
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,120
related to

585
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,320
a kernel version so this is 609 days

586
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,919
that at-risk devices were running

587
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:44,559
critical functions so

588
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:46,960
this was not a difficult piece of

589
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,200
analysis that needed to be conducted

590
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,520
you you identify the kernel version and

591
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,240
you look

592
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,160
up that kernel version against the

593
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,760
national vulnerability database i mean

594
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,120
it couldn't be simpler

595
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,120
and something as simple as that just is

596
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,400
not occurring so

597
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,160
you can see how this provides a giant

598
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,320
problem

599
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,640
this is just a um uh you know as a

600
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,240
result of these risks that exist it's

601
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,679
like okay so we have risk

602
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:11,360
great what are are there actually

603
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,360
attacks happening as a result

604
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,760
and the answer is obviously yes uh so

605
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,200
pathway one is you have a targeted

606
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,080
supply chain

607
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,320
malware attack or not necessarily even

608
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,080
malware by putting in like a back door

609
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,440
which isn't necessarily a malicious

610
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,600
binary but could just be like hard-coded

611
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,720
credentials

612
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,240
in a configuration file or something

613
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,160
like that uh so solarwinds is a great

614
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,440
example of this recently

615
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,760
obviously um a targeted device

616
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,120
vulnerability attack

617
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,600
this is the most common i think uh based

618
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,720
on

619
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,720
what we've seen um you have like the

620
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,720
mirai botnet you have ripple 20

621
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,120
you have all of these various uh device

622
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,240
vulnerabilities

623
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,240
um from from code that is running on

624
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,080
these uh different kinds of devices

625
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,760
and then you have the infiltration of it

626
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,600
networks across the ot air gap

627
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,640
so you had you had the uh the municipal

628
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,520
water

629
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,440
um system where they were able to you

630
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,960
know compromise some things and

631
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,760
and and get access to like the chemicals

632
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:04,480
and whatnot

633
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,000
and then you also have as i mentioned

634
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,600
previously the colonial gas pipeline

635
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,440
issue

636
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,080
so how can software build materials help

637
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,200
so shining a light

638
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,799
on this device risk is really what we're

639
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:17,360
what we're after

640
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,360
so from a value proposition you know we

641
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,440
can reduce unplanned unscheduled work

642
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,600
reduce code bloat adequately understand

643
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,200
dependencies within broader

644
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,919
projects comply with license obligations

645
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:29,520
monitor components for vulnerabilities

646
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,720
obviously

647
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,799
end-of-life awareness make code easier

648
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:35,200
to review maintain a blacklist of banned

649
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,559
components which is super important

650
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:37,600
especially for things like high

651
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,960
assurance environments

652
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,400
provide software bill materials to

653
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,880
consult customers for that transparency

654
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,880
third-party risk identification you can

655
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,280
build this software build materials

656
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,960
into your third-party risk so now

657
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,720
instead of relying on like a paper-based

658
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,520
questionnaire that's always like

659
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,799
questionable and the amount of value

660
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:56,799
that's providing um

661
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:58,559
we can now actually have the data-driven

662
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,080
approach to

663
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,960
to doing third-party risk management for

664
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,240
the software that we're procuring from

665
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,120
these vendors

666
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,280
um and then compliance adherence and so

667
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,679
i love this um

668
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:12,480
i don't even know what to call it like

669
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,559
s-bomb flower on the right-hand side

670
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,559
that highlights different um uh use

671
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,480
cases around supply chain software

672
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,360
development

673
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,360
uh software vulnerabilities compliance

674
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,960
uh all these different pieces of parts

675
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:23,919
so there's a lot of

676
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:25,679
a lot of good use cases here for this

677
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:27,039
data once we have it

678
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:29,840
so it's it's the it's kind of age-old

679
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,240
tail

680
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,919
once we get the visibility once we get

681
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:33,600
the data we can

682
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,559
we can extrapolate that and solve a ton

683
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:38,000
of problems downstream

684
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,960
so that's what we're trying to do so

685
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,039
s-bomb generation and consumption

686
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:45,120
uh there's a lot of software development

687
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,559
tools that can create s-bumps for you

688
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:47,919
easily

689
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:50,799
as you're building code going back and

690
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:52,080
creating an s-bomb for something that's

691
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:52,880
already been done

692
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,000
is just a much more challenging

693
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,159
proposition most of the time so

694
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:58,720
you know the standards that exist for uh

695
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,360
s-bom

696
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,480
you know adherence cyclone dx suid

697
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,799
and spdx are all well documented you can

698
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:06,000
go find them online

699
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,840
and if you go look at like cyclone dx as

700
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,000
an example they have an entire page

701
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,640
dedicated to tools that can be used to

702
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,520
generate

703
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,200
software build materials that can be

704
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,280
used to generate them from cyclone dx to

705
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,720
spdx format

706
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,840
there's a tons of opportunities here to

707
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,080
to make this much easier on yourself on

708
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,440
the right hand side you see

709
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,679
this is a set of the use cases that uh

710
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,919
can be that are basically uh part of the

711
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:31,039
cyclone dx

712
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:34,159
um standard so and whatever ones you can

713
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:35,840
fill in great whatever ones you can't

714
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,559
you know uh prioritize them based on the

715
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:39,360
needs of

716
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,240
what your customers are asking for so

717
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,760
this is similar to like the food label

718
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,039
piece i talked about earlier

719
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:46,720
where it's like here's the contents but

720
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,159
not necessarily like the rest

721
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:50,480
recipe or a proprietary blend which

722
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,240
would be a problem

723
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,080
so from a challenges perspective here

724
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,919
you know a software bill of materials is

725
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:56,640
not

726
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,120
is not a panacea it's we're not solving

727
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,400
all the problems

728
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,600
um it's it's another set of data

729
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,840
that we can leverage to help identify

730
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,400
risk provide visibility and

731
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,000
and reduce the likelihood of a problem

732
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,240
happening and and it allows us to be

733
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,120
more proactive

734
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,400
in in terms of identifying risk and and

735
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,000
mitigating or eliminating it as best we

736
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,400
can so this is not a preventative

737
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,360
security control

738
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,879
right um

739
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,720
all security controls don't need to be

740
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,799
preventative so

741
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:30,400
if you don't have visibility into

742
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,840
something you definitely aren't going to

743
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,880
be able to prevent it

744
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,039
so it's important to get this visibility

745
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:36,320
first and then

746
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,400
hopefully something from the data that

747
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,000
we can gather here can be integrated

748
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,600
with or tied into something else that

749
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,799
can help prevent

750
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:45,039
uh you know some malicious activity from

751
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:46,000
occurring

752
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,360
and it's important to realize right you

753
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,600
know security logs or logs in general

754
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,840
aren't preventative vulnerability scans

755
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,039
are not preventative

756
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:55,120
data lakes are not preventative sims are

757
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,400
not preventative but

758
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,000
but we all have them we all spend a ton

759
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,919
of money on them and so

760
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:02,320
all we're trying all that is we're

761
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,840
really mentioning here is

762
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,120
getting the data for these kind of

763
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,039
devices is probably more important

764
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:09,600
in most cases than some of the other

765
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,960
devices that we're getting data for so

766
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,080
let's do it

767
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,320
um legacy equipment's a challenge right

768
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,960
you might only have compiled code

769
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,960
so access to source might not be

770
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,159
possible for

771
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,960
a million different reasons um and so

772
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,400
component identification

773
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,919
and things like that can be really

774
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:28,159
challenging when it comes to

775
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:30,159
uh generating a software bill of

776
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:32,080
materials here but

777
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,919
it doesn't need to be perfect right

778
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:35,679
perfect is the enemy of good

779
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:38,320
and so it's important to make steps or

780
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,279
take steps

781
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:41,600
iterate iterate iterate make things

782
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,640
better over time

783
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,640
and uh if if something can't be perfect

784
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,159
that doesn't mean we shouldn't do it

785
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:49,279
you know imagine if you're

786
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,400
a person who has has been blind or uh

787
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,000
is is colorblind right we've all seen

788
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,520
those amazing videos of somebody being

789
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,080
given

790
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,279
a pair of those glasses and they can

791
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:58,640
finally see colors for the first time

792
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,200
and then

793
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,880
we all cry uh that's what we want to do

794
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,360
here

795
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,159
is basically give visibility give people

796
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:07,440
a set of glasses

797
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,080
that allows them to see what's going on

798
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,760
within these devices serving critical

799
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,200
functions in their environment

800
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:17,120
and so it's possible we can do it

801
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,200
so some misconceptions about a software

802
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,480
bill and materials i think are worth

803
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,840
highlighting here

804
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,720
am i providing a roadmap to the attacker

805
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,120
so

806
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,960
operating under the assumption that

807
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,400
attackers can't acquire this data on

808
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,360
their own is just

809
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:32,640
just i mean just totally inaccurate uh

810
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,400
in reality what we're doing here is not

811
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,640
providing a roadmap for the defender

812
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,679
so we're making we're putting roadblocks

813
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:40,799
in front of the defender

814
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:42,400
whereas the attacker can go get this

815
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,640
data so it's actually the opposite of

816
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,360
this

817
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,120
uh s bombs level this playing field to

818
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,880
some extent um

819
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,880
is this intellectual property disclosure

820
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,000
the answer this is no

821
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,679
we're not providing proprietary source

822
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:55,200
code or anything like that

823
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,799
these software components are just a

824
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:58,880
piece of the puzzle that that allow

825
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,440
you know organizations to identify risk

826
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,240
and and

827
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,919
understand what they need to defend and

828
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:06,000
what they have will this increase my

829
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,039
licensing costs

830
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:09,679
so this awareness allows manufacturers

831
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:11,679
to address unknown licensing commitments

832
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:13,279
it allows them to address these issues

833
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:15,279
in a proactive manner not reactive

834
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:16,960
gives them the visibility to make good

835
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,880
decisions ahead of time through fees or

836
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,080
more favorable terms

837
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,240
it also helps the end users and clients

838
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,320
ensure that they have compliant things

839
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,880
so it's kind of a win-win-win for

840
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,200
everybody from that perspective

841
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,360
so i have a software build materials now

842
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,240
what

843
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,080
so a bunch of things we can do here as i

844
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,760
mentioned once we have this data the use

845
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,720
cases for it

846
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,279
are pretty infinite enrichment of the

847
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:40,640
data with other sources

848
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,720
third-party sources uh vulnerability

849
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,480
data threat intelligence data

850
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,720
things like showdan like uh what you

851
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,919
name it um

852
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:49,760
operationalize the data we can send this

853
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,520
data to a sim

854
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,559
uh for triaging we can we can make it

855
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:55,919
part of our vulnerability management

856
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:56,720
process

857
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,480
we can integrate this data with a sore

858
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,400
platform we can integrate this data

859
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,559
for the manufacturer into like our ci cd

860
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:03,440
pipeline

861
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,440
uh you know if a critical vulnerability

862
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,640
is identified then

863
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,960
open jira issue whatever i mean the

864
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,039
logic we can think of and build out is

865
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:14,640
you know uh uh you know a lot so

866
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,440
make decisions based on visibility that

867
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,279
was previously impossible

868
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:21,679
or incredibly difficult to ascertain is

869
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:23,360
is is the biggest one

870
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,600
so adding additional monitoring to this

871
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,360
device due to a vulnerability

872
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,360
push back on manufacturer for lack of

873
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,880
license compliance

874
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,080
enhance third-party risk management

875
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,000
data-driven insights for life cycle

876
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,640
management segment a device or a class

877
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,840
of devices

878
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,960
you now have data to to drive better

879
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,000
decision-making

880
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
regarding these kinds of devices and

881
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
that's what we're really after

882
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,320
um so this is what you can do once this

883
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,080
is done

884
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,640
so i appreciate everybody taking uh some
