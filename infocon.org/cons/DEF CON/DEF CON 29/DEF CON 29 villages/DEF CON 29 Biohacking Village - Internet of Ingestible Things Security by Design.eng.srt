1
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,240
right so good morning good afternoon or

2
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,760
good evening depending on where you're

3
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,199
joining us from

4
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:29,840
today i'm miriam a phd researcher

5
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,760
between the daw center for future crime

6
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,680
and the advanced center for biochemical

7
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,680
engineering here at the university

8
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,120
college of london

9
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,280
i researched biocrime the internet of

10
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,399
ingestible things and cyber biosecurity

11
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,480
and alongside my research i'm also

12
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,320
co-founder and director of a med tech

13
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,719
startup my background is in deep tech

14
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,879
and bioengineering and i've experienced

15
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,039
leading award-winning uh projects during

16
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,000
my time at astrazeneca and microsoft and

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,800
i'm on a mission to build secure smart

18
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,320
pills for smart health

19
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,400
today i'll tell you what all that means

20
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,960
with a brief background into the topic

21
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,479
then i'll dive into the approach that

22
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:11,520
i've taken and what my intended outcomes

23
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,920
are so please do follow these icons on

24
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:14,960
the right

25
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,759
throughout the presentation

26
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,960
right so brief background

27
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,080
what if i told you that your dna is only

28
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,200
0.1 unique to you

29
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,600
and that the ecosystem of microbes in

30
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,400
your gut your gut microbiome is more

31
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,360
than 90 unique to you

32
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,840
and how does your microbial signature

33
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,640
then affect biocrime

34
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,799
well you may not know this but you are

35
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,799
more bacteria than you are actually you

36
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,040
bacteria that live on and inside the

37
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,399
human body make up five microbiomes and

38
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:55,040
the gut microbiome makes up at least 90

39
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,960
percent of the genes available to your

40
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,240
metabolism

41
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,000
these are essential to things like your

42
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,159
immunity nutrition

43
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,759
and when there are imbalances with your

44
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:06,960
gut microbiome then it's associated to

45
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,679
diseases such as diabetes obesity and

46
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,040
even depression in fact as you age the

47
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:18,080
ecosystems of microbes too grow with you

48
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,879
and unlike dna that can only reveal your

49
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,680
genetic makeup your gut microbiome can

50
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,080
reveal your lifestyle who you live with

51
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,239
if you live in the city or if you have a

52
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:29,200
pet

53
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,800
and believe it or not social behavior

54
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,120
as your gut is linked to your brain

55
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,280
through what's called the gut brain axis

56
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,599
both physically through the vagus nerve

57
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,440
but also indirectly through your gut

58
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,319
microbiome which controls metabolism but

59
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,800
can also modify behavior

60
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,480
several studies have found that people

61
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,959
who have larger social networks are more

62
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:53,280
likely to have a greater gut microbiome

63
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,560
diversity

64
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,400
there's also been a unique composition

65
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,519
of gut bacteria identified and linked to

66
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,840
behaviors such as atten attention

67
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,400
deficit hyperactivity disorder also

68
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,720
known as adhd

69
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,720
don't believe me well think about the

70
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,599
food that you eat and your mood some

71
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,760
food contains bacteria that make you

72
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,159
more social if you eat it regularly and

73
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:17,680
for long enough

74
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,280
and not getting enough of it may make

75
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,440
you anti-social

76
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,000
a whole new meaning to the expression we

77
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,879
are what we eat

78
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,040
it's no wonder why there's interest in

79
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,519
accessing the gut through emerging

80
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,400
internet connected digital pills

81
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,480
these swallowable smart pills contain

82
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,480
sensors and have a relatively long

83
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,519
history nasa for example has been using

84
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,519
these to help track their athlete's core

85
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,840
temperature for almost 15 years

86
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,400
now the problem is with emerging

87
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,480
technology comes emerging crime

88
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,799
opportunities health data is being sold

89
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,439
in the black market at 20 times more

90
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,319
than other types of data and unlike your

91
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,720
credit card credentials cannot be

92
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,200
regenerated you simply cannot regenerate

93
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,599
your genome

94
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,920
so what does that mean for the security

95
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,439
of valuable biological material yes i

96
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,439
mean you

97
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,600
well my research aims to underpin

98
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,839
evidence-based policy making regarding

99
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,639
biocrime and where relevant to change

100
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,280
organizational culture and practices to

101
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,840
improve national

102
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,440
security i've conducted a systematic

103
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,199
review published in the international

104
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,080
journal of frontiers edited and reviewed

105
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,479
by members of the cdc the u.s national

106
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,400
university of defense and department of

107
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,320
health services and has reached more

108
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,440
than 5 000 experts worldwide

109
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,360
it revealed the criminogenic potential

110
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,120
of biotechnology specifically in

111
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,919
synthetic biology but i've also elicited

112
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:53,040
the opinion of field experts with both

113
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,320
traditional

114
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,000
backgrounds such as governmental

115
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,360
officials or security intelligence but

116
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,080
also non-traditional experts such as

117
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,960
biohackers really extract different

118
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,520
views on what crime opportunities might

119
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,440
emerge

120
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,720
and both

121
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,039
strongly agreed that biocrime will take

122
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:15,919
place in this intersection of the cyber

123
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:18,639
and bio domains but that there are no

124
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,960
current frameworks in place to really

125
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,039
address these

126
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,440
in fact in light of the pandemic here in

127
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,000
the uk the uk parliament joint committee

128
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,160
on the national security strategy

129
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,240
published a call for evidence

130
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,000
to really assess how prepared the

131
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,080
government is for major biological

132
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,560
security risks using covet as a test

133
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,520
case

134
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,479
and regrettably it found profound

135
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,800
shortcomings in how the government

136
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,240
really safeguards national security

137
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,720
we contributed to this call and provided

138
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,440
three key recommendations

139
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,919
number one create cyber biosecurity

140
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:57,680
policy and standards to really

141
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,240
strengthen our preparedness

142
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,720
number two adopt an experimental

143
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,039
approach through ethical hacking as a

144
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,199
harm reduction tactic

145
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,759
and number three increase biotechnology

146
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:12,160
and biosecurity literacy

147
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,039
now

148
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:16,400
to demonstrate these key recommendations

149
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,639
i've led the very first internet of

150
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,960
ingestible things workshop supported by

151
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,800
the daw center for future crime here at

152
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,680
ucl and by partnering uh by the with a

153
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,400
high biohacking village

154
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,240
this workshop really brought cyber

155
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,319
biosecurity experts and medical device

156
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,039
regulatory bodies to really think about

157
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:36,960
cyber biosecurity

158
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,520
at the design stage of medical devices

159
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,240
and to inform policy by delivering a set

160
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,800
of principles

161
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,960
because fundamentally security is an

162
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,120
innovation driver and is a business

163
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,759
enabler

164
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,479
so what was our approach

165
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,960
well we call it the hybrid hackathon

166
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,400
delphi model hhdm for short and it has

167
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,840
three phases the first is the hackathon

168
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,400
so a design sprint-like event bringing

169
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,919
domain experts to collaborate uh

170
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,400
intensely on a project

171
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,800
and within the stage we have contextual

172
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,360
talks inviting stakeholders and speakers

173
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,759
including leaders of cyber biosecurity

174
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:22,479
and future crime research cyber security

175
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,080
professionals medical device

176
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,720
manufacturers but also the users of the

177
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,360
ingestible devices themselves such as

178
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,479
patients and clinicians

179
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:34,560
stakeholders of the industries of

180
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,039
interest come from a diverse set of

181
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,759
backgrounds and form cross-pollinated

182
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,680
teams to submit their smart pill

183
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,840
proposals

184
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,840
phase two is the delphi model

185
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,919
here the selected top three teams

186
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,400
undergo a series of questioning

187
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,639
to elicit opinions on a security by

188
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,560
design framework relevant to the

189
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,840
internet of ingestible things

190
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:02,400
finally phase three the teams actually

191
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,319
prototype their ideated ingestible

192
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,039
things device so the hhtm really

193
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,759
captures current and nuanced opinions of

194
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:12,319
diverse field experts whilst also

195
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:14,080
generating these detailed hacking

196
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,240
proposals hence the hybrid

197
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,720
so how did we do well we had over 200

198
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,039
attendees that are pre-hackathon talks

199
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,759
27 individual applicants and 17

200
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:27,919
applicants from a diverse set of

201
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,319
backgrounds including pharma security

202
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,479
intelligence neuroscience they've

203
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,880
generated over 500 ideas and the

204
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,279
finalists teams engaged with more than 4

205
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:39,519
000 people through their pitching videos

206
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,440
and their public's votes raising

207
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,279
security awareness for the emerging

208
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,120
smart pill technology

209
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,959
now let's meet the finalists the three

210
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:51,360
top teams and their smart pill designs

211
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,839
and proposals

212
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:56,640
up we have team smartrace which designed

213
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,720
an ingestible that would trace highly

214
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,040
contagious infections such as the

215
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,360
norovirus but specifically on cruise

216
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,279
ships during quarantine

217
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,279
their proposal introduced the use of

218
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,279
private blockchain for secure and

219
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:12,959
transparent data transmission

220
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,640
next up is team ibd activate they had

221
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,959
special skills in embedded systems for

222
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,360
iot or the internet of things and they

223
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,760
designed an ingestible things device for

224
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,720
targeted micro dosing of anti-inflamma

225
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,959
inflammatory drugs in the gut and this

226
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:31,440
was for inflammatory bowel disease

227
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,120
patients so patients with chronic

228
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,959
inflammation in their gut

229
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:37,200
their proposal focused on the need for

230
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,440
firmware coding and telecommunication

231
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,000
security tailored for clinical and

232
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,240
patient acceptance

233
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,279
finally we had team biota ai which

234
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,600
targeted the 10 to 15 percent of the

235
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,160
worldwide population that is estimated

236
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,880
to suffer from some sort of

237
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,839
gastrointestinal issue

238
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:57,760
and they proposed a secure clot

239
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,240
communication system designed for this

240
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,160
wider consumer health market

241
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,000
okay so what were our intended outcomes

242
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,839
ultimately our intended outcomes were

243
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,399
twofold first we wanted to demonstrate a

244
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,800
red teaming proof of concept framework

245
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,360
to be introduced to national security is

246
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,760
a continuous cycle of inquiry in

247
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,079
emerging technology to really aid

248
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,800
national security decision making while

249
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,040
using the ingestible medical devices is

250
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,760
an example technology and test bed

251
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,920
in fact there was a second call for

252
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,600
evidence by the uk parliament joint

253
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,959
committee here

254
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:37,120
related to how a red teaming approach

255
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,360
can be introduced in national security

256
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,160
that we contributed to

257
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,160
secondly uh we wanted to produce a

258
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,399
policy briefing much like the biohacking

259
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,560
community has itself

260
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,880
related to the security required for the

261
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,519
ingestible things ahead they're white

262
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,760
ahead of their widespread use on the

263
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,959
market

264
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:59,120
we asked our participants about crime

265
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,519
forums the ingestible things may enable

266
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,920
what relevant security should be put in

267
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,640
place who the stakeholders are

268
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,399
and how the ingestible things should be

269
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,120
governed we also asked about

270
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,519
what methods of communication

271
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:15,360
related to the security

272
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,440
we can implement

273
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,920
to consumers related on the security

274
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,920
needs now we're currently working on

275
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,680
this and it will be published by the end

276
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,000
of the summer so do stay tuned but

277
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,680
please be the first to find out by

278
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,680
scanning the qr code that you see on the

279
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,760
on the presentation to sign up to our

280
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,760
newsletter and be the first to find out

281
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,680
when the policy briefing has been

282
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,239
published

283
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,320
so far this research uh supported by the

284
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,480
doll center has led to a lot of

285
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,320
knowledge transfer activities with

286
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,480
highly specialized groups here

287
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,320
in london as well as presenting to over

288
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,760
200 policy makers of the uk home office

289
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,120
my work has been

290
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,880
recognized and published by the uk

291
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,040
parliament joint committee of national

292
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,279
security and has been featured in a

293
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,839
series of special covet 19 policing

294
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:06,480
papers by the jill dando institute and

295
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,160
policing insights

296
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,680
part of this research has also been

297
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,680
commercialized into a med tag startup

298
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,240
that's supported by innovate uk

299
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,720
uh and that ranked top five out of last

300
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,480
year's mayor's entrepreneur health award

301
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,639
here in london uh hosted by sadika and

302
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,480
the mayor of london i've also been

303
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,200
shortlisted as a greek international

304
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,200
woman of the year under science and

305
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,920
technology

306
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,959
so in an increasingly health-centered

307
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:35,519
global economy it is time for cyber

308
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:38,079
biosecurity so if you too are interested

309
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:40,480
in prioritizing responsible health tech

310
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,720
with a more bio-savvy

311
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,839
public that demands for secure solutions

312
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,399
then do please get in touch thank you

313
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:51,560
for listening

314
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,800
you
