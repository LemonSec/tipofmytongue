00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:04,160
hello i'm thomas hicks vice chairman of

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:05,680
the united states election assistance

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,520
commission

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,240
the eac is an independent bipartisan

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,519
federal agency

6
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:13,719
created by the help america vote act of

7
00:00:13,719 --> 00:00:15,440
2002

8
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,279
to help election officials improve the

9
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,199
administration of elections

10
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,119
and help americans participate in the

11
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,119
voting process

12
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:24,880
we work closely with state and local

13
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,320
election officials

14
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,960
to make sure everything is in order for

15
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,560
voters to cast

16
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,760
a meaningful secure

17
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,920
and independent ballot by statute

18
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,559
our agency is responsible for

19
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:43,040
distributing federal funds to the states

20
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,719
including 400 million in emergency

21
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,760
funding last year to address election

22
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,800
issues

23
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,800
caused by the covet 19 pandemic

24
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,360
the agency also establishes standards

25
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,800
for voting technology

26
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,160
used in our elections in february

27
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,319
we issued a new set of standards for

28
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:05,438
voting systems

29
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:07,119
that will pave the way for the next

30
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:09,040
generation of voting systems

31
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,520
across the country i have more on that

32
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,799
later

33
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:15,040
our agency also maintains the national

34
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,119
voter registration form

35
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,040
and finally we serve as the

36
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,960
clearinghouse for best practices

37
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,360
for state and local authorities to

38
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,640
consult about election operations

39
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,520
other federal agencies also play a role

40
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,159
in the u.s

41
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:34,320
election system the federal

42
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,400
elections commission has oversight of

43
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,439
the nation's campaign finance laws

44
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:42,399
the money in politics and how those laws

45
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:43,600
apply to candidates

46
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,040
and committees many other agencies

47
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,360
are also involved even if their

48
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,880
statutory mandate

49
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,000
is not solely focused on elections

50
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,680
you may be familiar with the cyber

51
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,600
security and infrastructure security

52
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,479
agency

53
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:02,000
cisa which plays a key role in securing

54
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,840
our elections infrastructure

55
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,239
for both foreign and domestic intrusions

56
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,399
and the us postal service has recently

57
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,239
been the focus of absentee

58
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,400
and vote by mail ethics during the

59
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,879
pandemic

60
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:19,440
with that level of complexity it's easy

61
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,120
to see how the electorate could fall

62
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,520
victim to simple misinformation

63
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,160
and how bad actors can introduce more

64
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:26,800
malicious

65
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,760
information through any one of those

66
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,000
points of entry

67
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,840
among our most important lessons from

68
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,519
the 2020 election

69
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,319
was a tragic reality that those threats

70
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:41,360
can stem not only from foreign enemies

71
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,800
but also from within

72
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,640
at the same time by its very nature

73
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,440
the decentralization system limits

74
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,400
intrusions

75
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,360
because any large-scale efforts would

76
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,040
require targeting

77
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,879
the separate states and local

78
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,239
jurisdictions

79
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,000
at the county and local level

80
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,080
by partnering across federal state and

81
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,440
local governments

82
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,720
and with robust support from industry

83
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,760
civic organizations nonprofits and

84
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,040
academia

85
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,120
we carried out one of the most secure

86
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,080
elections

87
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,400
in american history and continue to

88
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,080
improve operations

89
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,560
to secure continued success

90
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,959
and the road to repairing this damage

91
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,080
remains long

92
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,200
and but i hope the ideas

93
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,120
you share and the connections you make

94
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,239
gives everyone here the opportunity to

95
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,000
think strategically

96
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,599
about protecting our elections

97
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,480
to be sure miss and disinformation

98
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,599
succeed

99
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:53,120
in casting doubt about this fact

100
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,360
but what do we learn and how do we

101
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,120
respond

102
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,200
at the broadest level we learn that

103
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,519
online missing disinformation

104
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,400
pose a threat to the elections process

105
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,000
and it's incumbent upon

106
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,120
government institutions at every level

107
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,480
to make sure voters and potential voters

108
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,920
have accurate information it also

109
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,358
requires vigilance

110
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:19,600
by the platforms where myths and

111
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,600
disinformation appear

112
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,440
to be honest gatekeepers finally

113
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,440
individuals have to be responsible for

114
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,600
the information they consume

115
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,160
that means on the web voters and the

116
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:32,880
public

117
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,880
should look for verified and trusted

118
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,479
source labels

119
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,840
voters can and should refer to resources

120
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,880
directly

121
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,759
from local and state election boards

122
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,840
this is especially important for voters

123
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,919
checking their registration status

124
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:49,840
and confirming if their if their

125
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,759
information is correct

126
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,160
and a response to the recent executive

127
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,639
order issued by president biden in march

128
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,120
we are digitally working alongside the

129
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,840
general service administration

130
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,880
to modernize and improve the user

131
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,840
experience

132
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,560
of bug.gov where voters can find

133
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,880
information they need to participate in

134
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,120
the democratic process

135
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,840
beyond this our agency as well as the

136
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,160
rest of the election infrastructure

137
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,479
established numerous safeguards to

138
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:21,280
monitor

139
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,759
and engage vote future threats to our

140
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,000
systems

141
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,240
in january of 2017 dhs gave the critical

142
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,000
infrastructure designation

143
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,960
to our election systems this designation

144
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,199
is given to systems and assets

145
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,680
whose incapacity or destruction will

146
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,280
threaten the country's physical

147
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,560
or economic security the designation

148
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,080
allows the eoc

149
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,520
to participate in the government

150
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,840
coordinating council which provides for

151
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,280
interagency

152
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,240
and intergovernment coordination it

153
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,240
includes representatives across federal

154
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,280
state local

155
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,400
tribal and territorial governments

156
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,759
a sector coordinating council also

157
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:05,520
serves as the counterpart

158
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,639
to the gcc for partners in industry and

159
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,800
manufacturing

160
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,840
the councils proved highly important as

161
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,800
covert restrictions started last flame

162
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,400
with about half of the state still

163
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,039
needing to conduct at primary elections

164
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:24,240
the resources the gcc compiled proved

165
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,319
highly useful for election officials

166
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,319
the eac also launched several

167
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:31,440
initiatives

168
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,080
to support cybersecurity efforts at

169
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,120
state and local level

170
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,759
the cyber access and security program

171
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:40,880
provides

172
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,520
resources like security training best

173
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,639
practices

174
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:47,280
expertise and other assistance for

175
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,720
election officials tasked with

176
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,599
protecting

177
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:53,120
critical elections infrastructure

178
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,440
last year we helped provide election

179
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,440
officials with online cyber security

180
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,240
training

181
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,240
through a partnership with the center

182
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,080
for tech and civic life

183
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,000
ctcl to date over 1 000

184
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,800
people have taken the training from 46

185
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,759
states

186
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,840
dc and three territories

187
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,319
and this training remains available for

188
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,400
free through september for anyone

189
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,960
interested in attending

190
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,720
the eic also launched the risk

management and crisis management online

192
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,840
workshop

193
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,840
for state and territorial election

194
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,240
officials

195
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,280
and the eoc hosted a joint cisa online

196
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,880
risk management tool

197
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,840
on our website allowing officials at the

198
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,120
local level

199
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,840
to easily measure and mitigate risk to

200
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,840
the specific

201
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,840
environments leading up to the election

202
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,120
in june 2020 the eac also

203
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,039
announced its partnership with the

204
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,360
center for internet security

205
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,000
to pilot a technological verification

206
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,879
program

207
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:59,360
focused on non-voting collection

208
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,720
technology

209
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,360
including electronic poll books election

210
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,280
night reporting websites

211
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,199
and electronic ballot delivery systems

212
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,360
for the eac every discussion about

213
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,720
election technology

214
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,199
begins with our core statutory

215
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:16,400
obligation

216
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,520
the voluntary voting system guidelines

217
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,160
the vbsg are set as specific and

218
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,520
requirements

219
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,919
against which voting systems can be

220
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:26,560
tested

221
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,319
to determine if the system meets

222
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,400
requirement standards

223
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,440
the eac first adult did bvsg

224
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,599
in december 2005. this past february

225
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:43,279
we unanimously voted to approve vbsg 2.0

226
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:46,320
pbsg 2.0 is a major step

227
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,399
forward to ensure the next generation of

228
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:49,600
building equipment

229
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,720
is more secure accessible and

230
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,200
it ensures a better voting experience

231
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,440
for all americans

232
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,320
election security has been a major topic

233
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,279
and focus

234
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,440
during these efforts and i'm proud that

235
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,440
the vbst 2.0

236
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,839
includes provisions to ensure we have

237
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,440
more paper ballots

238
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,360
and built-in support for election

239
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,480
officials to conduct

240
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,320
more effective post-election audits

241
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,480
even more than ever without sacrificing

242
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,600
the mandate that those with disabilities

243
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,000
can still vote independently and

244
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,680
privately

245
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,240
these gains along with many others

246
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,680
benefits

247
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,519
to accessibility security and usability

248
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,320
that come with a 15-year technological

249
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,080
week forward

250
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,279
all are part of what makes the update so

251
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:46,720
critical this version reflects

252
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,839
the push and pull of various policy

253
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:50,160
considerations but

254
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,320
ultimately represents reasonable

255
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,440
compromise

256
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,920
that puts the agency in a good position

257
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,920
allows manufacturers to build their

258
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,360
requirements

259
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,800
and gives labs clear guidance to test

260
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,720
and certify those machines

261
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,839
and positions the eac for considering

262
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:10,880
enhancements in the future

263
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,040
this brings us to the issue of elections

264
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,399
post covent

265
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,240
and the new systems and technologies

266
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,160
that are being adopted across the united

267
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,399
states

268
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,120
according to the brennan center 25

269
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,320
states have passed

270
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,399
54 laws that lower barriers to voting

271
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:31,120
by adopting election practices that were

272
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,640
employed in 2020

273
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,839
in response to the pandemic those

274
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:36,480
permanent

275
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,920
fixes include more early voting options

276
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,920
like longer periods or additional days

277
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,760
for in-person voting

278
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,040
more valid drop-off locations adoption

279
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,079
of no excuse absentee ballot requests in

280
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:50,959
addition

281
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:54,240
two states vermont and nevada elections

282
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,440
will be conducted

283
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,120
entirely by mail joining the five states

284
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,640
that adopted all male 1

285
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,560
bournemouth prior to 2020

286
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,120
states have also adopted new procedures

287
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,040
to minimize the rejection of male

288
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:09,920
ballots

289
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,079
by allowing voters the opportunity to

290
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:14,959
cure any defects or to verify their

291
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:16,800
signatures

292
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,040
through ballot tracking technology some

293
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,560
states and localities

294
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,720
are even allowing voters to follow the

295
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,040
progress of their ballots to ensure that

296
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,800
it counts

297
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,480
and on the front end states have

298
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,320
simplified and expanded voter

299
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,000
registration

300
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,720
for example some states modify or struck

301
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,480
laws for giving voting for

302
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,760
preventing felons from voting

303
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,880
others expanded registration 17 year

304
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,560
olds who are eligible to vote

305
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:48,079
upon turning 18. finally a number of

306
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:51,440
states adopted new technology to allow

307
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,440
for accessibility providing

308
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,760
remote options for voters with

309
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,760
disabilities

310
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,920
today more than 20 states in the

311
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,360
district of columbia

312
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,959
offer electronic ballot delivery

313
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:06,720
changing long-standing election

314
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,480
practices procedures

315
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,560
and systems is no small order

316
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,440
in many cases this may require

317
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,200
legislative action

318
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,519
and in 2020 governors and state

319
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:20,639
legislatures

320
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:23,120
across the country acted quickly to

321
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,240
adapt election

322
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,880
administration procedures to meet eight

323
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,680
health

324
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,560
and safety guidelines beyond those

325
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,440
formalities

326
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,399
are more practical considerations like

327
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,000
the timing of the introduction

328
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,200
of those changes the implementation and

329
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,839
ongoing monitoring and the need for

330
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:44,720
voter education

331
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,839
for changes to an implementation of

332
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:50,079
new technology there is further

333
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:52,399
consideration about balancing

334
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:57,040
efficiency accessibility and security

335
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,440
in the eac's capacity as a clearinghouse

336
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,959
for best practices

337
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:02,959
election officials can turn to our

338
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:06,079
agency for guidance about how and when

339
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:10,000
implementing election systems practices

340
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,360
in their jurisdiction as one example

341
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,760
let's talk about electronic poll books

342
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,160
or e-pull books

343
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,320
these are voter registration lists that

344
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,839
have been digitized

345
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:25,839
to check voter eligibility at the polls

346
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:28,160
in 2018 more than one quarter of

347
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,440
jurisdictions used

348
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,800
equal books this was an increase of more

349
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,240
than 50 percent

350
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,279
in 2014

351
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:40,720
36 statements 36 states use equal books

352
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,279
in at least one jurisdiction seven

353
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,120
states use equal books in

354
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,560
all local jurisdictions equal books have

355
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,600
some ignorant security concerns

356
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,680
thousands of evil books can be deployed

357
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,240
in a jurisdiction during an election

358
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,480
they may be networked to other equal

359
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,279
books

360
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,920
or an equal book central server or a

361
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,959
voter registration database

362
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:06,800
people books contain personal

363
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,720
identification

364
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,680
information bii including name address

365
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,959
and age

366
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,519
in some circumstances other data

367
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,519
includes driver license numbers

368
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,480
and voter signatures they are

369
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,279
potentially

370
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:23,199
the target of attacks by nefarious

371
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:25,680
actors that could cause potential

372
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,959
fully placed delays turn away photos

373
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:31,600
or modify or delete voter registration

374
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,120
data

375
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,600
often personnel with minimal security

376
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,320
training

377
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,160
are also entrusted with operating these

378
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,680
equal books

379
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,240
this part is our effort to guard against

380
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,120
potential

381
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,399
these potential security scenarios

382
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:49,519
the eac will create a program manual

383
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:51,839
that will describe key elements such as

384
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:52,880
requirements

385
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,279
and responsibilities for participating

386
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:57,199
in the program

387
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:59,199
requirements will be developed and

388
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,680
published similar to the vvsg

389
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,160
but with a narrower scope they will

390
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,959
focus on unique aspects of the pullbucks

391
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:10,839
related to security usability and

392
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:12,079
accessibility

393
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:14,240
testing will be conducted by eac

394
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,760
accredited voting system

395
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,519
test labs pistols test plan reports

396
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,680
and relevant attachments will be posted

397
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,760
on the eac's website

398
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,639
and it will include typical system

399
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:27,839
configuration

400
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:29,920
information like software versions

401
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,279
hardware used

402
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:35,120
and hashes it will be voluntary

403
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,519
and manufacturers participation is

404
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,399
necessary for it to be successful

405
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,120
states can help if they start requiring

406
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,839
the uac evaluation

407
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:48,320
in some instances states may still need

408
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,079
to provide testing to ensure

409
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:52,839
interoperability with their specific

410
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:54,800
systems

411
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,920
it must be agile we don't want to cause

412
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:58,800
too much

413
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,959
we don't want it to cause too much

414
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,320
additional overhead

415
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:06,560
in terms of time or cost currently labs

416
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,560
take approximately one to two months to

417
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,839
evaluate

418
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:12,320
we believe that this turnaround can be

419
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,279
shortened through standardization

420
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,600
we also want to support the ability for

421
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,959
manufacturers direct

422
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:23,040
to rapidly iterate to have their systems

423
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:27,040
evaluated the standards would need to be

424
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:27,440
kept

425
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,199
up to date depending on how the

426
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:32,000
specifics and requirements are

427
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,600
the standards need to be updated

428
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,839
frequently

429
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:38,959
could be yearly or less for election

430
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:39,920
officials

431
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,759
the convenience and efficiency of using

432
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:43,839
equal books must be weighed against

433
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:46,320
potential security threats

434
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,839
that's because this data must be stored

435
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:51,040
somewhere and many officials

436
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,399
increasingly rely

437
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:54,959
on crowd services from amazon or

438
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:56,399
microsoft for example

439
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:00,399
to manage these systems unfortunately

440
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,160
those systems are vulnerable to cyber

441
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,199
security threats

442
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:09,520
as the 2016 election demonstrated

443
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,919
foreign hazards attempted to penetrate

444
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:14,160
the voter registration databases for

445
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,760
several states

446
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,359
by some meeting accounts they were

447
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,359
successful with at least one of those

448
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:22,000
states being penetrated

449
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,319
similarly security measures are

450
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:25,760
implemented

451
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,520
officials may inadvertently raise

452
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,320
barriers for voters with disabilities

453
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,919
so there is a need to protect against

454
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:33,600
trading accessibility

455
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:38,480
for security our goal is to do both

456
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,320
then there are public education piece

457
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,320
that voters with

458
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,559
the information to help them navigate

459
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:47,679
new systems and technology

460
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:49,440
maybe even more importantly this

461
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,960
education component

462
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,559
about making sure that the public

463
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:55,600
understands any new system of technology

464
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,559
is not only convenient but also reliable

465
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:00,960
and secure

466
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,919
for example ebooks of equal books have

467
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:04,400
made it

468
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,720
easier for jurisdictions to adopt the

469
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,960
use of vote centers

470
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,280
these are often larger more centralized

471
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,640
polling locations

472
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,120
that combine several precincts or vote a

473
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,080
contested ballot

474
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,799
equal books allow vote centers to more

475
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,640
easily access information

476
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,160
about voters across multiple

477
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,799
jurisdictions with more ease

478
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:28,720
than consulting traditional registration

479
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,200
lists on paper

480
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,919
during the pandemic both centers played

481
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:36,080
an important role in protecting

482
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,960
both election workers and voters because

483
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,559
in some instances

484
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,720
they were in larger settings like sports

485
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,960
stadiums that allowed for proper

486
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,559
social distancing when used for early

487
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:49,360
voting

488
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,360
vote centers allow voters to cast a

489
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,640
ballot ahead

490
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,960
of the election day and avoid

491
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,960
traditional longer lines

492
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,799
at a time of uncertainty about the

493
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:01,039
pandemic and the protective measures

494
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,039
needed to prevent infection

495
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,559
election workers worked with their

496
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:06,880
municipalities professional sports

497
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:07,679
leagues

498
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,000
and the media to inform voters about

499
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,360
using vote centers

500
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,480
to stay safe and to provide reassurance

501
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,679
that their votes would count i'll end

502
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:18,320
here

503
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,880
but i look forward to the conversation

504
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,720
and the collaborations that stem from

505
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,640
deathcon this year

506
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:34,640
thank you
