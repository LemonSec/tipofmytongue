1
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:11,519
thank everybody

2
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,559
for joining me for structured analytic

3
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:16,239
techniques for improving information

4
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:19,840
security analyses i'm rabbit

5
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,359
no really i am uh i'm sometimes also

6
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:24,480
known as jj

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,920
professionally if i need a boring name

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,320
for resumes and things um

9
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,760
i'm currently the head of product

10
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,159
security and security operations for

11
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,040
a company called latch latch makes smart

12
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,239
access devices

13
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,120
and smart home integrations and a number

14
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,719
of things for residential buildings that

15
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:41,280
are sort of

16
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,600
the internet of things variety we like

17
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,800
to think that

18
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,239
we make things that are a step above

19
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,160
what you'd probably typically think of

20
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,440
when you hear the term internet of

21
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,480
things

22
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,960
uh in background a former biometric

23
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,640
device

24
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,800
penetration tester i've done some

25
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,760
medical

26
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,879
security hospital engineering i

27
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:05,199
entered information security from the

28
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,119
field of epidemiology and public health

29
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:08,320
research

30
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,119
so my previous year and a half has been

31
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:12,880
a real interesting ride having some of

32
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:13,520
that

33
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,880
become national uh

34
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,520
you know stories international stories

35
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,000
my

36
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,320
informal introduction to information

37
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,159
security is when i completely wrecked

38
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:26,320
the pdp 1184

39
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,640
at my high school you never forget the

40
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,400
sound of the heads hitting the platters

41
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,159
on those old death drives that's

42
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,880
all i'm saying about that and an

43
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:35,920
interesting thing about

44
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,960
me uh i was raised around my father's

45
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,200
a very weird and large collection of

46
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,079
robots

47
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:44,000
so i'm basically like a budget version

48
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,640
of shinji akari

49
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,720
so what are structured analytical

50
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,920
techniques

51
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,560
structured analytical techniques are a

52
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,280
set of

53
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,960
tools tricks uh

54
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,640
fun ways to manipulate data that

55
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,719
can help you discover and eliminate

56
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:03,920
biases

57
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,520
they can improve the accuracy and

58
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,960
reliability of your

59
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,360
conclusions uh they can ensure that all

60
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,120
data is being equally considered and

61
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,160
including

62
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,959
included during analysis and they can

63
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:17,760
enhance your creativity

64
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,720
so where did this come from a few years

65
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,040
back

66
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,160
i was perusing files on the cia.gov

67
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,800
website as one does and i came across

68
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,599
something called

69
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,239
a tradecraft primer structured analytic

70
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:31,680
techniques for improving

71
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,720
intelligence analysis uh written by

72
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,959
prepared by u.s government so i never

73
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,400
found out who actually wrote this thing

74
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,080
but i assume it's you know one of these

75
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:40,959
people

76
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,680
um just ahead there's no connection

77
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,000
between me and the cia or me and these

78
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,879
authors

79
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:48,879
i just happened to be a guy who found

80
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,560
this uh so

81
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,959
yeah nothing yet i do think though that

82
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:54,640
maybe uh one of them might read it

83
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,160
eventually so just in case

84
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,920
so it's a good paper and also just to

85
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,720
point out uh

86
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,640
anything that the cia publishes with the

87
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,720
words a tradecraft primer on it

88
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,000
i am absolutely going to read that

89
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,920
so what portion of this is mine what

90
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,280
have i done

91
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,879
i initially thought about this mostly it

92
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,800
was rattling around in my head in terms

93
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,080
of how you might use it for

94
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,319
open source intelligence or for threat

95
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:19,920
intelligence so that's kind of a natural

96
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,080
fit just intelligence analysis

97
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,280
but as i like all of us i probably don't

98
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,040
do anything that cool most of the time

99
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,319
most of my time i'm spent

100
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,400
you know doing some more normal infosec

101
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,000
stuff for my orgs

102
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,080
and so i started thinking how could i

103
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,680
apply these same techniques to stuff i

104
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,000
do on a more day-to-day basis or

105
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,760
you know or sort of more mundane or

106
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,120
might have a more

107
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:46,159
widely applicable uh you know user base

108
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,720
uh there are three types of structured

109
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,440
uh

110
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,920
analytic techniques the first one is

111
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,200
diagnostic techniques

112
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,439
those are used to improve uh quality and

113
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:57,280
make sure that your analyses are based

114
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,599
on quality information

115
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:02,959
the second type uh are contrarian

116
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:03,599
techniques

117
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,360
these are for making sure analyses are

118
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,640
not biased or based on limited thinking

119
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,120
and the last type is imaginative

120
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,799
thinking techniques

121
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,599
these are for developing new insights

122
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,120
breaking out of the box or

123
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,720
seeing things from potentially new

124
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,279
viewpoints

125
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,680
so the first structured analytical

126
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,880
technique we'll take a look at it's

127
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,639
called just a key assumptions check

128
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,400
it's kind of an easy one to start with

129
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,000
it's very easy to describe

130
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,040
it's literally taking uh uh

131
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,880
thinking about all the assumptions you

132
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,320
made when coming to a conclusion or

133
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,840
performing an analysis

134
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,919
and writing them down creating a list of

135
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,960
things you've just assumed

136
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,360
you may review the assumptions

137
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,440
periodically as you do the analysis just

138
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,880
to see if your opinion of them has

139
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,520
changed

140
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,639
maybe you discovered you made an

141
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,800
assumption you don't remember making or

142
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,000
didn't think as of

143
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,919
as an assumption at the time or maybe

144
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:00,240
you know you need to do

145
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,240
some rethinking about some of the stuff

146
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,199
you had assumed in the first place

147
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,320
an example of how this might help you in

148
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,720
information security is let's say you're

149
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,120
replacing an old layer 3 firewall with a

150
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,960
new next-gen

151
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,840
you know blinky light layer 7 firewall

152
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,320
it's got

153
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,320
deep packet inspection and it does

154
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,400
protocol identification and all kinds of

155
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,960
cool things that your layer 3 didn't

156
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,759
what are some assumptions you may have

157
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,840
made that may come back to bite you

158
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,560
in having made that decision well you

159
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,800
may have assumed that newer is better

160
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,080
often is not it isn't always

161
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,560
uh you may have assumed that the default

162
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,720
settings on the new firewall

163
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,520
would block malicious traffic maybe you

164
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,160
know you

165
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,199
brought it out of the box and put it

166
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:48,880
into place and it's expecting you to do

167
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,880
a lot more tuning than you realized

168
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,919
um you may have assumed you really only

169
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:54,800
needed to worry about

170
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,919
incoming packets versus exfiltration or

171
00:05:57,919 --> 00:05:58,560
outgoing

172
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,680
traffic uh or you

173
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,639
may not you may assume that it doesn't

174
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,800
pass traffic until it knows that traffic

175
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,160
is good or bad

176
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,919
that's the one that uh particularly why

177
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,520
i chose this example is because i've

178
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,000
encountered layer 7 firewalls that

179
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,120
allow 32k or 64k of data to move

180
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,600
before they decide if a protocol is bad

181
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,720
or not

182
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,160
and at the time as someone who was

183
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,000
trying to exfiltrate all that really

184
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,479
meant to me was if i cut my data into 32

185
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:27,360
or 64k

186
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,560
chunks i could pass right through the

187
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,560
firewall by just restarting the session

188
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,319
every 32 or 64k

189
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:33,919
and it would never clamp off on that

190
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:35,440
protocol as

191
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,560
being malicious because it didn't have

192
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,479
time

193
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:43,199
uh so another technique is a quality of

194
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,039
information check

195
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:46,880
that is basically where you go through

196
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,400
all of your information

197
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,199
and judge uh judge it for its strength

198
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:52,160
its weaknesses

199
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,199
its importance and its confidence

200
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:56,560
it's something you can use throughout

201
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,319
the analytical process and

202
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,000
you should be performing it probably

203
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,520
periodically

204
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,479
it helps you detect errors in processing

205
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:07,280
or collection of information

206
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,240
errors in translation or errors in

207
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,520
interpretation

208
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,000
it can identify attempts at deception or

209
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,440
denial strategies if you happen to

210
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,880
discover that maybe there's some

211
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,199
specific problem with your data and it

212
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:20,639
can assist in communicating the amount

213
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:21,599
of confidence

214
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,919
you have in your assumptions and key

215
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:26,080
information

216
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,160
so it's pretty easy to do all you do is

217
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,000
take each information you're basing your

218
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,759
assumption or conclusion on

219
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:33,759
identify which of them are critical to

220
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:34,880
that result

221
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,440
and then consider uh if it involves

222
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,880
interpreted information has that been

223
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,880
interpreted in the right context or with

224
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,680
you know

225
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,160
a complete understanding of how that

226
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,800
should probably be interpreted

227
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,800
an information security example so

228
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,240
you're working instant response and

229
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,000
analyzing log files sent to you by an

230
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,120
ops team

231
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,479
what are some quality of information

232
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,240
checks you could do

233
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,000
to make sure you're working with quality

234
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,520
source material

235
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,360
well you might check that the timestamps

236
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,280
are accurate they probably aren't

237
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,919
uh are you confident that the log hasn't

238
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,280
been tampered with is there some

239
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,560
mechanism you can use to

240
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,280
prove that it has some you know veracity

241
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,000
to it

242
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,919
uh are you confident that log is real in

243
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,360
the first place you know

244
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,879
maybe there's someone left one for you

245
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:18,479
to find uh

246
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:21,280
and lastly does does the log even

247
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,280
capture the type of information you're

248
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,879
looking at maybe you have your device

249
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,560
configured such that the event you're

250
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,840
looking to correlate

251
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,319
isn't even captured in that log those

252
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:31,440
are all things you could check to

253
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,000
improve

254
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,679
the quality so another technique

255
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:38,240
indicators or signposts of change this

256
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,360
is where you create

257
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,839
a list of events or monitoring targets

258
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:43,679
that will tell you if your situation has

259
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,120
changed

260
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,360
essentially you identify a bunch of

261
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,959
competing hypotheses you know ways that

262
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:56,160
a situation may go and then you create a

263
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,920
list of potentials at potential

264
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,600
activities or statements

265
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,760
or events for each scenario right if you

266
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,360
start going down one of these paths

267
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,880
you may list out what would you expect

268
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,880
to start seeing happen

269
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,440
and then you regularly review and update

270
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,800
your your indicators

271
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,160
uh to make sure you're watching for

272
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,680
these things and so if you start seeing

273
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,279
these indicators in your environment

274
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:18,640
you've got some idea of what path a an

275
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,640
event might be taking

276
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,640
so uh information security example uh

277
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,440
you may want to protect your

278
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,160
organization

279
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,160
from a system-wide ransomware attack you

280
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,160
think you're in good shape because your

281
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,160
org uses cloud storage and your domain

282
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,080
controllers are regularly patched

283
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,519
um you might uh what might be some

284
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:38,399
signposts

285
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,560
that this assessment you've made that

286
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,600
you don't really need to worry about it

287
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,640
too much

288
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,080
might be changing and you might need to

289
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,760
rethink that scenario or rethink that

290
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,440
risk or conclusion

291
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,160
well for one if ransomware attackers

292
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:50,480
start

293
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,240
leveraging or attacking specifically

294
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,240
cloud storage providers a lot more

295
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,920
that's a fundamental change to their

296
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,199
tactics and and their

297
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,959
you know ttps by your estimation

298
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:05,200
so that should cause you to rethink your

299
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,240
your conclusion

300
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,079
or what if there's a vulnerability in a

301
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:10,240
domain controller say in a principle or

302
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,519
where microsoft really

303
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,680
releases a patch that doesn't fully fix

304
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,720
the issue that would

305
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,160
never happen but knowing that exists you

306
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,120
would have to

307
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,480
uh then consider will your

308
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,680
conclusion or or uh scenario of

309
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,399
or decision that you were protected hold

310
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:29,680
up over the next one

311
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,839
six 24 48 hours

312
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,680
another diagnostic technique uh analysis

313
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,920
of competing hypotheses

314
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,040
so this one is uh basically identifying

315
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,279
all of the reasonable alternative

316
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:46,959
explanations

317
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:49,040
and then just weighing the evidence

318
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,880
against them to determine whether your

319
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,160
evidence supports or

320
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,920
or refutes these potential hypotheses

321
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,399
and this this is specifically done

322
00:10:58,399 --> 00:10:59,040
without

323
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,000
conjecturing about the probability of

324
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,120
the hypothesis

325
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,880
being true hypothesis danger uh and

326
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,160
the goal is to take

327
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,200
your data uh your your bits of evidence

328
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,040
weigh it against each of the hypothesis

329
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,640
and decide if each piece of evidence you

330
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,040
have

331
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,440
either supports it supports that

332
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,120
particular particular hypothesis

333
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,800
refutes that particular hypothesis or

334
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,720
maybe doesn't contribute to it in any

335
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,959
meaningful way

336
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:28,560
you go through one at a time and you

337
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,079
create a matrix of

338
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:33,120
uh which bits of evidence support or if

339
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:33,519
you

340
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:36,160
which hypotheses you have with the goal

341
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:36,560
of

342
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,760
refuting or disproving hypotheses

343
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,480
not with the goal of proving hypotheses

344
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,560
and that's to prevent you from

345
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,920
uh grabbing on to one particular result

346
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,640
you might

347
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,519
favor for one particular reason or deal

348
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:52,320
is the most

349
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,160
likely you're not trying to do that

350
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,360
you're trying to make sure that you've

351
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,000
identified

352
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,720
all of the possible potential hypotheses

353
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,839
uh it reminds me of a quote a sort of

354
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:04,959
famous one when you have

355
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:06,639
eliminated the impossible whatever

356
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:08,639
remains however improbable

357
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,800
improbable must be the truth which is of

358
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,760
course from house md

359
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,399
uh an infosec example you're asked to

360
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,000
investigate the defacement of an

361
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,360
internal wiki page

362
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,440
someone has replaced all the tutorial

363
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,079
videos with links to hardcore form

364
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:26,560
the logs don't show any edits in fact

365
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,000
you don't see any activity on those

366
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,040
pages for several

367
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,800
years so how might you go about using

368
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,399
ach to

369
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,160
figure out or help you come up with a

370
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,279
conclusion as to what might have

371
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:38,240
happened

372
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,480
well you might uh conjecture that could

373
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,360
an admin

374
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,760
have made the changes and scrubbed the

375
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,560
logs

376
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,320
that might be possible could an engineer

377
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,920
have made the changes in the back end

378
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,360
and that's why your logs

379
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,279
don't match up could an external

380
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:53,200
attacker have compromised the wiki

381
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:53,760
system

382
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,680
in some way that you don't know about

383
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,800
yet or could the videos themselves have

384
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,240
changed somehow

385
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,639
and hopefully it's clear to a lot of you

386
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,240
that i'm alluding to a recent event

387
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:04,880
where

388
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,040
a company purchased a domain that used

389
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,200
to host fairly innocuous videos

390
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,480
um and on that domain now hosts hardcore

391
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,240
porn and as a result it's

392
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,560
showing up in a lot of old pages that

393
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,600
haven't been touched in a while because

394
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,519
it's true the actual videos themselves

395
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:24,399
are what have changed

396
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,720
so let me get to uh contrarian

397
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,480
techniques

398
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,360
uh probably the one that people are are

399
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,800
most familiar with is

400
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,440
devil's advocacy however i've noticed

401
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,959
that some people

402
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:38,720
some people understand the term devil's

403
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,720
advocacy to mean

404
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,040
arguing the opposite viewpoint or or

405
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,440
taking an intentionally contrary

406
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,240
viewpoint

407
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,279
to argue with in the context of the

408
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:50,079
original

409
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,160
government us government document uh

410
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,199
they actually

411
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:56,240
use this as saying uh it's more like red

412
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,839
teaming your analysis

413
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,920
it's taking your own analysis and then

414
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,680
having another

415
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,399
faction or you playing you know another

416
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,480
role in this analysis process

417
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,399
attacking your own analysis to find

418
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:09,519
weaknesses

419
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:11,360
things that might not be supported

420
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,440
things that might be

421
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,120
not quite as reliable uh as

422
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:21,680
you are using them in the final analysis

423
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:25,279
it's uh intended to allow you to test

424
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,800
whether your key assumptions will hold

425
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,639
up under different circumstances and it

426
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:29,600
helps you identify

427
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,399
faulty logic

428
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,959
so an information security example of

429
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:36,399
devil's advocacy

430
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:38,880
uh there's a bit of a scenario for this

431
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,720
one you're wrapping up a report

432
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,560
on what has happened during an event

433
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,160
you're mostly confident you've arrived

434
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,760
at the right conclusion as to how an

435
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,600
attacker was able to gain access to a

436
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,440
database and exfiltrate some data

437
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,000
but the stakes are high um let's just

438
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:52,720
say

439
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,240
if this happens again your company's

440
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,920
going under it's really important

441
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,320
you have to be 100 certain about this

442
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,680
given that it's so important

443
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,800
how what can you do to ensure that the

444
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,240
result that you've came up with

445
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,440
or uh your your hypothetical scenario

446
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,440
is as accurate as it possibly can be

447
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,120
well that's where you bust out

448
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,519
devil's advocacy so maybe you would take

449
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:14,880
one of your really good analysts

450
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,760
or uh maybe it's you uh sort of

451
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,639
functioning in this

452
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:21,519
this particular role but for for this uh

453
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:22,800
purposes of this one that

454
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,720
you have one of your other analysts look

455
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,120
at your report they specifically start

456
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,560
going through your report looking for

457
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,160
weaknesses in the things that you've

458
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:30,800
assumed

459
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,560
weaknesses in the evidence potential

460
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,600
faults that might disqualify some

461
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,279
infinite evidence that you're using

462
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,600
they just basically tear it apart and

463
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,800
while they're doing that to create a

464
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,440
report

465
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,279
of these are all the things that are a

466
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,800
problem with this analysis

467
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,440
and then they present that to the group

468
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,240
now

469
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,560
the group can take a look at that and go

470
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,680
now you know they can

471
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,959
they can argue with they say well you

472
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:56,720
know this really is founded because

473
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,040
of whatever reason or they might say all

474
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,480
right you're right we need to go find

475
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,720
some additional corroborating evidence

476
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,800
to support this one particular piece

477
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,480
because it's sort of a weak pillar of

478
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,160
the final result

479
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,480
and that helps you make sure that your

480
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,040
final product is based on the strongest

481
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,240
of possible determinations

482
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,160
from the process very similar

483
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:24,240
to devil's advocacy is uh team a team b

484
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,639
analysis a lot of people get these mixed

485
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:28,720
up and in fact if you do a team 18b

486
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,720
analysis wrong you can end up turning it

487
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,560
into devil's advocacy

488
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,480
but uh there's a slight difference in

489
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,320
that um

490
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,639
team 18b is used when you have two

491
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:39,920
potential

492
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,720
results or final conclusions that are

493
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,560
sort of equally probable or at least

494
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,360
equally

495
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,519
of equal confidence and you're not quite

496
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:48,880
sure which one

497
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,759
is the stronger one what you might do in

498
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:53,759
that situation is to take each of those

499
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,279
hypotheses

500
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,360
and give them to two different teams and

501
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,199
allow each team to pursue them

502
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:02,560
as their own analysis

503
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,839
one of the often uh uh

504
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:08,640
used additional sort of tricks in for a

505
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,799
team 18b analysis is to take

506
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,880
somebody who is in favor of one

507
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,319
particular outcome and put them on the

508
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,839
team of the opposite outcome

509
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,119
and it isn't just to sort of make them

510
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,640
angry it's because they may have

511
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,679
insights

512
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,839
or understand connections between the

513
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,280
data they're working with

514
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,760
that the other team hasn't realized it

515
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,959
allows you to sort of do some

516
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:28,880
cross-pollination of that understanding

517
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,440
of the issue

518
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,280
so how about you use that in information

519
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,520
security so you and your team are trying

520
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,520
to decide how best to reduce the number

521
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:37,919
of

522
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:39,600
malware incidents you're experiencing

523
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,039
within your organization

524
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:42,720
uh let's say you have limited budget and

525
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,120
time and engineering resources

526
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,080
and you can only really go with one

527
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:48,880
thing

528
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,919
one uh group of your analysts wants a

529
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:53,280
strategy involving

530
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,520
endpoint policies updates changes to

531
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,640
something on the endpoint

532
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,160
and the other group of analysts is

533
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,160
really uh thinks that the right way to

534
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,080
go is to put money into some

535
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,600
network wikibox uh anti-malware boxes

536
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,080
that can

537
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,520
stop stuff before it even gets to the

538
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,400
endpoint so one thing you might do

539
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,480
in that situation is you might decide to

540
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,559
give each of those two groups

541
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,559
or tell each of those two groups to run

542
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:18,240
with that idea and produce

543
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,280
an analysis why their solution is the

544
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,160
best option

545
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,559
why we shouldn't consider the other

546
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:25,840
option

547
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,760
and you might use the trick of sort of

548
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,360
cross-pollinating by taking people that

549
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,400
are an advocate of

550
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,480
endpoint uh restrictions and put them on

551
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,960
the network uh restrictions game and

552
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,520
vice versa and sort of get that um

553
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,240
that cross-pollination but the final bit

554
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,840
is you have sort of an agreed upon

555
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:45,360
sort of formal uh judgment method

556
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,520
uh maybe it's just you know the relevant

557
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,880
manager decides which one was most

558
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,480
compelling or maybe you have a

559
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,160
a team of experts who listens to the

560
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,679
arguments and they decide which one was

561
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:54,799
the most compelling or

562
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:57,280
who had the the best argument for that

563
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:57,919
particular

564
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,600
way forward it's a bit of a debate

565
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,000
tactic um but it can allow you to

566
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,200
pull the best out of two potential

567
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,799
in very close situations

568
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:12,720
so uh i impact low probability in that

569
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,200
analysis this is for when you have an

570
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:15,840
event

571
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,919
that would have dire consequences if it

572
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:19,760
happened but no one thinks it will

573
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,039
happen

574
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:23,440
it's very useful when decision makers

575
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,760
are convinced that an event is unlikely

576
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,360
but maybe haven't given sufficient

577
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,679
thought to the consequences

578
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:31,280
of its occurrence they've kind of

579
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,120
dismissed it because it's it's very

580
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,240
unlikely

581
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,679
it can be used to uncover hidden

582
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:37,679
relationships and it can help uh

583
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:39,600
analysts develop signposts from kind of

584
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,960
like we were talking earlier

585
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,520
uh which can provide early warnings of a

586
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,320
shift in

587
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,200
in the situation how do you do it you

588
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,640
define the high impact

589
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,200
outcome clearly like what is actually

590
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,000
going to happen if

591
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,320
this occurs uh and then you devise one

592
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,000
or more pathways

593
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,520
of series of events that could

594
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,480
potentially get you there you start from

595
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,159
uh known good and work your way towards

596
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:06,960
the high impact event that's important

597
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,480
uh when comparing this with a future

598
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,080
technique

599
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,080
uh you insert possible triggers or

600
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,840
changes that could affect the outcome

601
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,039
right maybe

602
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:19,440
it seems very unlikely because um

603
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,520
no one has the proper keys or access to

604
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,039
the proper keys so maybe a triggering

605
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:24,000
event might be

606
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,559
fees get released or you know keys are

607
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:27,679
exposed somehow

608
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:29,440
uh that might change this whole uh

609
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,760
scenario and now you need to rethink

610
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:35,520
our actual uh low probability it is

611
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,520
anyway you identify a a set of

612
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,200
indicators for each pathway that can be

613
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,400
monitored

614
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,080
and then you set about monitoring those

615
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,080
things so that you know

616
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,360
assuming you can't do anything to

617
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,520
fundamentally reduce this risk or remove

618
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,640
this risk

619
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,760
at least now you have a set of

620
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,440
indicators so you may get some advanced

621
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,960
warning of it coming

622
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,520
and be able to take corrective actions

623
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,120
an example of this say you're

624
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,720
concerned that your organization is not

625
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,240
taking the risk of having too many

626
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,880
unnecessary domain admins seriously

627
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,559
most of the domain admins don't need

628
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:05,919
that level of permission

629
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,520
but the stakeholders believe it hasn't

630
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,440
been a problem and it makes changes

631
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,840
quicker in an emergency

632
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:12,960
obviously something i've heard in the

633
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,520
past it also makes keep security from

634
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,880
being a bottleneck because they don't

635
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,000
have to ask for permission if they've

636
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:18,799
got

637
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:20,640
full threads to everything you're

638
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,559
concerned because they're of the risk of

639
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:25,280
a compromised admin credential or uh

640
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,120
what kind of damage an internal attacker

641
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,039
might be able to do

642
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:31,280
so maybe you conduct a high impact low

643
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,480
probability analysis

644
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,480
uh you highlight the huge impact that

645
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,480
happens if this very low priority uh

646
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,120
probability event occurs you identify

647
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,120
several pathways that could occur right

648
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,280
financials get leaked there's weak

649
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,120
passwords chosen by the people who have

650
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,080
these

651
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,840
maybe an internal attacker is having a

652
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,679
really bad day or get some news they

653
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:51,280
don't like you know

654
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:55,039
that might in fact impact things

655
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:56,880
you identify potential indicators that

656
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,000
these events are occurring right at

657
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,280
least now you've got some idea of what

658
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,880
to look for you may not be able to fix

659
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,840
the situation

660
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,880
hopefully you're working on the

661
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,640
organization to reduce the the number of

662
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,159
admins there are

663
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:07,520
but you've got some things you can watch

664
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,919
for you can look for indications that uh

665
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:12,559
leak credentials or credentials in a

666
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:13,120
week

667
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,520
you can test for very weak passwords in

668
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,320
some ways

669
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,760
there might be some stuff you can do

670
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:23,919
so a what if analysis a what if analysis

671
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:27,200
is often confused with a high impact low

672
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,280
likelihood analysis

673
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,120
but it really is almost a high impact

674
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,400
low likelihood analysis

675
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,480
done backwards with high impact low

676
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,840
likelihood analysis

677
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:39,120
you start at a base state and construe a

678
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,720
path where you may arrive at the high

679
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,000
impact event

680
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,320
with a what if analysis you start with

681
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,840
the high impact event

682
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,919
and then work your way back to identify

683
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:50,000
the things that would have had to have

684
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:50,799
happened

685
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:53,440
for that scenario to occur um it's

686
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,000
basically just

687
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,039
coming from the other direction so you

688
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:58,640
you start by assuming the event has

689
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,000
happened you select some triggering

690
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,520
events that may have permitted the

691
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,559
scenario to

692
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:05,120
unfold um you develop a chain of

693
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,120
argument as to how the output

694
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,840
output outcome could have come about you

695
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,440
work backwards as i mentioned

696
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,120
and you generate a list of indicators

697
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,960
for each of those stages

698
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,640
so now you've uh with your high impact

699
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,159
low likelihood analysis identified

700
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:24,240
things you might monitor or or consider

701
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,400
important for

702
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,400
detecting if it's starting or in

703
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,440
progress

704
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,039
you've now got additional uh indicators

705
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:35,200
for if activity is happening in each

706
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,039
stage and so maybe the event has

707
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:38,240
occurred and now you're finding it

708
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,840
before it works its way back on

709
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,640
the chain an information security

710
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,600
example uh

711
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,240
consider again that same scenario where

712
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,520
you're concerned about

713
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,520
potential for domain admin credentials

714
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,960
to become compromised

715
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,200
instead this time assume they're already

716
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,000
compromised

717
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,320
how did that happen right and so maybe

718
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,279
as a result of that

719
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:59,440
you might identify the same vectors as

720
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,960
before like leak pack

721
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,000
elite passwords or inside attackers

722
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
um however maybe because you're thinking

723
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,360
the other direction this time it might

724
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,159
occur to you that

725
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:10,720
maybe the help desk dumped some caches

726
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,159
off of something because someone logged

727
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,440
in with admin creds and

728
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,520
whatever it was was set up to cache that

729
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,039
uh you know

730
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:19,440
you might as a result of that decide

731
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,080
well

732
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,440
i'm going to add to the list of things i

733
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,600
can wash watch for or do

734
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,320
check for excessive ash caching

735
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:26,799
especially

736
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,760
domain admin creds and uh uh you know

737
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,880
maybe there's something you can do to

738
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,240
make sure you're catching if people are

739
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,760
using domain admin credits for like

740
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,480
needless local logins you've now got a

741
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,760
little more information of things you

742
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,600
might look for in your environment to

743
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,360
detect these specific types of problems

744
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,240
and on on to the uh the imaginative

745
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,919
thinking techniques i think these are

746
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:48,799
probably the most

747
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:51,679
obvious uh to people or the easiest for

748
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:53,360
people to wrap their head around

749
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,440
people are used to the idea of

750
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,120
brainstorming they've heard that

751
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,159
uh term a lot um

752
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:02,880
the the interesting thing is again the

753
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,000
source material talks about

754
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,240
brainstorming as a group activity

755
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,039
um in in obviously because they're doing

756
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:10,480
sort of structured

757
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,720
beams and things to bring about

758
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,080
brainstorming i think when we

759
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,480
just say brainstorming we we think of it

760
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,440
often as just

761
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,720
coming up with things off the top of

762
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,640
your head you know that might be

763
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,039
off the wall and that's true and you can

764
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:24,559
do that by yourself but in this context

765
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:26,320
they're talking about it as a group

766
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,720
activity

767
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,919
basically it's it's it's

768
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:34,720
quickly generating a range of hypotheses

769
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,080
that can then be refined

770
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,240
tested further developed or discarded it

771
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,760
just creates raw material you can work

772
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,039
from some ideas

773
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,039
things that you can then later go and do

774
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:44,559
you know um

775
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:46,400
test your evidence against and see which

776
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,919
of those you can discard as right off

777
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:49,279
the bat as well well that's not going to

778
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:50,000
happen

779
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,559
that couldn't be the result um but it

780
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:54,080
just generates you things to work with

781
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,600
gives you

782
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,919
more creative points to start your

783
00:25:57,919 --> 00:25:59,360
analysis with

784
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,320
um typically in terms of a structured

785
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,360
analytical technique

786
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,960
this is done by assembling a group of

787
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,559
analysts with others relevant

788
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:09,520
uh or others with relevant knowledge you

789
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,200
free form generate ideas

790
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,520
which can plausibly fit this supplied

791
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,679
evidence and you never censor an idea

792
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:17,919
you take whatever people throw at you

793
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:19,840
and no matter how outlandish and you

794
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:20,960
throw it up on the board but if it's

795
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,240
real outlandish

796
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,919
you kind of use that as an opportunity

797
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:25,520
to find out why where did that occur to

798
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,480
you what are you thinking

799
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,760
maybe there's some information in that

800
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,520
connection right it didn't occur to you

801
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,760
to think that but they might have some

802
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,559
uh understanding that caused them to you

803
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:35,279
know

804
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:36,880
to reach that conclusion or maybe

805
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,159
they're thinking about the problem space

806
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:39,679
in a completely different way and that's

807
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:41,200
why it seems oddball to you but when you

808
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,159
talk to them about it

809
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:45,360
it'll seem less oddball

810
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,240
how might you use that in infosec so

811
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,679
your new internet of things

812
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:52,240
product must store credentials and

813
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,000
tokens so that it can communicate with

814
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,039
your service

815
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:57,039
however the selected hardware doesn't

816
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:58,080
contain a secure

817
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,720
secure element um it doesn't have any

818
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,720
way to securely store the material or

819
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,919
resist recovery

820
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:05,919
we'll just assume in this this fictional

821
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:07,679
device you can always get these creds

822
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:08,400
off of it

823
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,720
how might you address the risks of

824
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,600
credential theft

825
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,480
or cloning what i don't know but maybe

826
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,360
we would use

827
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,480
brainstorming you might come up with

828
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,559
some ideas maybe there's some

829
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:20,080
other immutable characteristic of the

830
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,760
device we can use to identify it

831
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,360
maybe we don't need to store a specific

832
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,600
token maybe we just don't have

833
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,120
credentials and tokens in the first

834
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,120
place what if we re-thought

835
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,039
how the product works and just got rid

836
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:32,559
of them somehow or

837
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:34,399
maybe it's a feature maybe we want

838
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:36,000
people to clone them maybe that's a

839
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,200
great idea

840
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,120
and it enables you know some sort of

841
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,799
other business model for us with this

842
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:43,440
same widget

843
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,640
um so red team analysis i think

844
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,880
it's it's another technique but i think

845
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,840
it's specifically

846
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,240
in this context we have to be careful uh

847
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,120
to understand

848
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:56,799
what red team analysis uh actually means

849
00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:00,080
uh it's more in the context used

850
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,600
in the structured analytical techniques

851
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,960
of what i would consider a threat

852
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,240
simulation

853
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,840
or an adversary simulation meaning uh uh

854
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:10,559
you are determining you're analyzing

855
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:12,960
what the red team might be able to do

856
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,320
uh instead of red teaming your analysis

857
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,799
so uh how would you do it uh analyst

858
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:20,480
takes on the position of a potential

859
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,360
adversary

860
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,760
just you know rising on uh in the

861
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,480
thought space

862
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,240
and and tries to keep in mind the

863
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,399
motivations and the constraints

864
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:30,559
the adversary is driven by or restricted

865
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:31,520
by

866
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,720
and then they develop a list of

867
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,559
first-person questions the adversary may

868
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:36,320
be trying to answer for themselves

869
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,840
how would i interpret this particular

870
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,840
result or what would my next prior if i

871
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:40,960
reach a certain

872
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,440
point of exploitation what would my next

873
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,279
priority be because what is my ultimate

874
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:46,960
goal it might be specific to these

875
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,240
threat actors

876
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,520
uh you then lay out and prioritize all

877
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,039
the possible next steps

878
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:55,760
an advertary an adversary may take based

879
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,120
on the answers you came up with

880
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,159
those questions when you were sort of

881
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:01,279
play acting in that role

882
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,159
and of course the reason you do that and

883
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:05,600
lay out and prioritize all those

884
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,960
possible next steps is now you've got

885
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:07,520
another

886
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,279
set of great things you can look for and

887
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:11,200
monitor that will help you figure out if

888
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,720
these these sort of activities are

889
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,720
occurring in your environment

890
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,960
an information security example so

891
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:17,760
you've set up

892
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,679
several high interaction honeypot

893
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:21,760
honeypots in various places on your

894
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,799
network periphery

895
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:25,520
you notice a potential attacker always

896
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,200
connects sort of at the same time they

897
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,399
connect real quick

898
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:31,279
they get in they run a few meaningless

899
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:32,399
seeming commands where they just check

900
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:33,279
the user id

901
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:35,520
to make sure they're root uh and you

902
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,679
know maybe they enumerate some processes

903
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:38,000
and

904
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,520
dump some uh information about you know

905
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,120
what kernel it's running and then they

906
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,720
leave and they just do that over and

907
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,600
over and over

908
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,640
and never do anything more with it so

909
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,520
you might find yourself well what's

910
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,159
wrong

911
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:53,679
what's wrong with my honey pots right

912
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:56,559
well you might conjecture well

913
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:58,080
maybe the attacker is detecting it's a

914
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,840
honeypot and just dropping off

915
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,360
so maybe i need to change something up

916
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,279
or you might um

917
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:05,200
decide that the attacker is really

918
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,200
looking for a specific type of host

919
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,399
maybe they need a certain type of

920
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:09,360
processor

921
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,919
certain you know code revision to pull

922
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:13,039
off whatever it is they're looking to

923
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:14,480
exploit this host for

924
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,000
and that's why they're not interested in

925
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
it or

926
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,720
does the attacker have a lot of

927
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,080
compromised systems already

928
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,559
and they're just doing this because they

929
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:25,919
want to know if it's still active

930
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:27,200
they're just keeping it in the loop in

931
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,279
case they ever need it someday and maybe

932
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:30,799
it's all automated maybe no

933
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:33,279
human has ever done this some bot just

934
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:34,720
popped your honey pot and reported home

935
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,080
yeah i got something great

936
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,960
and it goes into some list and c2 and

937
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,799
they'll use it someday maybe

938
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:44,320
um knowing uh the viewpoint of your

939
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,720
attacker like why they may be doing that

940
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,679
in this scenario i threw in oh the ips

941
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:51,279
tips you off that it's some specific

942
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:52,320
actor

943
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,919
i don't know i think that normally

944
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:55,520
happens but let's assume

945
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,200
you know you could say oh well i

946
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,799
understand uh from this

947
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:00,080
attacker's point of view you know

948
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,080
they've got a ton of these things so

949
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,159
likely if we keep watching it eventually

950
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:05,279
they'll come back and want to actually

951
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:08,480
use this for something useful to them

952
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,600
uh so what have we learned uh we've

953
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,760
uh learned if you're concerned about

954
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,120
information quality

955
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,679
then use diagnostic techniques if you're

956
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:19,760
concerned about information biases

957
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,000
use contrarian techniques you're

958
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
concerned about information completeness

959
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,120
use imaginative thinking techniques and

960
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,640
where can you learn more the document

961
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,880
that i started with is fantastic

962
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,799
it goes way into more depth you should

963
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:34,080
really read it if you found any of this

964
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,600
interesting

965
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,240
there's another great document from the

966
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,320
rand corporation where they analyze the

967
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,080
first document and then decide whether

968
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,519
they think it's good or not

969
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:46,159
that's fantastic and then there is a

970
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:47,600
book structured analytic

971
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,600
techniques for intelligence analysis uh

972
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,360
by richard hewer and randolph

973
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,480
pearson uh it's 900 on amazon so i

974
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,519
didn't read that at all

975
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:57,440
i hear it's really good if someone can

976
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,880
get me a copy of that book i would love

977
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,159
to read it but i'm definitely not paying

978
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:01,600
900 bucks

979
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,519
um so if you have any questions i'm

980
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:05,440
rabbit i'm pretty easy to find on

981
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,080
twitter

982
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,399
uh you can email rabbit at rapid.com use

983
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:09,600
the right sixes

984
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,880
uh i will respond to the pgp's around

985
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,399
and uh thank you for listening to me

986
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:16,640
blabber for a half hour about

987
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,039
