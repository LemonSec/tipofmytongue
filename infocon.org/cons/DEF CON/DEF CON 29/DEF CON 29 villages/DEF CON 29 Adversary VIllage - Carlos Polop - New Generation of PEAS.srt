1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:04,880
so um first of all thank you very much

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,040
for having me here today i'm very

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,720
excited to be here at defcon in the

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,480
adversary village

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:13,440
and i hope you like this presentation

6
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:15,519
which is called new generation of peace

7
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,520
um we are going to discuss a little bit

8
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:19,119
more of this piece and why is there a

9
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,840
new generation

10
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:24,400
my name is carlos pollop i work as

11
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:27,519
senior security engineer at middle

12
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:29,840
i have some certifications i

13
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:30,640
play cdf analysis stuff so if you want

14
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,559
to stock

15
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,960
about me if you want to know something

16
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:36,960
else about me just check my linkedin and

17
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,520
you can also contact me via twitter or

18
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,879
even

19
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:43,440
email for the more traditional one

20
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:44,000
so in this talk we are going to talk a

21
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,399
little bit

22
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,920
about the p suite what it is why is it

23
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,640
useful why is there a

24
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:53,039
um a new generation then i'm going to

25
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,000
very briefly introduce hot trees and how

26
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,399
can it be useful

27
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,079
in combination with the b suite and then

28
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,039
we are going to see some demos about

29
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:03,199
limpy's mac peace and wimpy's

30
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,879
at the end we are going to very briefly

31
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:08,479
see what is uh both piece

32
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:09,360
the last p being added just one or two

33
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:10,960
months ago

34
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,040
and then i want to talk a little bit

35
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:16,720
about the to do

36
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:20,159
in order to indicate the community how

37
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:25,200
how you can help to the peace sweet

38
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:25,200
if you like it so sweet peace

39
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,680
this is uh the name piece comes from

40
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,560
privilege escalation not so much script

41
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,360
sheet basically

42
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:36,240
basically this suite is a combination of

43
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,479
scripts that will allow you to enumerate

44
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,880
the most common host and i'm talking

45
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:44,880
about windows linux

46
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:48,320
a unix in general and even mac

47
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:50,079
in order to find um easy ways to

48
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:52,479
escalate privilege

49
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:53,600
so before the p suite there were already

50
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:57,040
a few scripts

51
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:59,520
that perform the these sections but i

52
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,759
i like them but i didn't feel very

53
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,479
comfortable with them because there were

54
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:06,240
a lot of data that was mostly useless

55
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:08,000
and i didn't want to lose my time

56
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:11,280
reading this data and figuring out

57
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,760
if you can use it in any way or not

58
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,200
and because they didn't have enough

59
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,120
checks or at least they didn't have the

60
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,680
text i wanted to import it so that's the

61
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,319
reason i

62
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,280
started this this street so in peace you

63
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:24,319
are going to find

64
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:27,599
a very comprehensive scripts for

65
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:29,200
enumerate host and see how hard

66
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:32,000
they are and how you can escalate

67
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:34,640
privilege you are not going to find

68
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,480
endless data lists so you are going to

69
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,879
know where you need to focus

70
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,640
in order to find these vulnerabilities

71
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:43,280
you are looking for

72
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,000
they have more text that any other tool

73
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,400
at least

74
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,959
i try this and this is because i i

75
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:52,080
mostly have probably one new check

76
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:55,760
per week so that's a very very cool

77
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,560
way to update the scripts as i have said

78
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,959
before the

79
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,480
piece can be executed for linux macos

80
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:03,280
any mostly

81
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,800
any unix flavor and also windows which

82
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,120
is very which is great

83
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,319
anything is the only previous escalation

84
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,280
enumeration tool

85
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:13,599
that can be executed in this amount of

86
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,239
different operative systems

87
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:17,040
but i think the fact that most people

88
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,760
like love

89
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,640
about the piece is that the output if is

90
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,319
colored

91
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,080
this means that you are going to find

92
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,920
for example the color red

93
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,920
where something is suspicious or the

94
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,599
color green where something is well

95
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,519
configured and this is very useful in

96
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:33,280
order to know where you need to focus

97
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:37,040
or where you should focus in order to

98
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:39,360
try to find vulnerabilities

99
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,840
last of the characteristics is the

100
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,159
monitorization

101
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,000
we will talk about this later because

102
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:49,360
actually you cannot use

103
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,000
any monitorization at the moment but my

104
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,720
idea with this piece new generation

105
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,920
scripts

106
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:58,560
is that you are going to be able

107
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,000
to execute the piece in a host as

108
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,280
frequently as you want

109
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,599
and be able to compare different results

110
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,480
in order to see how good you are doing

111
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:08,959
hardening

112
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,159
your systems as i have said this is not

113
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:13,519
available yet but i

114
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:16,079
hope this will be soon and well the more

115
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:18,639
the community gives me the sooner this

116
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:21,759
will be prepared

117
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:23,440
but before going into depth with this i

118
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,960
want to show you what is hacked

119
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:29,840
because this is going to be highly

120
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:29,840
useful when using these tools

121
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:34,320
so i'm going i'm going to open this link

122
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,000
and you can see that hackers is

123
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,000
basically a book

124
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,840
with a lot of cool tricks of hacking but

125
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,320
now you want us to focus

126
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,440
on the privileged escalation checklist

127
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,479
for linux

128
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,440
and windows and in a few weeks i hope i

129
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:50,479
will create one

130
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,520
specifically for mac where you can

131
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:54,080
basically see

132
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,639
some checklist of things that you should

133
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,320
search

134
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:59,840
on each um computer in order to try to

135
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:03,039
find vulnerabilities and

136
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,560
well improve the security or exploitable

137
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:05,440
narratives depending if you are in a

138
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,639
built in or

139
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:10,000
in a red team also hack trees is pretty

140
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,759
useful because

141
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,080
when you execute these tools you are

142
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,919
going to see probably some links

143
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,759
to some parts of the book and this is

144
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:18,720
because if you don't understand the

145
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,280
check

146
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,720
that the script is performing you can

147
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,360
access this

148
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,400
url and you are going to have the theory

149
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,960
about the check

150
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,240
what what is being performed and what

151
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,199
you should check for and

152
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:35,360
how can you exploit a vulnerability a

153
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:38,639
vulnerability form in that section

154
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:40,720
if any you have it for linux for macus

155
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:43,759
in the future i'm just starting

156
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,680
and for windows and to get to give you a

157
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:48,800
very brief example

158
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:51,440
for example let's say that you find some

159
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,039
vulnerability which is related to access

160
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,759
tokens and you don't know what access

161
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,440
tokens

162
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,199
in a windows environment you can just

163
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,919
come here and have a

164
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:01,600
um description about what is the access

165
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:04,240
token how to enumerate them

166
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,080
how can they been abused and everything

167
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:10,000
basically this is pretty useful

168
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:12,319
to know um why are the bees performing

169
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,280
the text they are doing and you how can

170
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:16,400
you exploit them

171
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:18,400
if you find any vulnerability also you

172
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,160
have here the url this is free

173
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:24,319
for everyone you can just access the

174
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,319
book and use it as you please

175
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:30,080
so let's continue

176
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,759
now we are going to start with the demos

177
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,680
we are going first we are going to

178
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,560
perform our linux with limpies and then

179
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,720
a demon with

180
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:40,080
magpies so i have here i have a pretty

181
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,199
vulnerable and very

182
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,560
updated deviant machine that we are

183
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,240
going to

184
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,080
where we are going to execute lymphedes

185
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,919
just to see the vulnerabilities that it

186
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:52,639
is finding

187
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:54,160
so um i have already accessed this

188
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:58,800
machine

189
00:06:54,160 --> 00:07:03,599
via issh so unlock it i'm

190
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:06,960
i am the user user

191
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:07,919
and i'm in this very outdated deviant

192
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,520
machine

193
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:13,599
i have also already uploaded um limpies

194
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,360
so we are just going to execute it first

195
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:17,120
of all take a look at the options

196
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:20,080
because rupees and wheat peas

197
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,800
have um several options that may be

198
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,960
useful

199
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,880
for example in limbs you can find the

200
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,360
dash a this means to perform

201
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,560
all checks and this is because um there

202
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,759
are some checks that are

203
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,919
very very slow or that are very noisy

204
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,599
that by default they aren't executed but

205
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:38,000
if you are playing a ctf

206
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:39,759
or you don't care about being noisy or

207
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,599
about the time i completely recommend

208
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:44,080
you to execute that say because

209
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:45,360
more checks are going to be executed so

210
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,720
you have the super function

211
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:50,560
option and you also have some options

212
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:53,360
that will allow you to perform

213
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,800
network return just using limbics which

214
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,919
is kind of cool because just

215
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,360
with linkage you will be able to

216
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,639
enumerate the machine but also to

217
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,720
enumerate the network

218
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,160
if you don't want to upload any other

219
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,039
tools

220
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:07,039
so let's execute limpies we are just

221
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:09,440
going to run it without passing

222
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:14,639
we we are just going to run links in a

223
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:16,800
normal version so here we can see that

224
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,560
olympus star with a very very very

225
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,960
beautiful banner

226
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,720
um here we can find version we can find

227
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,560
legend this means what

228
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,160
delay indicating what the color means

229
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,840
which is kind of awesome because here we

230
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:31,680
can see that the red yellow

231
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:34,159
indicates a 90 percent 95

232
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,039
percent chance of previous escalation

233
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:37,120
vector

234
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,479
red means that well just take a look at

235
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,880
it and green

236
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:42,800
basically means well configure things or

237
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,640
common things that you

238
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,720
really shouldn't care about because this

239
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,480
was found in other machines

240
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,080
we have some basic information

241
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,200
information about the tools that are

242
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,399
available

243
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:57,440
to enumerate the network and then we

244
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:59,279
start enumerating um the system

245
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,440
so here we can find system information

246
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,640
we can see just in red that the kernel

247
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,480
is pretty burial

248
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,480
the pseudo version is also a little bit

249
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,560
old so probably they are vulnerable

250
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,080
we can see a little more more

251
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,760
information about the systems if you

252
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,880
info environment you may be able

253
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:17,200
able to find some passwords here

254
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,640
um we enumerate also some linux

255
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:22,320
protections like

256
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:24,399
is linux enable enable this aslr

257
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,720
is this a virtual machine actually this

258
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:29,120
is so we have here just

259
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,399
some information about the container if

260
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,320
this was a container but

261
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,320
we are in inside a container so nothing

262
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:37,279
is resting here

263
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,320
devices available software it's good to

264
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:40,320
know if you have

265
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,399
a some compiler or some compiler

266
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,920
available to compile possible kernel

267
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:48,399
exploits

268
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:50,240
then we start taking a look to um

269
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:51,839
two processes that may be vulnerable

270
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,920
just calibri less

271
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,519
binary process permissions ground jobs

272
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,440
and here we can find

273
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:59,200
the first highly probable previous

274
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,839
collision vector that lean piece has

275
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,200
formed

276
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:06,079
so for example here this user is able to

277
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,120
write in a path that is being used in

278
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:09,360
acron

279
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,360
that is then been executed by root

280
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,880
without indicating the path so for

281
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:16,079
example if we

282
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:18,160
create a file called override dot sh

283
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:20,320
with a reversal

284
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,240
in this folder this is going to be

285
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:25,600
executed by root and we are going to

286
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:27,839
obtain a reversal execute by root

287
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,640
um here we can see the link is

288
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,760
enumerated

289
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,640
enumerating more information also

290
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,800
network is

291
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,800
always important to know where you are

292
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:40,079
in in a network

293
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:42,000
and with other networks new networks you

294
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:44,320
can access and enumerate them

295
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,200
here we have just a numerical local

296
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,440
network

297
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,480
and we're going even checking if we can

298
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:52,320
sniff traffic

299
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:54,480
using tcp then we are enumerating

300
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,360
some user information and here we can

301
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,800
see that there are

302
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:01,600
a bunch of ways to escalate privilege

303
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:04,000
by executing different binaries with

304
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,000
sudo

305
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:08,880
more information about the users

306
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:11,519
software information

307
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,320
this is pretty interesting and is one of

308
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:15,120
the main

309
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,240
things of limpis and wind peas and it's

310
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,880
one of the main

311
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,399
new topics in the new generation scripts

312
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,320
so we are going to talk

313
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:24,720
about them later but basically here we

314
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:27,279
are just looking for sensitive

315
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:29,600
files that for files that may be

316
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:32,320
containing sensitive informations

317
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:34,560
related to some specific software for

318
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,760
example some tomcat configuration files

319
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,240
that may have

320
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,440
passwords inside of it you can see that

321
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,079
we are looking for

322
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:44,000
for a bunch of them actually we'll talk

323
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:46,000
about this later

324
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,279
so we are going to continue till the

325
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,639
last section which is

326
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:53,600
interesting files these files

327
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:54,720
and the files that are here are here

328
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,839
just because they have

329
00:11:54,720 --> 00:12:00,480
some interesting facts

330
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:02,399
that will make limbs to enumerate them

331
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,200
for example here we can find all these

332
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:06,880
uid

333
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:08,079
files some of them has been vulnerable

334
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:11,519
in the history in

335
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:13,839
the history so we have here some um

336
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:16,480
some information about in which systems

337
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:19,519
this issue id binary is album

338
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:22,240
and also this uid binaries that aren't

339
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:25,040
known but limpies are going to be well

340
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,839
executed in order to perform a few texts

341
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:29,200
to see

342
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:31,920
if we can abuse these files

343
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:34,399
to to execute arbitrary commands and

344
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:37,839
escalate privilege

345
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:40,000
same thing for s g id files again

346
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:42,720
if you don't know what the file these

347
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,920
files are you can follow this link

348
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:48,639
and you will find all the information

349
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:50,639
um checking this configurations well we

350
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:53,200
are seeing more misconfigurations we can

351
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:57,279
write a few files and folders here that

352
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:59,839
we can absolutely so this is very cool

353
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:01,360
um with availa file so basically here

354
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:03,040
you are going to see that well

355
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,800
in pieces looking for a lot of

356
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:07,040
information that maybe

357
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,880
give you or sensitive information or the

358
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,399
power to escalate periods

359
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,320
always take a look to everything because

360
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:15,760
what you can find um

361
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,720
something something interesting so this

362
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,279
is limpis

363
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,399
now we are going to continue with a mac

364
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:22,720
piece

365
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,720
demo

366
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,360
but this is there is something important

367
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:28,720
that you need to know first of all there

368
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,920
is no mac piece

369
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:34,959
script because mac peace is actually

370
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:36,639
inside of limbs if you execute limb

371
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:39,680
piece inside a mac host

372
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:41,839
macps is going to be execute and i have

373
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:45,279
created this script this way because

374
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:46,639
the code that both scripts both flavors

375
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:49,760
of the scriptures

376
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:52,320
is like 90 percent so almost every

377
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:53,120
every part of the code is served so

378
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,480
ideas

379
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:59,040
generate some specific parts for the

380
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,839
mac version in order to run these parts

381
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,600
in a mac

382
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,040
computer instead of their regular

383
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,880
olympics

384
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,639
but as you can see here just execute

385
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,240
link is in a macro system

386
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:11,120
and the mac piece version will be

387
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,560
automatically automatically executed so

388
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,279
this is very cool because you only need

389
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,760
to know

390
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:16,880
how one script works you know in order

391
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:19,920
to execute it in

392
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:23,680
in linux in microsoft cause i mean

393
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:26,160
any probably potentially any flavor of

394
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,160
unix

395
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:34,079
so my current host is a mac

396
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:37,600
so i i have already executed

397
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:40,000
the lean piece version in my mac

398
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:42,240
actually i haven't executed from file

399
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,519
but i have executed from memory

400
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:49,040
i have just downloaded from

401
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:51,360
github and pipe it into a sh shell

402
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,240
so this way the script is never going to

403
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,519
touch

404
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:57,279
the disk yeah

405
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:59,440
here we can see that i have already

406
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,760
executed because as my hosts have a lot

407
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,120
of

408
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:05,199
more files than a virtual machine this

409
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,760
could take instead of taking just one

410
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:08,079
minute

411
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,360
this could take around 5 minutes 10

412
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:10,320
minutes and i don't want to keep you

413
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,279
waited

414
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,560
so here we can see that the banner is

415
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:16,240
much more ugly i

416
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:19,519
really definitely needs to improve that

417
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:21,760
but well it's not on my priority list

418
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,560
again here we can see some information

419
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:26,000
some basic

420
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:28,000
information we can see some system info

421
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,519
and we can mostly see the same

422
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,360
information

423
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:33,440
from limb piece in mac piece the

424
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,600
difference is like underneath there are

425
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:38,560
different binaries being executed

426
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,600
to obtain the the same information but

427
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,759
it's pretty cool so

428
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,839
because you just need to execute one it

429
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:45,920
is going to be intelligent enough to

430
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:47,440
distinguish between mac or linux and

431
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:50,000
just the correct version

432
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,839
is going to be executed well as you have

433
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,600
said you are going to find

434
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:56,959
most of the same information as before

435
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:59,680
so we can

436
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:00,320
we can pass this output you can just

437
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:03,040
test it

438
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,040
in your own

439
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:09,600
okay okay so

440
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,560
in peace we can start also there are

441
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,839
other

442
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:17,279
more stealthiest way more stealthy ways

443
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:18,000
to execute limpies a bunch of them are

444
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:20,480
mentioned

445
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,680
in the redmi even ways to bypass

446
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,720
antiviruses

447
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:26,240
so um check this out because it's going

448
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,880
to be very cool for you

449
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:31,360
to learn how you can execute olympics

450
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:35,360
probably just using netcat and cool

451
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:38,880
on even without that using um

452
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:42,800
bus pipes so um yeah

453
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,800
that's all for limpies

454
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:48,399
okay so let's continue with win peace

455
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:53,199
when this is obviously the um

456
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:53,199
well the windows version of the script

457
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:58,639
okay so here i have um windows virtual

458
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,480
machine where we are going to execute

459
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:03,360
win piece

460
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,480
um obviously win pieces using a

461
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,919
completely different

462
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:10,240
script that olympus actually there are

463
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:12,319
two different projects for wimpies

464
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:14,559
one is the batch version and the other

465
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:17,760
one is the xc version

466
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:21,280
the batch version is less maintained

467
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:25,280
than the x version and is

468
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:28,319
mostly created for all windows machines

469
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:30,320
so um the most maintained version of one

470
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,720
piece is going to be the x1 and it's the

471
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,880
one i

472
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,400
recommend you to execute if you can

473
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:37,280
obviously there are some

474
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,799
requirements like the net version but

475
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:42,559
mostly you are going

476
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:44,000
in nowadays um windows you are going to

477
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:45,919
be able to execute it so i

478
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,320
definitely recommend you to execute this

479
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:51,679
this version

480
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:55,280
so here also we have a quick start

481
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:58,400
and we also have a few ways to execute

482
00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:00,960
a win piece from memory or win piece

483
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,600
or execute win piece while doing some

484
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,080
kind of

485
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,520
uh stealthy things in order to avoid

486
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,280
antivirus to detect

487
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,799
that we are executing the binary i

488
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:11,679
recommend you to take a look a look

489
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:12,320
because it is pretty interesting win

490
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:14,960
peace

491
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:16,080
also have some interesting parameters

492
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,640
for example

493
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:20,000
windpiece allows you to execute links

494
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,240
and this is very cool because

495
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,559
if you find in a windows the windows

496
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:27,200
subsystem for linux

497
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:28,799
um you can execute linps because it is a

498
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,840
bus script so if you just

499
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:32,240
in the case to win this the url where it

500
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:35,200
can

501
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,320
find lymphe it is going to download and

502
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,520
execute it

503
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:41,520
from memory i think also you don't even

504
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,880
need to host your version of olympus you

505
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:48,080
can just indicate

506
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:50,320
the the url for linps inside github

507
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:52,240
oh well you have also more more help

508
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:54,160
information basic information

509
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,679
what are my colors when you execute win

510
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:58,160
piece without doing anything

511
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:59,200
in a new windows host you are not going

512
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,440
to see any color

513
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,520
you need to execute this first in order

514
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,880
to indicate the registry that hey i want

515
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:07,039
you to

516
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,640
interpret the colors that are going to

517
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:10,400
be displayed just

518
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,760
run this you don't need to be root or

519
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,080
anything and

520
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,039
the colors will magically appear well

521
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:18,320
you need to

522
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:23,440
start another another power cell

523
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:27,200
cell okay so i have already run

524
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:29,280
win piece in this host

525
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,640
we can see that we have another very

526
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,240
beautiful banner

527
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,320
we have some information about the

528
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,720
creators

529
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,600
and we started with limbase we start

530
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,799
seeing some

531
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:44,320
system information we have integrated

532
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:45,520
what's on inside um wimpies so this is

533
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:48,799
pretty cool because

534
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:49,200
it will just run with wind piece here we

535
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:51,840
can

536
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:54,160
find that we have we are numerating the

537
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:56,559
hot fixes

538
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,760
has been applied to the to this virtual

539
00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:00,960
machine in this case

540
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:05,120
information about environment variables

541
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:07,760
um information about audi the web labs

542
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:09,520
w digest again if you don't know what

543
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,240
for example you don't know what is w

544
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:13,200
digest

545
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:14,159
um you can just access this url inside

546
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,559
hack tricks

547
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:17,360
and you will learn what is this and why

548
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:20,880
is

549
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:22,559
this important same lsa protection

550
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:25,600
credential guards

551
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:28,159
so and the main difference between

552
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,440
witness and limb piece apart from the

553
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:31,520
obvious one

554
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,960
is that you are not going to find these

555
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,960
red yellow colors

556
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:37,039
in wind piece that you will find them in

557
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:39,360
in the piece and this is because

558
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:42,159
maybe in wind pieces more complicated to

559
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,960
be sure that something is going to give

560
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:45,520
you

561
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,799
a previous escalation path so i haven't

562
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:51,200
implemented those yet

563
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:53,360
but i may do that in the in the future

564
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:55,280
well as you can see in wind pieces and

565
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:57,840
reading a lot of things

566
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,880
interesting events now we have some user

567
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,600
informations

568
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,799
in red you can find interesting things

569
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,320
for attackers so

570
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:06,400
here you can find a dj series

571
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:08,640
administrator

572
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,760
um homes inside folders something

573
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,320
interesting about

574
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:13,760
a win piece is that he's checking every

575
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:16,799
path that appears

576
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:19,280
so for example if this path was

577
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:20,320
reachable by our current user this will

578
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,320
appear on red

579
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:24,080
and we'll tell you hey you can write

580
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,039
this binary maybe you can escalate

581
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:28,480
privilege because

582
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:30,000
this is being executed as

583
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,919
you can see here obviously you cannot

584
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,280
escalate privilege overriding one piece

585
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:36,400
because this is a binary

586
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:37,919
of this of the user we are using but

587
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,360
maybe if this was being ruled

588
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:41,200
by another user which is an

589
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:43,280
administrator and you can write the

590
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,799
binary you may be able to escalate

591
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:47,919
privilege

592
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:50,880
same for for services information

593
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:52,480
actually here you can see an example of

594
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,880
what i have been talking about

595
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:57,280
and is that this service this binary of

596
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:59,679
this service is reachable by everyone so

597
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,559
here you have a privilege escalation

598
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:03,120
path

599
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:05,039
also win peace is checking for no quotes

600
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,919
and space in the beam path of death

601
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:08,480
services

602
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:10,159
so you may be able to abuse this

603
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:13,360
misconfiguration also through

604
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:15,440
scalia previous more information about

605
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:18,480
applications how to run

606
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,679
same you may find some places that you

607
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,799
can

608
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:24,640
well right on

609
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:26,320
your binary is going to be executed with

610
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:30,559
higher privilege

611
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:30,559
so that's pretty awesome

612
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:37,440
and i want to show you a few more things

613
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:39,120
network information again it's very

614
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,000
important to know where you are inside

615
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,600
an internal

616
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,039
network if you're inside an internal

617
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:45,039
network or any way

618
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:46,640
which other networks you can access that

619
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:50,159
you weren't able to access

620
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:53,360
before and also it's important to check

621
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:55,360
the ports i don't have well

622
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:57,039
udp the ports that i'll be that are

623
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,840
listening just in localhost because

624
00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:00,480
maybe

625
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,960
these services are vulnerable and you

626
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:05,120
can

627
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:08,159
well escalate privileges i'm using those

628
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:13,520
we found some well the

629
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:13,520
ntlm has of our current user i think

630
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,480
user yeah

631
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:23,840
we form the unattended file this may uh

632
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:25,919
have credentials of the administrator

633
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:27,760
user

634
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:29,679
and this is pretty awesome because you

635
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,720
can see here this section in the file

636
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:34,240
analysis

637
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:35,600
section and we are also looking for a

638
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,360
lot of files

639
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,720
that may be storing sensitive

640
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:41,840
information

641
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:44,400
so before the piece new generation every

642
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:47,279
time i wanted to search for a file that

643
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:49,600
may be containing

644
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:50,880
sensitive information i needed to ask

645
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,880
add an specific

646
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:55,279
check to lean peace and then on a

647
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:58,480
specific check to win this

648
00:23:55,279 --> 00:24:01,840
which was pretty awful because well

649
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:05,120
it was kind of hard and well

650
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:06,559
it took several minutes with the new new

651
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,799
generation scripts

652
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:10,000
we have this build list inside this

653
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:13,039
build this

654
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:16,840
folder we have this sensitive file jamal

655
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:20,480
where you can find all the sensitive

656
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:21,840
potential files that can storage

657
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,840
that kind of storage sensitive

658
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:25,679
information this is pretty awesome

659
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:29,679
because for example

660
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:33,440
filezilla is

661
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:34,159
is specifying to search the folder with

662
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,880
the name

663
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:37,440
filezilla and inside this folder to

664
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:41,200
search

665
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:44,240
the file called sitemanager.xml

666
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:47,039
and if it is found print in red

667
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:48,720
all the lines that contain some of those

668
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:51,039
regresses

669
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,760
so this is pretty awesome because um

670
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:55,200
lean piece

671
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:56,000
and win piece are a automatically

672
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:59,440
created

673
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:02,880
using this general so so both of them

674
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:04,640
are going to search all these files and

675
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:07,120
if they found them while executing they

676
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,640
are going to bring them to you

677
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:10,720
this is very awesome because now in

678
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:13,919
order to just add a new

679
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:15,360
check if i want to this if i discover a

680
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:17,840
new file that maybe contains

681
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,400
sensitive information i can just add it

682
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,480
to this

683
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:22,159
journal and this is going to and the

684
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,279
newly in peace and wimpies are going to

685
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:25,919
automatically be

686
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:26,960
built and are going to be searching for

687
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:30,080
the news

688
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:32,720
sensitive file so this is

689
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,600
very easy to maintain and also it's very

690
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,320
easy for

691
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,760
the community to help me adding new

692
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:40,559
files that may be storing

693
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:41,039
sensitive information actually you have

694
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:44,080
here

695
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:46,559
a few examples well explain it

696
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:48,240
so if you want to just contribute to

697
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:49,919
this script because you know

698
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,360
about this file that may be containing

699
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:53,919
credentials that aren't

700
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,799
included included yet just take a look

701
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:56,720
to the example

702
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:58,480
including in general create a pull

703
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,640
request to master

704
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,000
and the new versions are going to be

705
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:05,760
automatically built

706
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:11,840
so it's just awesome

707
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:11,840
um as i have said before

708
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:17,360
win peace has another flavor which is

709
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:20,080
the bats one

710
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:21,200
which is meant for all machines actually

711
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,960
the syntax

712
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:25,440
is a little bit more complicated because

713
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:28,480
batch is not very flexible

714
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:30,480
anyway if you need to use it at any

715
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:34,159
point you can find it here

716
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:36,880
and also take a look to this explanation

717
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:38,960
of how to understand the permissions

718
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:41,120
because you will need it in order to

719
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,720
find the paths to escalate privilege

720
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:44,080
because here you are not going to find

721
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,159
colors

722
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:48,720
well because match is not very very very

723
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:48,720
flexible

724
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:56,320
so we are in this presentation

725
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,360
we are going to continue with both piece

726
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:01,120
i created this

727
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:02,799
like um one or two months ago i think

728
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:05,120
this is very very a very very simple

729
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:06,960
script this is basically monitoring new

730
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,640
cbs and the ones

731
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,799
that are related to privileges

732
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:14,799
escalation are going to be

733
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:17,120
indicated in this um group of telegram

734
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:18,720
and in this group we also discuss about

735
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:21,200
hot trees peace

736
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,000
and latest news in cyber security so

737
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:25,600
it's free for

738
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:28,559
everyone you feel free to to join it

739
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:29,440
and also you can find bot piece in

740
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:35,840
github

741
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:35,840
you can find it um

742
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:41,919
you can find it here and actually this

743
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:43,760
this bot allows you to create your own

744
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:48,159
boat in order to monitor

745
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:50,799
your own um the cvs you're interested in

746
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:52,320
so basically you can modify this general

747
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:55,520
and set your own

748
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:59,039
um keywords and then put your

749
00:27:55,520 --> 00:28:03,440
slab webhood or your telegram token

750
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:06,880
and the bot will send you um all the new

751
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:08,159
cvs that are this color that contains

752
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:11,760
the keyboard the

753
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:13,919
keywords that you have specified here

754
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:16,399
in this case we are just looking for

755
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:18,240
things related to previous collision

756
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:19,520
yeah i think it's stupid escalation or

757
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,720
dog air

758
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,720
container escape

759
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,279
okay

760
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:32,320
so yeah feel free to join the group if

761
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:35,440
you please

762
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:38,399
finally about the to-do

763
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:40,080
