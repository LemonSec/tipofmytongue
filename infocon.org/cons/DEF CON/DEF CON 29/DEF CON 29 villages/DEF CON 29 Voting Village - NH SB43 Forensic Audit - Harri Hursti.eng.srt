1
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:04,720
hello my name is harry hurston

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:08,080
and this is talk about uh senate bill

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,599
43 new hampshire windham

4
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:13,920
election forensic election audit we

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:14,920
conducted

6
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:19,039
in may and published a report

7
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:23,039
out in mid-july

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,519
first of all we were a team

9
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:30,880
myself a professor philip stark

10
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,559
from uc berkeley and mark lindemann from

11
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:37,920
verified voting how we were chosen

12
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,360
was that i was appointed by the

13
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,840
secretary of state and attorney general

14
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,200
of jointly between

15
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,559
the secretary of state and attorney

16
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,399
general of new hampshire

17
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:50,960
uh mark lindemann was appointed by the

18
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:51,680
selectmen

19
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,120
of the town of windham and we jointly

20
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,600
chosen the third person to be professor

21
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,320
philip stark

22
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,719
so first of all why we are talking about

23
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,799
election machines at all

24
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,240
this is a little bit of my personal

25
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,840
story i started vote

26
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,840
hacking election machines in summer of

27
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,080
2005.

28
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,960
and i got involved by being invited by

29
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:15,600
election

30
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,200
bechten elekson uh supervisor ion sancho

31
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,400
of the capital of florida tallahassee

32
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,439
he was responsible for the

33
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,479
widely popular widely publicized at 2000

34
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:30,079
2004 recounts

35
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:32,880
and when the supreme court stopped his

36
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,320
effort to find out

37
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,840
the truth uh what happened

38
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,479
he felt that he needs to know more and

39
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:41,920
he wasn't fully

40
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,920
appreciating the claim that voting

41
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,439
machines cannot be hacked

42
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,119
so he wanted to know the truth how the

43
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:48,720
voting machines

44
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,159
work after the work we did in

45
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,640
in florida i was participating in a

46
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,759
number of

47
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:58,719
state commissioned voting machine

48
00:01:58,719 --> 00:01:59,520
studies

49
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,560
one of those largest ones is from 2007

50
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,719
everest by secretary of state ohio

51
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,840
it's a sad fact that the study we made

52
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,840
2007 is still valid

53
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,800
uh most of the the same systems are

54
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,000
still in use

55
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,400
uh very few of the of the systems have

56
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,239
had software upgrades

57
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,040
and you still literally have the same

58
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,319
software up and running which we

59
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:27,200
published the vulnerabilities 2007.

60
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,879
uh even the some vendors which have

61
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:31,840
published

62
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,160
a software upgrade to their system those

63
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:34,959
supply

64
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:37,280
upgrades are very seldom put in use and

65
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,239
deployed

66
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,440
so we have a the united states elections

67
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,640
are run with a lot of very old systems

68
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,640
and i have been doing similar studies

69
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,160
around the world outside of united

70
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,120
states

71
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,239
i'm also a co-organizer co-founder of

72
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:53,680
the voting machine hacking village here

73
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,720
at defcon

74
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,560
and also with alex and integrity

75
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,760
foundation

76
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,720
more recently uh the emmy nominee we

77
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,959
received an emmy nomination for

78
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,599
both of our our uh documentary movies

79
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:06,800
with hbo

80
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,200
back in 2006 hbo documented hacking

81
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,120
democracy was the first one

82
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,080
to lie to the general audience a

83
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,000
problems in voting technology

84
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,400
and then the new one the kill chain the

85
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,400
cyber war on america's elections

86
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,599
we received a emmy nomination on that

87
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:27,280
just few weeks ago our mission

88
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,920
in in defcon uh in a hot modding machine

89
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,519
hacking village is not to prove that

90
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:33,040
voting machines can be hacked

91
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,599
every single machine we have in a room

92
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:36,799
every single machine is in

93
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,200
is any use in the united states but

94
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,560
every single voting machine

95
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,000
has been hacked and their known

96
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,319
vulnerabilities our mission is

97
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:45,519
educational

98
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,000
we want people to be able to see the

99
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,560
truth

100
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,879
and and experience the technology the

101
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:51,760
old technology

102
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,480
themselves if they have concerns about

103
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,319
the software if they have concerns about

104
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,120
hardware

105
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,080
experience themselves how the systems

106
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,360
actually work

107
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,959
there's nothing which makes me more

108
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,439
happy than when local election officials

109
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,519
come to hack the very machine

110
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:09,760
they are using in their jurisdictions

111
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,120
under the election and this is the first

112
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,519
time when they are allowed to do so

113
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,680
so this is something where they ask the

114
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,040
first and often last line of defense uh

115
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,720
they need to have that knowledge they

116
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,240
need to have the experience

117
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,160
and so that they also understand what

118
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,520
kind of mitigations needs to be done

119
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,120
when you look the the voting systems

120
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,000
we have a lot of things where we can

121
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,560
lower

122
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,840
the risk by using mitigation strategies

123
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:45,120
better physical security etc etc

124
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,639
so our mission is to educate people and

125
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,400
before we started the voting machine

126
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,400
hacking village

127
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,880
there was a very small number of

128
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,880
privileged people who have been part of

129
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,320
these

130
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,960
election system studies we have

131
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,639
single-handedly hundred-fold

132
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,400
number of people who have first-hand

133
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,840
experience on the machine

134
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,080
by just having this room and and having

135
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,000
people to be able to experience the

136
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,759
technology and and find the truth

137
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:16,960
now when we go to this extremely heated

138
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,880
uh 2020 election uh i along with

139
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,560
59 scientists and

140
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,400
election security experts we signed a

141
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,360
letter in 16th of november

142
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,560
where we underline that extraordinary

143
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,680
claims require extraordinary evidence

144
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,520
and while we have seen a lot of claims

145
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,600
uh we have been not being found a single

146
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,560
appearance at that time where these

147
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,840
vulnerabilities

148
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,639
either are real or they have raised in

149
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:51,440
the level

150
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,520
of possibly changing the outcome of the

151
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,960
election

152
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,280
we keep on looking every single time a

153
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,520
new claim is coming along and we have

154
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,639
access we always keep keep our eye on

155
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,319
and want to study and

156
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,680
want to research any claim or with the

157
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,919
election technology in a 2020 election

158
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,800
uh like the audit which we are going to

159
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,919
be talking now

160
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:19,280
there are a instances where the results

161
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,280
were inaccurate but like in the case of

162
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,120
the new hampshire audit which we're

163
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,880
going to talk the

164
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,120
the inaccuracy didn't change the outcome

165
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,160
of the election

166
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,560
the same people get elected even when

167
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,400
there was a discrepancy in the number of

168
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,319
votes

169
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:39,520
so we're still uh largely behind this

170
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,080
letter

171
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,039
and the text uh but we keep on looking

172
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:43,360
and

173
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,199
and we have to remember how long are the

174
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,319
top lead times from a evidence and and

175
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:51,120
be able to

176
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,840
look in this so we keep on looking and

177
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,560
we keep on

178
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,160
uh developing a strategies to mitigate

179
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,639
against the risks because even if the

180
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,120
discrepancy didn't change the outcome of

181
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,720
hilox and there's always a lesson to be

182
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,199
learned

183
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,800
to improve the election we have to

184
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,319
improve our elections

185
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,720
a lot

186
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,720
a little bit about new hampshire

187
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,880
elections new hampshire is using

188
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,199
a handmark paper ballots no ballot

189
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,240
marking devices no no electronic voting

190
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,919
everything is done with handmark paper

191
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:24,400
ballots which is the most secure way of

192
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,080
voting

193
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,720
the from the election purposes the new

194
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,360
hampshire is organized to 320 thousand

195
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,240
words

196
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,599
and 123 of those

197
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:38,080
count only by hand new hampshire

198
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:38,720
elections

199
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,680
in the smaller jurisdictions can count

200
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,759
with hand without using voting machines

201
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:45,520
larger jurisdictions require voting

202
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,360
machines 197

203
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,400
use those and this is the this is normal

204
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,440
in the united states

205
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,360
we every state have their own election

206
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,919
laws uh some states have very complex

207
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,280
ballots they

208
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,039
they're even the smaller jurisdictions

209
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:01,280
we need to have a voting machines to

210
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:05,039
to reduce the error rate um

211
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,520
but we humans we are slow and error

212
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,639
prone so we are not

213
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,599
optimal counting machines for ballots

214
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:13,759
the combination should be using a voting

215
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,440
machine which you don't trust and then

216
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,560
verify the result

217
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,840
with a mandatory risk limiting audits

218
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,520
in new hampshire uh there is a they are

219
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,280
right now new hampshire is is

220
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,840
piloting with the risk limiting audits

221
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,840
the process in new hampshire is that the

222
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,280
candidates can request

223
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,679
a recount if they think that the result

224
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,958
was inaccurate

225
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,958
and recal recounts are very common in

226
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,360
new hampshire there were 16 recounts

227
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,880
requested and conducted

228
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,919
after the 2020 election and seven

229
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,959
after the state primary new hampshire

230
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,880
also has a safety mechanisms

231
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,040
in place one of the one of the many

232
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,360
safety mechanisms is ballast rotation

233
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,080
which means that the parties and the

234
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:56,800
candidates

235
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,640
appear in a different order in a ballot

236
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,080
so in one town

237
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,080
it might be republicans all the way left

238
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,839
and democrat next and the other

239
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,160
on the right and the next town over

240
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,680
where it's different ballot it is

241
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,000
other is first and then democrats are

242
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,120
centered et cetera

243
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,560
so those all are in the rotation

244
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,680
the same way if there is a

245
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,320
race where you have a multiple

246
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,440
candidates per

247
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,720
party and in multiple jurisdictions then

248
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,040
the candidates are rotating

249
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,600
when the parties are rotating from left

250
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,440
to right then the party candidates are

251
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,959
returning from top to bottom

252
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:37,279
in this recount hundred count which was

253
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,240
uh which

254
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,399
started this whole thing most motion the

255
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,320
last this was the largest numerical

256
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,440
discrepancy

257
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,640
between the machine count and the human

258
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,120
count

259
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,480
uh and that was a 300 votes and because

260
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,920
new hampshire didn't have a mechanism

261
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,120
to find the explanation why there was

262
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,959
this 300

263
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:01,760
300 vote difference that required the

264
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,399
state legislators to take an action

265
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,440
and pass a new law authorizing this

266
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,640
audit the forensic audit

267
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,240
so i have a typo it's sp43

268
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,160
so this was a reaction to the rockham

269
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,640
county district 7 context

270
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,880
and that contest is a eight candidates

271
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,079
vote for any four

272
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:30,320
that's the format in new hampshire when

273
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,959
recount is hundred count is done it's

274
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:34,959
customary that all candidates

275
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:37,920
gain more votes and this is because

276
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,480
people

277
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,839
are voting uh by feeling the ballot

278
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:44,079
inaccurately maybe

279
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:46,399
circling the name or underlining the

280
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,760
name or whatnot

281
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,079
making the mark in a way that the voting

282
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:52,480
machine didn't recognize that as a vote

283
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,880
but the human looking into the voters

284
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,760
intent

285
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,399
clearly understands who the vote was for

286
00:10:58,399 --> 00:10:58,959
and

287
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:02,079
this is the mechanism why the hand

288
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:02,720
counts

289
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,000
always uh tend to have more votes uh to

290
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,360
all candidates

291
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,959
however this time uh in the handgun

292
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:14,480
the uh each of the republican candidates

293
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,600
gained about 300 extra votes the three

294
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,160
of the

295
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,000
of the democratic candidates gained

296
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,160
about 25 votes

297
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,720
and the the woman who asked for a

298
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,000
recount she lost

299
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,760
99 votes so there was a two different

300
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,519
discrepancies first of all

301
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:37,040
it was not clear how it's possible that

302
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,000
in the hand count she lost that many

303
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,720
votes

304
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,839
but also 300 votes was more than the

305
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:44,720
traditional

306
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,920
in in in this context of the of the

307
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,399
elections of the election 300 was a high

308
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,200
number

309
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,880
for extra votes the whole election was

310
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,920
a ten thousand and six ballots so that

311
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,200
gives you size

312
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,240
and this audit was starting from this

313
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,200
local

314
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,000
down the ballot race it had nothing to

315
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,680
do with the presidential race

316
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,920
it had nothing to do with the top of the

317
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,120
ballot tickets

318
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,440
this was a a single discrepancy found

319
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,800
in this recount in this one local race

320
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,199
only

321
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,680
this is what the ballot looks like um

322
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,800
again this may be

323
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,800
giving a better idea what when i say

324
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,720
that battle rotation changes the names

325
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,040
of

326
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,360
them the order of the of the political

327
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,160
parties

328
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,920
from left to right and then if the same

329
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:41,200
candidates are in multiple uh

330
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,560
races then from top to bottom

331
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,880
rotating the name of the candidate you

332
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,000
also see that

333
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,600
the uh the names of the democratic and

334
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,079
republican candidates are not on the

335
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:55,279
same line

336
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:58,800
and this was on purpose uh the the

337
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,880
the reason why this is done this way in

338
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,320
new hampshire was

339
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,519
that it was a

340
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,279
if they want to make clear that the

341
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:08,720
voters understand

342
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,040
that the candidates are not running

343
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,320
against each other

344
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,519
you can pick any four you are not bound

345
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:16,000
to be

346
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,320
making the choice between two candidates

347
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,600
who are in the same row

348
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,440
so so this uh physical setting of the

349
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,320
of the candidates having the democratic

350
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,279
candidates one

351
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:30,480
uh row below was to try to make sure

352
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,680
that the voters understand how the

353
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,600
ballot is constructed and

354
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,639
don't have the misconception that the

355
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,480
candidates would be running against each

356
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,800
other

357
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:47,360
this is the voting machine used in new

358
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,000
hampshire

359
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,760
it's a accu vote precinct optical scan

360
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,279
machine

361
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,920
it's a very old model we go back to that

362
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:56,959
in a moment of

363
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:00,160
the technical specifications it is also

364
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,320
widely used in other states so this is

365
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,680
this is not

366
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,000
a only in new hampshire this is widely

367
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,480
used in in all the states of new england

368
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,880
but also in other words these have been

369
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,079
used previously

370
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:14,800
in large states like california not

371
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,760
anymore

372
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,800
why the used machine

373
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:21,920
and just because it's old doesn't mean

374
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,360
it's bad

375
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,519
first of all this machine was originally

376
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:27,920
developed in 1986

377
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,160
and it's believed that it was first time

378
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,480
used in elections uh in general election

379
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,440
1990

380
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,800
it started to be marketed in 1989 and

381
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,720
the first election where was believed to

382
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,920
be used was in minnesota

383
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,199
this is extraordinarily old technology

384
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:48,800
the the cpu of that is a system-on-chip

385
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,440
it's a

386
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,480
microcontroller version of v20

387
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,839
it's a v-neck v25 it's a pin compatible

388
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:58,399
with an intel 808

389
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,560
and instruction compatible with a 180

390
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,760
186

391
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,880
so this is the first ibm pc

392
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,079
era technology that

393
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:10,320
chip cannot address memory more than one

394
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,279
megabyte

395
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,600
that's the maximum size of a memory this

396
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,480
is uh this is

397
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,519
really that old in this particular

398
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:21,440
uh system there's 256 kilobytes of ram

399
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,959
that's all this is not scanning an image

400
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,040
of the battle this is a technology

401
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,600
called optical marker recognition

402
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,839
which means that the scanner is looking

403
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,199
for a landmark

404
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:35,680
called landmarks going timing marks and

405
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,920
finding the vote targets from the cross

406
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,959
sections

407
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:42,800
of those marks so inside of the memory

408
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,120
of

409
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,600
the of the machine there's never a

410
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,519
picture never an image of the

411
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,800
of the ball a ballot only these cross

412
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,839
sections

413
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:56,720
the scanner itself is reading 36

414
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,839
positions per line that's

415
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,720
all and the lines are separate one

416
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,320
quarter inch from each other

417
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,079
so in a sense this is a 36 pixels

418
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:11,279
for the whole side of the of of the ball

419
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,120
of the line

420
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,639
this is uh the scanner is using a

421
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:20,959
laser diodes and so which are orange red

422
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:24,399
in color so on purpose this voting

423
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,880
machine is color blind for a color

424
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,160
red on on orange red it doesn't if you

425
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,959
have a marking made with a red pen

426
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:34,959
and mark your vote with a red pen the

427
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:36,079
voting machine will

428
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:40,479
not read it it will not understand it

429
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:43,759
the software itself is stored in two

430
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:47,360
uh eeprom chips uh 128k

431
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,959
and 64k chips these are eeproms not

432
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:53,440
eeproms and eeprom means that

433
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,720
the chip can be erased only by using

434
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,000
a intense ultraviolet light this

435
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,360
the machine itself cannot erase the chip

436
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,280
only way you can erase the chip and

437
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,359
reprogram you physically have to remove

438
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:07,839
the chip

439
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,400
from the voting machine place it for 20

440
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,640
minutes under an intense ultraviolet

441
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,400
light and after it's erased

442
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,520
then you can use a universal programmer

443
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,079
to write the new software into the chip

444
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,520
for this reason the chips

445
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:25,039
are the chips has a clear

446
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:28,720
mirror for the ultra white light to

447
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,320
reach the silicon chip

448
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,039
and always when the ships are programmed

449
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:33,360
uh

450
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,039
a a piece of paper or something has been

451
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:37,520
put

452
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:41,280
is put in top of a top of the lens

453
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,559
preventing a accidental unstability by

454
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:47,919
a a burst or ultra rail light old

455
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,240
camera flashes for example could cause

456
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,200
an instability

457
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,960
this system doesn't have any traditional

458
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,440
operating system this is a special

459
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,799
purpose

460
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:03,840
computer it's not pc compatible

461
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,840
as such uh the whole operating system

462
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,440
is replaced with a a micro kernel

463
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,440
and the micro kernel is living on the

464
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,960
same chips as

465
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,640
the application software running the

466
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,039
election

467
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:23,039
there's a plenty of empty space in in on

468
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:24,559
the ship so how it's the

469
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:28,000
actual software is only 143

470
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,200
kilobytes everything gone by

471
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,360
this system doesn't have hard drive or

472
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,880
any other form

473
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,360
a flash memory any kind of storage which

474
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,880
can be rewritten

475
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,000
in inside of the of the system uh to

476
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,440
store stuff only place where you can

477
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,480
store

478
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,480
anything and where the election is

479
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,600
living is

480
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,039
a epson style j40

481
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:57,200
card edge connector uh battery refresh

482
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,240
static ram card typically

483
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,880
these these cars are manufactured in 32

484
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,120
64 128k

485
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,080
but typically only the first 32k is in

486
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,440
use on this card and

487
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,240
the picture of that memory card is on

488
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,480
the left

489
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,280
so this is an extremely limited single

490
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:17,919
purpose

491
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:21,600
computer where your

492
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,799
where a attacker's surface

493
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:28,880
is very small and this is not because

494
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,440
of design of worrying about security

495
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,200
this is so old

496
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,200
that at the time when this machine was

497
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,559
designed

498
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:40,240
cyber warfare was bad science fiction

499
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,440
this is a hallmark of how old this

500
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,480
computer that's

501
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,559
this is even better than most of the

502
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,919
hardened uh

503
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:50,799
systems of today just because how

504
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,320
limited the capabilities

505
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:56,000
of the system were at the time

506
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,360
here's the picture of the voting

507
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,039
machine's internals

508
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:03,440
there you see the two chips with a a

509
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,320
white

510
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,960
stickers those are the rom chips uh

511
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,559
containing the software

512
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:11,919
the two chips the left side of the the

513
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,520
chips in the on or with the white

514
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,600
stickers those are the the ram chips are

515
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,840
128k

516
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,760
frames twos or 256 and the square

517
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:25,480
chip on the side that is the v25

518
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:29,919
microcontroller as you can see this is a

519
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:33,120
from the era where a a normal

520
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,240
t 74 series tl uh

521
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,120
logic ships were used this is a very

522
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,080
very old design

523
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:44,960
also i would uh like to point out that

524
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,039
because of the limited horsepower

525
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:49,440
is this this machine cannot even if you

526
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,440
would introduce a wireless

527
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,440
uh a controller this doesn't have the

528
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,360
horsepower to drive wi-fi this doesn't

529
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,840
have a horsepower to drive bluetooth

530
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,240
the all only connections this machine

531
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,039
was

532
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:04,960
originally having was a rs232

533
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:09,200
serial port with a maximum speed of 96

534
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,559
9600 bits per second and a modem with a

535
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:16,240
maximum speed of 2400 bits per second

536
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,480
but as a security measurement in new

537
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,480
hampshire

538
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,360
uh the modem has been physically removed

539
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,960
uh the sticker

540
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,520
on the the white sticker in in top of

541
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,240
the

542
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,120
plastic that's where the modem was

543
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,320
before it was removed

544
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,280
and also the cables for the serial port

545
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,640
has been

546
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,000
cut and removed so in new hampshire this

547
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,360
voting machine has

548
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,520
no means of communicating with the

549
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,799
outside world

550
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:49,039
by any other means than the memory card

551
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:52,400
you can also notice the copper

552
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,559
color inside of the plastic this was the

553
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:55,679
way how

554
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:58,799
electromagnetic radiation shielding was

555
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:00,159
done back those days

556
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:02,880
that is a faraday cage which is which

557
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,600
has been

558
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,880
done by uh spraying the inside of the

559
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,919
plastic case

560
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:11,600
with a copper so this

561
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,919
from the electromagnetic emissions point

562
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:15,919
of view this is an extremely quiet and

563
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:16,720
well-sealed

564
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,200
machine and of course inside of the

565
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:19,919
machine

566
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:23,520
there's additional shielding for a a

567
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,559
a combinance which might be radiating

568
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:27,440
more

569
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,480
the compartment on the left is where the

570
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,559
battery so this machine is intended to

571
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,159
be able to operate

572
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:38,000
uh without a external power for limited

573
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,679
limited time so power cut wouldn't be

574
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:44,559
stopping the election i would also point

575
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:44,960
out

576
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,799
an interesting thing which we will come

577
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:49,039
back later which is that when you look

578
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:49,840
the center

579
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,880
of the of the voting machine you see a

580
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,520
white

581
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:57,039
line on the top of the metal casing

582
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:59,039
we will get back to that white line

583
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,440
later

584
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,480
so this is the law which was a

585
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,280
authorizing this audit and as you can

586
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:09,919
see

587
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:13,360
this is really a targeting the rokham

588
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,559
district

589
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:17,679
number seven which is windham and that

590
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:21,120
arrays only but as a measurement

591
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,520
they are asking for recounting two other

592
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,960
races just to make sure

593
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,960
that whatever is uh is the cause of the

594
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,760
discrepancy wouldn't be affecting uh

595
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,679
other races so this was a security

596
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:36,080
measurement to take a into account

597
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,600
a uh two wider races just in case uh it

598
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,719
will reveal something

599
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,919
and the law called us to uh

600
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:50,960
throw or use all four machines in that

601
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:51,520
county

602
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,159
to count every single ballot so it's a

603
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:56,080
little bit different procedure than what

604
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,919
is used in election day where

605
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:00,159
the vote the ballots were divided

606
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:01,679
between four machines

607
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:04,960
and then also take the custardy of the

608
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,200
ballots understanding how the population

609
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,440
of used unused ballots etc

610
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,640
is maintained and then hand count uh

611
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,960
everything the their hand count those

612
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:15,840
three races

613
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,600
the state represents the governor and

614
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,080
united states senator having a local

615
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,520
race statewide race

616
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:26,000
and federal race uh in a hand count

617
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,279
this was the scope of the of the

618
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:33,200
audit and we were we were told and

619
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,600
authorized if we find something which

620
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,400
expands

621
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,279
a larger we can follow the evidence

622
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:40,480
wherever the evidence

623
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,279
will lead us because the intention was

624
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:44,159
to find out

625
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:47,200
what caused this discrepancy even when

626
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,480
the discrepancy

627
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,559
didn't change the outcome of the of the

628
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:51,919
rackham district

629
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:55,440
7 race

630
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,120
the first order of business was that we

631
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,559
machine counted

632
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:04,000
every single ballot uh

633
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,840
there are a number of ways you can do

634
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,120
the machine count

635
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:10,159
uh you could have a remove the cards

636
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:12,080
from the voting machine make a

637
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,480
a image of the voting machine with a

638
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,600
third-party device

639
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:20,320
we decided not to do that because the

640
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,520
this

641
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,240
technology is arcane so we would have

642
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,480
needed to use a third-party device which

643
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,880
nobody else have audited

644
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,120
so it would have raised a concerns

645
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,000
potentially

646
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,559
what happened when the cars were removed

647
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:35,840
and

648
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,600
from the ceiling and placed to this

649
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,679
device we could have used the voting

650
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:40,799
machine

651
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:43,600
to make a copies of the memory cards but

652
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,559
since we were

653
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:46,720
auditing the voting message it would be

654
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,480
illogical to trust

655
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,480
the voting machine to create a forensic

656
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,600
evidence for us

657
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,840
when the voting machine is is in in

658
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,440
doubt because new hampshire had removed

659
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,240
the cables

660
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,559
that was not an option so the last thing

661
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:01,440
which we

662
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,480
which we chose to do was in order to

663
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:04,880
have

664
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:09,440
the best uh possible

665
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:13,039
security for and and also make gaining

666
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:16,320
and regaining the public trust we only

667
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,919
resetted the counters of the election

668
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:22,240
previous election after printing on

669
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,279
audit tapes

670
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:25,520
and we left the cars fully sealed into

671
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,240
the machine with no physical access

672
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,520
preset the voting machine mode from post

673
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,360
election back to pre-election

674
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,640
and run it as it is and

675
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,600
also setting up the clock of the of the

676
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,360
voting machine back to the november

677
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,520
election day

678
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,640
so when we started when we processed the

679
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,080
paper ballots

680
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:52,320
uh with the uh same memory cards except

681
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,200
that now we

682
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,039
put all the ballots through every

683
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:56,240
machine

684
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,799
we got the results which were a little

685
00:26:58,799 --> 00:26:59,840
bit different than

686
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,400
what was the 2020 election and remember

687
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,000
at the time when we started this we

688
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,039
don't know

689
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:07,679
which one is closer to true is the hand

690
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:08,799
counter problem

691
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:10,480
is the message encounter problem are

692
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,039
they both wrong we don't we cannot this

693
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:13,279
is

694
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:16,799
a the starting point was we don't know

695
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:18,880
where the what is the source of the

696
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,880
discrepancy was it the human count or is

697
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,279
it a matching con

698
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:26,720
so first when we ran all the ballots

699
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,240
through we found a

700
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,279
a plus -2 difference in 10 000 for the

701
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:32,320
presidential race

702
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:36,240
we found in governor's race a 50 to 60

703
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,240
fewer plans between those four machines

704
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,399
because again of all four machines have

705
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:41,600
a little bit different

706
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,720
results the usn8 the exit console

707
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:48,159
very small that change is a big issues

708
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:48,640
in

709
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:52,240
the state represent race and then rest

710
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,279
very small discrepancies but these

711
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:56,640
results were different

712
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,600
than the 2020 elections so now these

713
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,760
voting machines didn't even agree with

714
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:02,720
themselves so

715
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,120
now we have we have to think of what has

716
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,720
changed with the memory card didn't

717
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,600
change

718
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,840
um what has changed why we have a

719
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,279
different kind of results

720
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:13,520
this was the first clue for us in our

721
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,640
journey to

722
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,760
follow the evidence

723
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,000
this is as the numbers are the hand

724
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,919
counts uh between the

725
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:25,039
2020 hand code and 21 hand count and the

726
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:26,159
machine calls

727
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:28,559
now we see that the two matching do your

728
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:30,159
hand counts agree

729
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:32,960
very closely to each other which gives

730
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,080
us a

731
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,919
a strong evidence that the hand count

732
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:37,600
result was the wrong

733
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,159
right result and the machine count

734
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:42,000
results were the incorrect

735
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,440
results so this was the first critical

736
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,200
piece now we know

737
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,480
that the probably the main cause is not

738
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,159
hand count probably the main cause

739
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:54,000
is the machine count being wrong and the

740
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,480
machine is counting them differently

741
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,720
the other part which we found

742
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,600
immediately was

743
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,559
that this the voting machines the four

744
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:04,559
voting machines didn't produce

745
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:06,399
exactly the same results between each

746
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:09,039
other so we had a variation

747
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:12,159
of the results between the machines we

748
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:13,039
can see

749
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:15,360
that two of the machines are closely

750
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,799
matching each other

751
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:20,159
one machine is a little bit off and

752
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:24,080
one machine is way off from the others

753
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:28,399
another interesting data point

754
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,720
when we look the the uh the other hand

755
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,279
counts the governor and u.s senator

756
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:37,520
we saw that in the governor's race uh

757
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,360
there was a little bit more

758
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,640
a discrepancy and the discrepancy

759
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:46,480
is a non-votes being

760
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,880
eliminated being lower and more votes

761
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:49,679
found so

762
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:51,520
about the same amount of votes were

763
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,880
found for

764
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,000
both of the governor candidates and the

765
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,679
voting machine had clearly in this vote

766
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:02,960
say failed to recognize votes when there

767
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,039
was vote and when we have u.s senator

768
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:09,039
race very small differences

769
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:11,039
when i go back to the previous one we

770
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:13,039
see that the same thing was in the u.s

771
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:13,919
state representative

772
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:17,600
you have there's a thousand uh less

773
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:21,279
a uh non-votes for anyone so

774
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:23,679
now we are we are approaching the

775
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:25,919
question what means non-vote

776
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:27,840
and a non-vote can be two different

777
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,000
things it can be

778
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,720
that the voters didn't vote anyone or

779
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,000
the voter voted

780
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,960
too many because the other way non-vote

781
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:37,679
can happen

782
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:40,080
is called overvote condition it means

783
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,840
that when the

784
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,799
the voter was asked vote for four the

785
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:47,279
voter for example voted for five or six

786
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:50,000
and that cancels all the votes so if you

787
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:50,880
have if

788
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,360
you have a race vote for four and you

789
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,000
vote for

790
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,440
five the result is nobody gets any votes

791
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,399
so this is the condition we started

792
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:02,240
looking and focusing maybe

793
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,720
we are seeing what what caused this

794
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,159
problem

795
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:09,919
uh this is all 10 000 ballots

796
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:13,120
super imposed over its arm

797
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,480
this whole red plop in the left was that

798
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:20,080
before we started we made every single

799
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:20,880
ballot to be

800
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:24,640
unique by placing a unique number

801
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,279
to every single ballot we originally

802
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:29,600
were planning to use a base stamp

803
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,640
machines but the bait stamps uh broke

804
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,279
down

805
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:36,320
and eventually that's why we just then

806
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,399
did it with the handwriting but this

807
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:39,760
made every single ballot

808
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:43,200
unique and identifiable

809
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,240
and after the the serial number was done

810
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:46,559
we

811
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:49,039
we didn't use the the scans of the

812
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:49,919
ballots

813
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:52,000
for uh recount purposes these were

814
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,360
reference scans

815
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:56,399
to be used for analyzes and we didn't

816
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:57,840
know at the time when we did the

817
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,159
reference scan how useful this will be

818
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:02,320
i want to make sure that everybody

819
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,360
understands that

820
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:07,120
if you scan ballots uh with a separate

821
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,159
scanner

822
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:10,399
you cannot trust those images uh there

823
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:12,480
are a lot of features in the scanner

824
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,600
scanners which have been uh shown to

825
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,640
alter uh the ballots for example uh

826
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,919
the punch hole punch hole removal

827
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:24,720
from legal documents bunch hole looks a

828
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,000
lot a lot like a

829
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,080
filled oval so when you have a filled

830
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,919
oval it can remove that

831
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:33,840
you also have to establish trust that

832
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:37,000
your image population is a true

833
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,480
representation

834
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:42,080
of the physical balance so if you

835
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:45,440
are creating ballot valid images for the

836
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,559
purpose

837
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:49,600
of uh for example making a recount then

838
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,399
you have to

839
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:53,600
do make extra steps to

840
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,919
convince yourself that your image

841
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:57,760
population is trustworthy

842
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:00,640
and just taking the images or hashing

843
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,120
that

844
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,360
that is not nearly enough for this

845
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,600
purpose

846
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,679
anyway in when we superimposed the

847
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:08,960
images we saw

848
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,279
two interesting things here you is you

849
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:12,399
see we see

850
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:15,519
a a in the kirsty saint laurent

851
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:18,159
i hope i pronounce her name correctly we

852
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:18,799
see a

853
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:21,679
very high concentration of paper

854
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:22,880
foldings

855
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:26,000
going through her vote target and we see

856
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,200
in top of the ballot

857
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:32,480
a way wider area of foldings

858
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:36,399
some of them being over the vote targets

859
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:39,360
i have to this the darkness of the

860
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,480
folding is not

861
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,320
representing how many foldings were in

862
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,159
that place this is purely

863
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:48,559
uh maxing a type of superimposing

864
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:51,760
just to find where they are other

865
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,600
interesting thing is when you look the

866
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,840
uh the folding on the bottom through

867
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,120
going through the kirstie's

868
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,720
uh christie's target you don't see in a

869
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:04,000
flip side of the ballot nearly as strong

870
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,200
marking so that was interesting and the

871
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,719
last but not least

872
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:11,359
we find that the folding machine seems

873
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:11,760
to be

874
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:15,199
a little bit um oh the folder

875
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:17,918
seems to be a little bit off-center it

876
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:19,359
doesn't go straight from

877
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:23,359
from the left to right these ballots

878
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:26,480
had a score line score line is a a

879
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,119
weaker than a perforation it is a print

880
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:30,560
shop created

881
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:35,520
weakness on the ballot so if and that

882
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,239
weakness is created in a safe zone so

883
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:38,879
when

884
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:41,199
you hand fold the paper you

885
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:43,359
automatically fold the paper always in a

886
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:44,159
safe place

887
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:47,359
and it doesn't ever hit the uh

888
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:50,159
the vote targets

889
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:54,719
so our question was we know now that the

890
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:57,200
folding the correct folding line would

891
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:57,920
be

892
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:02,079
an [ __ ] the yulia sotis target

893
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:04,160
that's where the correct line is the the

894
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,000
similar the correct line is

895
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,280
in in above the the uh

896
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:13,440
the candidates in in the governor's race

897
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,560
so what caused a foldings

898
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:20,160
to appear in an incorrect place when the

899
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:23,440
the structural weakness is forcing

900
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,359
the hand folding to be always in a

901
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:27,200
correct place

902
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:30,079
if you try to fold the paper incorrectly

903
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:31,599
handfully correctly

904
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:34,880
you can not absolutely do it because the

905
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,640
weakness is where the paper wants to

906
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,720
fold and you would need a tool

907
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,800
like a ruler to make an incorrect

908
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,119
folding

909
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:46,240
so the plot thickens

910
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,000
the other part which we've started

911
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,280
looking into

912
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:52,240
the results we found out that uh one

913
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,599
machine

914
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:56,240
uh which was machine number two

915
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,200
processed

916
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,560
90 of the absentee ballots and at the

917
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,599
same time

918
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:04,000
that same machine had the highest error

919
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:04,880
rate

920
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,200
so we we had a perfect storm and

921
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,119
coincidence where

922
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:12,640
the absentee ballots which are folded

923
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,400
are the ones which are going through a

924
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,200
machine which have a highest error rate

925
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,880
why we have a higher error rate in that

926
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,520
one machine

927
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:25,680
the first discover we had was a paper

928
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,920
folding machine

929
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:31,760
when the good people in windham

930
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:34,480
had started to have a high number of

931
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,520
requests for

932
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:38,839
absentee ballots they

933
00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:42,000
were they had a hard time to cope with

934
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:42,880
the demand

935
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,440
and someone had remembered that if they

936
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,880
had rented

937
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,280
a paper folding machine to be used in

938
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,079
dmv

939
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:54,640
not in elections used in dmv so

940
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,560
in order to for them to serve their

941
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,400
voters better

942
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,599
they decided to use this paper for paper

943
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:02,480
folding machine

944
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,640
and they use it as it is they didn't

945
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,680
change the

946
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,920
settings of the scanner of the folding

947
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,520
machine so it's got it

948
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,240
it folded the paper exactly the same way

949
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:15,359
as the dmv registration

950
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:19,040
papers had been previously folded

951
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,640
and at that time nobody thought about

952
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,320
the foldings the

953
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:25,359
secretary of state had been conducted a

954
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:26,480
few years earlier

955
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,680
a testing of the foldings

956
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,800
if they caused the voting machine to

957
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,119
re misregister those as a votes and they

958
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:36,560
had didn't haven't found

959
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:39,280
any problem at the time so there was no

960
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,240
knowledge

961
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:43,119
that the folding can be can have a this

962
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:45,760
kind of effect

963
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:48,560
but the folding machine is strong enough

964
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,000
that it can fold the paper

965
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,720
in incorrect place so now we found out

966
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:53,119
what

967
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:56,480
caused the folding uh to be in correct

968
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,440
place

969
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,880
again this was a machine which was

970
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:01,839
rendered by

971
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:05,200
by windham we made a query

972
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,599
to other jurisdictions to find out if

973
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:08,560
they have been

974
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,640
using folding machines and we couldn't

975
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,320
find a single other

976
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,240
township of ward which would have used

977
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,920
the voting machine so

978
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:19,359
our query was not conclusive

979
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:21,200
we didn't ask all third three hundred

980
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,560
and twenty but

981
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:25,119
from the sample we did and asked the

982
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:25,920
question

983
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,400
uh we couldn't find a another place uh

984
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,720
with a phone so that's a pointing that

985
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,880
this folding machine is a unique

986
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:33,839
appearance

987
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:36,880
it's a it's a a black swan

988
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:40,240
in this mix if you make

989
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:43,920
when we look at microscope what the

990
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,240
folding machine looks we've we found a

991
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,720
a unused ballast which had been folded

992
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:51,040
on the election day

993
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:54,320
and the uh the folding on

994
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:57,359
the right side is the folding which was

995
00:38:57,359 --> 00:38:59,440
done on the election day

996
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,280
and the filing on the left was when we

997
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,839
used the folding machine to recreate

998
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:06,480
and this is a bump and we discovered

999
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,720
something else interesting

1000
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:12,320
if the paper is folded up or down makes

1001
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,240
a huge difference

1002
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:16,720
when it's up folded it creates a bump

1003
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,320
which creates a

1004
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,160
shadow and the shadow can be

1005
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,480
misinterpreted to be a marking on the

1006
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,359
ballot

1007
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:25,599
while it's down folded it creates a

1008
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:28,079
bridge and it's almost invisible

1009
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:30,800
in the microscope that the folding was

1010
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,240
there and this

1011
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:36,320
is consistent with what we saw in the

1012
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:39,680
superimposed image where the same strong

1013
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:42,000
folding which went through the

1014
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,599
christie's

1015
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:45,920
oval on the front side there was not a

1016
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,119
strong folding

1017
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:49,359
on the flip side and that was because

1018
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:51,119
the unknown factor was

1019
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:54,880
the direction it had been folded matters

1020
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,920
and again we couldn't reconstruct uh

1021
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,920
with from the secretary of state office

1022
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:00,960
whether they

1023
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,200
folded those up and down they didn't

1024
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,640
know it makes a difference

1025
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,480
nobody knew it made a difference but now

1026
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,520
we found out what is the difference

1027
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:12,880
this bump is permanent in the paper

1028
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:18,079
but it is not equal strength

1029
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:21,359
over time so at this point of time we

1030
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:23,280
started looking into the bumps and we

1031
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,400
realized

1032
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,440
that why the machine count in

1033
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:31,119
uh 2021 and 2020

1034
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:33,359
were different the difference was that

1035
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:34,480
the ballots have been

1036
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:37,280
laying flat six months under the wake of

1037
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,880
the other ballast and it had

1038
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,640
straightened the ballots

1039
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:43,359
so you still had the bump and it still

1040
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:44,000
created

1041
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,119
a false readings but it co-created

1042
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:50,160
less false readings because of the time

1043
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,480
the paper has been flattened under the

1044
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,880
wakes

1045
00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:58,400
then we start looking something else and

1046
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,400
the question was why these voting

1047
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,760
machines are

1048
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,079
different from have a different result

1049
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:05,520
from each other

1050
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:09,119
this scanner cannot be opened it's it's

1051
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:13,280
there's no easy way to uh open it

1052
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:17,280
so we use an endoscopic camera to

1053
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:20,400
look into the the scanner to see

1054
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:24,079
what was inside of there and

1055
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:27,280
we saw a white powder

1056
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:30,079
well it looked like a dust so at the

1057
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:32,000
first time we didn't even know what we

1058
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,599
were looking

1059
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:36,160
i used a highly compressed air cleaner

1060
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:36,960
and when we

1061
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:39,280
cleaned with the compressed air a

1062
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,960
massive amount of dust as you can see

1063
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:43,680
here came out

1064
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:46,400
only later we realized that this is not

1065
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,280
paper dust

1066
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:50,640
this is actually an offset printing

1067
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:53,280
powder in offset printing when the

1068
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,400
pallet is printed

1069
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,880
the ink is not fully dry when it comes

1070
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:57,520
out of the

1071
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:00,240
printing machine and in order to prevent

1072
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,240
the ballast to stick to each other

1073
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,319
in that kind of printing technology a a

1074
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:05,599
very very

1075
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:09,119
a fine powder is sprayed to the seeds to

1076
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:10,160
keep them

1077
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,319
a little bit separated and allowing them

1078
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:14,839
to naturally try

1079
00:42:14,839 --> 00:42:18,400
so this was what we found out it's out

1080
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,160
of the printing technology

1081
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:23,200
and that explained

1082
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,839
why uh the message were a little bit

1083
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:26,400
different

1084
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:30,079
we conducted 32 test elections

1085
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:33,200
with the 16 elections used by a

1086
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:37,280
flat paper and 16

1087
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:39,760
elections with the folded paper when the

1088
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,359
paper was flat

1089
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:42,960
all machines all four machines

1090
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,800
regardless whether they had the paper

1091
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,640
dust or not inside

1092
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:50,000
were 100 accurate and then at the time

1093
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,040
when when we processed the folded paper

1094
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,880
the differences came out and these

1095
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,880
differences seem to be indicating

1096
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:00,160
the level of paper dust contamination in

1097
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,240
offset powder dust contamination inside

1098
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:03,440
of the machine

1099
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:08,480
so we found a contributing factor

1100
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:11,040
and these are just a we made the sanity

1101
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:12,560
check we found

1102
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:15,040
how many ballots are in each way we

1103
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,640
found about 300

1104
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:19,520
600 ballots where the folding mark goes

1105
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:21,520
through a kirstie's target

1106
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:24,640
we found a about

1107
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,880
four where the folding line went through

1108
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:29,599
uh mr salty's uh target

1109
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:33,440
we found a a different combinations

1110
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:36,319
uh of the foldings uh in different uh

1111
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:37,280
intensities

1112
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,880
and this showed us that there's enough

1113
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,720
ballots

1114
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:44,400
and this is also proves us that the

1115
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:45,280
foldings can

1116
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:49,839
both add votes and substruct rules

1117
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:54,400
when a voter voted for less

1118
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:58,079
than four candidates uh then if the if

1119
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:59,599
the line went through

1120
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:02,400
uh christie's target it created a

1121
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,240
phantom vote for her

1122
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,000
and the hand count corrected that's why

1123
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,599
she lost 99 roles

1124
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:11,040
in the hand cut but if a voter voted

1125
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:13,599
for a straight party line republican

1126
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:14,319
ticket

1127
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:16,800
and the line went through kirsties then

1128
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:17,680
it created

1129
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:20,839
in certain intensity

1130
00:44:20,839 --> 00:44:23,920
a uh overvote which then tossed all the

1131
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:24,560
votes out

1132
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,640
and cancelled the votes so this folding

1133
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,319
line both explained

1134
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:31,680
why uh the republicans gained uh 300

1135
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:34,240
votes and it also explains why kirsty

1136
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:37,920
lost 99 was in a record and yet another

1137
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:39,359
example here we have the

1138
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:42,560
uh the folding line going through the

1139
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,640
governor's race and of course now in

1140
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,760
if that vote is if that folding line is

1141
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:51,119
misinterpreted to be a a

1142
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:53,839
business would be a vote then it cancels

1143
00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:55,920
those votes and we saw that 90

1144
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:59,040
uh figure in earlier what was the time

1145
00:44:59,040 --> 00:44:59,520
but this

1146
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:01,280
there were not very many ballots and not

1147
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:03,119
all folding lines are always

1148
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:05,440
interpreted as a balance we when we made

1149
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,520
the sanity check we found out that

1150
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:10,800
the the probability of strong folding

1151
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:15,680
to be misinterpreted into a vote is 0.44

1152
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:18,079
and it is the same with the two

1153
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:19,599
different ways of counting so this is

1154
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:20,640
both trying

1155
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:23,760
our our hypothesis to be a same with

1156
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:27,599
because of which way you are analyzed

1157
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:31,280
again this is just a close-up picture to

1158
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:32,079
show that the

1159
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:34,640
external connections were really removed

1160
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,400
and destroyed and there was no way of

1161
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,319
communicating with the memory card

1162
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:41,520
from outside world

1163
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:45,280
just to wrap up the last things we did a

1164
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:46,240
lot of things we

1165
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:50,400
we added in addition we we looked

1166
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:52,079
records we looked at absentee

1167
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:53,599
applications we

1168
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:55,280
made certain that all ballots are

1169
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:56,640
genuine ballot

1170
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:59,440
printed ballots hand marked not printed

1171
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:00,560
printed we

1172
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:04,560
measured the thickness we did a complete

1173
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:06,960
software analysis of the eeproms using

1174
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:07,839
gesara

1175
00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:11,119
an nsa open source a reverse

1176
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:13,920
engineering tool we looked through

1177
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:15,599
eeproms to find that

1178
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:18,240
verify that there's no uh a unexplained

1179
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:19,760
data there with because that would be

1180
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:21,760
the only place where malware would be

1181
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:24,480
so we complete all these analysis and we

1182
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:25,200
found no

1183
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:28,319
evidence of malware we found no evidence

1184
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:31,440
of a any kind of irregularities in the

1185
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:32,480
digital media

1186
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:34,800
and we found no irregular like

1187
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,720
regularities in the paper ballots

1188
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:39,920
everything was authentic printed and

1189
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:41,760
handmarked

1190
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:44,720
we live streamed into our event and we

1191
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:46,720
published a real-time huge amount of

1192
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:47,440
documents

1193
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:50,400
uh all along based on the request and of

1194
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:51,520
production so we

1195
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:53,680
we try to be as transparent as possible

1196
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:55,680
i have spent more time to be an observer

1197
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,119
and a monitor

1198
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:00,319
so i wanted to run this the way i would

1199
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:02,400
want to be i would be wanting to be

1200
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,880
observe as observers we want to be as

1201
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:07,440
friendly as possible to the observers

1202
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:08,079
make sure

1203
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:10,319
everything is is transparent when we

1204
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:11,839
were doing the hand telling

1205
00:47:11,839 --> 00:47:13,920
the spreadsheet was a google docs

1206
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:15,680
spreadsheet was a real time accessible

1207
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:16,560
from the world

1208
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:18,640
everybody could see all the data entry

1209
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:19,680
as they go

1210
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:22,160
and in the video every single ballot was

1211
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:23,359
a uh

1212
00:47:23,359 --> 00:47:26,240
with overhead camera photo so every

1213
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:28,720
single ballot of the 1006 ballot was

1214
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,240
shown in a live stream in a full

1215
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:32,880
hd so that everybody can follow that

1216
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:34,559
process

1217
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:38,000
i think that's wrap it up please ask

1218
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,839
questions in the uh discord and uh

1219
00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:44,960
i hope this was explaining why

1220
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:47,119
in this case in under very difficult

1221
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:48,319
circumstances

1222
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:50,720
windham elections where windham election

1223
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:51,920
was run

1224
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:55,040
very well of course when you

1225
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:56,480
have a close scrutiny we have a

1226
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:59,440
recommendations how to improve it

1227
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:01,760
but this was just a coincidence a

1228
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:03,839
conspiracy of coincidences

1229
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,760
very many things needed to happen in

1230
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:07,280
order to create this

1231
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:10,079
animali and now the animal is explained

1232
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:12,079
and there was no malicious intent or

1233
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:15,040
malicious activity

1234
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:19,920
thank you very much
