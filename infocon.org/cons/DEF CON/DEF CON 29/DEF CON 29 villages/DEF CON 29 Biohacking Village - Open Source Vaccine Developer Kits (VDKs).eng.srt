1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,399
all right hi everyone hi defcon

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:04,000
my name is alex hoekstra i am a

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,759
molecular biologist and i'm one of the

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:08,320
co-founders and scientists at the rapid

5
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,400
deployment vaccine collaborative or

6
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:11,759
radvac

7
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:13,920
i'm excited and i'm grateful to talk to

8
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,160
the biohacking village about open source

9
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,160
technology and vaccine development

10
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,600
building the kind of tools that fill

11
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,480
gaps in global vaccine infrastructure

12
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,080
my goal in this session is to present

13
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,519
the case for open source vaccine

14
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:26,720
development

15
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,400
and the tools that enable that kind of

16
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,560
development which uh radvac we've begun

17
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,120
to think of as developer kits or vaccine

18
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,719
developer kits

19
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,480
because it's very clear that vaccines

20
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,000
are a uniquely important tool in

21
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,280
biosecurity

22
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,040
and there's so much more room for

23
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,800
improvement in various facets of

24
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,719
vaccinology especially with regards to

25
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,879
accidents

26
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:48,320
we think that many aspects of vex

27
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,160
analogy should and with the right kind

28
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,160
of tools can be made more accessible for

29
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,239
more people in more places around the

30
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:55,120
world

31
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,039
and that the

32
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:58,480
vaccinology itself

33
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,359
uh could grow and be improved uh by that

34
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,239
kind of inclusive participation

35
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,560
so during the kobe 19 pandemic obviously

36
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,080
all kinds of gaps revealed in public

37
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,520
health infrastructure and biosecurity

38
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,720
and there's more reason than ever to

39
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,880
think seriously and creatively about how

40
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,200
to fill these various gaps going forward

41
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,759
uh i guess both for uh the ongoing

42
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:21,680
reality um

43
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,159
for billions of us um still struggling

44
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:25,360
through kovid

45
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,799
and this pandemic but also for

46
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:29,200
inevitable future emerging diseases

47
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,720
which we might be able to minimize and

48
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,600
even prevent the right tools

49
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,799
so i want to introduce some work by

50
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,240
discussing some concepts regarding

51
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,079
vaccines that i think me will be

52
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:39,920
familiar to a lot of people here who are

53
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,439
already familiar with space but i also

54
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:43,360
want to get into some hopefully

55
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,119
exciting and new ideas for a lot of

56
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,280
people across the biosciences

57
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,520
um since vaccinology has been heavily

58
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,439
shaped by iip laws

59
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,600
for the last seven or so decades

60
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,280
there's a lot of room for creative

61
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,520
improvement

62
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,960
especially when you begin thinking kind

63
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,360
of outside that box

64
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,560
i think it's important to bring up a few

65
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,560
foundational topics like vaccine

66
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,159
economics

67
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,399
and and the unique role of the vaccines

68
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,440
play in epidemiology and uh as well as

69
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,400
as the immunology as it relates to uh

70
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,400
vaccine platforms or the technology

71
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,160
themselves so we'll take a quick look at

72
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,120
those issues before um we get into you

73
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,120
know what radvac's doing in particular

74
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,160
because i think they're helpful in

75
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,480
identifying the gaps and why they exist

76
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,520
presently

77
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,760
um ultimately i do want to get into uh

78
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,280
what we've been doing at radvac and in

79
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,599
terms of open source efforts uh what

80
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,200
open source efforts can do to kind of

81
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,879
bridge those economic technical and

82
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:38,400
logistical gaps

83
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,239
uh we at radvac have been working on

84
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:42,000
building a particular platform for

85
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,640
intranasal uh peptide-based vaccine

86
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,440
candidates against cyrus co2 virus

87
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,319
um

88
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:51,360
but we also think that uh these these

89
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,040
principles of development may be more

90
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,120
valuable in their generalizable form

91
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,560
than any single

92
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,800
um development project on its own

93
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,920
so i want to get into why vaccines are

94
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,159
uniquely important uniquely leverageable

95
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:07,760
tool in public health and defense

96
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,840
against infectious disease

97
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,480
vaccines serve to combat disease in a

98
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,239
number of ways primarily by inhibiting

99
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:16,560
infection inhibiting disease inhibiting

100
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,120
transmission and inhibiting replication

101
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,760
which subsequently

102
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,519
inhibits mutations and the evolution of

103
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,200
new pathogens

104
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,200
and although there are a variety of

105
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,280
important and even very useful tools to

106
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,360
achieve some of these functions factines

107
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,440
are arguably the most important

108
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,760
this swiss cheese model uh is something

109
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,840
that i'm borrowing in mckay who adopted

110
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,640
a

111
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,799
similar illustration for covid another

112
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,120
mine uh is only showing a handful of

113
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,200
risk prevention interventions

114
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,959
and isn't really to scale in terms of

115
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,400
each interventions efficacy it's

116
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,080
stopping pathogens from infecting a

117
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,000
person uh i think the illustration is

118
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,319
still a useful one insofar as

119
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:55,760
uh it makes the case for applying

120
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,760
multiple layers additive layers to

121
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,360
mitigate

122
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,360
vaccines though are unique among these

123
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,519
interventions because they both augment

124
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,280
a person's ability to fight off

125
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,280
infection if the prior layers of

126
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,720
protection fail

127
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,319
but also if applied at scale across the

128
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,159
population vaccines can limit the

129
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,080
collective exposure to these pathogens

130
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,760
by reducing the number of available

131
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,759
hosts and transmitters and in the next

132
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:18,880
slide we're going to get into just a

133
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,040
little bit of math i promise it won't be

134
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,960
uh it will be too much and that'll be

135
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,160
the end of the math

136
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,040
um

137
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,199
but essentially the network effects may

138
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,040
be one of those important features to

139
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,320
vaccines

140
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,080
which are good on a personal level right

141
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,800
good for individual health but so much

142
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,080
better

143
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,479
on population scale

144
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,080
right but a lot of things have to go

145
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,360
right in order to achieve those

146
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,639
population scale network effects uh and

147
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,440
as of now as of july 2021 almost a full

148
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,520
16 months after the first coping

149
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,160
vaccines were actually developed and now

150
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,680
seven months after those vaccines were

151
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,520
authorized and made available in the u.s

152
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,800
and other high-income countries were

153
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,440
still not yet achieving the full benefit

154
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,400
um or benefits of those network effects

155
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,080
on disease prevention

156
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,840
that these vaccines could

157
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,000
and hopefully will soon provide once

158
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,080
they're made more accessible and more

159
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,400
widely deployed

160
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,680
so there's a good amount of math

161
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,120
involved with

162
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,880
uh considering how to prevent or

163
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,160
independent

164
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,680
accounting for things like population

165
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,600
characteristics age health status

166
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,479
mobility environmental conditions uh and

167
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,479
a lot more but one of the most important

168
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,000
concepts is understanding the effective

169
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,479
reproductive number for a given disease

170
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:31,680
effective reproductive number is

171
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,880
sometimes written as r or r sub e uh and

172
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,240
it's a bit different from basic

173
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,160
reproductive number which is uh you know

174
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,240
more commonly talked about it it's

175
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,160
r naught or r sub zero

176
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,199
um

177
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,280
because uh effective reproductive number

178
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,400
uh r sub e uh basically takes into

179
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,759
consideration the percentage of a

180
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,440
population that's susceptible to

181
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,759
infection essentially the percentage uh

182
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,520
that is not immune

183
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,400
um

184
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,960
sometimes written as s so our knot on

185
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,639
the other hand is uh is meant to be a

186
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,960
metric of a disease's contagiousness or

187
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,800
transmissibility now you can calculate

188
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,160
effective reproductive number by

189
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,680
multiplying the basic reproductive

190
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,840
number by s

191
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,199
so killing a pandemic requires

192
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:14,560
bringing that effective reproductive

193
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,400
number to under one

194
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,840
since the spread of infectious disease

195
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,880
is essentially an exponential function

196
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,319
in which every infected person can

197
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,520
infect a certain number of other

198
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,120
non-immune people

199
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,000
a reproductive number um a reproduction

200
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,960
number uh greater than one will increase

201
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,039
the transmission at an exponential rate

202
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,280
whereas the reproduction number uh below

203
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,440
one decreases transmission approaching

204
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,479
zero new infections uh over time

205
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:43,919
so here we can see a few illustrative

206
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,440
graphs and what happens to an

207
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,280
exponential function when that when that

208
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,199
constant um

209
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,080
is above one and when it is below one

210
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,919
um so the state uh is is related to a

211
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,160
herd immunity threshold hit

212
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,400
which is also a function of a disease's

213
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,759
reproductive number

214
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,199
essentially the higher the reproductive

215
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:04,880
number for that disease

216
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,800
the higher the threshold for population

217
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,400
scale immunity

218
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,319
the population is immune to a disease in

219
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,560
excess of that diseases uh immunity

220
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,680
threshold

221
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,520
the number of cases reduces at a faster

222
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,919
rate outbreaks are less likely to happen

223
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:19,919
and outbreaks that do occur are smaller

224
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:21,680
than they would have been otherwise

225
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,520
it's probably important to note that

226
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,199
the herd immunity threshold doesn't

227
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,800
represent the point at which

228
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,560
a disease stops spreading altogether but

229
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,120
rather the point at which each infected

230
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,199
person infects fewer than one additional

231
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:34,960
persons on average

232
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,400
essentially modulating the effective

233
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,720
reproductive number and diminishing

234
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,960
the incidence of disease

235
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,039
so these are useful formulas when

236
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:44,560
thinking about vaccine readiness and

237
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,160
roll out in situations of emerging

238
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,160
disease where populations begin with

239
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,199
virtually no pre-existing immunity

240
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,599
so the effective reproduction rate is

241
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,039
actually very high

242
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:57,199
and can be brought down by vaccines that

243
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,360
are both effective and very importantly

244
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,919
available

245
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,000
so what happens when there's no uh

246
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,240
pre-existing immunity so s is very high

247
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,840
and we're met with a disease that has a

248
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,759
high basic reproductive

249
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:12,400
well we are living it with uh soros cove

250
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,360
too

251
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,240
uh since sarco 2 is a new virus and

252
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,919
since it replicates with with high

253
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,240
efficiency covet 19's debut has been

254
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,680
devastating

255
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,919
um cohen's toll on human health won't be

256
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:27,280
fully calculable for years now

257
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,599
but uh you know because we're still very

258
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,320
much in this pandemic globally where

259
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,919
immunization rates are low and the

260
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,679
effective reproductive rate

261
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:38,000
is greater than one in many places

262
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,919
again no no matter how effective a

263
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,479
vaccine is on an individual level uh the

264
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,120
key to ending pandemics is decreasing r

265
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,360
uh that effective reproductive rate now

266
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,519
which means decreasing the number of

267
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:53,680
acceptable non-immune folks s

268
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,720
so bear in mind that uh the production

269
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,640
authorization and rollout of safe and

270
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,000
effective vaccines for an emerging

271
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,399
disease in under a year

272
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,800
is historically unprecedented and a very

273
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,800
very good thing but it's also clear that

274
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,360
the costs of not being prepared both in

275
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,920
terms of prevention and in response

276
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,480
those costs are vast and indeed far far

277
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,399
greater than the cost of building the

278
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,000
kind of biosecurity infrastructure

279
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
including vaccines

280
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,279
that were

281
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,440
you know we already largely know how to

282
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,560
make

283
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,480
so i'd like to explore why this

284
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,200
infrastructure was lacking uh and then

285
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,279
maybe get into some solution-oriented

286
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,440
ideas

287
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,720
i think it's important also to talk

288
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,080
about the ecosystem of vaccine

289
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,839
development that existed leading into

290
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:40,560
2020 and why covet caught us all off

291
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,240
guard despite years and years of

292
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,839
scientists and people who listen to

293
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,240
scientists agreeing that such an

294
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,920
outbreak was really only a matter of

295
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,880
time

296
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,000
so professor andrew lowe um at mit uh

297
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,080
professor of economics there has done

298
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,839
some really interesting analyses on the

299
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:57,680
economic landscape of vaccine

300
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,279
development over the last few decades

301
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,120
which taken together revealed some

302
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,440
interesting insights about why despite

303
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,040
their importance and despite the high

304
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,320
rate of technical success in development

305
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,320
uh vaccines are less than 10 of

306
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,480
industrial biotech investment

307
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,399
um it turns out the vaccines have a

308
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,839
uniquely high probability of

309
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:18,880
success and and develop close to 40

310
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,680
compared to 11 across all therapeutic

311
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,079
groups but industrial sponsors have been

312
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:25,519
pulling out of the vaccine development

313
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:27,040
business for

314
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,360
at least the past two decades

315
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,800
so professor lowe and others began to

316
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,360
understand that vaccines are a high cost

317
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,079
and low financial reward low margin

318
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:37,360
investment

319
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,920
and generally a turn off for industry

320
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,240
industrial or industry sponsors biotech

321
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,079
pharmaceutical companies as well as

322
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:44,839
their

323
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:47,519
investors dr lo and his colleagues point

324
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,800
out that these um analyses of vaccine

325
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,720
landscape um

326
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,519
reveal some some big gaps in investment

327
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,320
waning vaccine r d participation uh and

328
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,040
ultimately in inhibited vaccine access

329
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,600
uh that predate 2020 by a number of

330
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,640
decades

331
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,720
um and they suggested public sector

332
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,120
support may be useful in filling in

333
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,600
these gaps left by kind of a lack of

334
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,000
capital market incentives

335
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,519
and this itself is a really interesting

336
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:17,279
line of thinking because with what we

337
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,360
know about how vaccines leverage network

338
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,079
effects at a population scale lowering s

339
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:23,440
lowering r

340
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,200
by increasing immunity throughout that

341
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,959
population we can ask

342
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:28,880
could vaccine development and vaccine

343
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,320
innovation be driven by sort of

344
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,800
rethinking of vaccines not as a

345
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,480
market-dependent good

346
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,399
but instead as a sort of international

347
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,240
public since they clearly have

348
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,320
international public benefits and since

349
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,920
the market incentive structure has

350
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,360
failed to make those investments

351
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,760
profitable for profit-driven developers

352
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,880
so far

353
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,800
anyway the need for public sector

354
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,560
support uh should probably include

355
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,480
scientists many of whom also happen to

356
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,399
be members of the public many of whom

357
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,720
may actually be listening right now

358
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,639
um so vaccinology is is really a

359
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,079
constellation of a dozen or so

360
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:01,920
disciplines in the field of science

361
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,920
including public health epidemiology

362
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,760
immunology psychology chemistry

363
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,959
economics uh policy clinical trials

364
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:11,440
ethics informatica we've actually had a

365
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,360
couple of physicists reach out and offer

366
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,600
to assist us in characterizing uh our

367
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,600
vaccine candidates so it's clear that

368
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,760
there's a need for skilled people of all

369
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,000
kinds to take an active part in building

370
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,079
global scientific and logistical highway

371
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:25,120
system

372
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,880
that can deliver vaccines to populations

373
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,480
more quickly with high levels of

374
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,720
efficacy safety trust

375
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,040
and access

376
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,279
but we at radvac took a systems view of

377
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,040
the gaps in vaccine infrastructure and

378
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,120
across four different elements

379
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,680
of the vaccine response including r d

380
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,680
testing approval and deployment of

381
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,760
vaccines it seems to us that

382
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,440
each of these steps could be potentially

383
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,680
augmented improved sped up and made more

384
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,360
accessible globally

385
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,959
by increasing the kind of access that

386
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:55,519
empowers participation in each of those

387
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,360
central processes

388
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,680
we believe that the ability to take part

389
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,320
is a fundamental prerequisite for things

390
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,399
like vaccine equity inclusivity

391
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:05,839
transparency

392
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:08,399
ultimately in trust safety efficacy as

393
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:12,000
well um and ultimately in in developing

394
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,560
great ideas about how vaccines work both

395
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,079
on a technical level but also on a

396
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:19,200
systemic worldwide people and global

397
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,800
health level

398
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,880
radback actually began when dr president

399
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,440
esa sent out an email asking me and some

400
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,519
of our other colleagues if any of us had

401
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,440
heard of projects to accelerate vaccine

402
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,519
development through public participation

403
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,320
potentially citizen science he figured

404
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,399
that since vaccines are fairly old and

405
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,560
fairly well understood technology

406
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,079
uh or at least that many vaccines were

407
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:41,680
built on very well established

408
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,600
technological platforms

409
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,600
and might not be out of reach from

410
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,680
vaccines to be developed quickly even on

411
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,880
a low budget

412
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,880
maybe even with you know massively

413
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,760
parallel distributed um you know kind of

414
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,440
a global scheme

415
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,360
uh several of us got really interested

416
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,880
in the idea and we formed the core of

417
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,959
the radvac team so i'd love to tell you

418
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,440
what we've been working on

419
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,920
um so we began with a couple uh

420
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,399
principles in mind um

421
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:11,279
you know uh because of of decades of

422
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:14,240
extensive research on both pathogens and

423
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,120
on the development of vaccines

424
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,360
modern vaccines are actually very quick

425
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,160
and easy for experts to develop um they

426
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,320
they have again by far the highest

427
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,399
probability of success of any

428
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,000
therapeutic class

429
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,959
so access to vaccines and the process of

430
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:32,720
developing vaccine research and

431
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,399
development vaccines

432
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:36,320
is presently prohibited right it's

433
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,199
expensive uh it's fairly well guarded by

434
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:41,519
uh intellectual property again relating

435
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:43,440
to the expense and investors having to

436
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,639
recoup

437
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,480
their investment but

438
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,480
we we think that that

439
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,120
participation should be enhanced and can

440
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,199
be enhanced through open source

441
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:54,320
information

442
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,519
uh research and resource sharing

443
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:58,959
um and and

444
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:02,160
you know one of the the most powerful uh

445
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,320
principles motivating principles for us

446
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,399
was that you know in this this crisis we

447
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,240
we should help right we should do

448
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,959
something uh rather than waiting for the

449
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,920
status quo rather than waiting for um

450
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,920
you know the uh

451
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,519
sort of authoritative pre-existing

452
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,399
infrastructure to do its thing

453
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:23,760
and uh

454
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,320
and so we did we are you know we are

455
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,480
trying uh and we will continue to try

456
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,480
and um you know

457
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,680
our method of trying uh has a

458
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,920
kind of a unique structure to it um

459
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,079
which is sort of intrinsically open

460
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:40,079
source open source is kind of a central

461
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:42,079
component of our our development

462
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,199
platform

463
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:44,240
um

464
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,839
when we say free and open source we mean

465
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:48,160
it both in in three like speech industry

466
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,240
like beer that is the libre and the

467
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,399
gratis definition

468
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,800
but essentially it's it's um

469
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,720
you know it's meant to inspire this sort

470
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,160
of uh positive feedback loop of uh

471
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,120
researching prototyping refining sharing

472
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,680
and then getting feedback from um other

473
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,000
collaborators and you know throughout

474
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,320
this this uh sort of shared challenge

475
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,360
um

476
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,360
we took into consideration some some

477
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,800
sort of basic

478
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,240
design principles um when considering

479
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,240
how to develop vaccine candidates that

480
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,279
fit

481
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:24,959
the needs of this pandemic and

482
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:27,199
potentially future fantastic so

483
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:30,000
we opted for um you know safe

484
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,079
inexpensive accessible and primarily off

485
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:34,320
the shelf materials very few custom

486
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,519
components

487
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:38,160
and very few that required sort of um

488
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,360
you know

489
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,880
i guess high-grade or or

490
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,759
inaccessible laboratory infrastructure

491
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:48,240
we also wanted these um these prototype

492
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,079
vaccines or vaccine candidates to be

493
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:52,079
rapidly reproducible

494
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,800
that is rapidly producible but also

495
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,720
you know with high enough fidelity and

496
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,320
enough simplicity that they could be

497
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,160
reproduced in other labs so that you

498
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,000
could have sort of parallel

499
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,839
implementations and maybe parallel

500
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:05,919
experiments happening in multiple places

501
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:07,280
at once

502
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,919
obviously um you know for for that to

503
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:12,880
work uh it has to be safe uh both in

504
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,439
terms of development which means no

505
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:18,240
infectious components uh and also on the

506
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,959
sort of administration side

507
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:23,199
which you know also if you are working

508
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,799
with safe materials it certainly helps

509
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:26,640
with safe administration although those

510
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,080
two aren't totally equivalent

511
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,760
we also wanted well characterized

512
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,240
antigenic targets which could ideally be

513
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,160
adapted over time as

514
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,559
as more research began um to to focus on

515
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,400
the selection of certain epitopes that

516
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,240
elicited the strongest or the best or

517
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,200
the most um sort of uh

518
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,679
immunologically useful responses from

519
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,919
host's immune system and and

520
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:54,000
you know all encompassing within this is

521
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,240
the idea that this work should be shared

522
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,480
right and that it shouldn't be contained

523
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,960
to a single laboratory or a single team

524
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,400
or a single brain

525
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,480
it isn't necessarily against

526
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,440
um

527
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,039
the traditional model but it is

528
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:09,760
potentially enhancing of the traditional

529
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,240
model right that um and we've seen this

530
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,320
with other open source developments in

531
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,640
other areas right that um

532
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,400
the android operating system leverages

533
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,640
open source technology but google still

534
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,919
makes

535
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:23,760
a good amount of money

536
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,679
either on android or

537
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:28,160
android components so you know this is

538
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,840
not an anti-profit model it's not an

539
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,520
anti-revenue it's not an anti-business

540
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:35,000
model it is a pro-sharing uh and sort of

541
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,280
pro-accessibility model

542
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,160
so

543
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,280
um

544
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,840
in order to catalyze that participation

545
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,080
uh in mid 2020 we we published our first

546
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,440
white paper describing the initial

547
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,440
proposed vaccine candidates against

548
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,960
stars code two

549
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,039
we had four authors uh the original

550
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:52,960
white paper was 43 pages with 84

551
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,000
references

552
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,480
19 peptide sorry 19 epitopes uh uh from

553
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,400
stars cove 2 that were identified in the

554
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,799
research uh or predicted in other

555
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:04,160
research

556
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,840
to be of high value

557
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,480
in terms of eliciting uh immunogenic

558
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,799
response from the host uh we also um

559
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:14,400
you know gave kind of a primer

560
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,120
background research um and provided this

561
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,840
sort of library of pre-existing research

562
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,840
on mucosal and cellular and humeral

563
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,760
immunity um

564
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,440
again epitope selection and

565
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,200
immunogenicity and resilience against

566
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,799
future variants by selecting for

567
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:30,640
conserved epitope

568
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,760
you know we also went into uh you know

569
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,840
not a great length but considerations

570
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,720
for safety and efficacy testing for for

571
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,760
uh

572
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,240
short and long term uh for shelf life

573
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,360
and stability uh for booster doses and

574
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,760
uh and for ethics we think that's

575
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,520
important during a global crisis like

576
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,520
this

577
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:55,120
so as of 2021 that's july of this year

578
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,039
uh we've released over a dozen updates

579
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:58,799
to our white paper

580
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:02,000
we have more than 20 authors uh 90 pages

581
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,720
more than 200 references we've uh

582
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,840
updated and in many ways narrowed uh our

583
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,320
list of uh of well-characterized

584
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,039
epitopes that we think are um

585
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:15,120
uh you know highly useful and eliciting

586
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,760
uh an immunogenic response uh against

587
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,760
stars cove two and protective against

588
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,039
cope with 19.

589
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:22,240
um

590
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,760
along that line we've produced 10

591
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,919
generations of vaccine candidates

592
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:26,799
um

593
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:29,440
so far uh we've expanded our discussions

594
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,520
on safety and advocacy

595
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,440
and an epitope selection and booster

596
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,200
regimens and heterologous bluetooth

597
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,159
regimens

598
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:38,720
um optimizing production optimizing

599
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,080
stability optimizing sort of um valence

600
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,240
or multivalence where we uh we talk

601
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,159
about sort of the breadth of immunity

602
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:47,840
that's provided by a vaccine and whether

603
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,559
it is resilient against these uh

604
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:54,320
future variants and mutations that might

605
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,919
otherwise um

606
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:56,880
you know

607
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,039
minimize vaccine efficacy

608
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:01,360
but really you know it has become

609
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,200
a a collaborative living document and uh

610
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,640
and catalyst

611
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,000
for collaborative living research

612
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:10,720
so

613
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,039
i mentioned earlier um you know some of

614
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:16,480
the parallels uh in in other

615
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,559
open source development and open source

616
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:21,440
uh initiatives um

617
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,000
linux for instance uh is you know kind

618
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,799
of a great example of how

619
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:28,480
uh we hope we might be able to

620
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,559
contribute with uh with developer kits

621
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:34,400
right so linux clearly um

622
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,760
is is such an infrastructural tool in uh

623
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,960
software development and hardware

624
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,880
development and really promoting

625
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,520
accessibility for uh most of the world

626
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,080
at this point and and it's clear that uh

627
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,080
you know there are reasons that linux is

628
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,880
superior to alternatives uh that have to

629
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,600
do with uh its open sourceness right its

630
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,480
collaborative development ecosystem um

631
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,480
and uh the ability for for multiple

632
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,640
people in multiple places uh to take

633
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,320
part without restrictions

634
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,120
so

635
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,080
um

636
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:08,000
you know uh we conceptualize um

637
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,640
uh viruses as sort of non-digital

638
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,559
pathogen kind of funny because the name

639
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:14,640
went the opposite way right so uh

640
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,000
computer viruses are the digital sort of

641
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,640
um appropriation of the actual

642
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,480
biological virus so we're kind of going

643
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,960
in the opposite direction now

644
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,840
so in software developer toolkits you

645
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,799
know there's a number of key features uh

646
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:33,520
that are really useful right um uh that

647
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,120
may be required in order for people to

648
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,720
actually like use them and pick them up

649
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,600
and uh and develop cool things with them

650
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,240
so uh chief among them are a compiler a

651
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,600
debugger uh and a software framework um

652
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,360
and some of the components that um you

653
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,600
know are critical are libraries

654
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,000
documentation code samples processes and

655
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,240
guides and we think that the vaccine

656
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,640
developer toolkit should should mirror

657
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,000
uh and encompass all of those components

658
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,600
that are essential to

659
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,559
collaborative and open source um

660
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,480
and even just good vaccine development

661
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,280
again like um in open source you don't

662
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,679
have to necessarily share and share like

663
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:14,400
right you can take it um and if you

664
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,960
adapt it well enough you can actually

665
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,559
even patent it you can protect it with

666
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:19,440
ip

667
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,480
um and and even when it is open source

668
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,039
there's no real reason you can't uh

669
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:27,760
start a company right uh you you

670
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,440
you know you can run with these products

671
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,720
in a profit or even revenue driven way

672
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,320
but to put it in context of vaccine

673
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,640
development we think that providing a

674
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,360
framework of reproducible

675
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,760
simple accessible adaptable vaccine

676
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,039
technology

677
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:45,120
is really useful

678
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,039
in terms of processes we want detailed

679
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:48,640
production protocols in terms of

680
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,640
libraries we want you know vast

681
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,039
documentation of past studies that are

682
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:54,480
related to

683
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,520
vaccine immunogenicity vaccine safety

684
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,400
various aspects of vaccine technology

685
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,039
the code samples for us come down to

686
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:05,440
the design specifications for specific

687
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,880
vaccine candidates

688
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,799
in terms of debugging vaccine candidates

689
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:10,559
you got to talk about protocols and

690
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:12,880
considerations for pre-clinical and

691
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,400
clinical testing

692
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,919
and ultimately it has to play well with

693
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:17,200
others we think

694
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,520
um and and you know this is achievable

695
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,440
through open source licensing like

696
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,000
creative commons um and through an

697
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:24,960
active

698
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,480
engaged uh you know developer ecosystem

699
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,360
um and ideally one that is committed to

700
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,760
this concept of working together or at

701
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,520
least learning from one another

702
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:39,200
as they each do maybe their own thing

703
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,159
so you know along that line um we think

704
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:44,240
that our white paper is kind of a

705
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,799
foundational open source vdk right a

706
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:49,919
vaccine developer kit and um it may be

707
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:52,159
that uh there's there's huge room for

708
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:54,400
improvement in the the construction and

709
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,559
the composition of vdks there are

710
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:58,320
certainly components of the white paper

711
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,360
that uh you know don't exist yet right

712
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,880
we um

713
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,520
we've done a lot to characterize uh our

714
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,320
our method of epitope selection um

715
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,640
and and you know various other things

716
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,039
that i've ever talked about but like um

717
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:15,440
it still kind of lives in a pdf right

718
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,440
and and um

719
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,039
i don't think pdf is necessarily

720
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:21,520
anyone's preferred format of engaging

721
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,400
with

722
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:26,159
um a project right or engaging with uh

723
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:27,279
you know it's not necessarily a

724
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:28,400
collaborative

725
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,559
ecosystem in and of itself so

726
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:34,159
we've started um a researchers map uh in

727
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:36,000
hopes of connecting people who are are

728
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,600
interested in doing uh vaccine

729
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,840
development together um or learning from

730
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,400
one another or uh you know sharing ideas

731
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,840
sharing resources and that kind of thing

732
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,400
but really it's in its foundational

733
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,120
stages and uh what i hope to achieve

734
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,960
here uh you know

735
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,840
is

736
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,520
both to to

737
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,600
pitch the the idea that

738
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,120
open source vaccine development is

739
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,080
useful

740
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:01,840
and achievable um but also that uh

741
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,600
you know it's worth your time right that

742
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,679
it's worth the uh

743
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:08,880
the engagement uh and the efforts of

744
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,360
people of all kinds of skill sets

745
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,559
um

746
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:15,360
so i think that we're at the beginning

747
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:18,320
um i think that we're we're facing

748
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,880
you know a variety of possible futures

749
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,840
but one of which is of open source

750
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,600
infrastructure for vaccine development

751
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,080
and essentially that infrastructure

752
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,840
extending the ability

753
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,640
to participate in vaccine research to

754
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,080
historically

755
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:37,679
excluded people right um and

756
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:40,400
you know the the the costs of exclusion

757
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,720
the costs of exclusivity in vaccine

758
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,240
development are things that we're

759
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,559
feeling um you know very acutely during

760
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:50,960
the covet 19 pandemic um but also that

761
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,200
uh you know unless we resolve them are

762
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,000
not going to be fixable uh with the old

763
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,679
way of doing things

764
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:00,000
so uh you know it's interesting then to

765
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,400
think about what would biosecurity look

766
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,799
like if it were decentralized right from

767
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:07,520
these sort of centralized nodes of

768
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,840
pharmaceutical companies uh with very

769
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,840
very high budgets um or potentially

770
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,880
their budgets um doing you know the

771
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,120
majority of these uh you know these

772
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,240
developments

773
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,799
um what if we were able to decentralize

774
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:23,200
that a little bit by bringing down uh

775
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,200
certain infrastructural costs or

776
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,600
infrastructural barriers the bdks i

777
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,480
think are are a way to make vaccinology

778
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,720
easy affordable accessible and for

779
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,279
people who want to

780
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:37,440
start vaccine companies which may be the

781
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,919
only way to get to a billion doses

782
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:43,360
i think again by reducing those costs

783
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,240
we can

784
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,320
we can get more people involved we can

785
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,240
see more vaccine innovation we can see

786
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,480
better vaccines that could get developed

787
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,960
and approved faster

788
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,559
and more effectively

789
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:57,919
so uh with that i thank you i hope uh

790
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:00,000
that uh that you got something out of

791
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,080
the presentation i hope that you'll uh

792
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,480
you'll get curious about what an open

793
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,159
source vaccine development future might

794
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:08,320
look like uh reach out to us at
