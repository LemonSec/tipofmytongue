1
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:03,120
welcome

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,400
i'm so glad you're joining our talk

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,799
today thanks for watching i'm excited to

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:08,559
talk about what technologists need to

5
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:09,840
know about the world of election

6
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:10,960
administration

7
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,120
so that you can plan how best to apply

8
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,719
your technical skills

9
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:17,600
to help save our democracy look before

10
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,480
we really dig in

11
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,560
i want to start by just being up front

12
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:21,600
and saying let's be honest

13
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,160
the topic of elections it's pretty rough

14
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,680
topic these days no matter your

15
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,199
political stripes

16
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:29,439
talking about it is dicey there's a lot

17
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:30,640
to be concerned about

18
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,320
and there's a lot of tough conversations

19
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,840
to be had

20
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,000
jimmy fallon he put it really well when

21
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:36,960
he talked about

22
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,399
just kind of how drawn out everything is

23
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:42,239
and how it can make us feel he said

24
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,000
today felt like waking up with a

25
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,719
hangover and then realizing that you're

26
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:48,079
still at the bar

27
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:49,360
and i thought that was a pretty good way

28
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,840
of putting it other people captured

29
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,480
their feelings around election night

30
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,079
this way look i've been working in

31
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,079
elections for 20 years

32
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,480
and it definitely feels like in the last

33
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,760
12 months

34
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,920
i've probably gotten more gray hairs on

35
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,520
my beard and in my hair

36
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,360
than in the previous 12 years straight

37
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,159
but to settle down seriously these are

38
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,799
very challenging times in elections

39
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,040
and the stakes are high election

40
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,799
officials in particular have been under

41
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:21,680
more stress than

42
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,920
anyone even to the point of being

43
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,119
harassed

44
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:27,680
intimidated and threatened with violence

45
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,920
like never before

46
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,280
that has to stop it absolutely has to

47
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,240
stop

48
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,960
and we've got big issues to solve

49
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,960
because let's be really clear

50
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,839
about what's at stake

51
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,680
that's what's at stake our democracy

52
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,200
and we need to be really clear about

53
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,000
that so what does technology have to do

54
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,320
with solving that problem well with

55
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,759
respect to technology

56
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,520
none is more consequential to democracy

57
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,759
than election technology of course

58
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,600
when it works well it helps contribute

59
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,680
to confidence in the election outcomes

60
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,399
strong democracy and social cohesion but

61
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,000
if it's not done right it contributes

62
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,639
to mistrust in government toxic hyper

63
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:11,760
partisanship

64
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,360
and that can of course feel totally

65
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,040
disheartening

66
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,720
but i'll tell you at this moment the

67
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,200
osset institute is optimistic

68
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,879
i'm going to say that again we are

69
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,640
optimistic

70
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,160
and i'll tell you the reason why is

71
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,800
because we can't think of another time

72
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,120
when so many americans have been so

73
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,560
interested in the topic of election

74
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,519
integrity

75
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,200
so we actually view this as a golden

76
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,120
opportunity to roll up our sleeves

77
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,720
to try to turn down the temperature on

78
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,879
division and to work together to

79
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:39,440
increase

80
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,920
public confidence in elections but

81
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,360
here's part of the challenge and here's

82
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,440
part of how we got here

83
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,360
a lot of the concerns and claims that

84
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,959
are made about elections and election

85
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,120
integrity they totally lack

86
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,519
context about how election

87
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,440
administration actually works

88
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,680
in fact a lot of the claims are based on

89
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,319
a misunderstanding of how elections work

90
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:01,920
and that makes it easier for

91
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,239
misinformation to spread

92
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,239
so fundamentally here's why we're doing

93
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:07,920
this talk because

94
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,239
everything looks suspicious when you

95
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,159
don't know how anything works

96
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,080
today's talk is a primer on technology

97
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,599
in the election administration operating

98
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:16,480
environment

99
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,800
what's common what's not and what you

100
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,159
should anticipate again

101
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,959
so that you can best apply your skills i

102
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:24,640
want to say up front that i do recognize

103
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,599
that there's going to be different

104
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,200
levels of experience in the audience

105
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:27,760
today

106
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,280
for some of you this is probably going

107
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,720
to feel like election administration 101

108
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,480
but i know there's also more experienced

109
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,720
folks and for you i hope you'll consider

110
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,640
this a kind of literature review

111
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,080
just to remind you of what's the most

112
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,879
important stuff in the landscape

113
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:45,519
so let me start especially for those of

114
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,360
you that are newer you might be asking

115
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,840
okay how hard can this be right i mean

116
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,720
voting tech

117
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,319
it's not rocket science right i've seen

118
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,000
these voting machines

119
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,599
i'm going to complicate that picture for

120
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:57,920
you because the list of requirements for

121
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,120
modern voting systems

122
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,920
is long they have to support complex

123
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,560
data

124
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,480
for thousands of jurisdictions with

125
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,879
potentially millions of voters

126
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,720
within those jurisdictions there are

127
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,560
hundreds if not thousands of different

128
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,080
ballot styles

129
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,920
the system has to support audio for

130
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,320
every single text string on the ballot

131
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,279
and it has to support translations of

132
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:22,000
every single audio and text string

133
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,840
and it has to do that for potentially up

134
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,199
to a dozen or so

135
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,759
foreign languages obviously the system

136
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,919
has to be extremely accurate

137
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:31,680
even though it relies on imperfect

138
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,600
infallible technology

139
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,360
and in this day and age it has to be

140
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,680
secure enough to protect against attacks

141
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,759
from foreign nation states or from

142
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,080
domestic bad actors

143
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,560
but even though it has to do all of that

144
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,880
it still has to be usable and intuitive

145
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,680
enough

146
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,600
for average voters and poll workers and

147
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,199
election officials to use

148
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:52,639
even if they're not especially tech

149
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,199
savvy it also needs features to

150
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,199
accommodate voters with disabilities

151
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,479
in addition to the general voting

152
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:01,120
population and of course it has to

153
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:01,840
support

154
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,800
transparency and verifiability and

155
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,840
here's the kicker

156
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,400
it has to do that while also absolutely

157
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,000
protecting voter privacy

158
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,320
anonymity and equality and after doing

159
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,400
all of those functional requirements it

160
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,080
still has to be afford enough

161
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,560
affordable enough for cash-strapped

162
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,560
counties and townships to buy

163
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,320
because the federal government has

164
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,919
actually been pretty modest

165
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,440
about its funding for elections

166
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,840
infrastructure so you can see that's a

167
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,280
pretty long list

168
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,000
oh i totally forgot one other thing yeah

169
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,160
um the peaceful transfer of power

170
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,639
depends on public confidence in the

171
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:39,520
performance

172
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,240
of the voting system so if you go back

173
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:42,960
and ask

174
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,440
hey it's not rocket science right some

175
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,320
people have said

176
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,440
it's harder i want to emphasize

177
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,120
also that election technology is just

178
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,560
part of a much larger and more

179
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,479
complicated system it's just one piece

180
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:55,440
of the puzzle

181
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,680
because election administration is

182
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,720
multi-layered

183
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,520
the tech is not operated in a vacuum in

184
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,039
fact election administration and

185
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:03,919
procedures

186
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:06,639
impose all kinds of limitations on how

187
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,400
the technology is used

188
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,160
and a lot of those limitations might be

189
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,919
different from what you're used to

190
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,160
in other more traditional technology

191
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,759
operating environments

192
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,120
the other reason that the election

193
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,199
problem is such a tough one to solve

194
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,039
is because in addition to solving for

195
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:22,880
the technology challenges

196
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,039
elections still have to meet five really

197
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:26,319
important pillars

198
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,880
of u.s election administration elections

199
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,319
have to comply with laws

200
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,400
court decisions and policies at the

201
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,000
federal and state and local

202
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,240
levels of course elections have to be

203
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,120
administered

204
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,120
in a fair way they have to be totally

205
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,720
free from political influence or

206
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,840
manipulation

207
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,639
the outcomes have to accurately reflect

208
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,960
the intent of the electorate

209
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,560
and they have to be based on voter

210
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,160
centric practices

211
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,919
elections have to support equal

212
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:53,280
opportunity for all

213
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,440
eligible voters to participate in the

214
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,280
democratic process

215
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,280
and finally election administration has

216
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,599
to meet the bar of transparency

217
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,280
because in order to support confidence

218
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,360
and trust election officials

219
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,919
have to be accountable to the public so

220
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:08,720
it's a tough

221
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,280
problem at the osset institute we use a

222
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,160
shorthand

223
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,400
which is vast elections have to be

224
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,360
verifiable

225
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,560
accurate secure and transparent

226
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,639
so let's dig deeper into three big

227
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,639
questions what's unique about elections

228
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,080
in the us

229
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,000
how are different types of technology

230
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,919
used in actual elections

231
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,319
and given that landscape how can you

232
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:30,960
help

233
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,000
where can you apply your skills so let's

234
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,440
start by talking about what's different

235
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,199
about us elections

236
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,080
most people start with the idea that's

237
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,759
most important and that is election

238
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,039
administration in the u.s is

239
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:44,319
decentralized

240
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,400
there is no uniform system of election

241
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,599
administration

242
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,919
in fact depending on how you slice it

243
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,639
there's eight thousand to ten thousand

244
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,120
different elections that are going on on

245
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,440
a national presidential election day

246
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,360
there's also a limited federal role the

247
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,039
10th amendment of the constitution

248
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:03,039
leaves the administration of elections

249
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:04,080
up to the states

250
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,840
they decide the time place and manner

251
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,919
for how elections are actually run

252
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,560
so not surprisingly that leads to widely

253
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,759
different practices that you're going to

254
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:12,000
see

255
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,840
from state to state there's different

256
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,440
voting methods there's different male

257
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,240
practices

258
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,599
there's different prohibitions on

259
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:19,199
certain types of technology like

260
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,879
wireless transmission of results for

261
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,560
example

262
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,440
so as a starting point if you ask

263
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,800
yourself all right what does this mean

264
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,520
for me

265
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,080
it's really really important that you

266
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,919
get to know how elections are run

267
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:35,039
in your county your township or your

268
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:35,839
state

269
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,760
what's local is what matters because

270
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,039
those practices are going to be

271
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,559
different from others

272
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,799
as a starting point if you want to take

273
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,240
a quick look

274
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,720
verified voting has an excellent

275
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,360
resource

276
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,480
out on the web that's called the

277
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,480
verifier and it is a database

278
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,920
of all the different types of voting

279
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,600
technology that's implemented across the

280
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,480
whole country

281
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,800
state by state and even county by county

282
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,560
so it richly

283
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,720
shows you how much of a patchwork it is

284
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,640
now despite that patchwork and despite

285
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,920
all the diversity there are some

286
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,440
important common threads in election

287
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,720
technology

288
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,200
it's a mixture of network connected

289
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,240
infrastructure

290
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,200
versus other components that certainly

291
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,880
in terms of best practices

292
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,519
and are usually they're air gaps i'll

293
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,279
return to that topic in more detail

294
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,200
later but it's basically the difference

295
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,800
between network connected voter

296
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,240
registration and reporting

297
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,440
infrastructure

298
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,399
versus the voting devices themselves

299
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,240
another important thing to note

300
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,760
that's different from other environments

301
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,760
is that in elections a lot of these

302
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,959
technology components

303
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,440
they move around they need to be

304
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,200
transported from a warehouse

305
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,680
onto a truck out into the world so that

306
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,800
people can vote

307
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,680
it's not simply servers in a data center

308
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,880
for example you have

309
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,040
e-poll books and voting machines that

310
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,880
need to be taken to senior center or the

311
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,720
library or the civic center

312
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,880
so that people can vote and that means

313
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,640
that in this world

314
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,720
physical security and procedural

315
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,480
controls and chain of custody and

316
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,680
documentation

317
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,480
are very very important and finally the

318
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,120
use of removable media for data transfer

319
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,200
is very common in election

320
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,600
administration technology

321
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,120
i want to dig a little deeper into this

322
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,120
distinction between election technology

323
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,800
versus voting technology

324
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,880
the the second one voting tech is a

325
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,920
subset

326
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,079
of the broader picture and to think

327
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:25,920
about it you just need to make three

328
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,360
critical distinctions

329
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,040
there's everything that has to do with

330
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,360
registration and voter services before

331
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,160
voting

332
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,640
so voter registration databases or

333
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,000
online services

334
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,480
like if a voter wants to request a mail

335
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,519
ballot for example

336
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:42,399
that's one layer before voting that's

337
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:43,680
separate and distinct from

338
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,880
casting ballots and casting ballots is

339
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,920
also separate from

340
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,200
counting votes it's only the last two

341
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:51,680
things

342
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,079
casting ballots and counting votes that

343
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,000
are part of the voting system strictly

344
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,920
speaking and voting systems are

345
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,399
typically air-gapped in contrast

346
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:01,839
election technology like voter

347
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,079
registration systems or web-based

348
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,240
reporting systems on the back end

349
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,760
are typically network connected

350
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,000
some more common threads voting

351
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,279
technology in the u.s

352
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,680
is sourced by a very small number of

353
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,320
vendors

354
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,240
this is a really consolidated market

355
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,320
about 80 percent of the marketplace

356
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,959
is served by just two big vendors and if

357
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:25,040
you add the third smallest vendor those

358
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,040
three companies alone have about 95

359
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,640
percent of the market

360
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,640
there's also high barriers to entry

361
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,120
because certification and voting systems

362
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,959
are specialized and complicated

363
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:37,760
there are very few new market entrants

364
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,880
new companies

365
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,880
that have gotten into this industry in

366
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,480
the last 10 years

367
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,640
the other thing that many are aware of

368
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,160
is that the pace of innovation

369
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,120
is slow if you've seen voting technology

370
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,320
up close

371
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,880
even new equipment it can feel kind of

372
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,920
old

373
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,320
voting systems also are not updated very

374
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,120
often

375
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,600
they kind of feel frozen in time one

376
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,279
thing that surprises a lot of people is

377
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:02,399
that even the

378
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,079
so-called latest greatest voting

379
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,079
technology products the ones from the

380
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:07,279
major vendors

381
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:09,600
many of which were just bought and

382
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,320
implemented

383
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,639
as recently as 2018 2019 2020

384
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,040
even the newest latest greatest products

385
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,279
are all designed to comply

386
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,839
with 16 year old federal standards

387
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:22,399
that's right

388
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,200
16 years old all the way back to 2005

389
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:25,839
and if you

390
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:27,760
need a little perspective on what

391
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,000
technology was like back then

392
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,079
it was before the iphone had even been

393
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:33,040
invented

394
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,959
if you wanted a smartphone you were

395
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:36,959
using a blackberry because that was the

396
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:38,079
only thing with a physical

397
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:41,279
keyboard and 2005 is also the same year

398
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:42,160
that uh

399
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,160
there was a little service that was

400
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,360
launched for the first time

401
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,920
to upload videos yeah it's called

402
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:48,560
youtube

403
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,760
that was in 2005. and many of you may be

404
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,360
surprised to know that there are systems

405
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,240
out in the field

406
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,560
that were used in the 2020 election that

407
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,560
are running on the windows 2000

408
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,600
operating system

409
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,000
and they have not had any security

410
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:02,639
updates

411
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:05,440
in 15 years the final thing that's

412
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,120
important to note about voting systems

413
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:07,760
is that it's

414
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,800
really hard to make agile changes why is

415
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,600
that

416
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,920
it's because certification so let's dig

417
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:14,800
into that

418
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,240
one thing i want to be clear when i talk

419
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,000
about certification in this elections

420
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,639
context

421
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,399
i'm not talking about certification of

422
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,760
results i'm talking about the

423
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,600
certification of voting systems

424
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,839
which basically means what's necessary

425
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:27,920
to get them approved for use

426
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,519
and in the us we have a two-tiered

427
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,680
system and the fact that it's two-tiered

428
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,000
results in really long-time horizons

429
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,920
there's a federal certification layer

430
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,839
that is administered by the u.s

431
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:39,839
election assistance commission or the

432
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:40,880
eac

433
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,079
and the eac is who runs the program that

434
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:45,760
tests for compliance with the federal

435
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,480
standards

436
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,480
that are called the voluntary voting

437
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,120
system guidelines or the vvsg

438
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,279
but complying with the federal standards

439
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,480
the vbsg

440
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,240
that's just the first step that's just

441
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,399
table stakes or the prerequisite

442
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,959
for a whole separate additional state by

443
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,240
state process

444
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,320
and every state has its own unique

445
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,600
approval process

446
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,440
for voting systems with one exception

447
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,519
mississippi which doesn't require

448
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:11,519
certification of voting systems

449
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,160
approximately 40 states require some

450
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,279
form of testing

451
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:17,839
to the federal dbsg standards and they

452
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,079
again get to decide whether they want to

453
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:21,839
make that a prerequisite that's why it

454
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,279
is a voluntary

455
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,120
program this is what leads to long time

456
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,240
horizons a federal certification program

457
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,040
can three to eighteen months depending

458
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,120
on whether it's a relatively small

459
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,639
modification that's being made to a

460
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:35,279
system

461
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:36,959
or whether it's a brand new system that

462
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,560
maybe takes a year and a half to get

463
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,000
through the whole process

464
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,560
and state certification can also take

465
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,519
another

466
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:45,760
three to twelve months so when you add

467
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,079
those two timelines together by the time

468
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:50,160
product hits the streets for election

469
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,040
officials to actually buy it and use it

470
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,959
it's already behind the times it's

471
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:56,959
already prematurely obsolete to some

472
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:57,680
extent

473
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,680
because of course the threat environment

474
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,639
is constantly evolving

475
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:03,519
a couple other things about

476
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:06,079
certification voting systems

477
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:09,440
they end up being very rigid because

478
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,560
certification

479
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,959
creates the rigidity there's a lot of

480
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:14,560
different components in a voting system

481
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,440
including

482
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,199
back office computers that are called

483
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:19,040
the election management system

484
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,199
versus your actual voting devices for

485
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:23,199
example your scanners

486
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:25,519
and every single one of those components

487
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:26,320
has its own

488
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,800
major and minor software revision for

489
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,680
example

490
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,320
but the way certification works is the

491
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,199
certification

492
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:35,680
applies to a specific system

493
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,440
configuration

494
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,320
so if something in the software of any

495
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,600
one of those components

496
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,079
needs to change for some reason that

497
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:45,519
effectively results

498
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:47,199
in a totally different system

499
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:49,519
configuration which can trigger a new

500
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:52,720
round of retesting and recertification

501
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,720
there are some policies for truly truly

502
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,240
minor changes that are called

503
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,360
de minimis but just as an example in

504
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,639
voting systems

505
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:03,040
security patches cannot simply be rolled

506
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,279
out to already deployed systems

507
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:06,560
in the way that you can do in other

508
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,320
technology environments for example

509
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,759
so for all of these reasons net net

510
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:14,800
the big vendors prefer to kind of rest

511
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,600
on their old

512
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,079
product and to not have to go through

513
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:20,160
certification more than necessary

514
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,240
and so lots of times they end up just

515
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,839
making smaller changes around the

516
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:26,240
margins and less frequently

517
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,560
what it ultimately results in is these

518
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,759
dynamics

519
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:32,399
they incentivize doing less innovation

520
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:33,680
not more

521
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,040
and one last thing i want to mention

522
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,800
that you may be interested to know is

523
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,120
that open-ended penetration testing

524
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,120
is actually relatively rare there are

525
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,639
some exceptional states

526
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:44,880
california and colorado come to mind and

527
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,160
the eac

528
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,079
this year for the first time is trying

529
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:50,000
to launch a pilot pen

530
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,320
testing program but as far as most of

531
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,839
the voting systems that are out in the

532
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:55,519
field and have been used

533
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:58,079
the ones that are designed to those 2005

534
00:16:58,079 --> 00:16:59,519
standards

535
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,759
most of those have never gone through

536
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:02,880
pen testing

537
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,799
in the traditional way that you think of

538
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,400
it

539
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,439
so let's talk a little bit about how the

540
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:09,919
different

541
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:12,160
layers of technology work together and

542
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,599
how this is a complex

543
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:16,079
you know arrangement in this diagram i

544
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:17,359
really just kind of want to

545
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,679
focus on two main things there's a lot

546
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,599
of moving parts in election technology

547
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,439
overall the system is more complicated

548
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:24,640
than you may think

549
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,280
and again there's different layers only

550
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,880
some of those layers are the voting

551
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,840
system

552
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,840
others have to do with pre-voting or

553
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,880
reporting

554
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,640
and that's again why you get this

555
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,320
combination of some of it is network

556
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,039
connected

557
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:39,679
and some of it is not so in this example

558
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:40,160
just

559
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,679
looking at the four different rows you

560
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:43,200
have voter registration

561
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,039
you have processes that have to happen

562
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:46,799
before voting begins namely the

563
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,400
preparation of ballots

564
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,280
the voting itself again casting and

565
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,160
counting

566
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,080
and then reporting and each one of those

567
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,320
has its own moving parts in voter

568
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,360
registration

569
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,600
you have voter registration databases

570
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,559
you have

571
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:04,640
the increasing popularity of electronic

572
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,600
poll books

573
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,280
those also have their own software

574
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,960
managers for the poll books

575
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,559
and then there's those online services

576
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,160
that i mentioned earlier

577
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,919
managing the election data and laying

578
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:15,760
out ballots is part of the election

579
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,120
management system

580
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,280
in the elections office and then when

581
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,640
you look at the voting ban

582
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,600
again precinct scanners central count

583
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,559
scanners

584
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:28,000
for mail ballots for example accessible

585
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,039
voting devices and then you also have

586
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:34,080
the tabulation system once again

587
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,760
a computer that is in the central

588
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,640
elections office and that is distinct

589
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,360
from web-based reporting that you know

590
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,000
voters in the

591
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,840
media use to consume those election

592
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,280
night results

593
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,200
unofficial election night's reporting is

594
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,600
simply receiving data exports

595
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,280
from the system that actually counts

596
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,840
ballots and it's displaying all of those

597
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,559
so you can see again multi-layered

598
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,080
complex system

599
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,080
as i mentioned earlier it's not just

600
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,000
about the technology

601
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,280
in fact increasingly paper records

602
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,760
are a really important way to compensate

603
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,919
for technology security vulnerabilities

604
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:10,720
and to reduce

605
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,120
risk now generally speaking in recent

606
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,360
years the trend here is positive

607
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,840
because in the most recent election

608
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,000
upward of 90 percent of the ballots cast

609
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,240
included some form of a paper record

610
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,000
compared to a few years ago

611
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
when paperless direct recording

612
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,320
electronic devices were more common

613
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,840
and if you're wondering yes there are

614
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,000
still paperless dres out there

615
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,320
that are being used and in fact some

616
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,480
counties just bought new generations of

617
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,679
paperless dres

618
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,880
as recently as 2017 but one thing i want

619
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,240
to emphasize about

620
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,559
paper is that not all paper records are

621
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:45,679
created equal

622
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,720
and the different formats present

623
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,760
more additional controversies and more

624
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,559
types of risk you have to pay attention

625
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:55,840
to the difference between

626
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,720
traditional format paper ballots versus

627
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,720
machine marked paper ballots

628
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,120
that encode voter choices in barcodes or

629
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,960
qr codes and so forth

630
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,559
i know there's some of the audience that

631
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:08,400
are familiar with that topic i don't

632
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,159
have time today to go into it

633
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:12,559
but i'll sum up this topic of paper by

634
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:13,360
saying

635
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,120
that given the technology

636
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,200
vulnerabilities that of course exist

637
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,600
in complex computing devices the

638
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,960
critical question

639
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,159
to keep in your mind is the paper record

640
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:26,880
a record of what the voter did or is it

641
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,880
a record of what a machine did

642
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,200
because of course we can't simply assume

643
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,000
that the machines are trustworthy the

644
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
other reason that paper is so important

645
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:36,880
is because of

646
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,240
post-election audits look with these

647
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,679
complex systems

648
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:44,559
it's not surprising that the increase in

649
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:45,919
consensus is

650
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:47,520
it's unlikely that we're going to plug

651
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,520
every single hole in the dam

652
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,919
and because we can't plug every hole

653
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:53,280
that's why

654
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,080
having robust paper trails and robust

655
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,440
post-election audits

656
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,120
are the most important thing that we can

657
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,640
do right now to enhance election

658
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,600
integrity

659
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,360
that is part of what's called

660
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,120
evidence-based elections

661
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,960
many of you probably heard that phrase

662
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,600
the idea of evidence-based elections

663
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,720
is that you want processes that produce

664
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,880
public evidence that the reported

665
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,640
winners really won and the reported

666
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,600
losers really

667
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,159
lost and what's central to

668
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:22,000
evidence-based elections is the idea of

669
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,679
software independence

670
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:25,360
there's lots of different ways to state

671
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,600
software independence but in a nutshell

672
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,679
it's the idea that the integrity of the

673
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:31,200
election outcome

674
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,440
cannot be dependent on trusting the

675
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,120
correctness of the software

676
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,880
it has to be capable of being

677
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,960
independently verified

678
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,720
generally speaking what happens in an

679
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,880
audit is you have human beings

680
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,240
that are reviewing a trustworthy trail

681
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,600
of paper records

682
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,760
that can reliably be said to reflect the

683
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,799
voter's intent

684
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:53,120
and you compare those records to the

685
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,280
voting system's reported totals

686
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,120
the gold standard for post-election

687
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,320
audits is the

688
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,200
risk limiting audit which one of its

689
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:01,840
benefits

690
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,919
is it's a method of doing audit and

691
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:06,000
audit that can be very efficient

692
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,240
because you can achieve a high

693
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,919
statistical confidence

694
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:12,159
that your results are correct based on

695
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:12,960
reviewing

696
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,080
a pretty modest number of random ballots

697
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,280
depending on the margin size i want to

698
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,320
emphasize

699
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,760
there is a growing interest in

700
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,240
post-election audits and rightly so

701
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,960
done correctly they are absolutely

702
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,840
essential

703
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,760
but it's really important to emphasize

704
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,559
that there are specific best practices

705
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,720
for audits although i don't have time to

706
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,480
go into the details here

707
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,400
we'll provide a link with several

708
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,320
resources at the end and i want to

709
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:40,799
mention

710
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:43,440
that one of the key architects of risk

711
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,960
limiting audits is professor of

712
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,919
statistics

713
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:48,159
dr philip stark he actually invented the

714
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:49,039
rla

715
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:51,200
and in full disclosure he sits on the

716
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,000
osad institute's board of advisors

717
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,679
now beyond post-election audits i want

718
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:57,440
to mention one more thing

719
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,960
and it again it involves process

720
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,720
it's important to understand that

721
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,720
election night results

722
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,720
what you're seeing and what the media is

723
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,760
reporting

724
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,640
those are not official results and

725
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,159
they're not the final results

726
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:14,960
they're not complete at that time the

727
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,600
official certification of results come

728
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:21,520
only after a routine and pretty lengthy

729
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,200
post-election day process that is called

730
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,280
the canvas i want to emphasize that

731
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,360
ballots cast in the united states

732
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,480
are counted in the united states period

733
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,400
and part of that counting is again the

734
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,840
canvas when

735
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,159
when election officials do the canvas

736
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:37,679
which can take weeks

737
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:40,320
they are reviewing all of the paperwork

738
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,440
that documents

739
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,120
how the election was run they're

740
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,720
reconciling numbers and they're

741
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,600
accounting for

742
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,840
every single ballot that was cast to

743
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:48,720
ensure

744
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,520
that every valid vote cast is included

745
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,120
in the election totals

746
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,320
and that invalid ones are of course not

747
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,159
now that we've looked at the landscape

748
00:23:58,159 --> 00:23:59,919
for election technology and how it

749
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:01,200
actually gets used

750
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,760
let's wrap up with thinking about ways

751
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,720
that you can help

752
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,640
if you want to get more engaged to

753
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,720
enhance election integrity

754
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,880
a few starter thoughts although there's

755
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,400
a lot of different ways to

756
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,880
potentially get involved here's some

757
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,799
common things to bear in mind

758
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:18,880
first if you really are going to start

759
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,320
working more closely

760
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,480
in your community with local election

761
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,360
officials or

762
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,000
or making contact with the state be

763
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,080
prepared to be patient

764
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,440
remember you're dealing with critical

765
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,120
infrastructure and

766
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,880
the politics and so forth around these

767
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,400
issues can be delicate

768
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,320
you should expect a background check if

769
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,000
you're really going to get plugged in

770
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,320
and that's a good thing i also want to

771
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,200
remind you

772
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,279
learn about the practices in your state

773
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:44,400
and locality

774
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,559
again at the state level that's usually

775
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,720
the secretary of state

776
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,039
less common but it might also be the

777
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:52,640
board of elections

778
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,559
and in your immediate community that's

779
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,080
typically the county clerk or the

780
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,200
township clerk

781
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,600
i also want to mention that ways to get

782
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,279
engaged you can do that either on an

783
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:02,720
individual basis

784
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,120
or you might see if your local officials

785
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,000
would consider

786
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,159
being open to an advisory group some of

787
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:10,000
them do that as well

788
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,640
as far as ideas on how you can apply

789
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,039
your tech skills here's a starter list

790
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:16,559
and there's a lot more

791
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:18,320
if you have a particular expertise in

792
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,919
cyber security

793
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:21,360
obviously helping with network

794
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,120
vulnerabilities is going to be very

795
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:23,919
valuable

796
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:25,840
that really means voter registration

797
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,120
systems or

798
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,440
election night reporting systems those

799
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,279
are typically administered at the county

800
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,679
or the state level

801
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:35,840
if you also have expertise in cyber

802
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,919
incident contingency planning

803
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:39,760
you can help with that more and more

804
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,200
election officials are learning about

805
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,320
the importance of this

806
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,159
but it's new to a lot of them and they

807
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:45,440
need help and

808
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,840
really just kind of being a hand to hold

809
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,000
and being a kind of cyber navigator

810
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,720
could be very valuable if you're most

811
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,320
interested in helping with election

812
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,799
security in your area in your locality

813
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:58,080
there's a good reason that a lot of

814
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,919
people say hey a great introduction is

815
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:01,760
just a volunteer as a poll worker to

816
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,640
start

817
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,320
that will provide you with an awareness

818
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,240
of the overall operating environment

819
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,760
and give you a really good trusted

820
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,679
foundation to work more closely

821
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:12,720
with local staff if you're really

822
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,320
interested in the specific

823
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,799
technical vulnerabilities in the

824
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:19,120
deployed voting systems in your state

825
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,360
the best people to talk to are the state

826
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,120
certification authorities

827
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,640
again those are typically in the

828
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,480
secretary of state's office or the board

829
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,520
of elections

830
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,600
and it may also a good place to start is

831
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,679
that certification records

832
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:33,919
for voting systems with details of the

833
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:35,200
testing that happened

834
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,840
and the technical analysis and any

835
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,039
vulnerabilities that's usually

836
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:41,440
publicly available if you have

837
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,039
sufficient expertise you can also

838
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:45,440
support the standards creation process

839
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,039
at the national institute of standards

840
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:49,600
and technology or with the federal

841
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,520
cyber security and infrastructure

842
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,279
security agency

843
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:54,880
for example you may be surprised there

844
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,559
are currently no federal standards for

845
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:58,240
voter registration systems

846
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,799
or for electronic poll books you can

847
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:02,799
always burn up more on best practices

848
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:04,400
for post-election audits

849
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,840
and finally if you have expertise in

850
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,440
helping to protect the security of

851
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,400
websites

852
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,000
you can help election officials to

853
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,440
protect and secure

854
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,840
all their public communication channels

855
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,840
public websites social media and so

856
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:18,240
forth

857
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,399
and that can be especially valuable for

858
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:22,159
smaller counties because a lot of them

859
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:24,799
just don't have those kinds of resources

860
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:26,240
so let me leave you with some takeaway

861
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,039
thoughts i hope that today's talk has

862
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:30,159
helped you to see

863
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:32,240
that enhancing election integrity

864
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,279
involves more

865
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:35,360
than solving some really hard technology

866
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,399
problems

867
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:39,039
it definitely requires that but remember

868
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:41,279
the tech is just one piece of the puzzle

869
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:43,440
if i've done nothing else today i hope i

870
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,120
can help you understand

871
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,039
how the world of elections is really

872
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:49,360
complicated again there's all those

873
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,559
different layers

874
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:53,679
of law and policy and procedure all of

875
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:55,120
that imposes constraints

876
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,520
on how the technology gets used and on

877
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,080
what might be possible in the future

878
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,440
i also want to say thank you for

879
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,440
watching seriously

880
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,559
thank you the elections community really

881
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:09,760
wants and needs more technology experts

882
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,480
we want more security-minded and

883
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,840
tech-savvy people

884
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,480
of all genders all races all creeds all

885
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,600
political stripes

886
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:21,200
to step up so thank you for doing that

887
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,360
on that note i also want to emphasize

888
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,120
another important point

889
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,120
to have a productive partnership between

890
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,120
technologists and election officials

891
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,799
it's really really important that both

892
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:32,720
sides have a really healthy mutual

893
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,320
respect

894
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,799
i know that as technology experts you

895
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:38,880
all have a deep appreciation

896
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,240
for just how complex technology can be

897
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,960
and where the vulnerabilities might lie

898
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,720
but i hope that today has also helped

899
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,360
you to see

900
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,159
that's also true on the other side again

901
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:52,399
elections are a complicated business

902
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:54,960
these are professionals they care deeply

903
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,240
about democracy

904
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,640
and they have a deep level of expertise

905
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,960
that i hope you can also learn from

906
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,120
and when both sides work together that's

907
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,600
when great things happen

908
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,360
if today's talk has helped you to feel

909
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,600
more motivated and just to have a better

910
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,799
practical sense

911
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:13,039
of how to get more involved then that's

912
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:16,000
great that's what we were hoping to do

913
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
and then with your new knowledge i hope

914
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,640
that you can educate more people as well

915
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,760
together we can try to ensure that more

916
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,600
accurate information gets spread more

917
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,640
widely

918
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,080
and that misinformation and

919
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,559
misunderstandings don't

920
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:32,880
at the end of the day this is what it

921
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,760
takes

922
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,320
to increase public confidence in

923
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,360
elections

924
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,840
and to defend our democracy thank you so

925
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,520
much for being a part of that

926
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:54,720
and have a great rest of your day

927
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,799
you
