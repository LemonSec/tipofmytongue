00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,840
hello

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:07,680
welcome to my talk

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:08,880
i'm cheryl biswas i also go by encrypted

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,840
and

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:14,000
i really appreciate you taking the time

6
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:17,039
to discover

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,960
software supply chain attacks and the

8
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:22,160
chinese apts

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:26,439
who have been increasingly behind them

10
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,439
signed sealed and delivered

11
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,719
so

12
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:35,280
who am i

13
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:38,640
i work as a threat intel analyst with a

14
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,879
major bank here in toronto canada

15
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,440
i am a founding member of the diana

16
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:45,760
initiative we just had our this

17
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,039
conference that was online

18
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,680
much thanks and appreciation to

19
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:53,199
everybody who was able to be part of

20
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:55,680
this we love supporting inclusion

21
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:57,199
diversity and just drawing a bigger

22
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,039
circle about who we bring into this

23
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:02,079
amazing field

24
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:04,479
i'm a member of the c3x college student

25
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:06,720
cyber simulation here in toronto and

26
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:09,119
it's an annual event because it's great

27
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,720
to be able to give college students the

28
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,720
opportunity to learn

29
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,400
in a real life environment

30
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,640
what it feels like to

31
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,960
respond to an incident how to

32
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,200
communicate with management and just to

33
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,560
be able to pay it forward because we all

34
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,439
started somewhere

35
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,439
okay

36
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:27,200
that's enough exciting things about me i

37
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,880
am a cat mom but you don't get to see my

38
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,880
cats they are in the other room

39
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,799
all right

40
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,159
in this talk i want to explain what

41
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:42,880
software supply chain attacks are and

42
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:45,000
the growing threats that they pose

43
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:48,000
so we're going to take a look at

44
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,799
codependency how that's a factor

45
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,720
and how it's compounded by mistakes and

46
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,960
misconfigurations

47
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:57,000
we're going to take a look at

48
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:00,799
some of the attacks and the

49
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,560
state-sponsored actors that are involved

50
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:05,360
and what this will do is highlight the

51
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,200
prevalence of chinese threat actors who

52
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,119
continue to up their game

53
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,280
and the number of victims

54
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,640
and then we'll wrap up with what we

55
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,200
could do better

56
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:17,520
and how we need to shift

57
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,520
okay

58
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:24,239
i thought that this

59
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,239
would be a great starting point

60
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,879
what a year it's been

61
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,560
even before we got out of the game the

62
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:35,360
tone was set

63
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,599
solar winds was truly unprecedented and

64
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:40,160
it's the kind of event that we talk

65
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:41,519
about for decades we build and we learn

66
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,120
off of it

67
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,200
but the thing is

68
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,720
software supply chain attacks aren't

69
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,280
something new

70
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,680
they've been around for many years

71
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,640
and we've been watching that check

72
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:57,040
engine light for a long time but not

73
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,519
really addressing the issues

74
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:04,200
so i'm here to tell you there is a lot

75
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:04,200
more going on than we realize

76
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,519
a supply chain attack

77
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,959
is an abuse of trust

78
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,120
it's compromise

79
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:15,680
right at the source

80
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,599
this can create access points into the

81
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,480
networks of those customers

82
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:23,519
into the thousands as was demonstrated

83
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:25,440
by the attack against solarwinds orion

84
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,519
and as we learned

85
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:32,200
nobody is untouchable

86
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:32,200
everyone is a potential target

87
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:37,519
according to mitre attack a software

88
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,760
supply chain attack happens when hackers

89
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,760
manipulate the code in third-party

90
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:44,400
software components in order to

91
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,640
compromise the downstream applications

92
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,200
that use them

93
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,120
attackers leverage compromised software

94
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:54,560
in order to steal data

95
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:57,439
or to corrupt targeted systems

96
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,439
or to gain access to other parts of a

97
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,799
victim's network through lateral

98
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:03,360
movement

99
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:05,519
and any other upstream part of an

100
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,760
organization's supply chain

101
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:10,720
can then be targeted now that can

102
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:13,040
include application developers

103
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:15,680
or publishers of just off-the-shelf

104
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:18,479
software like solarwinds

105
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:22,880
but also think of api providers and

106
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:25,199
there are a lot more apis by the day

107
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:27,040
and just the open source community in

108
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,600
general

109
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:32,000
quote the attackers tamper with the

110
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:35,120
development process of the software to

111
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,440
inject a malicious component

112
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,040
such as a remote access tool

113
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,919
that will allow them to establish a

114
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:44,080
foothold into the targeted organization

115
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:45,440
or individual

116
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,160
pretty powerful

117
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,160
very effective

118
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,560
now this is a timeline of events going

119
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:57,840
from the end of 2020

120
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,280
into this year and as you can see

121
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,280
it got busy

122
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,440
you might even recognize some items on

123
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:06,400
there and we'll talk a bit about most of

124
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:08,560
these as we go through

125
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,880
as that attackers will manipulate

126
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,600
software dependencies and development

127
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:15,680
tools in order to compromise the data or

128
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,400
systems before

129
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,000
before they reach the recipient

130
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,400
and as we've seen

131
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,800
they go after the source code

132
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,720
now in the case of solarwinds

133
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,120
microsoft said that attackers gained

134
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,800
access to some of the source code for

135
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,280
exchange

136
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,199
azure and intune

137
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,680
i don't have to tell you

138
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:40,720
especially not after this march just how

139
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:44,240
many exchange boxes are in use out there

140
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:47,120
or how many many organizations have

141
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,880
azure up and running or in the process

142
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,759
of getting them up and running with the

143
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,759
mass migration to cloud environments

144
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:56,080
having the source code

145
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:58,400
lets the attacker look for undiscovered

146
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,520
vulnerabilities in order to exploit them

147
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,720
first

148
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:04,720
and they like to go after certificates

149
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,960
and that's another thing software

150
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,960
certificates

151
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:11,680
they're involved in so many of these

152
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:14,160
attacks pretty much all of them

153
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:16,960
stolen code signing certificates allow

154
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:19,039
the attackers to evade detection and to

155
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,720
deliver malware payloads

156
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:22,319
as though it comes from a legitimate

157
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,039
source because of course with a

158
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:26,080
certificate why wouldn't it signed

159
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:28,080
sealed

160
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,360
delivered

161
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,600
this is what

162
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:34,319
chinese apt barium did

163
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:37,199
with the azus live update when they

164
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:39,680
infected asus users on mass

165
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:42,880
and certificate abuse is an ongoing

166
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:47,199
component in all kinds of attacks for

167
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:49,520
example two years ago in an npm attack

168
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,720
developer accounts were targeted

169
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:54,080
and build

170
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,080
environments were compromised

171
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:01,280
so let's talk about the who and the why

172
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:05,199
this is definitely the purview of

173
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:07,520
state-sponsored threat actors

174
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:10,000
who have been in many cases identified

175
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:15,039
as a group of chinese cyber espionage

176
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:17,599
groups known as abc 10 apt 17 and apt-41

177
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:20,240
the various other nicknames

178
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:22,479
as well as some major

179
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:25,280
russian threat actors

180
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:27,680
now china has actively targeted tech

181
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:30,400
companies in taiwan with supply chain

182
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,800
attacks because they see them as major

183
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:35,599
competition

184
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,919
and this is what where i do threat

185
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:40,880
intelligence plays a key role because

186
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:42,960
we're we're watching the geopolitics

187
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,960
play out and we're reaching back for

188
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:47,360
historical context

189
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:50,080
on patterns of behavior

190
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,440
because history repeats itself

191
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:54,479
and actions

192
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,479
have consequences

193
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:59,039
ian pratt who is the global head of

194
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:00,879
security for personal systems at hp had

195
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:03,360
this to say

196
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:05,599
whether they are a direct target or a

197
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,960
stepping stone to gain access to bigger

198
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:08,879
targets

199
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:11,120
as we've seen with the upstream supply

200
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:13,759
chain attack against solar winds

201
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:16,080
organizations of all sizes need to be

202
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:18,160
cognizant of this risk

203
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:20,000
now both cyber criminal and

204
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,879
state-sponsored groups

205
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,599
target the technology industry because

206
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:28,240
these companies are relied on by

207
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:32,479
many organizations and individuals

208
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:35,039
and that can have a wide-ranging impact

209
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:37,680
attacks on tech companies can enable

210
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:39,039
third-party compromise of enterprise

211
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:43,120
customers

212
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:45,120
via software supply chain attacks

213
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,399
and that's the beauty of a supply chain

214
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,320
attack

215
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:49,600
you don't have to go directly after your

216
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:53,320
target

217
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,320
you come at them sideways

218
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:01,040
nick weaver the security researcher at

219
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,560
uc berkeley international computer

220
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,080
science institute

221
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,080
shares this

222
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,320
supply chain attacks are scary because

223
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,760
they're really hard to deal with and

224
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:13,040
because they make it clear that you are

225
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:14,480
trusting a whole ecology

226
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,720
you are trusting

227
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,880
every vendor whose code is on your

228
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:21,519
machine and you're trusting every

229
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:23,600
vendor's vendor

230
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,440
we're grappling with the growing sense

231
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,440
of complexity in tech

232
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,600
and it's not just what corporations

233
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,440
deploy in their own environments

234
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,600
but how they're incorporating

235
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,480
third-party tech

236
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:39,279
as windows snyder says the product

237
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,720
assumes all the security risk

238
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:43,360
of all the components that it

239
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,360
incorporates

240
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,600
need to say more

241
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,320
as i mentioned earlier

242
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,399
we

243
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:03,360
are increasingly code dependent

244
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,880
sorry bad pun

245
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,200
the fact is that

246
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,959
applications increasingly depend on

247
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,120
external software to work

248
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:13,120
there's proprietary code

249
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,200
open source components

250
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,760
third-party apis

251
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:20,399
modern apps are simply too big for just

252
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:22,399
one developer to try and do on their own

253
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,640
so software reuse

254
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:26,880
has become the norm

255
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:29,760
and there's popular open source projects

256
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:31,760
which are used as dependencies

257
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,120
these become attractive targets for an

258
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,680
attacker

259
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,440
who can then add malicious code to them

260
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:40,240
and claim the users of those

261
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,240
dependencies

262
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,800
for github security researcher maya

263
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:48,560
kawazurowski

264
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:49,600
85 to 97 of enterprise software code

265
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:53,120
bases

266
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:55,360
come from open source components

267
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,959
yeah that is a big number

268
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:00,640
what's the average project having

269
00:10:57,959 --> 00:11:04,240
203 dependencies

270
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:06,800
that's a lot of trust involved

271
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,560
now given how sophisticated these

272
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,880
attacks can get

273
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,720
any project that doesn't incorporate

274
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:15,600
basic protections

275
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:17,920
like code signing puts itself at

276
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,519
considerable risk

277
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:22,079
again

278
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:26,200
we're using other people's technology

279
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:26,200
this is about trust issues

280
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:32,399
this is a timeline

281
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:34,320
of software package repositories that

282
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,839
have been involved in supply chain

283
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,240
attacks

284
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:40,640
it's really easy to just get code from

285
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:43,600
various projects online and then

286
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:45,360
incorporate that into other software

287
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,519
but here's the risk

288
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,519
some of those open source projects are

289
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:53,200
widely used but they're not well

290
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:55,760
maintained some have even been abandoned

291
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:58,160
code reuse can help to simplify and

292
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:00,480
speed up application development

293
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,279
but it's at the cost of being vulnerable

294
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,560
to

295
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:06,959
compromised off-the-shelf components

296
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:09,279
now for an attacker compromising a

297
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:12,000
software supply chain can be through the

298
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:13,200
manipulation of the application source

299
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,600
code

300
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,680
or the manipulation of the update and

301
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:21,200
distribution methods

302
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:23,279
or by replacing compiled releases with

303
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,279
modified versions

304
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:27,600
and targets can range from either a

305
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:29,200
really specific and limited group

306
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:32,240
to a very

307
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,240
wide range

308
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:37,600
and that brings us here

309
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:41,200
the continuous integration and

310
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:43,760
continuous delivery pipeline ci cd

311
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,959
it's considered a best practice for

312
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,639
devops

313
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:49,360
because it helps them to deliver code

314
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:50,959
changes frequently and reliably it's a

315
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:54,160
good thing

316
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:56,800
now ci is a coding philosophy it's a set

317
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,680
of practices to help drive development

318
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,399
teams

319
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:02,800
to implement small changes

320
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:05,920
and then check in code to version

321
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:08,079
control repositories frequently again

322
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:10,959
this is a great practice

323
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:12,079
it's a consistent automated way to build

324
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:15,040
package

325
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:17,200
and test applications

326
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:20,720
with one caveat

327
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:24,160
we're using other people's technology

328
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,160
mistakes will be made

329
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:32,800
yes

330
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,560
in mcafee's blog from

331
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:37,440
last july

332
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:39,120
sikar sarokai and i hope i didn't mangle

333
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,360
that

334
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,120
had this to talk about with regard to a

335
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,560
source code leak

336
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,560
and

337
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:49,120
what we should have learned from that

338
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:52,079
and how we need to protect our ips

339
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:54,720
there was a sonar cube misconfiguration

340
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:58,480
and it led to a massive leak of source

341
00:13:54,720 --> 00:14:01,920
code which affected 50 major companies

342
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:04,720
sonarcube is an open source tool that's

343
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:08,800
used for static code analysis and to

344
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,800
check for bugs before deployment

345
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:16,079
now based on the attacks

346
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:19,639
developers and insecure development

347
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:21,199
pipelines are ideal targets either for

348
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:23,440
state-backed

349
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:27,880
apts or

350
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,880
highly resourced criminal groups

351
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,079
and let's discover what those

352
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:36,560
adversarial inclinations

353
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,560
look like

354
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,160
this is

355
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:42,639
from a report called broken trust and it

356
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,880
was released by the atlantic council

357
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:46,160
earlier this year following

358
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:50,320
solar winds

359
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:53,040
there was a lot to be processed

360
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:55,120
there have been 36 other cases of

361
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:58,720
intruders successfully targeting

362
00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:00,800
software updates from 138 recorded

363
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,480
supply chain attacks and vulnerability

364
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,720
disclosures

365
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:08,000
now of these 36

366
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:10,160
15 had similar access to build or update

367
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,199
the infrastructure

368
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:15,600
think about that that is a lot of

369
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:19,120
control when you can tamper with and

370
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:22,320
modify existing infrastructure

371
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:25,880
and half of those 15 could be attributed

372
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,880
to nation states

373
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:34,399
on december the 14th 2020

374
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:37,600
the news hit

375
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:40,160
now solarwinds orion is trusted network

376
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:42,480
management and monitoring software it's

377
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:44,560
used by governments

378
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,560
fortune 500s

379
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,759
security companies like

380
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:51,199
fireeye

381
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:55,839
major tech companies like microsoft

382
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:55,839
and nobody knew anything was wrong

383
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:00,800
what's distinctive here

384
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,720
is the degree of stealth

385
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,160
the ability of the adversary to conceal

386
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,240
their actions

387
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:08,639
and the length of time it took

388
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:11,440
for this to be discovered this was an

389
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:14,000
operation that took time and precision

390
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:16,399
to do the necessary reconnaissance

391
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,839
the sophistication to tailor all the

392
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:20,240
pieces

393
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:25,600
and then the patience to just let it

394
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:25,600
play out and avoid detection

395
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:32,000
they targeted and compromised the

396
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:35,199
software build environment and code

397
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,040
signing infrastructure for orion

398
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:38,480
code there's that word

399
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,639
code signing

400
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,560
they modified the source code

401
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:44,880
to add a backdoor

402
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:46,880
and they signed it

403
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:50,399
they leveraged the existing software

404
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:52,959
release management system

405
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:55,759
and they used stolen certificate

406
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:57,600
certificates to laterally move through

407
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:58,560
chains of trust

408
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,839
signed

409
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:02,839
sealed

410
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:02,839
delivered

411
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,280
this attack

412
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:13,919
is significant

413
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,360
and i want to tell you a bit about it

414
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,559
because it's something we all need to

415
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:18,319
learn from

416
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:20,400
and remember that things continue to

417
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:22,799
evolve and this just presents

418
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:26,160
opportunity to the attacker

419
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:28,160
security researcher alex berson

420
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,679
shot a bright light on a scary

421
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,520
possibility

422
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:34,880
he took a hypothesis

423
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:37,760
about a supply chain substitution attack

424
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:39,840
where a software installer script is

425
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:42,720
tricked into pulling malicious code

426
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:45,280
files from a public repository

427
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:47,200
instead of getting the intended files

428
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:50,799
with the same name

429
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:52,880
from an internal repository

430
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:56,480
and then he targeted apple

431
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:59,840
microsoft tesla and about 32 other

432
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:01,919
companies to execute unauthorized code

433
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:03,440
inside their networks to prove that this

434
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:05,280
would work

435
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,559
it did

436
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,480
however

437
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:09,919
somebody's watching somebody's always

438
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,600
watching

439
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:14,480
and in this case that somebody thought

440
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:17,679
that it would be a good idea too and

441
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:19,679
without let's say that permission they

442
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:21,120
targeted some other companies in march

443
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:24,640
of this year

444
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:29,160
again microsoft but also amazon slack

445
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:29,160
lyft and zillow to name a few

446
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:35,520
this premise prompted a study by

447
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,360
researchers at the red hunt labs

448
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,400
what did they find

449
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:41,280
well

450
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:43,200
93 repositories out of the top 1000

451
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:45,600
github organizations

452
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:48,320
are using a package that doesn't exist

453
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:50,480
on a public package index

454
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:53,200
this can be claimed by an attacker to

455
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:56,559
cause a supply chain attack

456
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:59,280
and 169 repositories were found to be

457
00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:03,200
installing dependencies from a host that

458
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:03,200
isn't reachable over the internet

459
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:10,320
126 repositories were installing

460
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:11,440
packages owned by a github or get lab

461
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:14,080
user

462
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:16,559
that doesn't exist

463
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:18,799
now of the top thousand organizations

464
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:22,160
that were scanned

465
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:25,200
212 had at least one dependency

466
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:27,760
confusion related misconfiguration in

467
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,520
their code base

468
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:32,480
this is significant

469
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:34,799
because according to the researchers

470
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:37,280
much of the open source ecosystem

471
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:39,039
depends on these giants

472
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:42,640
we know that these repositories have a

473
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:44,480
lot of users so it stands to reason that

474
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,840
if any of their projects were to get

475
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,480
affected

476
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:53,160
there is significant likelihood

477
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:53,160
that millions of users could be at risk

478
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:57,679
xcode spy

479
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,919
so

480
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:01,919
we know that attackers are targeting

481
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:04,400
developers and they're targeting the

482
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:07,360
shared sites the repositories where code

483
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:10,240
is uploaded for use by others

484
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:13,280
in march this year a new malware variant

485
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:15,440
was observed targeting ios developers in

486
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:18,080
a supply chain attack to install a back

487
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:20,880
door on the developer's computer

488
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,919
so xcode spy is a malicious product

489
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,080
project

490
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:26,400
and it affects the free application

491
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:29,280
development environment

492
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:31,200
it's common behavior by developers to

493
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,480
share their projects online with other

494
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,400
users

495
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:37,760
it's just good sense

496
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:39,760
it's collaborative and it's efficient

497
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:41,360
well threat actors

498
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,559
behind this attack

499
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:45,440
abuse

500
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:47,760
this norm and they used a legitimate

501
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,880
development environment created by apple

502
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:51,679
newest

503
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:54,080
to fool victims into adding an online

504
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:56,320
project to their application that would

505
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:58,240
compromise their system in

506
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,679
a supply chain attack

507
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,080
codecov

508
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:04,400
is an online platform used for hosting

509
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:07,280
code testing reports and statistics

510
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:09,760
now it provides developers with tools to

511
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:12,640
help them quantify just how much source

512
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:15,840
code gets executed during testing

513
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:18,159
and they serve over 29 000 customers

514
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:22,080
globally many of these are enterprise

515
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:23,840
level clients like godaddy atlassian

516
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:26,159
royal bank of canada

517
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:29,200
procter gamble

518
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:31,440
but the impact went beyond this

519
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:34,080
to thousands of public development

520
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,280
projects i think kubernetes

521
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,840
pi test

522
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,840
ansible

523
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:41,840
victims included twilio

524
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:45,360
and rapid7

525
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:47,039
and the e-commerce platform makari

526
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:49,600
on april 1st

527
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:51,360
of this year kodkov reported a supply

528
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,960
chain attack that had occurred back in

529
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,960
late january

530
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,880
what happened was this

531
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:59,120
attackers leveraged an error in the

532
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:01,120
process that creates codecov's docker

533
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:03,120
image now this allowed for them to

534
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:05,600
extract credentials

535
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:08,080
which protect the modification of the

536
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:10,960
bash uploader script

537
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:13,600
this is a tool used by customers to send

538
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:15,440
code coverage reports to the platform

539
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:17,600
the script was modified

540
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:20,480
to deliver details from customer

541
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:23,200
environments to a server outside of

542
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:26,799
codecov attackers could export

543
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:29,120
credentials tokens or keys which pass

544
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:32,080
through codecov's continuous integration

545
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:34,000
environment which we've talked about

546
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:36,240
they could then use these

547
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:39,880
to access services data stores or

548
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,880
application code

549
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,720
in 2009

550
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:50,240
operation aurora served as a wake-up

551
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:54,000
call when the chinese state-sponsored

552
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:55,919
group ept 17 targeted google adobe and

553
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,320
some other tech firms for their source

554
00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:01,919
code management systems

555
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:03,200
in order to alter that source code

556
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:05,600
we're going to talk a bit more about

557
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,840
that later

558
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:09,919
in

559
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:12,320
2017 there was not petcha

560
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:14,400
the elite russian hacking team sandworm

561
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:16,080
who's part of the gru military

562
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,480
intelligence service

563
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:21,200
compromised and took over the software

564
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:24,480
updates of medoc which is accounting

565
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:26,640
software used throughout the ukraine

566
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:30,320
and they used this to distribute

567
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:32,480
destructive malware known as not pecha

568
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,760
this infected major companies like

569
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:37,120
maersk

570
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:40,559
as unintended consequences

571
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:44,159
and the costs amounted to approximately

572
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:44,159
10 billion globally

573
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:49,120
in january of 2019

574
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,720
there was a sophisticated supply chain

575
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:53,919
attack

576
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:56,159
that targeted the asus live update

577
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:58,720
utility and that's something that's

578
00:23:56,159 --> 00:24:00,960
pre-installed on pretty much

579
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,960
all asus computers

580
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:06,480
and an auto update feature and we'll

581
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,480
cover that a little bit later as well

582
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:14,799
this group also delivered something

583
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:16,480
known as shadowpad malware to infect

584
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:19,360
enterprise networks

585
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:22,000
using a product known as netserrang

586
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:23,679
nectaring specializes in

587
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:27,360
server management

588
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:29,200
and security connectivity software

589
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:31,440
if this sounds familiar

590
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:35,440
it should

591
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,440
i think that just happened to solarwinds

592
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:41,039
as promised let's take a look at the

593
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:44,640
chinese apt groups who've been involved

594
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:44,640
in software supply chain attacks

595
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:50,480
now all state-sponsored adversaries

596
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:52,240
chinese cyber espionage groups have been

597
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,520
and will continue to be the biggest

598
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,840
threat to tech

599
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:58,000
conducting economic espionage and

600
00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:00,000
intellectual property theft

601
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,360
technology companies are rich targets

602
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,600
just on their own

603
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:05,600
but these groups leverage them

604
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:08,080
to infect supply chains

605
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:09,840
to go after their customers

606
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:11,919
and they are the leaders of the pack in

607
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:14,919
terms of the number of attacks and their

608
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:14,919
capabilities

609
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,799
these are some

610
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:24,240
of the most well-known attacks of

611
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:26,559
chinese state-sponsored threat actors

612
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:28,799
so i'll go through them briefly

613
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:31,600
and highlight where attribution was able

614
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:33,919
to be made some key lessons about the

615
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:36,240
targeting intrusion

616
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:38,159
and just the issue of trust

617
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:40,400
something that really came across to me

618
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:42,880
while i was doing the research on this

619
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:44,640
was the overlap in terms of tactics and

620
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:48,000
tools

621
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:49,679
my personal observation would be that

622
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,880
these groups tend to work closely

623
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:53,440
together

624
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,559
and they probably were learning within

625
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,640
one group

626
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:58,880
then moving on to another and then they

627
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:01,120
took what they had developed and learned

628
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,480
to leverage it as needed because that's

629
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:04,880
efficient

630
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,240
and it's collaborative

631
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:09,360
and isn't that what we do when we're

632
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:10,799
talking about open source development

633
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:13,360
exactly

634
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:15,760
why reinvent the wheel when you already

635
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:17,200
have something perfectly useful

636
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:19,039
when somebody's already covered that

637
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:21,760
ground

638
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:24,400
these groups are united though

639
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:27,039
in how they're serving their state and

640
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,039
its mandate

641
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:35,840
now if you

642
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:38,559
wanted to try mapping chinese apts to

643
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:40,720
government and military

644
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:43,760
i found this work that was already in

645
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:46,400
progress it's by anastasius pingios and

646
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:49,679
i'll share the link on the next slide

647
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:53,080
it's very complex but this is a great

648
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:53,080
visual representation

649
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,240
i'll give you a moment to take a look at

650
00:26:57,039 --> 00:27:01,200
that so

651
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,200
you can capture it

652
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:10,159
and if you're at all familiar with the

653
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:11,279
crowdstrike they like to uh to group

654
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:13,360
their

655
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:16,880
adversaries in

656
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,880
fun and colorful ways

657
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:23,840
all right so let's start with 2009 in

658
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:25,440
operation aurora

659
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,720
like i said earlier it really was a

660
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:29,840
wake-up call

661
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:31,440
apt 17 had targeted google adobe and

662
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:33,840
other tech companies

663
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:35,360
to go after their source code by

664
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:38,080
tampering with their source quote

665
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:41,600
management systems

666
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:43,440
this led to google implementing zero

667
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:45,279
trust

668
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:48,080
to track lateral movement and to

669
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:50,559
implement better infrastructure

670
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:52,240
those were their lessons learned

671
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:53,760
and what's interesting about this is

672
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:57,039
that

673
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:58,799
in the fallout of solarwinds orion

674
00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:01,799
google wasn't one of the companies

675
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:01,799
mentioned

676
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:09,120
in 2017 an attack was discovered that

677
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:11,360
targeted an administrative software

678
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:14,480
package known as evlog

679
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:17,600
this was made by altair technologies who

680
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:19,919
are a canadian software company

681
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:21,200
this was a software supply chain

682
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:23,520
intrusion

683
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:25,919
which targeted enterprise organizations

684
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:28,720
globally including military

685
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:29,760
organizations and defense contractors

686
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:32,159
which

687
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:33,679
is something china cares deeply about

688
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:36,240
developing

689
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:40,000
and surpassing the west ad

690
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:43,279
there were also banks and universities

691
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,720
and there were several major telecom

692
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:46,640
providers

693
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:49,440
i get a little worried by targeted

694
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:51,520
attacks against telcos for a few reasons

695
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:54,640
and that's not just because akamai had a

696
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:56,640
hiccup and went down but

697
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:59,360
we all feel the pain

698
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:01,279
when we lose our online access for any

699
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,159
degree of time

700
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:03,520
it's

701
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:06,000
pretty much because we can't live

702
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,000
without it

703
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:12,960
now in this attack

704
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:14,399
there was a very impressive client list

705
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:17,120
and you should be thinking about

706
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:20,480
solarwinds because that too was a very

707
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:20,480
impressive quiet list

708
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:24,960
several years later

709
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:26,559
we still don't know how many of these

710
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,520
customers

711
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:28,960
were

712
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:31,679
and could still be

713
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,679
compromised

714
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,200
now

715
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:38,480
why evlogs

716
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:40,640
because the users were mostly system and

717
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:43,120
domain admins

718
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:45,440
and that offered excellent access to

719
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:48,080
targeted networks after the initial

720
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,080
compromise

721
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:55,559
reconnaissance is really important

722
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:01,760
i think so many people may have already

723
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:04,320
heard about this one

724
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:07,440
but ccleaner

725
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:09,360
this has been linked to abt 17

726
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:11,760
and more specifically to a subgroup

727
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:14,640
known as axiom who have historically

728
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:16,559
been engaged in supply chain attacks

729
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:19,360
the c clean air attack showcases

730
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:21,039
technical knowledge preparation

731
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,480
and patience

732
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:25,600
the timing was strategically

733
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:28,159
advantageous because the original owner

734
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:30,880
puriform was in the process of selling

735
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:33,279
to avast

736
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,559
that creates a lot of distraction and

737
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:37,600
confusion

738
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:39,360
so it's really easy to miss things like

739
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:41,520
things in the network that don't belong

740
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:43,520
there

741
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:46,080
the attackers took their time to move

742
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:50,159
laterally in the network

743
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:52,320
during off hours to avoid detection

744
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:55,520
a month they installed a modified

745
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:57,919
version of shadowpad backdoor malware

746
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:59,039
to escalate their privileges

747
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:01,200
then

748
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:03,440
they distributed a cryptographically

749
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:08,080
signed version

750
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:11,360
of the a modified ccleaner product

751
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:13,760
and no one suspected sign sealed

752
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,760
delivered

753
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:20,480
if we want to look at this a little more

754
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:22,080
technically

755
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:25,840
and just walk through

756
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:27,600
the actual uh steps of the attack

757
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:29,360
initial compromise came through

758
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:31,840
unattended

759
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:33,360
workstations from a cleaner developer

760
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:35,120
they were connected to the piriform

761
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:37,679
network

762
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:39,919
and the attackers utilized

763
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:42,000
teamviewer

764
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:44,399
they also reused credentials that they

765
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:48,720
found from previous data breaches in

766
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:50,720
order to access that teamviewer account

767
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:52,559
they delivered the malware using

768
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,679
vbscript

769
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:56,159
and

770
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:58,799
they developed a malicious version of

771
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:01,039
ccleaner

772
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:03,360
they used rdp

773
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:06,559
to open the back door on a second

774
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:08,320
unattended but connected computer

775
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:10,880
there's some good lessons in here if

776
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:12,559
you're taking notes

777
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:15,360
there they dropped the binary and a

778
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:18,480
malicious payload of second stage

779
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:21,519
malware and that was delivered to 40

780
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:24,159
ccleaner users

781
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:26,159
now they compiled a customized version

782
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:27,360
of the shadow pad back door

783
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:30,399
in order

784
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:32,559
to allow for further malicious downloads

785
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:35,600
and data theft

786
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:37,679
in preparation for a third stage

787
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:41,159
and then they installed their third

788
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:41,159
stage payload

789
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:45,600
now that malicious version

790
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:47,919
had

791
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:52,600
multi-stage malware in order to steal

792
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:52,600
the data and send it back to the cnc

793
00:32:56,399 --> 00:33:00,559
and

794
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:02,799
as far as action on objectives

795
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:06,399
very likely that stolen data has been

796
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:08,559
put to great use in further espionage

797
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:11,200
activities

798
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:14,480
if you wanted to try and go through this

799
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:16,480
against miters framework

800
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:18,320
there's a there's a lot

801
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,919
i think that would be applicable for

802
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:22,320
example

803
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:24,480
under recon you've got

804
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:28,000
a lot of work that they did

805
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:29,760
but supply chain compromise

806
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,159
resource development

807
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:33,360
they compromised accounts

808
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:35,039
i believe they compromised the

809
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:37,120
infrastructure they certainly developed

810
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:39,440
capabilities and they established

811
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:42,000
accounts

812
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:43,360
for their initial access

813
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,600
thanks to those

814
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:47,519
reused credentials

815
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:49,279
they found themselves a valid account to

816
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:51,440
get in with

817
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:53,519
for execution they leveraged some

818
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:55,840
software deployment tools

819
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:57,760
and for persistence well

820
00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:01,360
there was more account discovery and

821
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:04,799
account manipulation to keep them in

822
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:04,799
for privilege escalation

823
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:11,200
exploitation for privilege escalation

824
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:12,879
for credential access

825
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:15,040
they had credentials i believe from

826
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:17,200
password stores

827
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:18,879
discovery

828
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:21,839
can i say they discovered everything

829
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:21,839
that there was to discover

830
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:26,800
lateral movement

831
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:28,639
as we talked about they used shadow pad

832
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:31,839
and remote surfaces

833
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:33,599
and then exfiltration over a c2 channel

834
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:36,079
and the impact being some data

835
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:39,040
manipulation

836
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:39,040
and exfiltration

837
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:49,839
shadow

838
00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:54,079
hammer this is the asus

839
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:56,079
attack in january 2019 a sophisticated

840
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:59,599
supply chain attack was discovered

841
00:34:56,079 --> 00:35:01,280
targeting the asus live update utility

842
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:04,800
so this is something that's

843
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:06,560
pre-installed on most aces computers

844
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:09,440
and it's to make life easier for the end

845
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:11,119
user it automatically updates components

846
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:15,359
like the bios

847
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:19,119
uefi drivers and applications

848
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:20,400
according to gartner in 2017 asus was

849
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:22,880
the world's fifth

850
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:24,800
largest pc vendor which would make it an

851
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,960
extremely attractive target for apt

852
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:28,560
groups that might want to take advantage

853
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:32,000
of their user base

854
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:35,760
and in this case that apt was chinese

855
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:38,480
threat group apt-17 or barium

856
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:40,320
who were as we've seen behind the attack

857
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:43,040
on c-cleaner

858
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:46,320
the attackers altered an older version

859
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:48,480
of the azus live update utility software

860
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:50,800
and then they distributed

861
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:52,720
their modified version to the azus

862
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:54,720
computers around the world

863
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:57,280
the software looked legitimate

864
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:58,720
it was signed with legitimate asus tech

865
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:01,520
certificates

866
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:02,960
and it was stored on official servers

867
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:05,040
and it was even

868
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:06,000
the same file size

869
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:08,160
signed

870
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,920
sealed delivered

871
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:11,839
and once it was planted

872
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:14,640
that backdoor program gave attackers

873
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:17,119
control of the target computers through

874
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:20,680
remote servers that let them install

875
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:20,680
additional malware

876
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:34,320
in 2020

877
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,520
there was an attack known as able

878
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:39,280
desktop

879
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:42,320
by the apt group lucky mouse

880
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:44,960
it involved tool reuse by other actors

881
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:46,880
that were not only chinese groups

882
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:49,200
and i thought that this was interesting

883
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:50,640
because the shared use of tools and

884
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:53,520
collaboration

885
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:55,119
within chinese state-sponsored groups

886
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,480
affects their ability

887
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:59,599
to do

888
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:59,599
accurate attribution

889
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:05,599
they compromise the able desktop chat

890
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:06,839
software that's used by mongolian

891
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:09,359
government

892
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:11,280
agencies and then they hijacked updates

893
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:14,800
of the software supply chain

894
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:16,320
this is a really great small picture

895
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:18,160
of what could be a much larger more

896
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:19,440
devastating attack

897
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:22,000
and again

898
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:24,400
the attackers didn't need to steal or

899
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:28,880
forge an update signature

900
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:28,880
because abel's updates were not signed

901
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:36,720
another attack coming out of 2020 was

902
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:38,480
sign site

903
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:40,560
this is the vietnamese government

904
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:42,320
certificate authority and it was the

905
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:44,960
target of a software supply chain

906
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:47,680
intrusion which targeted a wide range of

907
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:50,079
public and private entities

908
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:51,359
the attackers used its digital signature

909
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:54,000
software

910
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:55,839
that provides certificates of validation

911
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:59,520
and software suites

912
00:37:55,839 --> 00:38:01,440
to handle digital document signatures

913
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:04,160
now this software

914
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:07,200
is widely used throughout vietnam and

915
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:09,280
it's mandated in some cases

916
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,240
and if you've seen if you think of not

917
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:14,000
pecha

918
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:16,720
and how that tax software was mandatory

919
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:19,440
and there are other cases this is what

920
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:21,520
attackers for looking through their lens

921
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:24,160
are leveraging against us this is truly

922
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:26,320
an abusive trust

923
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:28,720
so the key point

924
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:31,680
the abuse of trust here leveraging a

925
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:34,160
service oligopoly

926
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:36,160
we haven't got actual confirmation of

927
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:38,400
who was behind it but it's definitely

928
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:39,440
believed to be a chinese state-sponsored

929
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:42,720
group

930
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:45,839
possibly a group known as ta-428

931
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:48,480
who have a track record of targeting

932
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:50,960
east asian countries like mongolia

933
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:54,560
vietnam and have possibly even gone into

934
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:54,560
russia for intel gathering

935
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:02,720
and that brings us to golden spy

936
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:06,240
golden spy malware was embedded in

937
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:08,079
required tax payment software

938
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:11,680
issued to corporations who wanted to

939
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:14,160
conduct business operations in china

940
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:15,200
now chinese banks require businesses to

941
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:18,000
install

942
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:20,240
an intelligent tax

943
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,400
to pay the local taxes this this

944
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:25,440
intelligence tax software and it's

945
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:29,599
produced by the golden tax department of

946
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:32,079
the icino corporation so the malware

947
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:34,800
install the back door on systems which

948
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:36,560
enable a remote thread actor to execute

949
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:39,359
windows commands

950
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:41,599
or upload and execute any binary that

951
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:43,520
could be ransomware remote access

952
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:46,000
trojans anything

953
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:47,280
and the malware provided system level

954
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,320
privileges

955
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:52,480
so the capability to execute any command

956
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:54,079
or any software on that system where

957
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:57,599
it's installed

958
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:58,960
and it was connected to a cnc that was

959
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:00,800
distinct

960
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:03,920
and separate from the tax software

961
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,920
network infrastructure

962
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:10,040
you've probably heard of these guys

963
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:17,680
this year there was a very

964
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:21,280
very very large breach and it's just

965
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:25,760
coming to light the details around it

966
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:29,680
ceta is a global i.t provider for

967
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:31,359
90 of the world's airline industry

968
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:32,960
the pieces of this when you put them

969
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:34,319
together

970
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:36,480
link back

971
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:40,480
to show that chinese state-sponsored

972
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:42,960
threat after apt-41 was involved

973
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:46,480
and it's potentially impacted over four

974
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:46,480
and a half million passengers

975
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:50,160
ceta had announced the attack back in

976
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:52,160
march

977
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:54,160
and then soon after singapore and

978
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:56,000
malaysia airlines

979
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:59,280
disclosed that their customers personal

980
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,280
data had been exposed

981
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:03,440
after that

982
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:07,000
air india reported a major attack

983
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:07,000
against its systems

984
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:13,119
now

985
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:13,119
group ib took a closer look at this

986
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:18,079
they they didn't believe what they saw

987
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:20,480
at first and then they realized just

988
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:23,280
the level of sophistication involved

989
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:24,640
in what was an enormous level of attack

990
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:27,760
that could only be attributed to a

991
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:27,760
state-sponsored actor

992
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:32,880
and that's how with some digging they

993
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:36,720
were able to find artifacts through the

994
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:39,040
malware through overlap in terms of

995
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:42,599
the code that they were seeing to trace

996
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:42,599
it back to apt-41

997
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:50,960
apt-41 also known as wicked spider went

998
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:53,760
t with ties to barium

999
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:54,480
a group that's been active since 2007

1000
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,400
and

1001
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:58,880
has a track record in supply chain

1002
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,880
attacks

1003
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:03,599
and

1004
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:06,880
that's that's why it's so hard my

1005
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:06,880
attribution is so hard

1006
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:11,680
all right

1007
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:14,000
so let's talk about

1008
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:17,480
what we should and could learn

1009
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,480
from these attacks

1010
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:21,839
we do

1011
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:23,200
have a new executive order

1012
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:25,119
and that's a great step in the right

1013
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:27,200
direction

1014
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:30,200
but the picture is far bigger than we

1015
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:30,200
realize

1016
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:35,200
these are some recommendations

1017
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:36,640
we need to have prompt communication

1018
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:38,400
when something happens

1019
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:40,240
we need to be able to share information

1020
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:42,079
effectively

1021
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:44,400
and we have to take action

1022
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:46,560
because time is a luxury we don't have

1023
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:48,480
and something that our adversaries have

1024
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:49,839
plenty of

1025
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:51,440
code signing

1026
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:53,520
is essential

1027
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:55,920
even though as we've seen certificate

1028
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:58,160
abuse can be rampant

1029
00:42:55,920 --> 00:43:01,359
we need to find ways to ensure that tech

1030
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:01,359
is secured by default

1031
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:05,760
establish an international

1032
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:07,440
norm with clear penalties because you

1033
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:08,960
can't have something without the other

1034
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:12,599
if you're going to have policies you

1035
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:12,599
need to have enforcement

1036
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,319
eric sheehan of symantec who was also

1037
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:21,040
integral in helping investigate and

1038
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:22,720
decode stuxnet

1039
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:25,440
says that this is like finding a needle

1040
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:28,160
in a haystack to have the right security

1041
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:29,599
telemetry and visibility at the right

1042
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:32,800
control points

1043
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:32,800
in your organization

1044
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:37,400
and here's the shift

1045
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:46,640
and so

1046
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:49,119
i'd like to end with this

1047
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:51,040
i love podcasts and one of my go-to's is

1048
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:53,200
risky business

1049
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:54,880
they had an excellent segment about

1050
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:57,599
operation aurora

1051
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:59,920
with mark rogers from octa whom i've

1052
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:00,720
referenced a few times in here

1053
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:03,520
so

1054
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:05,680
if you can gain a position of trust

1055
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:08,720
you can exploit it

1056
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:12,160
think service or non-person ids

1057
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:14,800
accounts that nobody really scrutinizes

1058
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:16,240
with enough privilege to leverage to do

1059
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:18,800
e-discovery

1060
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:20,319
and to find all the stuff that you need

1061
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:22,880
for an attack

1062
00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:24,319
your chain is only as good as its

1063
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:26,400
weakest link

1064
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:27,920
and there are more ways to abuse the

1065
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:30,960
chain of trust

1066
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:30,960
than people realize

1067
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:36,079
thank you so very much

1068
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:37,599
i hope that you got some good stuff to

1069
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:39,760
work with out of this talk and i really

1070
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:40,560
appreciate your time my details are

1071
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:42,960
there

1072
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:46,119
you can find me on twitter

1073
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:46,119
thank you
