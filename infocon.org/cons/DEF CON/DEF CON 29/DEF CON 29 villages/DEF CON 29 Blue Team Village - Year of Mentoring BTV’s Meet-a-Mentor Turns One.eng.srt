1
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:05,359
hello and welcome to uh our one year

2
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:06,879
update on the meet a mentor program at

3
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:08,400
blue team village

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,480
i'm matechi um so i'm gonna be talking

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,320
about what's going on with been going on

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,519
with the program for the last year and

7
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:14,480
we're also going to have a couple

8
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,880
interviews with mentormentee pairs who

9
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,400
are willing to share their experiences

10
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,600
with us

11
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,480
so

12
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,439
you're probably wondering what this

13
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:22,960
program is if you weren't with us last

14
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:23,760
year

15
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,599
we started this program around defcon

16
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:26,960
last year

17
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:27,920
and

18
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,599
we wanted to help our mentees achieve

19
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:31,599
their goals by matching them with uh

20
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,399
with mentors and give mentors a chance

21
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:36,079
to um kind of broaden their own

22
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:37,360
perspectives

23
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,760
um and also develop some skills

24
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,239
so um the program works by a three to

25
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,039
six month long mentor minty matching

26
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:48,399
this is actually done via python script

27
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:51,360
based on uh options that people check

28
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,239
off in an intake form

29
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:55,920
so a little bit of human interaction

30
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,000
there we always try to review and and

31
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,440
think about

32
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,760
pairs that would make sense

33
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,799
but generally speaking we let people's

34
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,799
interests speak for themselves so we

35
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:09,280
have an ask active discord community we

36
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,400
have a public channel that you might

37
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,439
have seen if you're on the blue team

38
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:12,720
village discord

39
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,040
and we also have a number of private

40
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,320
text and voice channels as well um

41
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,439
just for

42
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,280
kind of a have this closed private

43
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,479
community

44
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:25,520
um so we have more monthly meetups with

45
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,040
panel discussions

46
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,720
rounds of lightning talks that both

47
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,200
mentors and mentees can participate in

48
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,280
as well as happy hours blue team village

49
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,360
content and much more under development

50
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,360
so one thing that comes up when we talk

51
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,600
about mentoring is what it is and what

52
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,799
it isn't

53
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,479
the most important thing for us to focus

54
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,200
on is the idea of a mentor being someone

55
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,399
that gives

56
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,759
guidance and advice shares experiences

57
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:54,079
but isn't necessarily someone who is

58
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,079
there for technical tutoring

59
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:58,399
and that's uh that's one thing that even

60
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,880
the panel discussions we drive uh try to

61
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,759
focus on is uh sharing you know how to

62
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:06,320
do something uh as in terms of how to

63
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,720
learn it and how to develop skills and

64
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,959
things like that rather than just how to

65
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:13,599
build actual technical skills

66
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,280
and it's also important to stress that

67
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,200
mentoring is a bi-directional

68
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,280
relationship so there's give and take

69
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,480
both parties have responsibilities um or

70
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,239
have responsibility for

71
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,879
you know timing for participating for

72
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,239
doing the work

73
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,319
and also both can learn from each other

74
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,160
it's not just the mentee always learning

75
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,519
from the mentor

76
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:34,879
so we gathered some really interesting

77
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:37,360
statistics um at the start of the

78
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,920
program um and that is i think that the

79
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,319
thing that stands out to me most is that

80
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,160
you know the things that people want to

81
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,080
learn are the things that others have

82
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,080
learned and are willing to to help

83
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,239
others learn so we have this like you

84
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,160
know confidence and technical skill

85
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,000
acquisition like you know those are

86
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,840
things that our mentors have learned and

87
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,319
are are trying to help others learn and

88
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,760
that's a great match this basically

89
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,200
means that when we run this you know

90
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,959
algorithm for matching that it's

91
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:04,239
actually going to match quite a number

92
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,159
of people which is pretty cool

93
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,319
um in terms of technical interests

94
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,239
uh it's yeah really really hard

95
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,080
sometimes to match these things and we

96
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,319
try not to depend on that too much for

97
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,519
the actual

98
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:17,920
um you know strength of a match but it's

99
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,959
always nice to have some common

100
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,599
interests and luckily those top two uh

101
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,159
dfir kind of skills and uh

102
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:26,959
and um you know sim and logging stuff um

103
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:27,920
as well as a threat hunting and

104
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,920
intelligence are two kind of common

105
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,640
things that pop up a lot and then for

106
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,400
career level it's also an interesting

107
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,840
spread as well

108
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,920
probably a little unsurprising to people

109
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,200
that most of the people looking for

110
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,599
mentors mentors are actually early in

111
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,040
their career

112
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,040
or are still in university and most of

113
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,360
the mentors are mid-late career

114
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,200
and primarily in infosec roles

115
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,400
so i'm going to share just a couple

116
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,000
lessons learned before we moved on to

117
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,080
the interviews

118
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:56,720
and

119
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,799
first one of this is

120
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:00,560
anyone can be a mentor

121
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,680
um and a mentee so like i said you know

122
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,360
this is this is not a one directional

123
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,640
relationship

124
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,959
um in a lot of times people just want to

125
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,519
have another perspective and you know

126
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:12,720
when they ask

127
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,560
you know another when they ask a mentor

128
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,478
for a perspective that mentor can also

129
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:18,320
learn from that as well and rethink

130
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,478
something that they thought they you

131
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:22,880
know understood well before but getting

132
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,160
that fresh perspective is really

133
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,000
beneficial for both parties

134
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,040
um you know and and even mentors that

135
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,280
have been in their career for 10 years

136
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,120
can learn something from someone else

137
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,960
who's just entering the job market and

138
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,880
that might have changed in you know in

139
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,199
the time since the mentor was

140
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,440
entering the job market at that level so

141
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,440
really interesting bunch of experiences

142
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,960
there that our participants have shared

143
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,479
and then the last

144
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,320
part of the last thing on this slide is

145
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,479
uh sometimes people just

146
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,160
need someone to kind of be their

147
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,600
champion

148
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,840
and to boost their confidence give them

149
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,680
a little a little revving up and a

150
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,240
little um positive reinforcement

151
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,520
so that's something we like to see

152
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,440
and the next one wow this this is a

153
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,440
really important one for me personally

154
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,400
it takes a village to run this program

155
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,199
um

156
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,639
and it's

157
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,000
it's something that takes a lot of work

158
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,759
if you want to do it right

159
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,199
um so

160
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,360
important lesson for everyone in life

161
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,440
myself all the mentors all the mentees

162
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,440
is to learn to ask for help

163
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,840
um and you know there are always people

164
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,520
that'll be there to support you if you

165
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,600
just ask for it

166
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,479
um and also you know we've we've

167
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,880
benefited from a number of people who

168
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,039
stepped in to develop the program

169
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:40,479
and also the people that continually

170
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,160
participate in it

171
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,240
and that there's so many different ways

172
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,120
to to participate uh some people are

173
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,360
really great at thinking up ideas and

174
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,320
and thinking broader perspective longer

175
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,240
term bigger picture and then there are

176
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,319
other people that are just absolute gold

177
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,000
to rely on to just get the work done

178
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,280
like you give them a task and it's going

179
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,360
to get done and i think one thing i

180
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,800
really learned to this program is that

181
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,800
you need both types of people to really

182
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,360
make a program like this work

183
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,240
um

184
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,759
then the last one out of this is you

185
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:12,080
know the community supports itself i

186
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,520
i've watched this community over the

187
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,199
last year and i think one of the things

188
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:16,880
that really stood out to me is that you

189
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,720
know someone asks a question

190
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,240
and then someone answers it and everyone

191
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,400
else kind of like takes that and and

192
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,400
really digs into it so we have some

193
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,880
really fantastic interactions including

194
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,120
like um you know a mentee talking about

195
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,680
a job offer and then other people

196
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,600
sharing their perspective on it

197
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,000
for example you know there was

198
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
someone was sharing some contractual

199
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,240
issues with it with a um

200
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,319
with a job offer that they were a little

201
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,880
hesitant about and then they got that

202
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,560
support from the community to say yeah

203
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,120
this doesn't look like the good idea

204
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,280
and that you know that was a valuable

205
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,720
perspective to have

206
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,800
and that kind of um that kind of

207
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,319
interaction

208
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,960
pays forward to uh further interactions

209
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,240
where people feel comfortable to share

210
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,440
their own

211
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,479
questions

212
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:05,680
so really amazing to see that

213
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,160
and in the end the work is totally worth

214
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,319
it there are times when it's been a

215
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,160
really exhausting

216
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,240
kind of experience to

217
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,639
to run meetups every month and to

218
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,960
to try to put together um aspects of the

219
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:19,919
program

220
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,080
but you know and and also to to run

221
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,800
through mentormentee matches when you

222
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,800
know there's just so many more mentees

223
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,120
you know available mentors um but

224
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,520
looking back on it you know everyone

225
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,520
that i've i've talked to has had some

226
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,599
kind of uh benefit from this

227
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:37,680
relationship and that you know that's

228
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,919
gold right there it's not even just

229
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:41,840
mentor mentee pairs but also just the

230
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,759
support the community

231
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:44,400
is

232
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,759
really beneficial for people that may

233
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,840
not have another community locally that

234
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,240
they can fall back on um you know and

235
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,240
the connections that you make will keep

236
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,520
on giving back

237
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,160
um you know it's not just job offers and

238
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,080
networking but also just just

239
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,080
friendships and it's always really cool

240
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:00,960
to see

241
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,319
um the last bit that i have to remind

242
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,240
myself of is that there is always more

243
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,319
work to do but it's important to also

244
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,400
sit back and kind of reflect on on

245
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,319
everything that we've done so far

246
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:11,759
that's really hard to do when i know how

247
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,680
much i want to do um but just looking at

248
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,680
what we've accomplished in a year is is

249
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,319
really something special and valuable

250
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:23,039
so with that i'm actually going to hand

251
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,720
over to the interview side of this and

252
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,840
we're going to have some mentors and

253
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,840
mentees share their experiences with us

254
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,120
so we are here with selenia and nico uh

255
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,320
who are uh one of the most active pairs

256
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,719
i've encountered here in this program

257
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,559
so welcome i'm gonna throw a couple

258
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,479
questions out because i think uh you

259
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:43,519
know i

260
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,600
i'm always a little uh

261
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,519
interested in kind of how how these uh

262
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:48,880
matches have worked out because it's

263
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,640
kind of made by an algorithm but i like

264
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,920
to hear about the human relationships a

265
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,360
bit so

266
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,720
i'm going to start

267
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,880
directing a question at nico and this

268
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,120
one is how has the mentor program helped

269
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,120
you in your own career and professional

270
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,040
or personal growth

271
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:03,920
um

272
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,120
i think it

273
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,040
has helped me reinforce all the things

274
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,120
i've learned in security

275
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,279
and it's given me an opportunity to

276
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:14,160
share those back with the community and

277
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,160
allowed me to

278
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,959
continue to grow my knowledge

279
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:23,440
and gain something out of it so um

280
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,120
there were plenty of folks to help me

281
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,000
and i'm glad to help somebody else out

282
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,080
and awesome and you were on a panel too

283
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:30,880
right

284
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,399
yes

285
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,480
is that a fun experience

286
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,720
uh it was my first experience and i did

287
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,839
enjoy it

288
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:40,399
nice very cool very cool

289
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:43,680
um and then for selenia um what was one

290
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,839
goal or growth area you had that your

291
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:47,440
mentor helped you with the most and how

292
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,640
did they help

293
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,680
yeah sure uh nico's really big on goal

294
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,000
setting and at the time i was not and in

295
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,080
fact once we started talking kind of

296
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:56,880
with

297
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,800
initial conversations after we'd been

298
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,440
paired up i realized oh wow

299
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,120
this is really

300
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,240
not only like mentally stressful

301
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,760
but also

302
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,399
professionally disadvantages to me

303
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:11,600
because

304
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,440
let's say everyone else has a good goal

305
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,120
in mind for either

306
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,720
it can be whatever you'd like but let's

307
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,880
say for a job that you'd like to have in

308
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,440
the future say as a pen and tester

309
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,440
since i don't have that it's so much

310
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,760
more difficult for me to not only answer

311
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,600
interview questions like where do you

312
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,959
want to be in three to five years which

313
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:32,560
i can't answer because i don't know and

314
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,440
to like strategize and

315
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,360
help me help myself and have others help

316
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,279
me

317
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:40,560
so it's been a wonderful experience

318
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,640
working with niko to

319
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,800
kind of set some of those goals and

320
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:49,279
become more grounded and goal-oriented

321
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:53,839
goal-oriented approach to career growth

322
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:55,680
nice yeah it's kind of interesting

323
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,959
because i've seen like a lot of

324
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:59,040
different pairs either have a very

325
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,120
cavalier just conversational approach to

326
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,680
things and some are a little bit more

327
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,279
formal like kind of following a plan and

328
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,040
helping set goals so it's always

329
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,800
interesting to hear who does it which

330
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,720
way

331
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,160
and the next one i have actually this is

332
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,160
for both of you um was there anything

333
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,600
you got out of the program that you

334
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,040
didn't expect i'll start with nico

335
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,079
um i think just uh

336
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:23,839
given everything that's happened over

337
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:25,600
the last

338
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,120
year i should say with covet and

339
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,200
everything else uh it was nice to have

340
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,560
another person to connect to that had

341
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,200
those interests and passions and uh that

342
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,320
want to continue to grow

343
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,120
that was definitely you know something

344
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,040
lacking for me because a lot of the

345
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,959
folks that i tend to work with or i'm

346
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,560
around are you know they've been around

347
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,880
for a while and so it's you don't

348
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,279
necessarily want to you know

349
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,120
poke and prod but you want to you know

350
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,639
get more information and learn more and

351
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,399
stuff like that so

352
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:55,519
um

353
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,120
and it's just also

354
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,760
again continued to help push me to grow

355
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,040
um

356
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,120
things that i didn't know uh especially

357
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,480
if there was a question it's like you

358
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,399
know what i don't know that but let me

359
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,720
figure that out so

360
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,880
it's one of those things

361
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,360
nice selenia

362
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,000
um speaking experience a couple of times

363
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,600
actually um

364
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,839
i'd always i've always been a lurker

365
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,240
like if you look at my reddit account

366
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,399
it's like zero comments but has existed

367
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,320
for a decade

368
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,079
so i'd always kind of

369
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,800
that's my default right is to choose to

370
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,399
stay involved at the periphery of things

371
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,320
um until recently

372
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,079
where

373
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:39,920
i realized again i'm kind of doing a

374
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,240
disservice not only to myself but to my

375
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,800
peers and colleagues and to those who

376
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,480
will come after us

377
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,920
by

378
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,440
not being more involved and so i decided

379
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,920
as a goal to myself a little less formal

380
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:54,959
to

381
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:56,800
take some baby steps outside of my

382
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,720
comfort zone and to start putting myself

383
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,639
out there a little bit more

384
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,720
and there were a couple of volunteering

385
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,480
opportunities that actually came up some

386
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,240
with blue team village and one with the

387
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,920
diana initiative

388
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,240
that i

389
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,800
kind of jumped on despite my previous

390
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,360
context and those ended up quickly

391
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,000
evolving from hey we could use some help

392
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,399
organizing this meeting to hey there's

393
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,240
an opportunity to

394
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,519
be a kind of a panel speaker

395
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:28,240
or a brief presenter a monthly meetup

396
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,399
would you like to yes

397
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,160
and

398
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,320
i'm modestly confident in my public

399
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,120
speaking skills but

400
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,240
i'm

401
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,079
quite bad at

402
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:42,320
taking that first step and getting over

403
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,120
like

404
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,279
the fear hump

405
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:46,560
or

406
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,480
breaking out of my shell however you'd

407
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,720
like to say it so i'm really glad that

408
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,240
the mentorship

409
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,959
program has kind of kick-started me into

410
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,199
being a bit more engaged uh

411
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:59,279
engageful with the community a bit more

412
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:00,320
engaged

413
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,199
with uh my peers

414
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:05,680
yeah that's awesome i i mean i i

415
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,440
obviously as someone who's been involved

416
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,040
with bluetooth for years i'm a huge

417
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,800
proponent of volunteer opportunities

418
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,639
like they just do so much just like

419
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:14,560
mentoring does

420
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,959
so the last question i have uh this is

421
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:18,160
again for both of you and i'll start

422
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,040
with nico and that's one major takeaway

423
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,279
or what is one major takeaway from this

424
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,959
mentoring experience that you'd like to

425
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,880
share with others

426
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,160
uh

427
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,240
the biggest thing i would have to say is

428
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,440
uh that you don't have to go it alone um

429
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,959
there are tons of folks out that are

430
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,279
out there that are willing to

431
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:40,079
uh

432
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:40,959
help

433
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:44,720
or they're seeking help so um i know a

434
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,639
few years back i was seeking help i was

435
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:47,680
trying to

436
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,920
figure out how to break into

437
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,480
um analysts work and things like that

438
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,440
and

439
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,880
i wasn't getting a whole lot of answers

440
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,720
so

441
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,959
definitely this program has

442
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:00,639
helped with

443
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:02,160
me being able to

444
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,240
give that back to somebody else um and

445
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,160
hopefully be there to help answer some

446
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,720
questions or help throw some guidance

447
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,399
somewhere

448
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,560
awesome selenia

449
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,199
uh that was my point as well actually

450
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,399
was that

451
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:17,760
i've been

452
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,720
so

453
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,000
pleasantly surprised about how warm and

454
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,480
supportive and advocative people in the

455
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,079
security space are um

456
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:29,920
you know wow i think that

457
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,720
for a mentee mentor relationship

458
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,320
the mentee should really take some

459
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,680
proactive steps to kind of

460
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,040
be

461
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,600
the lead in that relationship it's a

462
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,839
little bit of you get out of it what you

463
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,360
put into it

464
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,279
um

465
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,440
that being said i completely agree with

466
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,920
nico and that not only are you more than

467
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,040
welcome here we have a really hard

468
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,720
tough road ahead of us and could really

469
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,160
use your help

470
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,120
so

471
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,440
as people start looking for next steps

472
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,920
or trying to break into the space

473
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,399
or into different roles or

474
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,560
evolve their careers in different way i

475
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,399
think that we can all

476
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:12,720
you know take baby steps like i've done

477
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,120
and like nico sounds like have

478
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,079
done during this relationship to

479
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:19,519
break out of our comfort zones a little

480
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:22,560
bit and tap that collective network

481
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,320
and engaging with the broader community

482
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,240
like we've spoken about

483
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,199
so

484
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:28,240
i

485
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,920
not only do i think that you'll be a

486
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,880
little bit surprised about what you find

487
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,720
but i think you'll also be surprised

488
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,800
about what you can offer and contribute

489
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,560
back

490
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,240
yeah that's definitely a point i i

491
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,680
always try to make

492
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,360
well thank you very much for your time

493
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,120
really appreciate it um

494
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,279
and i'm just really happy that uh that

495
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:49,519
this has worked out and it's been a

496
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:50,880
positive experience for everyone

497
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,199
involved so thank you very much

498
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:55,599

499
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:01,680
so now i am joined by scooby and danny

500
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,560
dev

501
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,359

scooby's one of our core mentors has

503
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:08,400
been with the program since we first

504
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,240
started thinking of it and i i think

505
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,000
i've seen danny dave's name pop up quite

506
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,079

507
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,559
really awesome to have uh frequent flyer

508
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:19,439
people here i'm going to start with a

509
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,000
question for scooby and this one is uh

510
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,919
how has the mentor program helped you in

511
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:25,760
your own career and professional or

512
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,000
personal growth

513
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,240
um i think it's mainly personal more

514
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,400
than career and

515
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,919
at that point because i was already

516
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:36,559
doing some mentoring also um

517
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:37,760
at my

518
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,480
job during my professional life

519
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,559
uh on the other end meeting those people

520
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:44,080
with very different backgrounds i

521
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,080
currently have three different mentees

522
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,559
and danny is the latest addition to the

523
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:49,760
to the crew

524
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,559
um but but have people from pretty much

525
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:53,840
around the world

526
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,960
um

527
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,720
like danny is uh is in the md i have

528
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,360
people in europe and and one in the

529
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,000
united states so it really opens up sort

530
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,960
of very different type of work uh

531
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,120
compared to what i used to do before

532
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,360
where i was mainly working with with

533
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,400
people

534
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,600
just in my local community right so now

535
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,200
i can start to understand how uh works

536
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,480
work uh outside of canada

537
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,440
um

538
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,600
so and i have i have some

539
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,600
some now where i work i have some some

540
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,320
people that are also spanish background

541
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,000
so working with danny also kind of

542
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,160
helped me understand better

543
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,160
uh how these people i don't want to say

544
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,640
these people think everybody but but i

545
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,080
you can you understand what i mean that

546
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,480
there's still a little um

547
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,679
there's a

548
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:44,960
i don't know the right word in english

549
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,520
but there's some some behaviors that

550
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,120
that some people in some different

551
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,799
country have and sometimes it's it's

552
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:53,760
more it's easier for me to ask danny for

553
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,400
for his opinion than someone i work with

554
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,360
on a daily basis uh not to hurt their

555
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,880
feelings and stuff like that so that's

556
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,200
definitely something um

557
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,840
that is present and then that helped me

558
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,919
maybe that's that's a pretty i said

559
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:10,000
nothing uh professionally but i just

560
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,280
said something

561
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,080
so

562
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,080
no i i think that's a really great point

563
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,840
and i think one of the things that that

564
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,039
i've really gotten out of this program

565
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:18,400
too is just

566
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,240
when i look and see how many different

567
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,600
people we have participating from so

568
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,080
many different countries cultures

569
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,000
and backgrounds it's

570
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,919
it's really amazing and i mean you know

571
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:29,280
we've been stuck in a pandemic where we

572
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,960
can't travel so much so it's kind of a

573
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,960
nice opportunity to have some some

574
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,880
cross-country cross-cultural connections

575
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,760
without needing to fly

576
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,559
is

577
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:41,520
yes and i i was a a very avid traveler

578
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,000
before that so being stuck here for that

579
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,520
long is uh

580
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,840
is really hard yeah well hopefully maybe

581
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,919
next year um so the next question is

582
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:52,400
going to be for for danny and this one

583
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,360
is what was one goal or growth area that

584
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,440
your mentor helped you with the most and

585
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,520
in what way

586
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,320
so

587
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,799
one of the goals or

588
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:04,960
the way scoby helped me

589
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,000
was in

590
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,080
management side

591
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,360
once i entered to this mentoring program

592
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,840
i was just an analyst

593
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,799
and

594
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,960
if our first

595
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:21,360
session i was promoted to a manager so

596
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,200
one of the key parts

597
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,640
in this

598
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,960
in this conversation and this session

599
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,360
with with the scooby was management this

600
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,120
was fairly new for me

601
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,480
managed

602
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,679
one team manage people you know

603
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:38,720
because i i always was [ __ ] focusing

604
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,320
myself on resolving problems resolving

605
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,600
with handling with computer not with

606
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,799
humans you know so skewie

607
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:51,520
helped me in that part looking the

608
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,000
looking from from another perspective

609
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,200
looking at things from another

610
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,840
perspective on how to manage the team

611
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,320
and resolve that

612
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,120
a particular problem so yeah

613
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,880
oh that's awesome congratulations on the

614
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,320
promotion too

615
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,280
thank you

616
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,200
um so my next question actually since

617
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,200
it's got the last one too um you know

618
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,440
we're a little short on time

619
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,559
i'm going to direct this one back to

620
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,480
scooby to start and i'll come back to

621
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,039
danny as well and this one is what was

622
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:20,799
one major takeaway from this mentoring

623
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:22,159
experience you'd like to share with

624
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:23,760
others

625
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,799
um you know as danny asks some questions

626
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:29,120
and we're have very similar roles right

627
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,679
now it really makes me

628
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:33,600
see the parallels of what i'm doing so

629
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,840
by him asking questions that i might not

630
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,880
have asked myself i it forced me to

631
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,520
reflect on some things and sometimes

632
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,720
find solutions or find the things that

633
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,039
that i need to improve where i work

634
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,960
where i didn't even know

635
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,120
they needed to be improved right because

636
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,679
he sees it in his own ways and he has

637
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:56,799
his own challenge and

638
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:59,120
sometimes they relate almost one for one

639
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,280
and i just didn't realize with all the

640
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,880
other things that that

641
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,360
that we have to do that what he cares

642
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,640
about is actually something that i

643
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,039
should start being like caring about as

644
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:10,320
well and

645
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,480
employment where i work

646
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,640
so it's really a two-way relationship i

647
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,840
think

648
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,640
no that's great and danny

649
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,520
oh

650
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,799
uh

651
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,320
as i said before

652
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,280
looking

653
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,360
the problem from another perspective now

654
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,200
that i'm working with the stakeholders

655
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,520
and from more from management

656
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,760
point of view i need to

657
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,679
to one of the things that i learned i

658
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:35,120
need to

659
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,799
see the problems from another

660
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:37,919
perspective

661
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:38,720
see

662
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,200
what's uh not the stakeholders where

663
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,000
they are what what what what are their

664
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,240
needs not only focusing in the technical

665
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,120
part but what the stakeholder needs so

666
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,559
those are one

667
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:51,440
that's

668
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,960
at least for the

669
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,520
past sessions that's my major take away

670
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,240
from this and it's helping me a lot and

671
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,880
as well the team to grow in

672
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,240
in the company that that i am now

673
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,679
nah that's awesome

674
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:07,760
it's really i i mean i i think from the

675
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,520
start it really stuck out to me that for

676
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,440
a lot of people this is a it's a two-way

677
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,440
relationship you know a mentor doesn't

678
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,320
just

679
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,080
just mentor for the sake of helping the

680
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,919
mentee but also to develop themselves

681
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:19,600
and that's that's become very clear

682
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,360
through all the the interviews i've had

683
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,760
in just the past year of interaction

684
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,720
with people

685
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,720
so thank you very much for your time uh

686
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,240
it's really appreciated and i'm glad

687
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,280
that you've gotten to share your

688
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,960
experience with everyone else thank you

689
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,159
thank you

690
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:33,520
see you then

691
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,840
thank you everyone

692
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,679
all right so now we are here joined by

693
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:47,360
ali and uh and her mentee serial killer

694
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,679
um so i'm gonna actually kick off with a

695
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:51,360
question for ali

696
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,880
and i i'm really excited to hear the

697
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,640
answer for this one and that is what

698
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,760
motivated you to become a mentor

699
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:58,720
well

700
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,600
i actually was asked by one of the folks

701
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,480
to join as a court mentor and i was so

702
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,279
excited and so honored to be asked

703
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,039
especially seeing as i don't have a

704
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:11,039
traditional you know technical

705
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:13,360
background i have more of a business

706
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,520
type of experience to lend to the

707
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,679
program so i was really surprised and i

708
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:19,760
was so honored um

709
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,880
and i absolutely like said yes without

710
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,039
even hesitating or thinking about my

711
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:27,360
other obligations i said yes it sounds

712
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,840
so awesome and i knew that i was going

713
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,520
to give it my all

714
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,600
for whatever that required of me just

715
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,640
because i really believe in the mentor

716
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,679
mentee type of structure and really how

717
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:42,480
much that is needed especially in this

718
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,799
industry

719
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:47,840
all right so for seal killer

720
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,360
what were your goals and hopes for the

721
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,960
mentoring experience when you signed up

722
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,799
for it

723
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:56,480
i think my goals overall was just to

724
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:59,360
have a better connection to the infosec

725
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,120
community

726
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,440
like i'm not really that much involved

727
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,039
or i haven't been in the past and it's

728
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:06,720
something that i wanted to do to

729
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,960
progress in my career and to help out

730
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,400
inside the infosec community

731
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,279
nice um so

732
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:17,760
on that note um serial killer i'm going

733
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,080
to ask you what was one goal that your

734
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,000
mentor helped you with the most uh

735
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:22,880
during

736
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,880
during this process and how did they

737
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,279
help you

738
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,720
i think my one goal was to be more

739
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,760
outwardly focused and to

740
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,679
become a better communicator

741
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:39,760
so that i could provide some sort of

742
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,559
input into the infosec community and ali

743
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:44,320
has definitely helped me

744
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,200
lift up my confidence because i

745
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,799
suffered a lot from

746
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:51,760
imposter syndrome

747
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,919
yeah that's definitely something that

748
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:56,080
comes up quite a lot and i think we even

749
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,000
had it we've had probably like five or

750
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,840
six panel discussions where it that has

751
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,960
come up at this point so definitely a

752
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,240
common theme and i'm sure a lot of

753
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,760
people watching are going to be able to

754
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,279
relate to that one

755
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:09,520
so ali um did you have a structure for

756
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,840
mentoring or um when you feel like more

757
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,520
go with the flow like how did you

758
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,080
approach this

759
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,720
um i guess in the very beginning gosh

760
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,400
it's been several months now so thinking

761
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,159
back to the very beginning

762
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:25,440
i really wanted to really just maximize

763
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,679
the time and the process

764
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:29,440
with my mentee

765
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,240
and at first i was like okay i need some

766
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,440
type of like structure so that we can

767
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,679
sort of get down

768
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:40,880
who we are how are we communicating um

769
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,960
through what channels throughout mediums

770
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,000
the frequency of our communications and

771
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,559
then also sort of like the goals and and

772
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:50,640
the real next steps because

773
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,360
i just wanted to really do the best that

774
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,640
i could do to actually help someone

775
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,640
not just kind of you know

776
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,159
i don't know sort of glaze over things

777
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:02,320
but really really help them and after

778
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,080
talking with my mentee it was pretty

779
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,000
clear that i could definitely be their

780
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,600
cheerleader

781
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,159
and help them with um

782
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:12,080
their goals and so

783
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,240
i guess in the beginning it was a little

784
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,960
bit more structured um

785
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,720
hopefully not to any

786
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,240
detriment

787
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,080
but i think that was good for the

788
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,760
beginning to really sort of kick things

789
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,919
off because we were strangers you know

790
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:27,520
we literally never knew each other

791
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,480
before

792
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,559
um although it sounds like we were

793
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:32,399
actually in

794
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:35,679
at least one of the same rooms at defcon

795
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:37,679
in 2019 which is funny we didn't even

796
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:39,520
know it so anyway so it was definitely

797
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,279
more structured in the beginning i made

798
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:44,159
this worksheet that kind of laid out um

799
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:47,520
the goals and the next steps and sort of

800
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,840
like that to do who's doing what because

801
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,919
not everything was on my mentee you know

802
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:54,320
i did a lot of stuff too to help them in

803
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,880
terms of like research reminders etc so

804
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,640
it was nice to have everything laid out

805
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,399
and like when is the next time we're

806
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:01,360
meeting

807
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,080
you know what channel is that and

808
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,360
i think that was good and then

809
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,520
eventually we got into a very natural

810
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,240
flow where you know we meet every sunday

811
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,320
at four o'clock eastern like that's just

812
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,360
our thing

813
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,159
and that was really cool because just

814
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:18,880
like a nice set set meeting that we both

815
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,240
have to know

816
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,720
okay we have this time to check in so

817
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:26,080
it is still somewhat structured but

818
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,000
it's honestly kind of i would say more

819
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,399
go with the flow i don't know

820
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:32,080
that's awesome

821
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,600
it's funny because we actually still use

822
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,279
that template and you're kind enough to

823
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:36,880
provide the kind of a blank version of

824
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,320
it and it's really helped a lot of

825
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:41,279
people um solidify goals which is

826
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:42,880
something we try to emphasize for people

827
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,520
like mentoring should have some amount

828
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:49,200
of of like you know it's a goal-oriented

829
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,240
type of relationship um that eventually

830
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,399
settles out into friendship which is

831
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,799
definitely an upside program connecting

832
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:58,000
people that wouldn't have connected

833
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,760
otherwise or maybe they would i don't

834
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,600
know

835
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,799
definitely

836
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:05,039
um cool well thank you for that uh and

837
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:06,000
then the last question i have i'm going

838
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,200
to direct both of you and i'll start

839
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,679
with serial killer and that is uh what

840
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:12,159
is one major takeaway

841
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:14,320
from this experience that

842
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,760
that you would like to share with others

843
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:18,158
watching

844
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:19,679
the

845
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:23,039
biggest thing for me at least was

846
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:26,039
to

847
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,720
if you're looking to get help it's okay

848
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,240
to ask for help

849
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,520
like

850
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,600
that was my like

851
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,360
i was very nervous when i first signed

852
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,760
up for the mentor program

853
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,080
because i'm not one to ask for help

854
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,799
almost ever and that was

855
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:44,799
uh stopping me from doing a lot of

856
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:47,520
things that i wanted to do

857
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,120
i am sure that that resonates with a lot

858
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,159
of people

859
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:51,679
myself included

860
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:53,360
yeah

861
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,799
and then i'll direct the same question

862
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:58,000
to ali to close it out

863
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,880
gosh it's funny because

864
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,520
for as much as i felt

865
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,559
i was sort of giving to my mentees

866
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:08,640
knowledge and things to think about and

867
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,159
things to work on etc you know they also

868
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:13,919
really taught me a lot of things too in

869
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:15,840
the process seriously

870
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,360
and

871
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,960
not that i was shocked by that by any

872
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,320
means but i guess

873
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,640
there were even things that we would

874
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,919
talk through

875
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:26,480
that would make me think about you know

876
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,559
how does this apply maybe in my life

877
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:29,360
right

878
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,679
and so i guess the biggest thing

879
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:34,559
that i learned through this experience

880
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:40,240
is honestly just all of the things that

881
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,720
that go into this relationship and this

882
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,799
process and these goals

883
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:47,679
um is something that like i actually

884
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,399
want to reflect on myself as well and

885
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:52,720
that was i guess a little bit surprising

886
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,760
um

887
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,440
just that i had

888
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,760
actually some stuff to think about once

889
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,240
it was prompted so in a way

890
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,360
my mentee also kind of mentored me

891
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,120
and i love that

892
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,519
that's a really great way to put it i i

893
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:10,240
definitely share in that experience too

894
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,760
