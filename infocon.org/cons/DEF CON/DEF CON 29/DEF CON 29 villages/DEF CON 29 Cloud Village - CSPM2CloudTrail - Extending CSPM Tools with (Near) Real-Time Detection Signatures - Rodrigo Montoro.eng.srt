1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:02,720
uh def conclude village for having me

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:04,799
here uh we are going to talk about cs

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:07,680
pam to cloud trail uh my name is is

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,840
rodrigo montoro

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,639
my handle is poker and my twitter is

6
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:15,120
poker labs i live in south of brazil

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,600
florianopolis and i work at tempest

8
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,080
security as research and detection

9
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,560
engineer

10
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,359
the motivation behind this research

11
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:26,880
is something that

12
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:27,840
we

13
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,480
that we need to improve our

14
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,840
cloud detection in ours in our secret

15
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,200
operation center

16
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,360
and since you have a lot of different

17
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,680
customers we start figure out like how

18
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,239
you could do something that will fit in

19
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,320
mostly out the customer without needing

20
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,760
a lot of context

21
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,920
and and so when you start to think and

22
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,600
brainstorm about that

23
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,520
uh we we get

24
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,480
what uh we get splitted in two different

25
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,199
parts like so you have the

26
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:59,440
threat detection that's something more

27
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,600
complex i could not

28
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,199
and something

29
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:06,000
related about misconfiguration

30
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,840
and that's something more more straight

31
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,479
to the point

32
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,560
and our agenda like we were just do a

33
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,320
before review about the

34
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,799
cloud attack uh cloud attacks uh

35
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:21,520
cloudtrail and cspm a very

36
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,759
short overview and talked about the

37
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,320
research and some future work we are

38
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,439
figure out

39
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,040
to do

40
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,360
and so cloud attacks like

41
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,200
i think like when you are on premise

42
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,560
we have like a kind of perimeter and

43
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,040
this parameter is something that make

44
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,840
things inside the perimeter safe

45
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,840
like you could do a lot of

46
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,079
bad configuration not follow hardening

47
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:48,960
stuff

48
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,759
but inside your perimeter that's a let's

49
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,520
let's call like you have a fire and you

50
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,960
have the internal and external parts

51
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,159
you you have your data your apps your

52
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:03,360
servers your containers or whatever

53
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,240
and

54
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,079
i could not access

55
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:08,239
from the external part unless i have

56
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,120
some access and other other things but

57
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,040
i'm comparing like something by default

58
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,000
like if i open a server i i

59
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,200
i i i pick some share in my server and

60
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,840
operation to anonymous for example i

61
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,879
could not access from outside by default

62
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:27,680
and companies are doing

63
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,640
and migrate into the cloud so what they

64
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,720
are mostly doing they are doing what we

65
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,400
call lifting shift

66
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,519
like they

67
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:37,680
they do they they they worked on the

68
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,440
same way they worked on premise and they

69
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,599
put everything on instance and other

70
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,720
things and they mostly though

71
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,959
doesn't work with the the cloud native

72
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,440
stuff in the first instance but the

73
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,680
problem with that and that they are

74
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,160
doing the lifting shift of the security

75
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,560
of the protections of the data source

76
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,879
that they need to monitor and when you

77
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:01,120
are moving to the cloud

78
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,879
you'll have a new attack surface and

79
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,760
your track surface is born and what is

80
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,040
this new attack surface that is really

81
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,440
really important to monitor that if

82
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,440
you're on the cloud if you're in the

83
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,519
cloud like it's the most important part

84
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:16,959
to monitor

85
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,280
is the aws api

86
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,360
or the control plane

87
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,519
and

88
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,239
and it doesn't matter like if you are

89
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,799
a devops guy uh

90
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,599
some automation or the malicious guy you

91
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:34,080
could from there do a lot of things you

92
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,799
could access the the the information you

93
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,040
could change the

94
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,360
the infrastructure you could open stuff

95
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,280
you could like

96
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,360
start something some crypto mining and

97
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,280
all that things like you have control

98
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,280
especially because we're not going to

99
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,040
talk about that like the

100
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,200
over permissive uh

101
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,000
policy and that's that's another subject

102
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,400
to talk another day but that's one of

103
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,400
the main problem in the cloud and so

104
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,879
that's been being said like we have

105
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:05,040
something as i mentioned before i like

106
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,760
and so you have the threat detections

107
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,239
should this specific and you have the

108
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,480
misconfiguration detector

109
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,720
and the threat detection is something as

110
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,720
i said before is something a bit more

111
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,279
complex and we're trying something about

112
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:22,000
like uh a kind of chain attack chain

113
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,560
like the user will log from somewhere

114
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,400
different maybe try some enumeration

115
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,600
from the numeration you have approval

116
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,400
escalation and so you do this filtration

117
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,560
and so you probably need to have some

118
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,120
kind of combination of acts to figure

119
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,040
out like its attack or not and something

120
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,680
like simulate a pacu framework and see

121
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,560
what what's happened and we have the

122
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,560
misconfiguration detection and the this

123
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,479
misconfiguration that act if you pick

124
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:51,520
the the right fields and information

125
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,440
it's something more

126
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,880
one one two one like one one one event

127
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,039
you could probably have a detection and

128
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:03,520
that's uh where we are

129
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,320
are fitting our our research

130
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,280
and there is three type of activity you

131
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,919
could say and those activities will be

132
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:13,840
like could be the good the regular guy

133
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,479
using doing good things following the

134
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,240
baselines

135
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,280
using the best spreads and so on

136
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,840
and so you have the bad intentional

137
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,560
something like you lick the a key and

138
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,440
from the key you start to to do some

139
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,520
while while you have access to do like

140
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,199
you could like

141
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,120
access some information

142
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,800
try to realize collision and other

143
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,680
things

144
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,919
and you have the

145
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,240
the bad non-intentional and the bad new

146
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,600
intentional

147
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,800
is where the the dangerous lives because

148
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,039
it's something like the guys that's

149
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:51,039
that's supposed to have access have

150
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:54,720
access and are working on the daily job

151
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,479
doing something that's not following the

152
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:59,039
best spreads and the the

153
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:00,960
the the

154
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,000
our

155
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,199
our our main goal here it's exactly on

156
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,479
that because like if you

157
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:10,240
uh try to find some misconfiguration

158
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,160
here you'll probably find for for bad

159
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,240
intention too because sometimes they're

160
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,000
going to open something or do some

161
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,720
things that is the same but we don't

162
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,520
want you stuff to

163
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,919
begin wrong and so like this kind of

164
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:26,720
detection is cool and it's that's

165
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,280
why it's something most almost in real

166
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,560
time

167
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,120
and so when you do that you're opening

168
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,560
your account

169
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,440
for

170
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,639
for other other other people other other

171
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,120
access or something else doesn't matter

172
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,639
and there is

173
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,720
two kinds of

174
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,800
misconfigurations some misconfiguration

175
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,759
that who you provide direct taxes you

176
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,000
need nothing to access

177
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,039
that and

178
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:55,280
and and and could be something like an

179
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,039
s3 bucket

180
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:58,319
oh uh

181
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:01,599
a snapshot ebs snapshot could be a

182
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,599
security group that you open a part to a

183
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:06,080
server that's running in some instance

184
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,720
that has no authorization and

185
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,599
and

186
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,520
on authentication and they will have

187
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,720
access until this kind of of stuff

188
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,680
open your account to the root direct

189
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,240
taxes i don't need nothing nothing more

190
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,960
and you have like the

191
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,520
the second stage attack and you need

192
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,199
another vector

193
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:29,759
and and and and this vector could could

194
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,360
be like uh

195
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,639
oh access to ac ec2 instance a server

196
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,319
start request forgery oh an access key

197
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:41,599
or a user and password

198
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,440
like yesterday

199
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,479
uh

200
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,440
phillips poses pro tills uh talk

201
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,919
uh talked about a lot of different ways

202
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,080
to find like so many

203
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,319
entry points that are put are public

204
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:57,680
based on on research that aws that could

205
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,800
be disposable and this kind of thing

206
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,440
uh uh most of the things that he he told

207
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,599
like fits on the second stage like that

208
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:07,360
he'll have the entry point open but

209
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,000
probably first red shifter for

210
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,479
for rds or

211
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:15,759
you need like some some

212
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:18,319
some extra thing like a user and pass

213
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:19,680
but he he mentioned that your

214
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,520
elasticsearch open so you have direct

215
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,720
taxes

216
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,360
and and this kind of things and so that

217
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,960
those three type of

218
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,280
activities that the bad new intentional

219
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,080
is where we are looking for and so to to

220
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,039
give context to that like let's let's

221
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,240
do a quick view about the cloud tray and

222
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,120
so the how quality work mostly like

223
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,800
whatever you do in your control plane

224
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,399
uh you have aws management uh you have

225
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,279
the sdk that you could develop something

226
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:53,680
you have the cli that's very common tool

227
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,000
to to use

228
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,279
any of them will connect to the api and

229
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,080
and is executed the actions and you have

230
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,600
like nine

231
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,000
nine more almost ten thousand actions

232
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,080
currently and so like everything will be

233
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,080
logged most of everything right with

234
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,360
some exceptions

235
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,800
and and so it will be logged at

236
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,399
cloudtrail and how it works it's re it

237
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:19,040
will record everything it it has a a

238
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,000
simple json format and that's why it's

239
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,080
near real time because it's have a delay

240
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,640
to put to s3 if you're using a s3 and

241
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,800
you have a lot of different field but

242
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,800
mostly you have a json like that that

243
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,920
will tell you like who did that

244
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,720
when he did that

245
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,640
what he did and this started to be

246
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,040
interesting for detection

247
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,720
and from

248
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,560
and the what parameters and so the

249
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,519
combination of what and what parameters

250
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,160
it's where going to look and figure out

251
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,320
like let's see if something is

252
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,120
is

253
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,720
is being created

254
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,640
with the full misconfiguration

255
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,320
right

256
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,519
and so

257
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,240
how we figure out like what we should do

258
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,000
what you should be using so

259
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
we start to look on the cloud security

260
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,959
password management tools and we look at

261
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:13,600
cloud splits and cosplay to us created

262
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,519
by method fuller that

263
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:18,720
the project the company was acquired by

264
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,160
aqua security and one very interesting

265
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,200
point it's a multi-cloud cs pin

266
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,600
and what that's mean that

267
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,399
we are talking now about cs pm2 cloud

268
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,040
trail but you could just change your csp

269
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,120
to cloud detection stuff

270
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,000
because

271
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,120
we are focused on aws right now but

272
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,200
since it's smooth cloud it could work

273
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,519
without the clouds or the provider that

274
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,360
he has you understand why you want to

275
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,440
use it because you have a lot of

276
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,680
data ready ready to go and so if you

277
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,760
look on the cloud supply checks we have

278
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,640
the alibaba we have aws and we have

279
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,040
azure github google earth

280
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,920
aws more than 300 that's a great number

281
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,480
a lot of work to do and not a hundred

282
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,800
percent could be converted in some

283
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,160
detection

284
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,720
but this brings us like a total of

285
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,640
735 possible

286
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,120
detections that's a lot like if half of

287
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,360
this works that's great

288
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,959
we don't need more than that and the

289
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:23,120
check was like uh a week ago

290
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,000
and

291
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,959
what what what is those how those checks

292
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:29,839
bring to us a lot of metadata

293
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:31,760
and those metadata has a lot of

294
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,560
information you have a title you have

295
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,560
where the services fits like some

296
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,640
description some have some more

297
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,839
information we have linked to

298
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,560
documentation you have the

299
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,279
the recommendation access action so you

300
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,200
could figure out oh if that's this

301
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,279
happened like do that and so like if you

302
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:50,800
create some detections you already have

303
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,360
the answer and you have the code that

304
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,880
you could just look and figure out

305
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,440
better what what what they are doing

306
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,399
to to validate that

307
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,720
and this brings us to cs pam to cloud

308
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,680
trade research and this research it's

309
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,200
something where

310
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,639
we're putting a lot of times uh we're

311
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,760
we are working on on on to release that

312
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,120
and so like i read i read saying that

313
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,560
we are going to release like in the

314
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,399
middle of september probably now we get

315
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,720
reverb so follow us we have a bunch of

316
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,279
cool information and we are figuring out

317
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:28,480
like the better way to do that

318
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,399
and that's being said like what what you

319
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,800
did like the first stuff like we create

320
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,720
a cvs about the cloud support

321
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,040
information pick out the metadata what

322
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,040
you need to do here is to add the

323
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,399
severity so you could have like some

324
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:45,200
some better like since you have like 306

325
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,800
checks on that time

326
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,880
uh we we would like to have something

327
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,639
much better i like like for

328
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,240
prioritization so it creates this

329
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,560
severed like

330
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,880
and based on our concepts there is there

331
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,560
is no magical rule here

332
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,120
and

333
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,680
what he did we started to do some some

334
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,800
cards

335
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,160
and so

336
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,560
and so we have the the rule we have the

337
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,839
severity we have the the the impact

338
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:15,760
that's something we had like because

339
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,959
make the the because one important part

340
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:21,279
where i talked about detection like

341
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,480
having

342
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,120
more metadata more information make the

343
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,480
the the

344
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,560
security analyst life easier and that's

345
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,079
very important

346
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:33,120
and so like from this we want to create

347
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,839
this and this is the first version like

348
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:38,079
using splunk but

349
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:40,880
our main goal is to have like some sigma

350
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,079
rules so

351
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:44,720
you could convert to any scene you're

352
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,279
using but since our customer most use

353
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:49,519
splunk and our

354
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,279
biggest engine inside the security

355
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:53,440
operation is splunk so that's something

356
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,360
that

357
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,600
what i'm going to do something different

358
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,519
than that

359
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,440
and

360
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,120
how we could like uh start to create the

361
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,320
payloads

362
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,000
to make sure that we could create

363
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,800
detection and so simulates all things

364
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,560
let's create

365
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,519
let's create our aws miss configuration

366
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,519
server could do

367
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,240
and for sure you're using a a lab

368
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,560
account and we are creating and

369
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,720
destroying but that's kind of thing that

370
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,120
could be have nice to have a tool

371
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,519
uh to simulate all this misconfiguration

372
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:33,600
and so could have something like cspm to

373
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,519
writing automation or

374
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,920
something like that that could be very

375
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,760
nice because you could simulate like if

376
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,920
your enforcement is working you could

377
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,240
simulate like if your stock operate a

378
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,079
secret operation change is working if

379
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,480
your detection is working and this kind

380
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,440
of thing and just to show some proof of

381
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,680
concept about the research

382
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,680
that i said still going and start with

383
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,880
aws

384
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,920
uh we we create a a public history book

385
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,639
detection um true

386
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,279
we create uh we showed here a vpc and

387
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,440
the point exposed

388
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,320
the public ebs snapshot and the thruster

389
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,639
account relationship

390
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:15,040
and the very first is talking about the

391
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,440
public s3 buckets

392
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,920
and and so there is two rules there and

393
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,240
so we create one like the the detect

394
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,959
that put bacterial and the puck debugged

395
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,440
police just to show like if they are

396
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,680
changing through something that's uh

397
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,240
to anyone who you are you're sure that

398
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,680
you're detecting

399
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,759
sure that when you're going to release

400
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:38,079
you'll probably have some extra rules

401
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:40,639
that's not exactly relates with this

402
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,639
rule but something like you could create

403
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:44,399
across accounts

404
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,800
and then and so you could could add a

405
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,759
principle here like another aws account

406
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,480
and so like for example that and game

407
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,560
tools that's a nice tool for kind of

408
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,079
mcquade works

409
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:58,480
and it will not make it public it will

410
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,160
make available to your account and so

411
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,880
this kind of less noise stuff and so

412
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,639
that's something you need to pay

413
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,079
attention but here i just want to show

414
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:08,800
the sample and so like gray hat warfare

415
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,000
it's here to show you that

416
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,920
that uh you have a lot of information

417
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,639
available already and and that's insane

418
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:20,079
because they follow it like for a long

419
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:23,040
time and you say like aws

420
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,759
uh releases a lot of tools through the

421
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:28,240
text this and it keeps growing that's

422
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,399
insane

423
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:33,040
now the vpc and the points exposed and

424
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,160
so

425
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,279
here in this we you create like

426
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:39,920
uh when you create a vpc to detect if

427
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,160
the state principle and state research

428
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,720
is it's going to start

429
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,759
and

430
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:48,079
and sure there is another vector like

431
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:50,800
because like if we talk here about

432
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,880
when it's been created but

433
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,959
you could go there in and use another

434
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:57,360
another action as the

435
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,120
modified vbc

436
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,839
endpoint and we'll have the same result

437
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:03,519
and so as i said we are going to focus

438
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:04,799
on the

439
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:07,919
the most possible case that how you can

440
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:10,240
expose something

441
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,319
and scott piper has a nice paper about

442
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:15,439
that i forgot forgot to mention that

443
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:18,480
and there is a very great talk here

444
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,319
uh talking about that and scott piper

445
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,640
has a paper about this too not about on

446
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,520
the expo exposable service but about

447
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,559
this too

448
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:28,400
so i really recommend you that's open

449
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,240
your mind see like how dangerous could

450
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,480
be because sometimes we don't have

451
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,720
this

452
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,840
we could not figure out like how

453
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,080
dangerous that could be but this is kind

454
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,480
of second stage you cannot abuse this

455
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,520
like

456
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:48,640
if you are not inside the the perimeter

457
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,679
uh public snapshot ebs snapshot

458
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:53,760
that's something like here is another

459
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,000
simple like you could just modify the

460
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,039
snapshot

461
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:59,280
attribute as far as you could not create

462
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,280
it public you need to modify so that

463
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,360
will be probably the only way

464
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,760
and you add it things group to all but

465
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,000
and but there is another modifier that

466
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,559
you permit an account and so that's kind

467
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,880
of thing that prevalent game abuse and

468
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,720
something that you you need to have two

469
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,799
rules you have two rules and i'm just

470
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,000
showing you one

471
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
and there is a great talk from fight

472
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,039
secrets and pub public explosive ebs

473
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:26,320
like from defcon two years ago

474
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,400
and the trust cross account rule the

475
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,200
trust browser control it's it's it's

476
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,280
very very danger

477
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,400
because

478
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,520
when you cross account with some account

479
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,679
you are you need to make sure that that

480
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:42,559
that that that account is is safer too

481
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,559
because like if you put excessive

482
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:47,280
permission and cross account like your

483
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,200
account as safe as the permission you

484
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,440
give to the to the non-safe account and

485
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,720
so that's something

486
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,200
that you really need to understand and

487
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,640
fix i didn't write here but now last

488
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,760
year's uh legendary talk here at claude

489
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,720
village

490
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,039
that the suspo calipsie that he

491
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:08,000
explained like for 40 for the minutes

492
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,080
something like that the how the the

493
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,039
cross account works and some

494
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:15,520
some ways to mitigate that and so i

495
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,120
really suggest you to watch that too

496
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,120
and that's being said like some future

497
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,000
work

498
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,039
uh

499
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:25,039
uh we're going to create more aws

500
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,760
detection we'll start to gcp and azure

501
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,360
mapping too we and more focus on aws

502
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,120
maybe some affinity

503
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,520
queries and provide sigma rules that's

504
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,440
something we have in mind

505
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,000
but that could change like when it

506
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,120
starts to work

507
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,679
