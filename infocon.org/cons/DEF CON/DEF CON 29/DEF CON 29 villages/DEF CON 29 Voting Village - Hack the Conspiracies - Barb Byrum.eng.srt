00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:03,120
hello

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,960
my name is barb byram and i am the

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,640
ingham county clerk in the state of

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:07,919
michigan

5
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:10,400
i've run 30 elections and have been the

6
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,120
chief elections official in my county

7
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,320
for nearly nine years unlike some states

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,400
michigan county clerks are elected

9
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,359
partisanly

10
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,560
every four years elections in michigan

11
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,640
are also decentralized

12
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,039
so while i perform the programming for

13
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:28,480
the election equipment

14
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,560
and accept some candidate filings and

15
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,640
enforce campaign finance laws

16
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,719
it's the local clerk city and township

17
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:37,520
clerk that is responsible for the day of

18
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,600
running the election keep in mind there

19
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,760
are over 1500

20
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,000
local clerks in the state of michigan

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,200
those local clerks

22
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,200
are responsible for hiring precinct

23
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,520
workers and distributing ballots to

24
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,039
voters

25
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,680
prior to my time as an election official

26
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,520
i served six years in the michigan house

27
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,960
of representatives

28
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,120
and owned and operated a hardware store

29
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,280
for nearly 20 years

30
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,879
i've been fortunate enough to be

31
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,720
involved with defcon voting village for

32
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,159
a number of years

33
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,320
and thank you for the opportunity to

34
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,600
speak with you again

35
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,880
albeit virtually this year thank you for

36
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,200
your participation in defcon voting

37
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,000
village

38
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,880
because through your activism election

39
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,240
administrators like me

40
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,360
will forever be positively impacted i

41
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,600
thank you for sharing your knowledge

42
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,720
and being engaged in voting village as a

43
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,400
result of things that i have learned

44
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,280
from you

45
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,360
i have established additional security

46
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,680
practices and am focused on continuing

47
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,680
to mitigate the risk

48
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,079
and maintaining a close working

49
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,960
relationship with my i.t department

50
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,880
i remember my first defcon that i

51
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,920
attended i was absolutely terrified

52
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,600
and i didn't even know what to be afraid

53
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,079
of little did we know

54
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,439
then just a couple years ago that one of

55
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:56,320
the largest

56
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,360
threats on our republic was going to be

57
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,439
the president of the united states

58
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:05,280
and his inability to admit defeat

59
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,318
so let's set up the 2020 election and

60
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:11,440
the experiences we as election officials

61
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,640
have had in michigan

62
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,599
back in 2020 august of 2020 trump

63
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,360
claimed

64
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,400
that if he did not win the election it

65
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,480
would be rigged

66
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,440
media entities and that sided with the

67
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,000
president

68
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,879
parroted his claims his surrogates and

69
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,720
family members criticized election

70
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,000
administrators

71
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,120
and he sent out many social media posts

72
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,680
before he was banned that indicated his

73
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,760
victory was inevitable

74
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,440
and that the deck was stacked against

75
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,400
him if the unthinkable happened

76
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,879
late on november 3rd or early november

77
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,319
4th 2020

78
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,560
with absent ballot counting sometimes

79
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,480
referred to as mail-in voting

80
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,159
not yet completed in several

81
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:01,760
battleground states

82
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,200
the president declared victory in-person

83
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,519
ballots had been tabulated

84
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,720
and results were reported they favored

85
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,760
the president

86
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,760
which was less than surprising given

87
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,680
that he had been downplaying the

88
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,159
severity of the coven 19 outbreak

89
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:20,560
to his supporters and sowing seeds of

90
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,519
skepticism

91
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:25,200
towards absentee voting biden supporters

92
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,080
meanwhile

93
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,239
favorite absentee voting mail and voting

94
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,640
and early voting as safer options

95
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,000
the larger urban areas typically lean

96
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,159
leaning democratic like the city of

97
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:37,680
detroit in michigan

98
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,000
were still counting the large volume of

99
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,959
absentee ballots they had received

100
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,040
days later shortly after the winner of

101
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,480
the november general election was

102
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,440
announced

103
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,000
conspiracies began popping up in the

104
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,480
darker corners of the internet

105
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,400
these included whether or not sharpies

106
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,920
were being utilized

107
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,760
in predominantly republican leaning

108
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,760
precincts because they somehow

109
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,280
invalidated ballots

110
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,400
this is not true in fact sharpies are

111
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,640
usually the recommended the preferred

112
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,319
ballot marking device for optical

113
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,560
scanned voting machines

114
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,040
there were allegations of boat dumps in

115
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,879
the wee hours of the morning

116
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:18,320
nope not true either what they probably

117
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,000
saw was the upload of larger

118
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,759
jurisdictions results

119
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,320
you know the ones that had more absentee

120
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,840
ballots to count

121
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,440
and probably could not finish by the

122
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,759
time polls closed on election day

123
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,960
being added to the reported results

124
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,120
in ingham county we were still receiving

125
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,360
election results from our largest city

126
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,880
at six o'clock in the morning on

127
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,720
wednesday november 4th

128
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,880
and quite frankly i was surprised it was

129
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,320
that soon

130
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,560
in michigan we're not allowed to feed

131
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,960
absentee ballots into tabulators

132
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,759
until polls open on election day at 7

133
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,440
a.m local time

134
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,360
this means that local clerks are not

135
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,800
permitted to begin tabulation until 7am

136
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,800
typically this means completing

137
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,960
everything from opening the ballot

138
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,120
to verification of the ballot number

139
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,560
assigned to the voter

140
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,160
while the ballot is still inside the

141
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,000
secrecy sleeve to maintain the secrecy

142
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,960
of the vote

143
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,360
to removal of the ballot stub to the

144
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,199
removal of the ballot from the secrecy

145
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,960
sleeve to flattening the ballot

146
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,400
and finally to feeding that ballot

147
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,479
through the tabulator

148
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,400
for november election the michigan

149
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,639
legislature gave local clerks a morsel

150
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:25,440
of assistance

151
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,039
in the form of allowing clerks and

152
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,199
jurisdictions with populations

153
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,479
of more than 25 000 to open the outer

154
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:35,199
absentee ballot return envelope

155
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,919
on the day before the election so there

156
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,960
was still a

157
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,759
great amount of work to be done come 7am

158
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,240
on election day

159
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,680
there were also allegations of 138

160
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,560
000 ballot dump for biden but let's be

161
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,280
clear

162
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,759
that was an extra zero that was added

163
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,520
when a vote totals were

164
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,479
manually typed into a state database it

165
00:05:58,479 --> 00:05:59,919
was quickly corrected

166
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,479
but not quick enough for fake news to

167
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,479
travel

168
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,240
election challengers claimed ballot

169
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,840
delivery trucks arrived from

170
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,160
goodness knows where to the tfc center

171
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,360
in detroit

172
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,720
this theory too was proven incorrect

173
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,039
voters who requested an absentee ballot

174
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:19,360
in michigan have until 8 pm on election

175
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,000
day

176
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,639
to return said ballot there are drop

177
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:23,199
boxes

178
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,880
all over the city of detroit that

179
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,639
accepts absent voter ballots

180
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,199
which all had to be checked at 8 pm on

181
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:30,720
election day

182
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,639
once the ballots were retrieved from the

183
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,960
drop boxes they had to be returned to

184
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,240
the clerk's office

185
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,919
where they were marked return in the

186
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,160
voter file and the signature on the

187
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,759
outside envelope was compared to the

188
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:42,400
signature

189
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,639
in the voter file plus they were

190
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,960
probably being sorted by precinct

191
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,120
of which there are hundreds in the city

192
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,360
of detroit for easier and more

193
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,639
efficient and secure processing

194
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,520
once they once only then could they be

195
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,199
delivered to the absent voter county

196
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:00,000
boards

197
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,240
where they can go through the process of

198
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,080
opening that outer envelope

199
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,000
verifying the ballot number assigned to

200
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,440
the voter

201
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,599
removing the ballot stub removal of the

202
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,039
ballot from the secrecy sleeve

203
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,599
flattening the ballot and finally to

204
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:14,639
feeding that ballot

205
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,080
in through into the tabulator oh

206
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,319
and man with the mysterious wagon full

207
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,840
of ballots in detroit

208
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,240
was from a local news station so that

209
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,280
man was a

210
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,240
was a reporter another conspiracy was

211
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,080
that something screwy was going on in

212
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,840
antrim county michigan

213
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,960
again not the case interim county

214
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,280
michigan reported that biden beat trump

215
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,759
which prompted the trump team to claim a

216
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,440
software glitch

217
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,520
and baseless claims that dominion voting

218
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,240
systems election computer malfunctioned

219
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,000
spread around the nation the truth is

220
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,240
the problem was human error as the

221
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,240
tabulator programming and the ballots

222
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,160
had been updated to include some late

223
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,599
added candidates

224
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,000
which did not match the programming on

225
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,680
the computer that accumulated the

226
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,639
results

227
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,879
therefore vote totals were not properly

228
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:07,120
awarded to the proper candidate

229
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,879
the county clerk worked with the county

230
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,720
board of canvassers to certify the

231
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,240
proper results

232
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,039
this was able to be done because one the

233
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,280
tabulators read the ballots properly and

234
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,400
printed the proper

235
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,879
the correct report on election night

236
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:21,840
into

237
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,000
michigan's paper ballots that can be

238
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,280
reviewed

239
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,440
a full hand recount of the county's

240
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,280
paper ballots also showed

241
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,039
that the certified election results were

242
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:33,440
correct trump did in fact win

243
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,839
interim county michigan the barrage of

244
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:40,159
theories around the foundation of our

245
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,640
democracy has left a large swath

246
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,279
of the american population frustrated

247
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:46,080
and sometimes

248
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,240
outraged over what they perceive to have

249
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,680
happened

250
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,240
with a calming word from trusted leaders

251
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,480
the mistrust and disbelief

252
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,360
may have faded away and the election a

253
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,040
distant memory

254
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,320
however for months the tru trump and his

255
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,440
compatriots

256
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,080
sought to rile up crowds and stoke the

257
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,680
fires

258
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,800
trump sent rudy giuliani to michigan to

259
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,959
take part in a kangaroo hearing

260
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,839
about the november 3rd election after

261
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,320
weeks of perpetrating these falsehoods

262
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,320
and bullying officials like the georgia

263
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,000
secretary of state

264
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
you may even recall the saturday night

265
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,120
live skit

266
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,200
and i wish i could say the real hearing

267
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,200
was more serious

268
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,839
mr giuliani and his associates spent

269
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:34,800
five hours repeating these conspiracies

270
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,000
without much credibility unfortunately a

271
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,680
lot of the testimony

272
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,600
from that hearing which was not under

273
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,080
oath boiled down to people who did not

274
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,320
understand the elections process

275
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,399
and who were upset about the result of

276
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:49,600
the election and

277
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,440
observed it with a negative bent

278
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,040
our elections officials are under attack

279
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,360
there were claims that there were

280
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,680
tabulation errors in rochester hills

281
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,680
which again turned out to be human error

282
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,360
of a file being sent twice

283
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,600
to the county clerk for the purpose of

284
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,480
reporting unofficial election results

285
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,000
it was corrected the morning after

286
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,680
election day the

287
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,320
vile messages and threats that that

288
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,240
local clerk received after setting the

289
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,600
record straight

290
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,440
certainly contributed to her leaving her

291
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,519
post abruptly and seeking employment

292
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:24,800
elsewhere

293
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,440
the brennan center for justice put out a

294
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,640
report last month

295
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,320
about the attacks election officials

296
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,760
have faced

297
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,680
it states that one in three election

298
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,440
officials feel unsafe

299
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,480
because of their job and almost one in

300
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,279
five

301
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:41,120
listed threats to their lives as a

302
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,360
job-related concern

303
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,519
the video that accompanies the report is

304
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,680
eye-opening to the attacks my colleagues

305
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,800
have experienced

306
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,959
over the past eight months and even

307
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:52,800
longer than that

308
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,720
when our election officials are under

309
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,800
attack our democracy

310
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,680
is under attack now i'd like to play

311
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:15,839

threatened my life couldn't go anywhere

321
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,680
without the police officers

322
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,360
we had officers on the roof of our

323
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,200
building i'd never had people

324
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,160
so engaged and enraged about what we

325
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,839
were doing just to ensure that people

326
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:06,480
could vote

327
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,440
we had go bags ready for my family and

328
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,839
my children

329
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:14,959
the biggest problem we have right now

330
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:16,320
are the ballots

331
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,000
millions of ballots going out what's

332
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,639
going to happen on november 3rd when

333
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:23,519
somebody's leading and they said well we

334
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,200
haven't counted the ballots

335
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,680
we have millions of ballots to count

336
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,519
it's a disaster

337
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,360
that was picked up by his political

338
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,000
allies and perpetuated against

339
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,399
election administrators this to me was

340
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:37,440
an effort

341
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,480
to undermine confidence in

342
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,720
our entire electoral process the

343
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,160
national narrative was

344
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,160
no early voting make them go to the

345
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,839
polls you know you can't trust

346
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:49,639
absentees there was certainly

347
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:51,680
unfamiliarity with the process

348
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,440
and and people took advantage of that

349
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,040
people exploited that

350
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,399
uh to try to make people question

351
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,240
the validity of the system and what they

352
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,760
were doing was again trying to discredit

353
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,839
the results if they didn't turn out

354
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,839
and the bullseye was on us

355
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,240
there were people who showed up outside

356
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,639
of election officials houses

357
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,399
armed people that showed up outside of

358
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,480
offices threatening phone calls

359
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,959
harassment and online discussions about

360
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:22,000
types of

361
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,800
ammunition and guns to use on me it

362
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,000
became a daily

363
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,920
occurrence outside of our facility to

364
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,079
have anywhere from

365
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:32,959
50 to 150 individuals outside some of

366
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:34,000
them were armed

367
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,040
there was a fence sort of separating

368
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,560
the building from the from the

369
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,120
protesters

370
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,279
and they were armed i was walking up the

371
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:44,560
street to the park

372
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,320
to this big big caucasian guy came up to

373
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,079
me out of his car and he said i've been

374
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,600
waiting for you miss winfrey i want to

375
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,360
know why you cheated during the election

376
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,560
i want to know why

377
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,279
donald trump lost it's your fault we

378
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:58,639
were terribly concerned about

379
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:00,959
every threat everything that was said

380
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,959
because we just didn't know i was

381
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:04,800
encountered with a

382
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,600
partisan operative campaign manager with

383
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,959
his cell phone

384
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:12,000
where he videotaped me hurling

385
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,440
insults and accusations it had over 400

386
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,000
000 views commenters were saying we

387
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,680
should find out where she lives

388
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,079
we should hang her for treason she

389
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:23,199
should be shot

390
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:26,639
this is not what um i i expect

391
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:29,120
uh to have to really run and fight for

392
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,040
my life we think about that happening in

393
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,880
other places around the world but that's

394
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,440
happened in the united states

395
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,079
and it's happened specifically because

396
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,040
of the big lie

397
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,040
this is going to be a fraud like you've

398
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,120
never seen the only way

399
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,440
we're going to lose this election is if

400
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,519
the election is rigged

401
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:48,880
it's going to be fraudulent it's going

402
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,120
to be fraud all over the place

403
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,880
who's getting the ballots who's sending

the ballots

405
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,120
this is stealing millions of votes this

406
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,280
is a rigged election

407
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:04,350
[Music]

408
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,399
i made the decision to go with an

409
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:09,199
all-male ballot for the primary election

410
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,760
we had to redo pretty much the entire

411
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,199
way that philadelphia votes and we only

412
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:14,399
had a couple weeks to do it

413
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,399
i mailed all applications to all

414
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:18,079
registered voters in the city of detroit

415
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:19,760
government and industry representatives

416
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,519
from the election security community

417
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:23,920
issued a joint statement reflecting a

418
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,440
consensus perspective

419
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,760
that the 2020 election was the most

420
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,279
secure in u.s history

421
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,959
we actually had a record number of

422
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,880
turnouts of people that came out

423
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,040
in a pandemic everything that you had

424
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,040
written in a playbook as far as like how

425
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,279
you normally do things in an election

426
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:40,000
cycle

427
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,800
had to be set aside we had no idea that

428
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,759
we would be

429
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:46,560
having to purchase personal protective

430
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,600
equipment

431
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,839
at a time when none was available we had

432
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:51,440
a lot of senior

433
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,959
facilities churches that were not even

434
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:57,199
open to their own congregations let

435
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:59,360
alone open their doors and let several

436
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,040
hundred people come in and vote

437
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,959
as you're hearing the country is seeing

438
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:06,720
record turnout in early voting

439
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,040
americans waiting in lines for hours

440
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,279
even braving pouring rain to make their

441
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,600
voices heard

442
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,639
we had a camera in the convention center

443
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,240
with a live feed for the networks could

444
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,320
tap into it anytime and it was a massive

445
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,320
operation again 24 hours a day hundreds

446
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,040
of people

447
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,680
it was very surreal we had people coming

448
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,199
and signed up to work that november

449
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:29,040
election cycle who had never worked in

450
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:29,759
an election

451
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:32,240
ever before and a lot of them were

452
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,279
people that were

453
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,839
college age the work that my team did to

454
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,680
run this election is about as good as

455
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,480
any team

456
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,800
in the united states of america has ever

457
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,320
done election officials

458
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,120
are in this for passion for service they

459
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,120
don't do this job to get rich

460
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,959
and they care more about the integrity

461
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:50,720
of elections than anyone i know

462
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,560
that feeling that you get when elections

463
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,079
are over on election night and

464
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:55,440
everything has worked

465
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,199
according to plan is there's a feeling

466
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:59,040
that i can't just describe it it is

467
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,399
so much more than just an exercise we do

468
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:03,360
every six months

469
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,919
it's our fundamental right and we know

470
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:08,000
that when more people participate

471
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,119
the better off we are there is a lot

472
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:12,880
that can be done to help educate

473
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,559
lawmakers educate the public

474
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:17,520
about the process the leaders have made

475
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,640
it comfortable

476
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,760
to be racist

477
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:26,000
to be so partisan

it needs to be a bipartisan effort and

480

there needs to be leadership who's

willing to support

clerk was told that if he emailed that

515
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,160
particular voter again

516
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:20,240
he was going to slit his throat

517
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:23,120
lawsuits across the nation have been

518
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,320
plaguing

519
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,679
election offices michigan like many

520
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:28,400
other states

521
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,960
have seen countless rallies and lawsuits

522
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,240
crying fraud

523
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,160
due to these already debunked

524
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,240
conspiracies

525
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,679
legislators and legislatures at both

526
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,960
the state and federal level call have

527
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,000
called for the election to be overturned

528
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,720
then others joined a texas lawsuit that

529
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,440
would have

530
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,760
upended the electoral college process

531
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,559
let us not fail to note the proposed

532
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:58,480
legislation that has been introduced in

533
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,080
the majority of states in the united

534
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,039
states

535
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:04,960
reportedly to combat the election fraud

536
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:09,039
at least 389 restrictive election bills

537
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:10,400
have been introduced in state

538
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,360
legislatures across the u.s

539
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,880
michigan has seen a 39 bill package

540
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,120
introduced in the senate that was

541
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,760
written by the heritage action fund

542
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,320
and disseminated to republican caucuses

543
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,240
across the country

544
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,799
these bills sought sought to restrict

545
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:29,600
the vote

546
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,880
suppress the vote and disenfranchise the

547
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,240
voter

548
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,919
those pushing back against the

549
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:37,679
misinformation

550
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,320
bills are being targeted in future

551
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,919
elections

552
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:44,240
we are already seeing that in michigan

553
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,159
with a secretary of state candidate

554
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:49,039
attending the arizona audit and people

555
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,000
who are behind

556
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,080
numerous election lawsuits and fraud

557
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,600
rallies running for attorney general

558
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,960
let's talk about what's happening in

559
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,919
arizona i refuse to call what is

560
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:01,360
happening in arizona

561
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,240
arizona a true audit because what we are

562
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:04,720
seeing

563
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,080
are partisan election reviews exercises

564
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,640
by unqualified individuals with little

565
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,280
to no

566
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,799
transparency the one we are witnessing

567
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:16,640
in arizona is being pushed across the

568
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,799
nation in places like pennsylvania

569
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:22,080
wisconsin and even michigan

570
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,640
election officials in arizona have to

571
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,120
spend

572
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,760
more time creating websites to respond

573
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,960
to baseless

574
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,760
inaccurate claims and less time serving

575
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,200
the voters

576
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,200
this is causing our election equipment

577
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,120
to be decertified

578
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,320
due to unauthorized access in fact the

579
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,360
systems

580
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,360
in the arizona case were taken to

581
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,520
another state and subject to

582
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:49,760
unknown compromises these exercises are

583
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,840
just perpetuating the conspiracy

584
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,240
theories without actually consulting

585
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,440
experts or doing anything to improve

586
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:01,760
election process or experience

587
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,679
in michigan we even have a sheriff

588
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:06,559
investigating election officials now

589
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,799
one michigan county sheriff is also

590
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:10,559
taking it upon himself

591
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:13,600
to conduct an investigation into the

592
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,080
election

593
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,840
going so far as to hire a private

594
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,840
investigator and harass

595
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,799
local clerks into giving them access to

596
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,799
their election materials

597
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,960
or straight up seizing the election

598
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,039
equipment

599
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:28,640
we're seeing more and more election

600
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,799
administrators leave the field

601
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:33,919
in 2020 nearly 35 percent of election

602
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:34,720
officials

603
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,559
would be retirement age by 2024.

604
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:40,640
the institutional knowledge that we'll

605
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,840
leave with them

606
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,880
is going to be devastating not to

607
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,360
mention who will be taking their place

608
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,520
when the people have watched election

609
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,679
officials get harassed

610
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:53,360
and it will ar and it's already a

611
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,600
thankless job

612
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,360
those that are pushing the conspiracy

613
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,799
theories will be running

614
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:02,080
for those positions we may not see the

615
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,240
real impact at least in michigan until

616
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,600
2024

617
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,240
when county and township clerk offices

618
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,200
are up for re-election

619
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,400
we have to do more we have to stay

620
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,840
engaged

621
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,720
fight back against these conspiracies

622
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,520
that is how

623
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,320
we hack them it is not all doom and

624
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,280
gloom

625
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,280
the michigan senate oversight committee

626
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,840
put out a report after numerous hearings

627
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,120
and investigations

628
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,440
that concluded there was no fraud in the

629
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,200
november general election

630
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,640
and the certified results were accurate

631
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,799
one can only hope that people in places

632
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:41,279
of power standing up to the conspiracy

633
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:43,679
will pave the way for others to do the

634
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:45,120
same

635
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,679
election integrity the security and

636
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:49,200
sanctity of the vote

637
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,320
is of paramount importance the federal

638
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,840
government knows this

639
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,760
as election administration was deemed

640
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,120
critical infrastructure

641
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,799
back in 2017 so what else can we do to

642
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:03,679
protect the future of our elections

643
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:06,320
demand that our elections continue to

644
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,919
follow the most secure

645
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:11,360
protocols that every voter votes

646
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:14,640
in the least hackable way possible

647
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,520
with a paper ballot hold those

648
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,559
politicians

649
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:20,320
who would undermine our democratic

650
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,640
system or government accountable

651
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,279
stand up for a free press and the safety

652
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:26,960
of members of the media

653
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,200
we must demand that those that threaten

654
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,320
the media

655
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,320
and election administrators are held to

656
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,960
the fullest extent of the law

657
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,480
get more involved in the process of

658
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,080
election administration

659
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,760
sign up to work an election as a

660
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,360
precinct inspector

661
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,520
work an absent voter accounting board

662
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,559
learn as much

663
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:47,200
as possible about our elections because

664
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:47,919
the more

665
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:50,960
people with knowledge of how the process

666
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,400
works the more people will be assured

667
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,320
that it is working the way it is

668
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,159
supposed to

669
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:00,400
call on those with skills to help us

670
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,880
keep elections safe and secure

671
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,520
election officials are not usually cyber

672
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,120
security experts

673
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,200
but we must work with government

674
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,679
agencies to bolster our defenses

675
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:16,960
against cyber attacks again

676
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:21,760
again thank you so much for the

677
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,480
opportunity to speak with you this year

678
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,559
please join me in fighting back against

679
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:28,159
miss diss

680
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:30,960
and mal information whether that is by

681
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,000
reporting false

682
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,320
social media posts or learning for

683
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,480
yourself if something is accurate before

684
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,400
amplifying the message

685
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,679
i welcome and appreciate your assistance

686
