00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:04,080
hi everyone

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,160
my name is lauren zabrik and i am the

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,520
executive director

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,280
of the cyber project at the harvard

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,519
kennedy schools buffer center

6
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:13,519
first i just want to thank bryson bort

7
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:15,920
and the entire ics village

8
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,400
and team for inviting me here to discuss

9
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,119
our paper

10
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:21,600
entitled toward a collaborative cyber

11
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,760
defense and enhanced threat intelligence

12
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,680
structure

13
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,279
i want to start with the story just to

14
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:29,199
paint the picture you know what

15
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,159
how this is really informing my thinking

16
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,160
i spent over a decade in the united

17
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,680
states intelligence community

18
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,079
and a big chunk of that where i was an

19
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:40,399
analyst working counterterrorism

20
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:42,239
the group of analysts that i was a part

21
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,559
of developed an entirely new methodology

22
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:47,920
that at its core suggested that all data

23
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,039
no matter when it was collected or from

24
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:52,559
what sensor it was collected is

25
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:55,039
important to identify malign activity

26
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:56,480
from the benign

27
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,640
this mindset combined with leadership

28
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,520
who removed

29
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,800
bureaucratic burdens such as arbitrary

30
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,559
reporting requirements

31
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,720
let us be analysts and figure out the

32
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,159
hard problems and

33
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,320
you know isn't that what we all want as

34
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,920
analysts who want to be empowered to do

35
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,119
that

36
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:15,520
doing so allowed us to become very

37
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,360
entrepreneurial in our work

38
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,119
we made relationships across the

39
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:20,880
community offering

40
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,119
our cutting edge analysis for access to

41
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:24,000
more data

42
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,759
and even creating our own

43
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:27,680
forward-deployed spart spots to make

44
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,200
good on those relationships

45
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,079
and to continue the mission in this

46
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:32,720
setting

47
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,880
i deployed overseas multiple times

48
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,960
sitting side by side with analysts and

49
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:37,920
operators

50
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,720
in joint operations centers or jocks

51
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,520
where

52
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,439
everyone was free to share information

53
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,360
with each other and where we all had

54
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,280
awareness of the battle space

55
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,280
because of the nightly operations and

56
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,960
intelligence briefing

57
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,280
this is where i first became acquainted

58
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,200
with this model that i described in the

59
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,159
paper

60
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,640
which is best highlighted by lieutenant

61
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,439
general stanley

62
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:02,719
crystal's motto where he says it takes a

63
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,640
network to defeat a network and that's

64
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,600
the whole crux behind this paper so say

65
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,239
what you will

66
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,639
about our overall strategy in iraq and

67
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,319
afghanistan

68
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,640
from a tactical intelligence and

69
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,239
organizational standpoint

70
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:18,160
i think we're innovative and there's

71
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,520
some really important

72
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,480
organizational lessons learned here when

73
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,800
i came to the cyber world in january of

74
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,920
2016

75
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,680
i was fresh from government and fresh

76
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,120
from this whole environment

77
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,319
and i watched organizations try to build

78
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:32,800
up their

79
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,400
own cyber capabilities threat

80
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,000
intelligence capabilities

81
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,319
operating on slim budgets and really

82
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:39,840
trying to figure out how to

83
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,360
defend themselves in during amid rising

84
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,640
cyber threats

85
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,040
largely without government involvement

86
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,720
and i just remember thinking

87
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,280
there has to be a better way now i want

88
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,480
to be very clear here

89
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,200
i know there was recent pushback over

90
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,280
conflating cyber and ct

91
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,040
and and while there are some distinct

92
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,040
differences you know and some

93
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,400
um areas of similarity you know it's

94
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,920
it's the intelligence

95
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,840
and the organizational concepts that i'm

96
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,159
really trying to carry forward here

97
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,640
i think our current threat environment

98
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,560
demands the need for

99
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,840
more collaboration increased

100
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,920
collaboration we're witnessing

101
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,760
increasing ransomware attacks and

102
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,200
intrusions into our critical

103
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,200
infrastructure by both state

104
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,159
and non-state actors with increasingly

105
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,239
sophisticated capabilities and sharpened

106
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:29,120
intent

107
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,840
and so the strategic vision set forth by

108
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,680
our president and his senior cyber

109
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,159
leaders

110
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,560
is truly critical to helping us become

111
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,319
more secure and resilient

112
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,560
but to operationalize that vision we

113
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,239
have to ensure that the structures and

114
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:43,360
the policies

115
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,360
to facilitate that collaboration are in

116
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,640
place and

117
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,000
um as we know there they've been lacking

118
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,159
so this is my idea to create those

119
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,319
structures and policies kind of like

120
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:57,040
if you build it they will come now from

121
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:57,680
there

122
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,920
you obviously need strong relationships

123
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,280
between people and

124
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,120
even better ways to operationalize

125
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,879
intelligence and this paper doesn't

126
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,319
exactly address that

127
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,319
but i will make a quick plug for share

128
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:09,519
the mike and cyber which

129
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:10,959
in october we're going to be really

130
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,640
focusing on those

131
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,720
human to human tactical relationships

132
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,880
for public-private partnerships

133
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,358
so is this a perfect answer i don't know

134
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:21,519
but it's a conversation starter

135
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,280
and there's some new ideas in here

136
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,360
building on some existing ideas

137
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,080
from other people um so i'm really

138
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,080
excited to talk to you about this today

139
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,840
so first i want to go over how we did

140
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,759
the research and what we know

141
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:35,360
about the current state and that'll go

142
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,840
into our five recommendations and wrap

143
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,960
up and await your feedback

144
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,680
we conducted research and interviews

145
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,080
starting back in november of 2019

146
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,759
and we wanted to talk to people across

147
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,080
the entire ecosystem we did

148
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,320
we spoke with people at state fusion

149
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,280
centers

150
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,320
in national labs people who were still

151
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,840
in the federal government or who had

152
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,560
just left

153
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,639
people from sizza the department of

154
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,560
energy the intelligence community the

155
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,759
fbi

156
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,960
we talked to people at isaacs and i sows

157
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,199
we talk to people in various private

158
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:10,720
sector companies

159
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,560
especially threat intelligence analysts

160
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,400
both large and small

161
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,400
and and some even in the critical

162
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,720
infrastructure sectors

163
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,600
we wanted to map the current state and

164
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:21,919
an

165
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,000
earlier version of this paper has 20

166
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,840
pages dedicated to the subject but we

167
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,759
cut most of that out for length because

168
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,280
we want people to actually read the

169
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,160
paper

170
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,120
but our thesis was that our current

171
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,080
environment

172
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,680
across the domestic landscape is um

173
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,919
it's very stove piped and uncoordinated

174
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:41,440
and as you know

175
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,000
it leaves the analysts and the operators

176
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,960
overextended

177
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,240
you're all exhausted um and it's not

178
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,360
getting much better

179
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,800
and and of course our critical

180
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,720
infrastructure remains vulnerable

181
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,319
which was born out of our research now

182
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:59,919
we know that for defense there has to be

183
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:01,759
a layered approach between

184
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,600
the diplomatic community the military

185
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,000
and the intelligence community of course

186
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,960
regulations um and this paper doesn't

187
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,919
address that it's really just focused on

188
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:13,840
the nature of our collaboration and

189
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,759
threat intelligence sharing

190
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:19,120
um so take that for what it is

191
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,440
we looked at the landscape through four

192
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,960
different lenses

193
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,039
cultural organizational legal and

194
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:26,240
technological

195
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,400
and it was part of my hypothesis from

196
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,240
the outset that these

197
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,240
were where some of those barriers were

198
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,800
to effective collaboration

199
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,520
as we know domestic cyber security is

200
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,000
really

201
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,880
hampered by limited resources talent

202
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,919
data

203
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:45,199
funding there's a siloed approach and

204
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:46,240
even

205
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,240
especially at the state and local levels

206
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,400
an emergency management law enforcement

207
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,599
approach

208
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:54,000
which isn't necessarily a bad thing but

209
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,120
um

210
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,240
doesn't really lend itself to strategic

211
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,840
whole of nation um approaches to the

212
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,160
problem

213
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,960
um the private sector is responsible for

214
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,039
their own networks and their own data as

215
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:10,960
you know with varying levels of maturity

216
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,639
and resources

217
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,280
and similarly the federal government

218
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,319
suffers from

219
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:19,680
swim lanes budget limitations paperwork

220
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,560
requirements

221
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,360
to to actually work with the private

222
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:23,840
sector

223
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,800
classification issues there's a lot of

224
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,560
trust issues between

225
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,960
public and private and you know this

226
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,319
this thought of well

227
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,080
if i'm going to work with you what am i

228
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,319
going to get out of it so a lot of

229
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:37,599
entities thought they weren't really

230
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:41,120
getting much out of that collaboration

231
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,319
um not one person has been able to

232
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,479
really hammer this out between the

233
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:47,360
interagency

234
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,280
and you know engaging with the private

235
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,120
sector um on

236
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,160
from a holistic standpoint and

237
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,039
so to us the fundamental challenge is

238
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:59,199
that the structures the policies and the

239
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:00,400
incentives

240
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,879
are lacking the relationships that do

241
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,800
exist are largely ad hoc

242
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,879
and they're point to point there's no

243
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,800
clear operational picture

244
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,840
of the entire threat landscape or

245
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,879
again a coordinated sustained

246
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,080
strategic approach to really address the

247
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,440
issues

248
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,440
we really lack a comprehensive

249
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,039
understanding because we aren't

250
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,080
collecting

251
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,319
processing and sharing that data that's

252
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,599
out there in a coordinated manner

253
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,840
so before i jump into our five

254
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,958
recommendations

255
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:35,200
i want to read you a quote from team of

256
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,839
teams by stanley mccrystal

257
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:40,958
where he says organizations must be

258
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:41,760
networked

259
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,399
not siloed in order to succeed

260
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,320
specifically we restructured our force

261
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,680
from the ground up

262
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,000
on principles of extremely transparent

263
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,440
information sharing

264
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,200
and decentralized decision-making

265
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,440
authority we dubbed this goal the state

266
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,800
of emergent adaptive

267
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,880
organizational intelligence shared

268
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,920
consciousness

269
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,519
and it became the cornerstone of our

270
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:04,560
transformation that quote right there

271
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,399
is really just the driving vision

272
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,519
for um the the structures and and the

273
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,440
policies that i described here

274
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,640
so um restructuring um

275
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,120
transparent information sharing and you

276
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,240
know at the

277
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,640
different level uh level decentralized

278
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,120
lowest levels making those decisions but

279
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,040
still having that that common thread

280
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,920
across the whole landscape so our first

281
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,440
recommendation

282
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,160
to actually create those structures is

283
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:36,880
to

284
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,959
take something that exists now and

285
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:40,160
transform it

286
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,480
and what we're recommending is taking

287
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,240
the current

288
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,360
scissor regional office structure

289
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,959
so they have 10 regional offices right

290
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:51,360
now

291
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,360
and they are staffed by

292
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,360
from what we could derive a handful of

293
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,360
people they're more advisory posts right

294
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,000
now

295
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,560
but what we are recommending is to take

296
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,000
each of those offices and

297
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,920
just build them out creating making them

298
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,399
bigger

299
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,600
outfitting them with all you know

300
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,440
a number of workstations and

301
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,160
common communications across across all

302
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,600
these nodes

303
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,000
and we're calling them or we want to

304
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,880
call them the

305
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,040
collaborative defensive and analysis

306
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:25,920
centers or

307
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,600
cdx so mirroring the jock

308
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,800
sorry the jock construct

309
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,279
but you know we don't want it to be over

310
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:36,240
militarized

311
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,440
but in this setting analysts

312
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,519
and operators would sit side by side

313
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:42,560
analyzing

314
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,519
sharing cyber threat intelligence

315
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,120
providing early warning across the

316
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,240
ecosystem

317
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,800
and coordinating defensive actions with

318
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,760
stakeholder

319
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,519
organizations and mentioning the

320
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,360
stakeholder organizations people may

321
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,000
think well

322
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,680
who has a seat in the cdoc

323
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,320
obviously not everyone can have a seat

324
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,120
in in the

325
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,720
organization and of course it is

326
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,959
incumbent upon the different entities

327
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,760
um staffing levels whether they can send

328
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,240
somebody or not but at a minimum

329
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,320
we're thinking people like

330
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,160
representatives from the fbi

331
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,560
representatives from cisa

332
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,560
representatives from the state

333
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,320
fusion center so the states that are

334
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,800
operating in that region

335
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,279
the different isaacs and i sows

336
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:30,640
especially ones that have a heavy

337
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,240
presence in the region

338
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,160
um different private sectors companies

339
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,640
both big and small but especially ones

340
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,640
in the critical infrastructure sector

341
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,120
so bringing all these analysts together

342
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,480
and also giving them

343
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,079
the ability to have reach back

344
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,320
capability to their own organizations

345
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,120
for

346
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,920
additional analytic support and um any

347
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,880
sort of

348
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,240
defensive um actions

349
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,680
a lot of people have asked well why

350
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,680
regional offices we think that they're

351
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,360
key to this vision because they offer

352
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,720
that physical breadth

353
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,959
for the mission and a field office touch

354
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:05,839
point

355
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:08,480
um for businesses and and states

356
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,079
operating in that region

357
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:11,760
we think a structure like this would

358
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,920
ensure a sustained government-led

359
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,040
coordinated presence

360
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,040
in all regions of the country but to

361
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,360
combat the threat on a local level

362
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,680
something that i've heard called

363
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,880
reaching communities

364
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,000
and highly distributed ways

365
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,320
um and having intrinsic understanding

366
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,320
of the entities in that region i think

367
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,639
is really important because

368
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:37,279
um there's just different needs and

369
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:38,240
different

370
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,399
realities on the ground and then of

371
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,639
course every day or night

372
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:43,680
we think there should be an

373
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,519
enterprise-wide operations and

374
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,360
intelligence briefing that everyone in

375
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,480
the cdac could

376
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,279
observe and gain situational awareness

377
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:52,000
um

378
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,920
you know the analysts would share

379
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,920
strategic intelligence operators could

380
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,639
debrief

381
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,440
incidents and you know note any major

382
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,600
reflections from those activities and we

383
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,360
think this would be the thread that

384
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,120
holds all the different nodes in place

385
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,880
and continues to build that connective

386
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,040
tissue

387
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,920
our second recommendation is to scale

388
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,680
voluntary data collection and processing

389
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,720
you can't really have this structure

390
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,839
without the data to

391
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:24,000
to go through and to really provide that

392
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,200
foundation for

393
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,320
enhanced analysis so collecting more

394
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,120
threat data

395
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,680
and processing it and by processing i'm

396
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,720
talking

397
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,000
indexing applying analytics minimizing

398
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,519
it so stripping out all of that

399
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,120
personally identifiable

400
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,959
organizationally identifiable

401
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:42,320
information

402
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,279
to detect anomalies to create that

403
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:46,959
common operational picture

404
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:50,079
and then to ensure that it is shareable

405
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:53,440
at both speed and scale um

406
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,600
we have the information out there you

407
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,680
know that it's it's in

408
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,360
all these different networks it's with

409
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,880
companies it's with government

410
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,199
organizations cloud service providers

411
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:06,880
isps etc but we need to get this data

412
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,920
again this anonymized data into the

413
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,760
hands of analysts to really drive

414
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,639
those operations and you may be asking

415
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,079
ourselves well don't we have

416
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:18,720
systems like this in place with say

417
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,600
scissors

418
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,600
automated indicator sharing system or

419
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,760
does crisp

420
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,760
yes however while they can be

421
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,000
or they should be very foundational and

422
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,320
and help to provide early warning across

423
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,079
the system they're just not

424
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:38,480
or at least ace isn't uh to a point

425
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,680
where

426
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,720
they can really do that yet so

427
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,800
they both of those programs need to be

428
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,040
upgraded as far as their technology

429
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,199
and increased in scale so for instance

430
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:51,120
in september of 2020

431
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,320
the inspector general released a report

432
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,800
that noted at least in 2018 only

433
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,720
219 private sector organizations were

434
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,720
members of ais

435
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,600
and those who did participate found that

436
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,800
the information

437
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,240
that they were getting just really

438
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,880
lacked usable context which as you know

439
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,959
is just not you know as helpful as that

440
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:14,880
could be

441
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,320
um the the program itself was

442
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,560
understaffed which really limited

443
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,880
outreach to the private sector and the

444
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,839
whole

445
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,320
um you know where dhs is really seen as

446
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,880
a regulatory agency i think a lot of

447
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,759
organizations are very reticent to

448
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,079
participate that in that and so

449
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:35,040
we need to change some of those policies

450
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,160
and increase some of those

451
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,199
incentives so to get

452
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:42,240
wide wide scale voluntary participation

453
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,279
we think

454
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:45,199
uh a number of things should happen so

455
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:47,040
first

456
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,000
ensuring that anonymization or or

457
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,480
minimization so again stripping out that

458
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,639
information that we don't need that is

459
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,320
personally identifiable or

460
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,480
organizationally identifiable but

461
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,320
stripping that out making that automated

462
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,040
but but even further than that

463
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:07,600
is to put that burden on the solution

464
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,880
so instead of having every single

465
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,440
entity who participates to to have that

466
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,279
as their responsibility it has to be on

467
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,040
the solution

468
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,880
and that's not only from a legal

469
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,560
standpoint but a technological

470
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,880
standpoint too

471
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,680
access controls based on authorities um

472
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,759
applying analytics and indexing this

473
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:28,959
data again to be

474
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:31,519
instantly shareable um and you know

475
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:32,320
maybe it's through

476
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,560
a data lake or maybe it's through the

477
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,560
notional joint collaborative environment

478
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,160
that the cyber solarium commission

479
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,320
recommends either way

480
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,839
but you know to create

481
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:45,680
these analytics on top of the data to

482
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,120
help analysts

483
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,519
um to free them up to do the higher

484
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:50,880
order analysis

485
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,560
and to essentially triage um

486
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,880
and you know couple i mentioned the

487
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,720
legal aspects of the cyber security

488
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,480
information security

489
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,959
or infrastructure security act of 2015

490
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:04,720
you know should be amended to

491
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,240
help facilitate the sharing so again

492
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,319
um taking the minimization burden and

493
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,319
putting it on the solution and really

494
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:13,679
the government

495
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:17,359
to do that and then

496
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:20,160
removing the limited liability clause

497
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,520
that

498
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,400
limits private sector protection so

499
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,559
essentially adding more protection

500
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:28,319
to the private sector entities that

501
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,080
participate on there so it doesn't have

502
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:30,880
to be

503
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,080
just sharing with dhs for instance

504
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,120
um so and ensuring that the incentives

505
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,720
are there the business cases are there

506
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,160
but making it easy for

507
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,600
people to say yes to do this um

508
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,760
so with that i will turn to the next

509
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,799
recommendation

510
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,919
to create a culture shift and again i

511
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:51,520
will read you

512
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,160
another quote um i think from team of

513
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,300
teams it may be from

514
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,880
[Music]

515
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,080
my share of the task but mcchrystal said

516
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,760
that in the world of intelligence

517
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,240
information was power leading people at

518
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,000
each stage to ask themselves a set of

519
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,720
questions

520
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,720
should we pass this intelligence if so

521
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,039
how much will we get in trouble for it

522
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,280
those doubts cost us speed and often

523
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,280
diluted the intelligence making it less

524
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,520
likely to lead to targets

525
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,600
we widely distributed without

526
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,880
preconditions

527
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,880
intelligence that we captured or

528
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,799
analysis that we conducted

529
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:27,039
the actual information shared was

530
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,000
important but more

531
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,840
valuable was the trust built up through

532
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,760
voluntarily sharing with others

533
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,480
and that i think is so key um because as

534
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,760
we've seen

535
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:39,120
the the trust really needs to be built

536
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,080
up between

537
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,799
the public and private sectors um trust

538
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:44,799
as well as again those those structures

539
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:45,840
and policies

540
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,440
so much like the task force in the early

541
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,400
2000s

542
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,080
i think that we need to make a major

543
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,440
cultural shift in

544
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,240
our domestic cyber security posture a

545
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,160
lot of interviewees told us that there's

546
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,880
a big disconnect between the field and

547
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,240
washington dc

548
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,280
so they may ask questions to certain

549
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,799
representatives and it would just take

550
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:08,480
forever because they would have to

551
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,640
root those questions back to dc so

552
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,799
really we have to flip that mindset on

553
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:14,880
its head promote this expeditionary

554
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,840
culture

555
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,559
in which um a lot you know the major

556
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:20,400
activities happen in the field

557
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,559
and dc is the reach back office for the

558
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:24,799
federal government and in fact

559
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:28,240
chris krebs the foreigners as a director

560
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,240
has said the future of says that is in

561
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,280
the field so

562
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,360
along that that line we think this could

563
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,559
really um

564
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:38,160
be an interesting solution

565
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,760
and then to incentivize people

566
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,880
to to buy into that then we recommend

567
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,840
tying the ability to go out into the

568
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,520
field if you will

569
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,320
to promotions bonuses and raises for

570
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,679
instance

571
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:55,039
and then we need to really create a

572
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:56,320
culture in which sharing and

573
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,320
collaboration is the norm and not the

574
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,039
exception

575
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:01,520
and the way to do that is for the

576
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,320
leadership

577
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,400
to set the mission the priorities as

578
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,000
well as the conditions

579
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,159
and the infrastructures technologies etc

580
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:09,679
to do so

581
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:11,760
but also to build that connective tissue

582
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,840
between the nodes and ensure that people

583
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,440
are executing in line with those

584
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,799
missions

585
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:20,400
to help do that um for example

586
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,000
we need to move from say metrics

587
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,440
as measures of effectiveness metrics and

588
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,120
numbers say reporting

589
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,240
reports created to analytic outcomes

590
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:36,000
so in my experience organizations that

591
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,159
mandate a certain number of reports um

592
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:41,919
at that point collaboration and

593
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:43,280
information sharing then

594
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,559
becomes not the goal but an inhibitor

595
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:50,240
to creating those reports so where the

596
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,240
leadership removes those burdens of

597
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,679
production

598
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:56,000
from analysts and instead focus on those

599
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:56,720
hard

600
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,679
analytical outcomes and subsequently

601
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:01,039
operational successes

602
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:02,400
then your personal become more

603
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,720
entrepreneurial and innovative

604
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,840
and most vital to realizing this

605
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,400
is personnel from leadership on down to

606
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:10,880
the

607
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,280
most junior levels everyone has to be

608
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,520
welcome diversity is key

609
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,640
focusing on those people but ensuring

610
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,200
that they're

611
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,600
they're welcomed and they're supported

612
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,840
and really focusing on diversity and

613
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,799
demographics

614
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:27,840
background and experience our fourth

615
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:28,720
recommendation

616
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,400
is to unravel the interagency

617
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,240
in our research we discovered that the

618
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,320
interagency cyber environment was really

619
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,480
characterized by competing equities and

620
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,760
priorities and

621
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,600
up until the creation of the national

622
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,280
cyber director

623
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,000
not one person was really only are able

624
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,480
to unravel that yarn to determine those

625
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,840
priorities and who

626
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:53,200
arbitrates among the interagency um

627
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,880
uh you know the equities the

628
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,039
classification battles and then

629
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,799
as also as they are coordinating with

630
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:01,120
the

631
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,080
private sector so with the creation of

632
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,400
the new national cyber director role

633
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,360
it appears that the deputy national

634
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,039
security advisor for cyber emerging

635
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:12,000
technologies under

636
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,240
and new burger will handle title 10 and

637
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,320
title 50 cyber issues so more on the

638
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,880
offensive side and the ncd

639
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,640
will be responsible for the rest of the

640
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,159
interagency

641
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:23,919
and engagement with the private sector

642
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:26,159
so on the defensive side

643
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:28,799
from a strategic standpoint while in

644
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:30,799
continuous coordination with each other

645
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:33,280
and this distinction is important we

646
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,240
recommend

647
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,360
that the president really

648
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,679
imbue the ncd with that authority to

649
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:41,200
ensure that the director can

650
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,120
determine those priorities and and

651
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,120
hammer out those conflicts because

652
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,679
when congress set this position they

653
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:49,120
really gave the president

654
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,120
some some wiggle room on on how to

655
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,200
actually shape this role so we're really

656
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,400
hoping that the president can really um

657
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,000
give that role the authorities that it

658
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,080
needs on par with

659
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,520
the the counterpart at the nsc so in new

660
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,720
burger

661
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,760
so where andrew berger and chris english

662
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,960
set that strategy

663
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,440
the other agencies and especially cesar

664
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,840
will operationalize it

665
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,480
given the agency's importance and its

666
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,919
relatively small budget

667
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:20,960
and the recent political political i

668
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,120
can't say it politization

669
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,840
we echo the call forces independence

670
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:26,159
from

671
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:28,799
dhs we believe that it would give

672
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:30,559
greater authority

673
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:32,720
bigger budget more operational

674
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,840
flexibility to an

675
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,919
agency that just really needs it right

676
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:37,440
now

677
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,360
we think it could provide greater

678
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,440
flexibility in hiring practices as it

679
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,120
looks to scale up and out

680
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,520
and informally we've heard you know some

681
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,640
frustrations there

682
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,760
so we believe that it would also allow

683
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,000
for

684
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,960
reform of the sector risk management

685
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:53,840
sector risk

686
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,600
management agency construct that i'll

687
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,600
get into in a second

688
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,960
but with sysa as its own freestanding

689
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:01,679
agency

690
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:03,520
we are recommending that it establish

691
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,440
its own intelligence arm

692
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,039
becoming the newest member of the

693
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:08,720
intelligence community

694
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,799
that way the office can work with the

695
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:13,039
different cdx to inform

696
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:16,400
the intelligence collection requirements

697
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,159
and priorities

698
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:19,760
because at this point there's no real

699
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,760
institutional mechanism

700
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:25,279
for um to inform the the

701
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:28,400
collection framework despite

702
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,480
a lot of those threats really focusing

703
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,480
on the homeland

704
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,840
so on the srmas

705
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,480
we think first that ppd21 should be

706
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,559
revised to enhance collaboration and

707
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:41,520
sharing

708
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,320
across all sectors and entities so

709
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,400
transforming the focus from a sectoral

710
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,960
approach to a cross-sectoral

711
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,720
mission focused and collaborative one

712
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,000
and then second

713
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,400
if you could take those missions to

714
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,279
collaborate

715
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:56,799
and share information with the private

716
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:59,039
sector that are currently on each of the

717
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,400
srmas so

718
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,440
think dle think um tsa

719
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,080
for pipelines for instance instead i

720
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:06,880
think you could

721
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,000
transfer those missions to cisa but

722
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,159
really

723
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:14,080
operationalized at the cdx so again at

724
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,840
the cdac level then they would

725
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,960
be the ones taking care of sharing that

726
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,679
information and working with

727
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:24,400
their constituents basically in the

728
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,720
private sector

729
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,880
our final recommendation uh it really

730
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,799
focuses on personnel

731
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:32,720
we often read about the gap between the

732
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,720
number of open jobs and cyber security

733
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,760
and the number of

734
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,240
quote unquote qualified personnel

735
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,640
according to cyberseek there were over

736
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,120
half a million open jobs in the us and

737
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,960
we currently lack the personnel to fill

738
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,000
them

739
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,159
the pipeline is always going to be an

740
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:49,360
issue

741
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,720
there are a lot of people who are

742
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,799
looking to get into this career field

743
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:54,720
they're working towards this employment

744
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,880
but for a variety of reasons they're

745
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,400
they're finding it very difficult to

746
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,760
make that jump and

747
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,400
and one of the biggest reasons and and

748
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,840
there are a lot we won't go into them

749
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,440
right now but one of the biggest reasons

750
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,720
is that a lot of jobs even entry level

751
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,279
jobs

752
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:12,720
want their candidates to have experience

753
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,880
so how can you get experience if you

754
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,919
can't get in

755
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:18,400
and a lot of people are you know even if

756
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,320
they're able to overcome those high

757
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:20,880
costs

758
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,279
of training and certification to make

759
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:24,240
that jump has

760
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,960
has been very prohibitive and so to

761
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,880
bridge that gap we're proposing

762
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,880
a service here in which a person

763
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,360
interested in this field could

764
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,000
say receive training and support for

765
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,400
certification in exchange for at least a

766
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,440
year of service

767
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,640
at one or more of this is a

768
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,720
regional sea docks for instance but

769
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,480
really getting that critical boots on

770
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,080
the ground experience

771
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,159
now this is not the military you're not

772
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:52,000
going to have to get up and do pt you're

773
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
not going to have to deploy overseas

774
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,440
it's just this is your national service

775
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,279
in exchange for training certification

776
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:01,600
you're getting that experience

777
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,520
and then importantly too i think it

778
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,720
would really help to

779
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,600
to fuel civic renewal which is something

780
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,520
i think we desperately need right now

781
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,080
but uh you know to make this happen um

782
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,840
the president actually signed a law

783
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,240
the american rescue plan that included 1

784
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,720
billion dollars for national service

785
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,399
and so we recommend that the white house

786
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:23,200
establish this interagency service corps

787
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,000
um between now dhs but if says it

788
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,679
becomes its own regional

789
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:30,320
um uh freestanding agency then something

790
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,679
like that for instance

791
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:33,279
and and you know eventually maybe

792
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:35,760
include other agencies as well

793
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:39,039
but um in in cooperation with the

794
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:42,240
national community service organizations

795
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,159
to create those opportunities to create

796
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:45,520
those pathways in

797
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,760
because as we know we desperately need

798
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,720
people

799
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,000
and then on the other end of the

800
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,240
spectrum you know to to raise the level

801
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,200
analytic capability across all federal

802
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:55,840
entities

803
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,679
and to get people who are very

804
00:27:57,679 --> 00:27:59,440
interested in cyber but who haven't

805
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,919
really found those pathways over yet

806
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:03,360
to create those opportunities for

807
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,919
analytic exchanges between the agencies

808
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:07,039
but especially between

809
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:11,120
cisa fbi and nsa and so we think that

810
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,640
it would sort of raise the level of

811
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,559
capability it would provide vital

812
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:16,159
experience and training

813
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:18,240
but also build that connective tissue

814
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,240
and that trust across the different

815
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,840
interagency elements so thank you so

816
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:24,480
much for

817
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,640
hanging in with me i know that was a lot

818
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,000
to digest

819
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,120
but i'm really thrilled to be here and i

820
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,039
really look forward to your questions

821
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:34,880
and your comments

822
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:39,600
so thank you very much
