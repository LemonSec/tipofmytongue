00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,280
and mechanic information sharing

176
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,479
mechanisms

177
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,680
are the key ones to obtain a successful

178
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,599
result in many aspects

179
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:54,960
so you know thank you elio uh for your

180
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:55,599
comments

181
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:59,039
much appreciated i i really truly

182
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:01,680
agree with you know with your statement

183
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,240
about

184
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,479
uh you know trust i mean trust is

185
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:05,599
everything when

186
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:07,680
sharing information between countries

187
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,680
and and organizations

188
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,720
so shifting to john felker

189
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,199
at this point uh john would you please

190
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,960
introduce yourself

191
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,919
uh and then i would like to ask a

192
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:21,520
question as well

193
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,400
so information sharing is an important

194
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:24,960
part

195
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,080
of collective defense so

196
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,199
what are some of the effective

197
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,800
ways in your opinion that information is

198
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,319
or should be exchanged i'm john felker

199
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,080
i'm a 30-year coast guard veteran

200
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,240
i've spent the last 10 10 years or so of

201
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,199
my career

202
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,280
focused on intelligence predominantly

203
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,720
signals intelligence

204
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,680
and cyber issues i helped to stand up

205
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,919
the coast guard cryptologic group

206
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,560
and the coast guard cyber command

207
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,160
following my retirement

208
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,080
i worked for hewlett-packard enterprise

209
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,440
services

210
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,000
as a cyber and intelligence strategist

211
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,360
where we were working on

212
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,440
projects to help the us government

213
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,000
improve cyber capabilities

214
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,360
and in 2015 i went back into government

215
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,199
as the director of the national cyber

216
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,199
security and communications integration

217
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:16,080
center

218
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,400
nkick was the clearinghouse of

219
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,960
information sharing and exchange

220
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,440
for the u.s government was also focused

221
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,599
on incident response

222
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,400
and a number of other left of boom

223
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,599
activities

224
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,958
cyber hygiene scanning policy policy and

225
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:35,200
governance guidance and so forth

226
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,039
um and then uh sisa was stood up in

227
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,399
2019 and i became the assistant director

228
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:42,719
of

229
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,120
cisa responsible for integrated

230
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,200
operations

231
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,839
the part of our portfolio included some

232
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:51,680
cyber in the field

233
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,720
physical security chemical inspections

234
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,399
and emergency communications and

235
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,080
continuity of communications

236
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,320
across the nation yeah i think there are

237
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,240
several opportunities for international

238
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,200
partners

239
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,760
to exchange information in many cases in

240
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,600
fact i think in most cases

241
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,120
that sharing of information or

242
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,720
information exchange is done on a

243
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,800
bi-directional basis

244
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,640
it's important to develop trusted

245
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,240
relationships and nurture those

246
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,839
relationships over time

247
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:20,399
to allow for that effective exchange

248
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:21,680
you're not going to share information

249
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,080
with

250
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,560
people that you don't trust and often in

251
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,360
many cases

252
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,680
particularly at a national level

253
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,120
operation centers

254
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,000
will share uh information they'll

255
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,800
establish regular procedures where they

256
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,120
conduct phone calls or email exchanges

257
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,160
just to make sure that those

258
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,519
communications links

259
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,680
are open and those bi-directional

260
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,959
relationships

261
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,279
start building trust even at a watch to

262
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:46,399
watch our analyst

263
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,240
analyst level and when you build the

264
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,160
trust the muscle memory

265
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,000
is in place so that cyber threat

266
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,839
information can be effectively

267
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,040
exchanged in my experience sizza and

268
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,480
brazil

269
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,560
both have shared information

270
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,800
particularly cyber threat information

271
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,200
on a bi-directional basis uh that

272
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,000
effective

273
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,720
uh sharing of information has been uh

274
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,360
effective

275
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,560
but infrequent and uh be my hope that uh

276
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,079
there could be some more information

277
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:16,320
that uh is routinely shared between the

278
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,160
two nations

279
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,640
there are also several multi-level uh

280
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,600
partner organizations such as the iwn

281
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,040
the international watch and warning

282
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:29,680
network iwn was established in 2004

283
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,040
and it fosters international

284
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,079
collaboration on a real-time basis

285
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:36,399
it addresses cyber risk cyber threat

286
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:37,680
fiber vulnerability

287
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,560
across the spectrum of different

288
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,640
national interests

289
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,720
it also provides a mechanism for

290
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,320
participating countries to share

291
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,200
information

292
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,519
and build global situational awareness

293
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,760
on a more frequent and regular basis

294
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,560
and it also helps to establish uh

295
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,760
knowledge of each other

296
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,880
with respect to capability and incident

297
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,160
response

298
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,800
effectiveness i would also suggest

299
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,160
another effective way to share

300
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,000
information is to become a part of an

301
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,920
information sharing and analysis center

302
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,200
if you're in a uh private sector

303
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,399
vertical such as the financial sector

304
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,040
the maritime sector uh oil and natural

305
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,160
gas

306
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,680
electricity water and so forth the isacs

307
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,320
provide a very effective way to share

308
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,279
information

309
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:28,079
in a light group and they do so across

310
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:29,200
national boundaries

311
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,680
i think the the importance that we all

312
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,680
need to remember is that

313
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,440
cyber criminals don't respect any

314
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,360
national boundaries and it's important

315
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,640
for us to

316
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,200
to establish relationships and build on

317
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,320
those relationships

318
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,720
regularly exercise those relationships

319
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,839
so that when

320
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,000
a bad day occurs we can respond

321
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,399
effectively and even before that

322
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,279
we can we can share information to

323
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,480
prevent bad days

324
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,800
from happening i also think that there

325
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,000
are a whole lot of informal

326
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,160
opportunities going to conferences

327
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,680
attending training and so on and so

328
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,200
forth that allow

329
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,320
us to establish relationships at all

330
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,320
levels at senior levels at analyst

331
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,000
analyst levels that watch the watch

332
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,160
levels all those things are important

333
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,079
they cost time they cost money

334
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:16,079
but the establishment of a relationship

335
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:17,760
that allows effective information

336
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,480
exchange

337
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,880
cannot be discounted so eli

338
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,279
we know that brazil has been developing

339
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:26,880
some cyber security

340
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,160
and defense capabilities uh and

341
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,360
what are the main efforts that brazil

342
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,320
has developed

343
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,000
in recent years and that you

344
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,880
consider to be important for increased

345
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,560
cyber security maturity

346
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,600
and how does this contribute to

347
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,120
the critical infrastructure sectors

348
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,760
as i said in recent years several

349
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,680
instruments have been created

350
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,000
to establish guidelines for housing

351
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:56,880
maturity

352
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,279
and cyber security should evolve the

353
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,760
institutional security cabinet which is

354
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,639
the central

355
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,000
agency for policy development at the

356
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,720
national level has developed a series of

357
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,920
regulations

358
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,560
that ranges from the high level

359
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,720
information security management

360
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,920
to more technical standards such as the

361
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:18,880
collection on

362
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,920
preservation of cyber evidences

363
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,880
passing through the secure use of cloud

364
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,839
computing

365
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:28,560
that i have the the personal opportunity

366
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,519
to act as a deputy coordinator

367
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,240
in addition important milestones were

368
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,600
also established

369
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,120
such as the national security policy

370
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,920
which encompasses all actions that the

371
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,519
federal agency

372
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:46,320
agencies must take to protect not only

373
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,839
government

374
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:50,480
but to provide citizens with secure

375
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,920
public service

376
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,000
and the protection of the cyber

377
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,959
components

378
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:58,399
of critical infrastructure actors

379
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,760
adding some aspects

380
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,360
to the national policy on critical

381
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,440
infrastructure that has a more

382
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,959
comprehensive view

383
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:12,240
of the sector finally an important

384
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,160
milestone in the development of

385
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,600
of strategies is the cyber sector

386
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,720
was the liberation of the national cyber

387
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,320
security strategy

388
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,800
this instrument was the result of a

389
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,519
collective

390
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,800
effort between government and society

391
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,760
which after a benchmarking survey among

392
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,120
many nations

393
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,839
and their respective instruments had the

394
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:36,959
participation

395
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,279
of several representatives from many

396
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:40,160
sectors

397
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,040
of the federal government academia and

398
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,399
the private sector

399
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:47,440
and sought to consolidate the necessary

400
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,440
actions to evolve the sector

401
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,639
in next years which involves

402
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:55,440
among many actions the national cybers

403
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,639
incident plan

404
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,839
which max actively participates on

405
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,959
and the development of public policies

406
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:03,839
to promote

407
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:07,199
the sector as well as i can say

408
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:10,399
the development of talents to fulfill

409
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,560
the cyber security gap

410
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,760
that we have here in the country

411
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,800
elliot i agree with you 100 percent

412
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,839
uh there's a a massive gap in

413
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,800
cyber talent especially those those

414
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,760
cyber

415
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,160
professionals that understand cyber

416
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,440
security

417
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,959
and ics or scada iot

418
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:35,360
uh and the ones that actually can see

419
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,560
both sides

420
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,000
right so so there's that kind of gap

421
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,120
and that's why exercises like cyber

422
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,720
guardian and others

423
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,759
can help polish uh

424
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:51,040
those skills and find the right folks

425
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,320
to support brazil and the us

426
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,519
now i have a question for you max

427
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:00,880
so in your case max you act directly as

428
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,839
one of the

429
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:03,920
coordinators of the cyber guardian

430
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,199
exercise

431
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:08,560
which this year is in its third

432
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,839
version i believe so

433
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:15,519
what important results has brazil been

434
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,399
achieving in the context of cyber

435
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:19,360
security

436
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,120
and defense that have a direct impact

437
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,199
on the protection of critical

438
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:26,720
infrastructure

439
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,199
oh good question the subway guard

440
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:30,320
exercises now

441
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,680
is the storage edition this year and

442
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,560
is designed to coordinate and integrate

443
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,480
intelligence environments

444
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,639
covering public and private bodies in

445
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:41,759
brazil

446
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:45,199
verify the effectiveness of procedures

447
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:48,399
apply good cyber practices simulate

448
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:51,120
incident protection process and employ

449
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,440
information share tools

450
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,480
today one of the main tools that we have

451
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,680
encouraged

452
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,920
it's using the context of the

453
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,639
information share during the exercise

454
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,959
is the means people yes malware

455
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:06,880
information share platform

456
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,679
which is used within some companies in

457
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:11,359
the critical infrastructure sector in

458
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:12,319
brazil

459
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,319
even last month the computer side

460
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,839
incident response

461
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:19,280
center of the lucha burger team provide

462
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,799
extensive training

463
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:23,679
worldwide of unless on learning issues

464
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:26,000
and best practice in using the

465
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,440
platform i recommend talking uh

466
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,360
taking a look at the guy's website

467
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,559
website

468
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:36,080
as it has a lot of material available

469
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,919
misp is a threat information share

470
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:39,919
platform that's free

471
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:43,039
an open source software a tool that that

472
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:45,600
collect information for partners

473
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:49,600
their analysis their tools normalized

474
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,120
correlates and enriches the data

475
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,120
allows team and commodities to

476
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,400
collaborate with

477
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,200
security tools automatically protection

478
00:17:59,200 --> 00:17:59,520
and

479
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:03,280
output feeds analysts tools in addition

480
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,360
to using misp within critical

481
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,799
infrastructure sector

482
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:08,559
the cyber defense command maintains

483
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:11,200
close collaboration with some countries

484
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,080
that make up the american cyber

485
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,520
defensive forum

486
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,480
used the miss platform to exchange and

487
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:18,960
share

488
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,160
information the iberoamerica involved

489
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,360
the

490
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,720
countries as portugal

491
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,559
spain yes argentina and other countries

492
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:32,799
it's also import import important to

493
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:34,720
highlight the brazil keeps

494
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,799
in the taipo technological park

495
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:37,840
foundation

496
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,280
a project for a hone in edge ics scada

497
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,200
that today has generates relevant

498
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,360
information on attack signatures

499
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,400
that has helped the taipo hydroelectric

500
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,400
power plant itself in the construction

501
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:50,640
of

502
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,520
more effective security measures and

503
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,559
that also be

504
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:57,360
shared with some other partners the

505
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,080
propose

506
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,799
for the future is the constructor of

507
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:02,160
disability

508
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,280
honest torah of the country as brazil is

00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,160
would like to see

523
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,440
uh and now i have a question for uh

524
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,480
john felker who who can give us you know

525
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,520
help us to you know connect the dots

526
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:51,120
uh in terms of information sharing so uh

527
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,320
john uh what are some of the ways that

528
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:54,880
these

529
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,400
important information sharing

530
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,200
relationships can be built

531
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,960
and fostered there are a lot of ways to

532
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,960
achieve the needed muscle memory that is

533
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,000
so important

534
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,200
to effective information exchange from

535
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,159
watch to watch

536
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:12,240
or analyst to analyst interaction on a

537
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,440
daily basis

538
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,120
whether it's based upon an emerging

539
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,200
threat or simply just to maintain

540
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,559
contacts

541
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,640
it is critical to regularly use the

542
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,400
communication channels that you have in

543
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,360
place

544
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,760
to take it to another level conducting

545
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,480
basic

546
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,039
operational drills utilizing utilizing

547
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,640
players on both sides

548
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,640
of an operational relationship is

549
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,679
critical

550
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:35,600
this this can enhance the flow of

551
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,559
information that's useful for both sides

552
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:40,960
and it also helps strengthen the bonds

553
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,960
of the relationship

554
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,400
one of the best ways to grow

555
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,400
relationships is to conduct a full scale

556
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,360
exercise

557
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,880
with all of the relevant people

558
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,640
including senior leadership

559
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,880
senior leaders need to know what's

560
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,080
expected of them

561
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,240
what's expected of their team and how

562
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,679
they can become

563
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:01,039
more effective in conducting

564
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:02,960
left of boom activities as well as

565
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,320
activities that occur

566
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,200
when there is a cyber incident in place

567
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:07,919
practicing

568
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:10,720
regular response routines whether on the

569
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,600
keyboard

570
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,280
in front of the media or in the

571
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,159
boardroom is critical to the success

572
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:19,679
uh your success in any uh cyber incident

573
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:23,679
thank john for the awesome comment

574
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:26,720
i fully agree with you about

575
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,000
leadership being involved throughout the

576
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,200
process and exercises

577
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,799
and having this understanding that

578
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:40,240
you know they're the leaders and

579
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,039
without their support it's just really

580
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:44,000
really hard for

581
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,960
things to happen at the tactical level

582
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:47,679
so

583
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:49,919
we we need more leaders with that kind

584
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:51,360
of understanding

585
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,240
uh so thank you so much for uh your

586
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,280
comment

587
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:59,440
uh this question is for max and elio

588
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,799
so critical infrastructure

589
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:05,360
and the key resources are important

590
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,240
assets

591
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:10,240
for nations and the more collaborating

592
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,640
to protect them the greater the

593
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,080
resilience

594
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:17,679
in the specific context of information

595
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:18,559
sharing

596
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:21,679
what actions could support greater

597
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:23,039
collaboration

598
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:27,440
among critical infrastructure sector

599
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,280
sectors or even international

600
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,600
collaboration

601
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,440
oh thank you for this question i'm very

602
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,360
glad to talk about this

603
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,440
i believe that actions that brazil and

604
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,360
many countries have been taking

605
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,840
have been achieved great results for the

606
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,760
development of the sector

607
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,760
uh the instrumentation the the

608
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,360
instruments that i mentioned

609
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,440
before the critical infrastructure

610
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,280
policy the national

611
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:55,440
cyber security policy establishes across

612
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,360
many actions to improve the

613
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,000
collaboration between national agents

614
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,720
but but international international

615
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,520
agencies

616
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,799
as well this technical and academic

617
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:09,520
exchange carried out by many brazilian

618
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,480
american and european institutions

619
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,200
as well as joint actions with

620
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,080
development

621
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,880
banks have already presented important

622
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,840
results

623
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,720
uh the national cyber security strategy

624
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,679
for brazil

625
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:26,320
is one of these results that i can say

626
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:26,799
uh

627
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:28,880
another one that i can say from my own

628
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,960
experience is the contact that we are

629
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,200
having with the ois

630
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,919
and in the course of the establishment

631
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:38,000
of our third

632
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,200
we will establish we have the oes and

633
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,760
cert americas an information sharing

634
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,559
channel

635
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:47,760
that uh we think that will be vital to

636
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,880
our success

637
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,039
in protecting the presidency of the

638
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:52,159
republic

639
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:54,320
likewise i had the opportunity to

640
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,600
participate

641
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,480
in the george marshall's george c

642
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,279
marshall

643
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:02,000
center the program named program on

644
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,760
cyber security students

645
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,320
that is leaded by the marine retired

646
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,360
colonel philip

647
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,480
lark it is an american initiative in

648
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,240
conjunction with the germany

649
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,520
government that annually trains hundreds

650
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,799
of professionals

651
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:19,919
at the executive level who go to their

652
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:21,279
nations to develop and

653
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:23,919
improve national instruments and

654
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:26,000
international cooperation on cyber

655
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:26,960
security

656
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,279
this collaboration is essential for

657
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:31,440
increasing the cyber maturity and here

658
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,640
in our nations and establishing

659
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,840
more reliable uh channels of trust

660
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:41,760
to share information uh

661
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,600
especially when it comes to to

662
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,240
consolidate channels to communicate

663
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,520
with critical infrastructure actors but

664
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,159
it also allows an alliance of many

665
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:54,000
actors to join forces

666
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,360
to act again increasingly sophisticated

667
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,080
and present-day cyber threats thank you

668
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,480
very much

669
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,559
oh over the years i have participated

670
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:09,360
in events and training aimed at the at

671
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:09,760
this

672
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:13,039
ics environment one of the things i take

673
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:14,320
serious today is

674
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,960
understanding the environment and

675
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,080
getting closer to

676
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,880
the operation professionals and having a

677
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,360
dialogue close to their speech

678
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,880
and one of the training that cut cuts

679
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,000
my attention the most was the sons one

680
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,760
the ics 505 given by robert emily

681
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:37,360
who is also the founder and ceo of

682
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,720
drago's

683
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,520
company in the sense material itself

684
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,960
will have a chapter

685
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,440
dedicated to to information share threat

686
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,559
intelligence

687
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:48,960
it's clear that the challenge today

688
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:49,679
ahead

689
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:52,159
will be multigrad greater with the

690
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:53,200
development

691
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,039
of the new exploits malware services

692
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:59,200
fragility in the supply chain

693
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,600
vulnerability in the iot environment

694
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,080
among

695
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:06,080
others and if you represent

696
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,120
a particular automation company company

697
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,679
if you are not the target of the time

698
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:15,520
you may suffer from the side effects

699
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,880
and then seeking to increase the capital

700
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:22,720
popularity of an information exchange

701
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,640
and share information will only

702
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,840
contribute

703
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,880
to seek it to be one step ahead of

704
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,400
possible threats in this way i believe

705
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,039
that

706
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:36,240
group cooperation agreements at the

707
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,039
national

708
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:39,679
international level for this type of

709
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:40,799
approach

710
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:43,679
will make all the difference in seeking

711
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:45,200
measures to avoid

712
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,320
possible impacts and compromise mainly

713
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,039
for those focus on critical

714
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:53,120
infrastructure

715
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:56,400
thank you max and and thank you elio

716
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,880
great response i think that you know

717
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,720
this question now will kind of

718
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,760
tie uh everything together

719
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,799
you know obviously brazil is a cyber

720
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:10,159
powerhouse uh in south america

721
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:13,760
and and having this relationship

722
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:17,760
uh between the us and brazil in terms of

723
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,080
information sharing especially when you

724
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:20,799
think about

725
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:24,399
cyber threat intelligence and iocs

726
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:27,440
and and how fast we can

727
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,559
we can exchange this kind of information

728
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:34,080
um you know and how uh

729
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,720
precise the information is you know the

730
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,760
fidelity

731
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:41,440
of all this stuff um all this

732
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,399
must obviously improve with with the

733
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:44,960
proper

734
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,760
leadership in place in the proper

735
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,799
knowledge

736
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:51,919
uh in place but i would like to ask

737
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:55,520
um john felker a question that

738
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,200
like i said i think it's gonna tie these

739
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,720
things so as

740
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,120
uh systems evolve more and more

741
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,159
interaction

742
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:06,720
between i t and ot takes place

743
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,520
that's that's the reality folks so what

744
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,559
are some

745
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:14,039
some things to think about in these

746
00:28:14,039 --> 00:28:17,679
circumstances in particular information

747
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:21,840
exchange between brazil and the us

748
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,720
go john when one device or control

749
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,320
system is compromised

750
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,200
it can impact many others control

751
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,080
systems

752
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,039
are effectively systems of systems that

753
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:34,880
are increasingly more interconnected

754
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,320
with business systems

755
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:39,760
the itot connection there are many many

756
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,559
incidents that occur in control systems

757
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:44,559
probably on a daily basis that just

758
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:46,399
don't break squelch

759
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:48,880
control system cyber incidents affect

760
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,080
all industries

761
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:53,520
manufacturing buildings transportation

762
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,559
electricity water to name a few

763
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:58,320
i think a close review of these cases

764
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,480
would indicate that malicious incidents

765
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,559
make up a significant percentage of

766
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:04,799
control systems cyber incidents

767
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:07,679
in terms of numbers and impacts as i

768
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:09,360
mentioned earlier

769
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,200
sharing incident information between

770
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,279
partners is one way to address these

771
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:14,000
potentially

772
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,440
vulnerable interconnections i think also

773
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,919
that participation in focused ot

774
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:21,440
training

775
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,440
like that provided by says at idaho

776
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,840
falls would be a benefit to many of the

777
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,200
cyber professionals

778
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,480
that have for years focused on i.t

779
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,600
only and they don't understand the itot

780
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,880
connection

781
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,480
and the potential vulnerabilities that

782
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,120
exist as a result of that

783
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,799
i think also using training and

784
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:43,760
exercises to build relationships between

785
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,480
brazilian

786
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,039
and u.s partners in government and in

787
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:48,640
private in the private sector

788
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,120
is critical to effective information

789
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,679
exchange

790
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:57,440
so the ics village uh simulates

791
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,880
ics environments and they really truly

792
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:01,520
unique

793
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:05,120
in what they do uh tom van norman

794
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,000
is the actual uh co-founder of this

795
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:08,880
awesome

796
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:12,399
ics lab and non-profit organization i'm

797
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:12,720
sure

798
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,840
you've seen them at def gone and it's

799
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:16,640
just such an

800
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,760
it's such an amazing village and and the

801
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:22,159
opportunity to learn about ics

802
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:24,480
uh through the ics villages is quite

803
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,520
incredible

804
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:28,799
so i have a question for uh for tom

805
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:32,240
so tom uh would you please tell us

806
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,679
how you envisioned the ics village

807
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:36,559
supporting

808
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:39,679
brazilian and american national security

809
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:42,799
in terms of information sharing please

810
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:45,600
thank you paul ics village's mission is

811
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,679
to provide industrial patrol system

812
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,240
security and awareness through community

813
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,640
engagements and information sharing

814
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,240
by advocating for the sharing of

815
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,760
information between governments

816
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:56,399
companies

817
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:58,559
organizations or among individuals

818
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:00,399
everyone's security posture

819
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:04,080
will be greatly increased however when

820
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,760
information is shared it also has to be

821
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,720
in a format that is

822
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,440
easily understood by the receiving party

823
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,080
this could be

824
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:13,279
education indicators or compromise or

825
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:16,880
iocs tactics tools and procedures or

826
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,159
ttps

827
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:20,720
intel reports and any other relevant

828
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,480
information

829
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,159
if you were an operator of a critical

830
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:25,600
infrastructure asset

831
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,360
and were compromised in the same way

832
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,720
another asset owner

833
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,440
was wouldn't you have liked to known the

834
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:41,360
iocs or ttps ahead of time
