1
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:03,360
hello and welcome

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,640
to the defcon 29 ics village

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,880
where today i'm going to talk about

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,240
crippling the grid

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,559
an examination of dependencies and cyber

6
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:13,519
vulnerabilities

7
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:16,480
just what that means so first who am i

8
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,160
well my name is joe sloick

9
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,800
i'm currently the cti and detections

10
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,720
lead for network security monitoring

11
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,080
company gigamon

12
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,640
previously i performed cyber threat

13
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,800
intelligence research for domain tools

14
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,039
and dragos and prior to that

15
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:32,960
i've held multiple roles in the us

16
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,719
government including at los alamos

17
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,880
national laboratory in the u.s navy

18
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,120
but enough about me what's our agenda

19
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,480
for today

20
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,559
so today we're going to first talk about

21
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:44,079
understanding what the grid

22
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,440
actually means as a concept as

23
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,719
a really a machine

24
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,800
and then with that high level

25
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,000
understanding we'll then

26
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,320
dive into some of the particulars of how

27
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,440
the electric

28
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,840
system actually operates and potential

29
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,840
dependencies and injection points

30
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,080
that could lead to cyber nexus attack

31
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,000
routes in order to cause

32
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,799
disruption and disruption in a way

33
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:10,479
different than what we see with most

34
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:11,920
headline events that have taken place

35
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,520
over the last 10 years

36
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,560
and finally we'll conclude on a more

37
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,799
uplifting note in talking about what is

38
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:21,119
actually required to defend against

39
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,200
attacks of this nature

40
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,840
so first when we talk about the grid we

41
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,119
have to realize that

42
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,200
we're really not talking about one thing

43
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,040
from a north american perspective we're

44
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,119
really talking about several things

45
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,360
within the united states alone we have

46
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,400
the

47
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,200
western texas and eastern interconnects

48
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,000
as well as

49
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
expanding a bit out uh similar

50
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,600
sections covering alaska and quebec so

51
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,200
we really have different sections

52
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,280
different geographic regions

53
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,280
that while not completely independent of

54
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,640
one another

55
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,000
certainly do create segmentation when it

56
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,840
comes to the overall

57
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,840
generation transmission and distribution

58
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,880
of electricity

59
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,280
which actually gets us to another point

60
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,960
that the electric sector is not a

61
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,000
monolithic entity

62
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,878
but really consists of entities spanning

63
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:12,640
several distinct phases

64
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,879
from generation what people typically

65
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,800
think of when they talk about

66
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,239
the production of electricity

67
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:21,680
but that generation has to be

68
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,160
transmitted across substantial distances

69
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,640
in order to reach consumers where final

70
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,640
sort of last mile distribution takes

71
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,680
place

72
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,160
by other entities and these entities can

73
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,280
and often are

74
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,200
uh distinct from one another

75
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,800
representing different companies and

76
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,480
it's important to note that

77
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,800
if we look at historical events and

78
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,599
impacts

79
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,640
we've seen attacks take place at

80
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,840
different phases

81
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,920
of the electric system so the two

82
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,680
ukraine events the first

83
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,560
in 2015 targeted distribution the second

84
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,200
in 2016 targeted transmission

85
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,159
and we're not quite aware of any actual

86
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:59,200
in the wild

87
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,360
impact on generation at least not at

88
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,640
this time

89
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,000
it's not to say it hasn't happened it

90
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
just means that no one's really talked

91
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,920
about it or proven that it is the case

92
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,200
although there certainly have been some

93
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,519
tests like the aurora generator test

94
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,560
that have touched on the subject

95
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,120
but to close this section up there's no

96
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,000
single grid

97
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,840
we have multiple phases of operation

98
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,120
throughout the

99
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,519
process of delivering electricity to end

100
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:24,400
users

101
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,000
and different organizations often

102
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,680
operate at different phases of the

103
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,080
this operation that already gets us a

104
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,159
pretty complex attack surface between

105
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:33,280
different regions different

106
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,879
organizations operating within that

107
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:35,680
region

108
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,519
and how they might interact with one

109
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,360
another but there's a lot more going on

110
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:39,920
than just

111
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,720
this high level view of the electric

112
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,920
system

113
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,680
because but wait there is more

114
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,040
because there are additional system

115
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,959
characteristics that tie into

116
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,280
how the electric system operates as a

117
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,560
system of systems

118
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,040
as one continent-spanning machine so to

119
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:57,680
speak

120
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,480
that gets us into items such as

121
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,319
requirements for generation

122
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,400
the stability of the system in order to

123
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,799
operate and operate in a way that's safe

124
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:08,560
as well as the actual delivery of

125
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,080
services to consumers

126
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,200
we're not going to touch on this last

127
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,400
one that much but it is something to

128
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,360
bear in mind

129
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,680
especially as we see increasing adoption

130
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,600
of things like smart metering

131
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,120
and other uh ways of transmitting more

132
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,040
control and more interaction

133
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,360
all the way to end users that previously

134
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,800
just didn't exist before

135
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,400
that's an entirely different topic that

136
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,479
we can do an entire presentation on

137
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,040
on its own but we'll talk about though

138
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,520
are

139
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,160
generating sources in fuel so while it

140
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,199
would be ideal

141
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,240
that electric generation

142
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,280
was more renewable in uh nature

143
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,320
or even nuclear i would argue primary

144
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,160
ways of generating electricity across

145
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,759
much of the world right now

146
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,800
consist of fossil fuels principally coal

147
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,199
and natural gas and because we're

148
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,479
talking about burning

149
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:59,040
a substance in order to generate steam

150
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,560
that then turns a turbine

151
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,800
we need fuel in order to make this

152
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,919
process work

153
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:06,240
well that's a pretty important

154
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,520
vulnerability

155
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,120
in how these systems work because if you

156
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,800
can somehow cut off or disrupt the

157
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,320
supply of fuel

158
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,560
that can be problematic very quickly so

159
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,240
certainly with coal

160
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,840
we have coal storage yards that could be

161
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,520
quite large and have

162
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,680
maybe several days worth of supply but

163
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,400
natural gas is typically a just-in-time

164
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,440
very low storage at least on-site uh

165
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,759
proposition so a disruption in these

166
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:30,960
sorts of markets can be quite

167
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,840
catastrophic quite quickly

168
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,360
furthermore we have balancing

169
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,800
authorities when it comes to things like

170
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,639
system stability so we already looked at

171
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,039
the grid as consisting of at least three

172
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,039
high-level distinct entities but within

173
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,080
those entities

174
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,120
we have a further set of

175
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,759
responsibilities for balancing

176
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,880
the frequency phase and similar

177
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,000
characteristics as well as

178
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,039
matching the actual uh amount of

179
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:56,319
electricity generated

180
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,800
with demand at any given point in time

181
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,800
uh in order to make sure that the system

182
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,440
functions

183
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,039
electricity has to be consumed

184
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:05,199
essentially as it's created and has to

185
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,319
do so within

186
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:10,000
fairly well-defined uh tolerances in

187
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,840
order to do so safely without damaging

188
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,479
equipment

189
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,000
and that's what these authorities are

190
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,319
set up to do to organize these systems

191
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,120
and make sure that everyone is playing

192
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,120
along the right set of rules

193
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,639
because the thing is is that if we start

194
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,440
getting a unstable or an unmanaged

195
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,000
grid within one of the balance authority

196
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,360
geographies as well as through the

197
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,560
entire interconnect

198
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,560
bad things can happen so for example in

199
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,680
north america

200
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,720
we generate around 60 hertz in terms of

201
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,600
frequency

202
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,880
uh corresponding to you know really just

203
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,759
literally

204
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,160
how a generator is turning and how many

205
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,560
uh revolutions per unit of time

206
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,160
and the thing is is that as we start

207
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,840
getting away from

208
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,840
that frequency even by relatively small

209
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,800
amounts we induce the possibility for

210
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,960
uh either errors in the system but also

211
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,240
set the stage for

212
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,240
outright equipment damage that needs to

213
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,400
be mitigated through various controls

214
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,319
the same applies for things such as the

215
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,880
frequency around which the

216
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,560
we talked about frequency the phase

217
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,080
around which

218
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,080
electric generation takes place and how

219
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,840
this is then communicated throughout the

220
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,319
system

221
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,800
onto transmission and even distribution

222
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,360
levels

223
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,520
with other physical equipment balancing

224
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,199
authorities step in to make sure that

225
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,199
everyone participating in these systems

226
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,120
is doing so in the right fashion and

227
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,800
doing so in a way that

228
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,319
allows the system to function normally

229
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,639
now i've just talked a lot of very very

230
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,160
high level these are complex topics and

231
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,360
we could talk about these

232
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,919
for quite an extended period of time but

233
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,360
you didn't come here to talk about power

234
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,000
engineering

235
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,680
you came here to talk about cyber and we

236
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,120
haven't really touched on cyber at all

237
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,720
just yet but the thing is

238
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,639
is that cyber actually has a role to

239
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:47,919
play in this and it's one that's

240
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:48,720
increasing

241
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,199
and that leads to several risks for

242
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:52,160
example

243
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,879
just recently a few months ago we had

244
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,800
the colonial pipeline ransomware

245
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,680
incident

246
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,000
while that didn't impact all the

247
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,280
electric sector

248
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,720
particularly this was a petroleum

249
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,400
pipeline so we're talking about

250
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,120
vehicle fuel aviation fuel and similar

251
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,520
this does show that pipelines can be

252
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,520
fragile to a certain extent now in this

253
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,560
case the disruption to colonial pipeline

254
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,680
never really resulted in

255
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,479
ransomware-induced shortages

256
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,879
mostly panic buying and quite frankly

257
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,000
human stupidity

258
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,160
produced the impact in this scenario but

259
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,000
it does show that pipelines can be

260
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,599
impacted in ways that have physical

261
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,520
repercussions through something

262
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,840
like relatively indiscriminate

263
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,519
ransomware operations

264
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,599
well what does that mean when we start

265
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,360
talking about natural gas and not

266
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,640
petroleum

267
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,679
natural gas the sort of natural gas

268
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:42,640
revolution

269
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,399
in uh power generation in north america

270
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,560
is astounding you can see in the chart

271
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,000
here that

272
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,720
where natural gas used to be sort of a

273
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,240
lower level contributor

274
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,279
to the electric generation mix of north

275
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:58,000
america

276
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,480
it has rapidly uh grown to become the

277
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,480
number one source of electricity

278
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,200
within the united states and the thing

279
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,560
is is that while that is fueled by

280
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,440
things like the

281
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,320
shale gas boom and other sort of

282
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,080
operations it still requires the

283
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,760
movement of natural gas from its point

284
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,800
of extraction

285
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,640
typically places in texas in the

286
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,519
northern uh midwest and other areas to

287
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,279
get to generating facilities

288
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:24,560
typically typically closer to

289
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,720
populations and as you can see from this

290
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,279
map

291
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,600
there are some pretty interesting choke

292
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,200
points we're starting to look at this as

293
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:31,839
a system

294
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:35,200
so certainly around major uh gas

295
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,120
development regions again like texas and

296
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,040
the gulf coast we see lots and lots of

297
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,080
pipelines and

298
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,839
uh lots of uh reliability or at least

299
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:45,200
fault potential fall

300
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,120
failovers within the system but as we

301
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,320
start getting into areas like the

302
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,680
western united states

303
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,760
the eastern seaboard the florida

304
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,519
peninsula and other areas

305
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,480
start seeing fewer and fewer redundancy

306
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,760
uh within this system

307
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,240
so what if we were able to induce some

308
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,640
sort of disruption to pipeline systems

309
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,360
on the gas sector well the thing is

310
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,800
we've already seen some of these events

311
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,000
take place but

312
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,040
they did so at a fairly small level

313
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,800
so in uh

314
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,040
2019 there was a notice put out by the

315
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,240
united states coast guard of all

316
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:18,959
entities

317
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:20,640
that a relatively small pipeline

318
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,720
facility was impacted through a ryuk

319
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,320
ransomware event that resulted in a

320
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,320
disruption so a very minor event given

321
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,839
the size and scale of the facility

322
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:28,399
involved

323
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,720
but it shows that we can get disruption

324
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,880
of petrochemical including natural gas

325
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,839
infrastructure

326
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,680
through something like ransomware

327
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,480
another item to keep in mind is that

328
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,600
just recently cisa announced or at least

329
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,320
attributed

330
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,160
and made publicly available a report

331
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,640
that it existed for some time

332
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,880
a widespread intrusion campaign from

333
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,120
2011 to 2013

334
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,040
linked to the people's republic of china

335
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,760
that was targeting pipelines at a very

336
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,000
thorough uh very widespread sort of

337
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,240
basis so adversaries are either

338
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,519
sort of unintentionally from the

339
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,440
ransomware perspective or very

340
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,120
deliberately through

341
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,000
very long duration intrusion operations

342
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,480
involving pipelines exploring this field

343
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,680
to what end you may ask well if i can

344
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,240
identify

345
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,040
a critical pipeline or segment maybe not

346
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,560
getting quite down to an individual

347
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,920
compressor station but at least

348
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,200
identifying the

349
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,720
control center that would control

350
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,800
multiple uh compressor stations and

351
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,320
similar infrastructure for a given

352
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,200
pipeline

353
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,839
i could potentially disrupt that control

354
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:31,839
center or similar functionality through

355
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:33,040
a cyber event

356
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,200
and result in a disruption of pipeline

357
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,720
information

358
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,800
operations that would restrict the flow

359
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,800
of gas to follow on generation stations

360
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,240
as well as things like home heating and

361
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:42,880
other

362
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,200
items that could start to create a real

363
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,320
physical impact

364
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,839
now certainly some of these systems are

365
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,760
well segregated and there are defenses

366
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,040
in place but

367
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,639
given the trend line away from

368
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:56,560
very local very hands-on sort of

369
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,000
management of these systems

370
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,600
and instead to having distributed

371
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,279
management from a

372
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,920
single or handful of remote control

373
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:04,639
centers

374
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:07,120
this sort of scenario starts become

375
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:07,920
significantly

376
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,800
more impactful and realistic than it may

377
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,079
have been even just 5 or 10 years ago

378
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:15,200
but in addition to things like

379
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,519
feedstocks we also have stabilization

380
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:18,160
impacts

381
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,720
so these are two examples that took

382
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,279
place

383
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:24,800
in early 2019 ironically both on the

384
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,600
same day

385
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,959
uh in 11th of january of 2019

386
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:31,680
of frequency deviation events one in the

387
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,959
united states the other

388
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:36,160
in the european union in both cases

389
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,240
there were essentially unexplained at

390
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,680
least at the time

391
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,519
significant frequency deviations that

392
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:44,000
resulted in

393
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,839
non-trivial impacts to the overall

394
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,000
electric system

395
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,160
shedding load which means people not

396
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,200
having power

397
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,800
uh taking plants offline in order to

398
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,040
prevent physical damage and other things

399
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,040
while some explanations have emerged for

400
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,279
why these events took place it's still

401
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,120
very strange when you start looking at

402
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,320
either nsoe

403
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,399
or this project from oak ridge national

404
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:05,519
laboratory in the university of

405
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:06,399
tennessee

406
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:07,920
that tracks these sort of anomalous

407
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,760
events that these are quite common but

408
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,720
systems can step

409
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,120
in in order to prevent the worst case

410
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,639
scenarios from developing

411
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:18,240
as a result of these uh grid

412
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,120
wide phenomena that take place so

413
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,560
examples of those sorts of impacts

414
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,079
include just simple operational

415
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:26,079
efficiency as well as wear and tear

416
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:28,079
so having things like protective relays

417
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:29,760
stepping in to

418
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,600
take a system off or put a system back

419
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,680
on when there are significant frequency

420
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,639
deviations

421
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,320
does generate wear and tear on that

422
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,639
equipment when things get a little bit

423
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:39,199
more

424
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,040
dicier and sort of what we saw in the

425
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,320
european example

426
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,959
we can start seeing assets become

427
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:45,839
isolated so

428
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:48,000
removing equipment from the system or

429
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,519
shedding load in such a fashion that

430
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:50,639
consumers

431
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,240
experience a blackout in order to make

432
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,720
sure that the system remains stable

433
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,399
finally we can even get into potential

434
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,560
physical damage scenarios so the aurora

435
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,920
generator test that i

436
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,399
spoke about earlier involved a

437
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:03,440
manipulation

438
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,480
in the electro the uh protective relay

439
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,199
system

440
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:10,800
for a uh generating asset

441
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,560
and by manipulating that in just the

442
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,160
right way so that you re-sync the

443
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,440
generating asset

444
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,519
out of sync to frequency or phase you

445
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,760
can cause it to basically

446
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,320
shutter uh and do that enough times or

447
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:22,880
with a

448
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,959
large enough deviation you can actually

449
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,320
induce physical damage

450
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,160
now we haven't really seen anything like

451
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,360
that take place

452
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,760
uh at least not to a breathtakingly

453
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,199
destructive fashion because there are

454
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:34,160
many systems

455
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,079
that step in in order to prevent these

456
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:38,240
sorts of scenarios from occurring

457
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,160
but it is something that the grid has

458
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,240
been designed around because it's a very

459
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,040
real

460
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,079
risk to equipment well from a cyber

461
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:47,760
perspective though we're starting to see

462
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,760
adversaries become more interested

463
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,880
either incidentally or very deliberately

464
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,360
to the types of systems that step in

465
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,000
from a

466
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,639
balancing and stability uh perspective

467
00:14:58,639 --> 00:14:59,920
when it comes to

468
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,920
electric system operations so for

469
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,920
example within the last two years

470
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,279
really actually just within the last

471
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,120
year this took place last year

472
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,120
there were two events of interest the

473
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,720
first involved in intrusion

474
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,920
at the european entity enso e

475
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,920
which essentially links the transmission

476
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,199
system operators

477
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:19,279
uh on the european continent together to

478
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:20,959
allow for better communication and

479
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:21,519
whatnot

480
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:23,600
so nsoe doesn't really control anything

481
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,120
itself but it's an awfully nice

482
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,600
springboard to getting access to

483
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,279
the tso organizations that are

484
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,040
underneath it to facilitate follow-on

485
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:31,920
targeting

486
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,759
uh not what you would typically expect

487
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:35,920
for an adversary to really go after

488
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,560
for an intelligence value or anything

489
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,920
else and there was no ransomware in this

490
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,399
case

491
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,880
but a very intriguing target for what it

492
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,360
might enable for follow-on operations

493
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,000
around the same time there was also a

494
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,120
ransomware event

495
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,120
that targeted a entity in the united

496
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,560
kingdom called alexa

497
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,399
that's responsible for essentially

498
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,079
market operations

499
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:57,920
to match electric generation with

500
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,600
electricity demand

501
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,839
while it's very debatable that taking

502
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:03,440
down an electron would result in any

503
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,639
actual physical

504
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:07,120
damage to the underlying electric system

505
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,720
it certainly would increase the amount

506
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,360
of friction

507
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,560
in play in trying to operate deregulated

508
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,759
electricity markets

509
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,759
and so we can't quite ignore that either

510
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:17,440
if we go back a little bit further too

511
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,120
and it's not on this slide

512
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,199
we could look at the 2016 ukraine power

513
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:23,279
event as another example of at least

514
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,360
approaching some aspects of this

515
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,480
frequency and stability uh question when

516
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,480
the attack resulted in manipulation and

517
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,680
actually disablement

518
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,199
of the protective relays on the victim

519
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:38,000
power well

520
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,839
transmission station as part of that

521
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:42,079
incident so adversaries are starting to

522
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:44,320
learn that not only are these systems

523
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,720
present uh and represent a sort of soft

524
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,399
underbelly to the overall electric

525
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:49,040
system

526
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,040
but they can also be reached targeted

527
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,279
and potentially even manipulated

528
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,839
through computer network operations and

529
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:57,279
we have examples of this

530
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:59,839
taking place albeit at very low and at

531
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:00,639
least not yet

532
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:02,560
or at least not not known destructive

533
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,079
levels for

534
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,839
over five years if we go back to the

535
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:08,000
2016 ukraine incident

536
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,160
now the possibilities for an adversary

537
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,480
in this sort of grid stability

538
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,760
attack scenario range from denial

539
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,319
walking access to system-wide resources

540
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:19,280
and removing

541
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,319
system-wide safety and other sort of

542
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:23,439
checks that allow for

543
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:27,359
efficient and uh very integrity focused

544
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:30,240
operations of the electric system to

545
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,280
disruption

546
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,679
where we can outright disrupt operations

547
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:34,640
as they shut down

548
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,799
in order to preserve safety in an

549
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:38,559
unstable or

550
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:41,600
uh just uncertain operating environment

551
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,760
uh to outright destruction so like we

552
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,280
talked about with things like the aurora

553
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,640
test and

554
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,480
something like the 2016 ukraine event

555
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,000
there are possibilities to induce

556
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,120
physical damage

557
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,640
this would be really really really

558
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,559
flipping hard to try to actually execute

559
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:55,840
and practice because

560
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,160
it would require not just setting off

561
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,480
the event so to speak by creating the

562
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,559
network-wide instability but also

563
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:04,559
removing protections and other controls

564
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:05,679
that are in line

565
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:08,000
to prevent uh worst-case scenarios from

566
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,760
developing so an adversarial would have

567
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,360
to do a number of things

568
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,640
to make this possible however the

569
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,799
increasingly

570
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:17,360
networked nature of a lot of our grid

571
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,160
operations

572
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,960
systems as well as individual uh

573
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,160
portions of the electric

574
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,039
system as it may exist mean that there

575
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:26,559
are increasing possibilities for

576
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,240
adversaries to reach out and touch

577
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,160
some of these elements so we can't quite

578
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,400
ignore it even if this represents a very

579
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,400
distant right or left tail possibility

580
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,600
compared to some of these other

581
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,679
scenarios

582
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,320
so that's all very concerning and

583
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,640
present some problems but as lenin would

584
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,679
say

585
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:46,480
what is to be done well the first thing

586
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,760
is we have to really

587
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,640
remember and recognize that the grid is

588
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,320
a big complex

589
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,559
project whether we're talking in europe

590
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:55,840
in north america

591
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,880
etc and not only is that you know in the

592
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,160
classic case of like oh there are

593
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,520
actually three grids in the united

594
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,160
states

595
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,080
but also comes to understanding those

596
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,080
dependencies and other items

597
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,720
that allow for the grid to function in

598
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,400
the way that it was designed to

599
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,320
that means that we need to invest in

600
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,919
security visibility

601
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,160
and redundancy across all phases of

602
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,600
operation in order to

603
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,960
really be able to respond to or counter

604
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,000
high-end threats to this environment

605
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,600
part of that means making sure that

606
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,440
we're increasing our visibility to try

607
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,559
and match threats

608
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,400
if we have that increased visibility we

609
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,640
can then have greater assurance of

610
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,039
deploying root cause analysis on any

611
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,640
incidents that may emerge like those

612
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,320
frequency deviation events we talked

613
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,520
about earlier

614
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,320
and by applying this continuous analysis

615
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,440
of our own environment

616
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,760
we could then marry that to continuous

617
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,679
analysis of the threat environment

618
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:50,080
what lessons can we learn from what

619
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,440
adversaries are doing

620
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,520
out in the wild such as the targeting of

621
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,960
entities like nso e

622
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,799
or alexan and pipeline operations etc

623
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,480
based on that understanding fusing

624
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,400
internal and external perspectives

625
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,559
we then adjust defenses in light of that

626
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:06,880
knowledge and ideally begin

627
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,400
sharing that knowledge not just with

628
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,320
others within our sector such as other

629
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,000
power generators or similar

630
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,159
but also sharing data with partners and

631
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:16,080
other entities that make this system

632
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:16,960
function

633
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,159
uh at a massive scale emitting

634
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:23,120
the balancing authorities and omitting

635
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,799
fuel suppliers and transportation

636
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:25,760
functionality

637
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,520
means that we're essentially extending

638
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,440
vulnerabilities out beyond where we can

639
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,280
really control or see them

640
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,600
and allowing for sort of roundabout ways

641
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,799
of impacting

642
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:37,840
electric utility operations

643
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,360
another part of this and since we are at

644
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,880
defcon it's important to

645
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,480
bring this up is that we also need to be

646
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,919
a little bit more creative when it comes

647
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:46,000
to our security testing in red teaming

648
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,240
just saying like oh the bad actors can't

649
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,159
get to our generator controls that we're

650
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:50,880
safe

651
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,280
omits ideas like some of these stability

652
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,240
attacks and other

653
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,480
items where we're looking at attacks

654
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,919
that originate outside of our own

655
00:20:57,919 --> 00:20:58,720
perimeter

656
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,640
how do we identify and test for these

657
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,919
scenarios

658
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:03,840
such that we can identify when controls

659
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,280
exist and what controls need to be

660
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,159
improved

661
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:07,919
as well as for evaluating things like

662
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:09,600
our business continuity and disaster

663
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,799
recovery plans

664
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:12,400
should one of these scenarios manifest

665
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,240
so that service can be restored

666
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,360
in a timely fashion so this is a very

667
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,080
short talk

668
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,080
and we only touched on things at you

669
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,360
know the 10 000 put

670
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,960
foot view i hope this was very

671
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,120
insightful and really identifying that

672
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,360
from a defense of electric utility

673
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,159
operations

674
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:29,840
it's not just about the utilities it's

675
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,600
not even just about transmission

676
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,120
generation and distribution

677
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,559
there's an awful lot that we need to be

678
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:36,559
concerned about and making sure that we

679
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:37,600
have eyes on

680
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,400
so with that i hope that this has been

681
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,120
enlightening

682
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,919
and uh leading to some interesting

683
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:45,600
thoughts about where to go forward

684
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,480
this few resources available on this

685
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,640
topic have also written and presented on

686
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,480
these topics elsewhere so plenty of

687
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,679
other things out there that can be

688
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:54,400
referenced
