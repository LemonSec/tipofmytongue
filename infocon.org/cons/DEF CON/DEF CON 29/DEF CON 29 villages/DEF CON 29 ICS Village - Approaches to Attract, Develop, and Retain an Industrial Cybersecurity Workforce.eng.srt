00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,760
hey this is john ellis from siemens

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:03,600
energy today we're here to talk to you

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,440
about how to attract develop

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,440
and retain an industrial cybersecurity

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,360
workforce and we're excited to present

6
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,759
for ics village at defcon 29.

7
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:16,720
hi i'm julia atkinson and i'm an

8
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,400
industrial cyber alliances program

9
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,080
manager over at siemens energy and

10
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,439
excited to talk to you all today

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,439
so let's talk about the demand for ics

12
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:30,080
and ot

13
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,479
cyber security experts in the field and

14
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,399
right now we're focusing on the energy

15
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:36,320
space in particular

16
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,840
so demand for cyber security

17
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,000
professionals is exploding

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,840
especially in the ot or operating

19
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,800
technology specialty in a recent study

20
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,960
by ics square the organization behind

21
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,559
the cissp

22
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:51,039
researchers found that there were 3.12

23
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,039
million open cybersecurity roles

24
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:53,760
globally

25
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,320
in 2020. in the same study the

26
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,559
organization found that 64 percent of

27
00:00:58,559 --> 00:00:59,600
companies report

28
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,399
significant or slight shortages of

29
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,080
skilled cyber labor

30
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,119
while 56 of companies report extremely

31
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:08,720
or moderately at risk

32
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,159
due to the cyber workforce shortage as

33
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:12,960
it stands

34
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,400
about 90 percent of national ics cyber

35
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,479
security workforce needs went unmet

36
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,080
in 2020 according to cyberseek.org

37
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,840
so what's driving demand for ot cyber

38
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,920
security expertise and why aren't more

39
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,159
individuals moving to ot

40
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,560
first the obvious answer there were few

41
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,799
ot cyber experts to begin with

42
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,960
ot cyber experts have traditionally come

43
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,479
up through the ranks

44
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,560
these individual individuals typically

45
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,079
have a mix of field experience

46
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,920
and on-the-job training that has been

47
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,680
difficult to replicate in academic

48
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,280
settings

49
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,680
the lack of academic options across all

50
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,439
geographies has also limited the growth

51
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,360
of specialists in this field

52
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,280
at our last count there were only five

53
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,360
colleges that provided classes

54
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,000
not degrees but just classes even in ics

55
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
security

56
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,840
from a market perspective there are

57
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,280
several other drivers of increased

58
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,200
demand in lagging supply of skilled

59
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,000
staff

60
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,639
including increased regulation including

61
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,318
the probable use of compliance-driven

62
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,160
cybersecurity investments in the coming

63
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,120
years

64
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,840
workforce changes including retirements

65
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,480
new market

66
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,120
entrants including deeper ot cyber focus

67
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,200
from large consulting companies

68
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,480
and of course a growing number of

69
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,920
connected devices in the ot network

70
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,440
in the next slide we will discuss the

71
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,280
typical skills found in the successful

72
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,200
ot cyber defenders and look at the

73
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,800
ecosystem needed to support the

74
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,720
development of the next generation of

75
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,840
cyber defenders

76
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,160
so let's take a look at this through an

77
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,879
ecosystem and skills based view

78
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,040
traditionally ot cyber security experts

79
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,040
have had a mix of industrial knowledge

80
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,800
relevant to the physical systems they

81
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,319
are defending and cyber security

82
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,239
knowledge especially of the ot networks

83
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,319
they are responsible to protect

84
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,080
individuals with this experience have

85
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,840
also typically gained on-the-job

86
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,840
experience and received mentorship from

87
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,440
the resident experts within their

88
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,800
organizations

89
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,800
some have also gained outside academic

90
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,800
training or attended boot camps

91
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,720
focused on industrial cyber security

92
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,840
topics and instant response

93
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,319
in order to truly scale up the ability

94
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,599
for the industry and governments to

95
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,200
respond to cyber threats

96
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,840
a new approach is needed one that brings

97
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,440
structure to training pathways

98
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,280
and accelerates the development of a new

99
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,000
group of industrial cyber defenders

100
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,760
the gradual development of expertise

101
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,200
over a decade is simply

102
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,920
too long to develop and sustain a stable

103
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,159
ot cybersecurity talent and workforce

104
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:35,120
pipeline

105
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,599
for the industry instead the successful

106
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:38,959
approach would include the development

107
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:40,879
of a program that considers the needs of

108
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,480
various stakeholders

109
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,879
invested in industrial cybersecurity to

110
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,640
better understand

111
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,319
the complex mix of needs in this

112
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,640
ecosystem let's take a look at the

113
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,480
the image on the right there are a few

114
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,400
key groups including diverse talent

115
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,319
academia government and industry

116
00:03:58,319 --> 00:03:59,920
first off let's talk about the talent

117
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,799
themselves so diverse talent pool

118
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,360
really needs to to join have a program

119
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,640
that they can join with friends

120
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,400
something that they can join as a cohort

121
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,159
it's more fun to join something with

122
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:11,519
your friends and it becomes more of a

123
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:12,959
team sport

124
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:14,640
also individuals that go into these

125
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,399
programs they want job relevant

126
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,839
education they don't want to take

127
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,199
classes that they don't need

128
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,639
and they want to be able to use what

129
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,040
they learn they also want

130
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,880
post training placement so they're

131
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,400
looking for a job

132
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,479
after the rotation program or after

133
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,800
their education in this type of program

134
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,280
and finally no one wants a boring job so

135
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,240
we're look

136
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,400
companies that are hiring apprentices or

137
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,560
working through this type of model

138
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,960
will need to develop programs that

139
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,960
really fulfill the needs of an exciting

140
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:43,520
role

141
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,280
mentorship and allowing individuals to

142
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,000
learn on the

143
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,440
on the job for academia

144
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,280
many colleges and universities are

145
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,800
looking for assurance that academic

146
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,639
programs they develop are going to be in

147
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,400
demand and that that demand will be

148
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,680
sustained

149
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,600
to produce graduates that are attractive

150
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,120
to employers

151
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,960
and also they would like to make sure

152
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,039
that they avoid expensive investment

153
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,400
and difficult internal politics

154
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,560
but they'd also like to develop academic

155
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,320
partners also want to develop close

156
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,840
relationships with the employers that

157
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,600
they're working with

158
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,680
from the industry view it's all about

159
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,120
low turnover

160
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,720
having employees with relevant and

161
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,479
cross-trained skills

162
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,639
for organizational resilience and

163
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,720
employees with a mix of technical

164
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,800
and communication skills so soft skills

165
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,240
are absolutely relevant

166
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,000
even in these ot cyber defender roles

167
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,680
additionally industry is looking for a

168
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,919
diverse talent to be able to fill these

169
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,080
roles and actively respond to

170
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,199
the threats from cyber attackers

171
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,199
and finally employers want individuals

172
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,400
that want to grow with the organization

173
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,600
from the government view there are a

174
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,400
couple factors that need to be taken

175
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,759
into account as well

176
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:56,800
governments are looking for a

177
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,960
competitive workforce they want secure

178
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,160
infrastructure

179
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,400
and they want to develop high skill high

180
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,000
pay tax base

181
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,960
while growing the economy in the next

182
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,639
slide we'll talk about a framework based

183
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,919
on the apprenticeship model that

184
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,840
considers the ecosystem needs

185
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,759
while also developing a structured and

186
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,680
accelerated approach to attracting

187
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,000
developing and retaining an industrial

188
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,840
cybersecurity workforce

189
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,400
so putting together the needs of various

190
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,919
ecosystem stakeholders

191
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:31,520
we feel that an apprenticeship model is

192
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,039
one of the best ways to develop

193
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:34,880
in the industrial cybersecurity

194
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,560
workforce of the future

195
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,319
a well-designed program provides

196
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,160
opportunity for participants to learn in

197
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:40,800
the classroom

198
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,440
as well as from their employers mentors

199
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,199
and community

200
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,120
when designing this framework we first

201
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,560
looked at the needs for in-class

202
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,199
training

203
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,360
what we found is that the ideal program

204
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,199
combines a mix of mechanical

205
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,000
electrical and computer engineering with

206
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,639
a heaping dose of cyber security topics

207
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:00,720
the specific make of the program should

208
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,880
mirror or provide flexibility to align

209
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,560
the learning outcomes to the specific

210
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,680
types of systems

211
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,280
that the participant is likely to

212
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,280
encounter in their day job

213
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,960
anyone that has undertaken a project

214
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,319
like this in the past will know that

215
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,160
designing an academic program like this

216
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,560
is hard and challenges can arise from

217
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,080
getting different departments such as

218
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,840
engineering and computer science

219
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,720
to talk to each other among other issues

220
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,880
a basic understanding of ics ot

221
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,240
industrial cyber security can be

222
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,080
delivered as part of a two-year academic

223
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:28,560
program

224
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,039
stretched over four years as part of the

225
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:32,319
apprenticeship program

226
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,800
education is paid for by the employer in

227
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,880
this model

228
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,479
next let's look at the on-the-job

229
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,080
training part of the program

230
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,360
participants in an apprenticeship

231
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,759
program enjoy the opportunity to learn a

232
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:44,319
program

233
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,240
to earn a progressive paycheck that

234
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,840
grows as they learn through the duration

235
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,280
of the program

236
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,039
typically on-the-job training provided

237
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,240
through an apprenticeship program

238
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,759
includes access to a mentor

239
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,440
and rotations through three to four

240
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,240
roles for industrial cyber security and

241
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,039
here at siemens

242
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:01,199
we recommend the first rotation to

243
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,039
include industrial control system

244
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:03,759
installation

245
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,000
upgrade experience followed by back

246
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,160
office rotations and analysis

247
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,840
threat intelligence parsing and threat

248
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,000
hunting

249
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,080
apprenticeship programs should also have

250
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,160
defined milestones along the way

251
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,680
this could include the completion of

252
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,599
certain training activities

253
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,759
skills trained and practiced and

254
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,080
measured or rotations completed

255
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,919
there is a lot of opportunity to gamify

256
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:27,120
the process as well

257
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,160
with challenge coins or anything else

258
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,919
as with many targets they should be

259
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:33,200
specific measurable

260
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,559
attainable and realistic the time boxing

261
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:36,799
is

262
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:39,519
is up to you in your design finally the

263
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,360
apprenticeship program should focus on

264
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,519
building up a community and culture

265
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,519
apprentices are employees from the start

266
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,040
and should be included in the team

267
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,120
part of team activities and supported by

268
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,160
the group in general

269
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,600
while learning and beyond community and

270
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,040
culture are also important to make sure

271
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,560
that apprentices are learning a shared

272
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,440
vocabulary

273
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,200
working from similar playbooks and

274
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,440
ultimately able to work as a team to

275
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,240
respond to cyber threats

276
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,640
this includes getting familiarity with

277
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,399
the organization's

278
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,880
policies procedures and guidelines and

279
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,959
being well trained on these

280
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,560
ahead of the end of their rotational

281
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,200
program in the next section we'll cover

282
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,040
some of the benefits of apprenticeships

283
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,480
and walk through some of the outcomes

284
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,320
from similar programs in the past

285
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,519
so why should employers choose an

286
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:29,600
apprenticeship model versus any other

287
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,519
workforce development model well

288
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,200
research shows that for every dollar

289
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,200
invested no other workforce training

290
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,240
method is as impactful as apprenticeship

291
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,320
applying this model to cyber security

292
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,320
allows companies to leverage a proven

293
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,240
model with decades of success in

294
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,120
professions

295
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,320
like carpentry employers can build a new

296
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,120
talent pool

297
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,440
by tapping into diverse networks of

298
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,279
early career professionals

299
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:56,080
as well as career switchers and once

300
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,440
this talent pool is built

301
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,240
oppress apprentices are also much more

302
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,079
likely to stay with the company

303
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,560
versus new hires off the street

304
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,800
apprentices develop a deep understanding

305
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,560
of the company through rotation

306
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,959
and mentorship and their retention rate

307
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:11,680
is over

308
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,040
90 percent one year after graduation

309
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,720
additionally according to many case

310
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,079
studies apprentices

311
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:20,079
also have a higher productivity and

312
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:21,120
capacity

313
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,880
than new hires though creating an entire

314
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,320
program from scratch

315
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,120
could seem daunting for any company a

316
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,279
consortium apprenticeship model

317
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:32,959
where multiple companies can band

318
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:35,120
together to pool demand

319
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,120
would allow for shared costs on things

320
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,560
like program design

321
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,880
training equipment as well as hiring

322
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,160
outreach

323
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,200
overall the investment is well worth it

324
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,279
without a stable pipeline of cyber

325
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,760
experts to fill the rising number

326
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,240
of open cyber positions companies are

327
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,440
not going to be able

328
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,040
to grow and to meet rising demand

329
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,880
speaking of funding on the next slide

330
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,120
i'll get into some funding opportunities

331
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,079
that are available to companies

332
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,240
many states already have incentives in

333
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,680
place to help companies stand up

334
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,120
apprenticeship programs

335
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,000
things like tuition reimbursement may be

336
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,160
available for a portion of tuition

337
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,959
as well as various state and federal tax

338
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:18,640
incentives

339
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,640
additionally when it comes to justifying

340
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,640
the investment internally

341
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,560
statistics show that the return on

342
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,560
investment for every one dollar

343
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,200
spent on any on an apprentice is nearly

344
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,640
a dollar forty six

345
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,800
this is more than any other workforce

346
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,880
training program

347
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,200
the internal rate of return versus a

348
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,399
direct hire

349
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:41,519
is nearly eight percent higher the

350
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:42,720
initial investment in

351
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,360
education and on-the-job training pays

352
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:45,760
off

353
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,720
as i mentioned previously in retention

354
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,480
so even after three years

355
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,399
not just one but three years after

356
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,639
graduation nearly 90

357
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:56,880
of apprentices are still with the hiring

358
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,880
company

359
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,200
so what's next if you're looking to put

360
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,560
together an apprenticeship

361
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,040
program

362
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,040
we can move to the thanks so we believe

363
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,720
that the whole industry benefits from

364
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,760
building up

365
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,959
the ics ot cyber talent pipeline as we

366
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:17,279
know

367
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,839
many of these job positions are just

368
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,839
sitting open right now

369
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:23,839
