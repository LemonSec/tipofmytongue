jen

so you know we've heard a lot about ran

84
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,560
somewhere in the last few weeks and

85
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,599
months we've seen

86
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,160
uh the attack on the colonial pipeline

87
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,160
we've seen the attack on cassaya

88
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,160
we've seen a variety of things jbs the

89
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,239
meatpacker um and we've seen the buy

90
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,080
demonstration do a number of big things

91
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,160
in including two now executive orders in

92
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,000
a row talk to us about what those

93
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,440
executive orders do

94
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,640
you know you're a lawyer or maybe a

95
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,640
recovering lawyer at some point um

96
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,840
talk about whether those executive

97
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,280
orders are gonna be are going to be

98
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,319
effective at

99
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:51,680
helping protect the nation from

100
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,360
ransomware and if they're not

101
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,200
uh what what are they doing that's

102
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,920
helpful and what more needs to be done

103
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,599
yeah great question and and thanks for

104
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,680
having me and also thanks to ics for

105
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,200
having us this is a great panel

106
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,879
um so yeah i think what's interesting is

107
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:07,920
that we're seeing

108
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,040
a lot of leaning into the situation um

109
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,959
from from that level and that is very

110
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,640
very different than what we've

111
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,040
seen in the past um i know in the past

112
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,000
we've looked at

113
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,760
things in a task force manner here we're

114
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,440
seeing dhs actually

115
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,200
kind of pushing through in a manner of

116
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,200
sprints and these sprints are really

117
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,239
meant to address

118
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,720
issues that are topical um they're not

119
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,239
going to kind of get to the bottom of

120
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:31,519
every issue but they're

121
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:33,519
forcing the industry to look at things

122
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:34,959
kind of in a cadence

123
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,440
um recently we've seen the ransomware

124
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,640
sprint that came out

125
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,360
um that was april and may but right now

126
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,799
i think we're in the industrial control

127
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:43,519
systems

128
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:45,440
sprint and that is a very critical one

129
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,360
because as we saw with the colonial

130
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,319
pipeline

131
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:51,760
um it is very important that we protect

132
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,040
the country against like

133
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,280
any sort of infrastructure being shut

134
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,040
down and that's where i think you know

135
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,480
this panel has

136
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,400
some great topics ahead of it because

137
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,159
we're looking at how

138
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,680
it's that it's a public private

139
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,599
collaboration i think that is very novel

140
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:06,720
in this approach

141
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,640
um as somebody who's kind of practiced

142
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,080
in both areas i think it's

143
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,480
really heartening to see that that sense

144
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,319
of collaboration it's always been there

145
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:16,959
right i i with law enforcement you know

146
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,238
there's kind of the sense of kind of

147
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,399
poking around to see who's friendly

148
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,320
now i think what these executive orders

149
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,080
are doing is basically saying

150
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,800
start talking right and so with this

151
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,160
sense that xero trust

152
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,080
is going to be the overarching like

153
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,800
theme of private and public sector

154
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,960
um and with some definitive controls

155
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,240
around trying to

156
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,720
require two factor or multi-factor

157
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,000
authentication

158
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,040
um trying to segment out networks there

159
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:43,680
is

160
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,240
that both both private and public sector

161
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,759
are meant to get better

162
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,360
with this approach and it's kind of fun

163
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,280
to watch yeah

164
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,040
so david you know you've you've been

165
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,639
doing some stuff operationally

166
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,400
right uh back in the past in your time

167
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,639
at uh at uh rapid seven

168
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,039
um and blue voyage talk to us about some

169
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:02,720
of these uh some of the sort of the the

170
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,360
operations

171
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,400
we should be thinking about in the

172
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,400
context of what's happened with colonial

173
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,000
pipeline what happened with jbs

174
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,600
what happened with cassaya right and

175
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,120
then these executive orders and sort of

176
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:11,520
you know

177
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,199
uh jen's obviously told us about about

178
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,639
the fact that we're looking

179
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:15,600
at at least the government's gonna move

180
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,600
to zero trust i think the the planet is

181
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,120
talking about moving to zero trust

182
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,280
right is that the answer is that is that

183
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,479
the solution right

184
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,320
is it one of the pieces of it is or are

185
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,080
we heading the right direction and and

186
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,919
and if so great and and how can we do

187
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:29,759
more if not what would you be doing

188
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,840
uh from an operational perspective if if

189
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,600
you were running the show today

190
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,960
well first i think you know one of the

191
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,400
challenges we have to step back and

192
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:36,960
realize

193
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,759
is that you know we we've accrued due to

194
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,080
20 plus years of technical debt in

195
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,120
time on the internet and you know i

196
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,800
haven't seen anything from the private

197
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,400
sector or public sector that's going to

198
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:48,880
uh

199
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,240
pay down that debt overnight and so i

200
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,759
think yeah the first acknowledgement is

201
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:52,400
that we're

202
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,160
we're working from a deprecated position

203
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,160
and um and i think what's been

204
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:56,639
challenging

205
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,240
ransomware is i think we've we've always

206
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,160
thought about uh you know critical

207
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,039
infrastructure

208
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:03,120
as you know from from state sponsored

209
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,800
actors of you know what happened if

210
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,000
there were you know a

211
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,400
uh a combination of cyber kinetic action

212
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,039
where

213
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:11,280
uh you know the a a state actor wanted

214
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,240
to disrupt our

215
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,319
uh either as part of a an overall

216
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,160
catacore or for economical reasons

217
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,440
disrupt our infrastructure

218
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,039
we didn't really think about the uh the

219
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:20,720
financially motivated actors and

220
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,080
and the components that come with that

221
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,919
so i think you know the the

222
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:25,840
the difference between the state actors

223
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,759
and the financial motivated actors these

224
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:28,479
the financial

225
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:29,759
actors a lot of the basic blocking and

226
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,520
tackling stuff you know

227
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,800
does start to make a difference that

228
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,400
does raise the bar so you know

229
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,319
segmentation two-factor authentication

230
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:39,840
um you know i i i i do think you know

231
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,520
there there is some degree of hygiene

232
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,280
that we either have to figure out how to

233
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,120
uh how to motivate and whether that's

234
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,319
motivation through

235
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,639
you know i think we too often follow the

236
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,400
regulatory stick of like well someone

237
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,759
should get a rule that you must do these

238
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:52,319
things

239
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,039
uh perhaps there's other ways to uh to

240
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:55,520
drive

241
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,560
um the carrot uh to motivate folks or or

242
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,840
you know one of the things hopefully

243
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,759
chat about later is i'm kind of

244
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,199
i'm bullish that the insurance industry

245
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:04,880
can have a role in helping us fix things

246
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,160
here because if you

247
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,440
if you don't hit a base level of

248
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,360
capability you know if if you're

249
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,639
if your stairs you're building aren't

250
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,479
safe you can't get insurance and there's

251
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:13,680
no point where

252
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,840
where that comes so i do think on the

253
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,120
operational side we have some

254
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,479
some basic block contact when you get

255
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,319
done and whether that's you know uh

256
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,800
not you know not exposing you know not

257
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,240
running five-year-old you know

258
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,759
versions of microsoft exchange that have

259
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,599
been out of maintenance for five years

260
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:29,280
uh or uh you know two effect

261
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,720
authentication you know

262
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,720
network segmentation some basic data

263
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,319
security i think those will go a long

264
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:34,880
way

265
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,319
but i think we have to acknowledge that

266
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,720
um there's you know this tech debt is

267
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,720
is built up that uh we're we're not

268
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,319
gonna paint on overnight and

269
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,560
how do we motivate folks to do that and

270
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,599
you know get either

271
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,360
get the right solutions in place or you

272
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,960
know spend a lot of time

273
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,639
running uh security operation centers

274
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,560
serving small medium-sized clients

275
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,080
at least get them to a point where they

276
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,759
can detect and respond uh

277
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:58,000
in a faster period that's again given

278
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,680
what's out there that's not a uh

279
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,080
simple solution overnight but uh like to

280
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,120
like you know

281
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,560
like just i think we've got some good

282
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,680
things making progress some of the

283
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,960
recommendations

284
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,120
so ernie you know it's crazy uh both jen

285
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,039
and david have talked about two-factor i

286
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:12,479
think or multi-factor authentication as

287
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,000
being sort of one of the things that

288
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,199
that's being pushed now it's kind of

289
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,280
crazy that you know we're here we are in

290
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,400
2021

291
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,199
and we're still talking about

292
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,800
multi-factor authentication it strikes

293
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,560
me as as nutty but you have a

294
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,240
unique perspective right at forge point

295
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,240
capital and full disclosure forged

296
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,840
capital is an investor and a company

297
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,680
that i work for iron at cyber security

298
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,080
um but uh but at fortnight capital you

299
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,159
you help run one of the largest

300
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,000
uh or the largest cyber security

301
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,679
specific fund uh in the gl

302
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,679
in the world uh talk to us about you so

303
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,120
you're looking across

304
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,799
all these sort of all these potential

305
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,560
investments talk about what the right

306
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,240
plays are right now like what is the

307
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,000
what are the game-changing plays that

308
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,720
you all see uh in cyber security

309
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,279
what are the what are the sort of the um

310
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:54,080
the hot

311
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,920
ideas out there zero trust is one that's

312
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,120
obviously that we've already talked

313
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:57,519
about

314
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,279
briefly um that we mentioned tell us if

315
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:00,640
there's some some ideas that you're

316
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,320
looking you're looking in that space

317
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,160
um you know obviously iron it does

318
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,360
collect a defense right that's an

319
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,160
interesting idea

320
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,080
what's what are the hot ideas in your

321
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,320
mind out out in the outcry as you look

322
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:10,959
across

323
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:12,560
the spectrum when it comes to grappling

324
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,080
at this sort of ransomware

325
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,519
and a related question given your

326
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,200
experience at diu

327
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,519
and bringing that to bear forge point is

328
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,760
there is ransomware sort of a unique

329
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,800
thing that we need to be focused on

330
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,760
specifically

331
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,760
or is it just a component of this larger

332
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,120
trend of malware

333
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,560
coming from both nation state and

334
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,720
non-nation state actors

335
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,519
yeah no great great question um to

336
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,120
answer your second question

337
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,080
it's it's uh it's just a continual

338
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,279
evolution of

339
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,839
of malware and uh from an investing

340
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,320
standpoint we we kind of look at it

341
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,560
from you know think of it as continuous

342
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,839
attack surface

343
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:50,880
uh testing as well as extended

344
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,600
xdr extended defensive response and we

345
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,399
look at

346
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:57,120
it from an investment standpoint network

347
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,680
so how do we restrict lateral movement

348
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,399
so you mentioned rnf but there's there's

349
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:03,519
the network piece

350
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,680
there's an email protection piece

351
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,079
there's dop hopefully next gen dlp is

352
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:09,360
what we're looking at

353
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,279
not the dlp that service one percent of

354
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:12,399
the market

355
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,959
uh threat intel on the endpoint side

356
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:17,040
obviously you have the edr players

357
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,959
right did the cried strap crowd strikes

358
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,040
out there you also have smaller company

359
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,240
you mentioned huntress early i'm on the

360
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,440
board hunters

361
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,959
they do mdr for the smb the smp smb

362
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,360
is uh has been a right target for

363
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,120
ransomware because

364
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,279
they have msps who are their i.t service

365
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:34,160
providers

366
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,000
they don't have the sophistication the

367
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,920
cyber talent nor the budget so how do we

368
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,200
defend them

369
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,519
how do we leverage dissection privilege

370
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:42,880
access management

371
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,680
right and then moving left app security

372
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,560
testing

373
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,959
so everything from traditional sas to

374
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:49,680
sca

375
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,880
to dast uh fuzzing you name it

376
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,399
and then the other piece is identity

377
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,000
we've made a lot of investments in

378
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,680
identity

379
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,000
as i'm sure david and jen can attest to

380
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,519
its identity

381
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,360
there's a lot of debt there there's a

382
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,959
lot of legacy

383
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:07,279
so how do we you know start thinking

384
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:08,079
about

385
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:10,880
uh monitoring entitlements how do we

386
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,399
manage identities

387
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,200
across multi-cloud uh how do we

388
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,560
potentially use passwordless

389
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,000
authentication

390
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,800
uh identity proofing and then obviously

391
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,079
mfa should be

392
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:23,920
table stakes so that's kind of how we're

393
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,000
looking there's no silver bullet

394
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,480
it's this composite solution which will

395
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,560
hopefully get your cyber hygiene up

396
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,279
yeah yeah so so jen uh one of the issues

397
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:34,800
that's come up in this conversation is

398
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,320
this just cyber hygiene right and the

399
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,120
need to sort of

400
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,640
get better at the basics right we've all

401
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,920
talked about that for a long time the

402
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,399
need to

403
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,000
just sort of get that bottom level

404
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,680
protection up so that

405
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,120
you're making the attackers work that

406
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,040
much harder right and one of the ideas

407
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:47,519
that

408
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:48,800
that david put on the table was this

409
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,639
idea of insurance right that somehow

410
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,639
insurance might be able to help us raise

411
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,240
the bar on cyber security

412
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,920
right a lot of people you know in

413
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,680
washington dc uh or

414
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,880
where i think at least a couple a couple

415
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,480
of us live david i know lives down the

416
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,120
street from me

417
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,200
um in the washington dc metro area um

418
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,680
you know in in dc a lot of the talk is

419
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,839
you know regulate right or as david put

420
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:09,040
you know put on the table you know that

421
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,240
we need some sort of government

422
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,760
intervention right or maybe

423
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,600
you know if we just pass enough laws or

424
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,000
we get the ftc or the fcc involved

425
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
uh it'll solve everything right but this

426
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,440
idea of insurance i think is interesting

427
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:19,920
to me

428
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,200
do you do you have a sense of how

429
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,720
insurance like might sort of come to

430
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,120
bear

431
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,639
on this problem um and and in particular

432
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,240
can assure us help can insurance help us

433
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,399
get better at the cyber hygiene piece

434
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,959
and can it do more than that yeah i

435
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:36,160
think so i think so i mean

436
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,760
david and i don't have any skin in the

437
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,959
game but this is something we've

438
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,959
observed over time but i mean just like

439
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:42,639
just like getting good drivers out on

440
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,480
the roads right like there's a concept

441
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,079
that you've got to have a vehicle that

442
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:47,360
meets a certain standard

443
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,720
and a driver that set a certain

444
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,560
competency like that that is who you

445
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,240
will ensure to drive

446
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,399
same same with the insurance industry as

447
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,839
it relates to companies right like

448
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:56,240
they've

449
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,079
that you've got people sitting on data

450
00:12:58,079 --> 00:12:59,760
that doesn't belong to them

451
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,120
and so how are they going to be the

452
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,120
responsible stewards of that data

453
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,560
right how are they going to ensure that

454
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,959
at these smbs who have a hard time you

455
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:08,320
know scaling up

456
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,920
have the appropriate security measures

457
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,200
in place i think it's all about

458
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,600
standardization and compliance

459
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,200
those insurance companies can push

460
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,279
requirements down on companies

461
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,760
to get them compliant in a way that the

462
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,279
government won't be able to

463
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,279
right it's a matter of doing business

464
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,040
and so i i think

465
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,639
you know we've seen some insurance

466
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:27,920
companies who are kind of pushing

467
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,600
towards that but that standardization i

468
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,880
think will come

469
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,880
from that from that lateral movement

470
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,639
into industries because they need

471
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,639
insurance no company is going to operate

472
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,120
you know without that and so to get that

473
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,000
you're going to have to

474
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,560
level up and i think that leveling up is

475
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,320
is what a lot of us are here to talk

476
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,440
about today which is

477
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,199
yeah it's more than just you know those

478
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:49,600
those few things it's so many things we

479
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,320
can't even

480
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,880
describe them all but uh i mean even

481
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,800
even like the cloud migration

482
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,120
i mean i mean we talk about you know at

483
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,800
nissa's we talk about the fact that like

484
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,079
if the cia can get

485
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:01,440
you know everything up in the cloud

486
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,399
right and they're classified stuff

487
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,160
right it's pretty amazing yeah they had

488
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,839
a hard time so like so so

489
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:09,519
i think it's just a matter of shifting

490
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:11,440
the mindset around some of that stuff

491
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,199
and a lot of that is going to be kind of

492
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:14,560
pushed down again

493
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,920
maybe it's maybe it's partially

494
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,000
legislation maybe it's partially from

495
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,839
you know the folks who help businesses

496
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:21,440
run like insurance companies

497
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,040
but i think it's a i think it's a team

498
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,600
sport yeah so ernie from an investing

499
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,240
perspective

500
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,160
yeah sorry david do you have something

501
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,519
i'm sorry go ahead go ahead

502
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,920
that was me oh yeah mr ernie so from a

503
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,120
you know from uh from an investing

504
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,560
perspective how do you see

505
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,880
sort of one the insurance marketplace um

506
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,240
and that and that driving

507
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,240
cyber security how do you see actually

508
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,680
the venture investing space or one of

509
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,959
the things i've always wondered about is

510
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,320
how the venture investors aren't saying

511
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,320
to their companies hey look you need to

512
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,920
protect your own assets literally all

513
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:48,880
we're investing in

514
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,040
is your ip if that's not well defended

515
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,800
you know we're sol

516
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,560
right help me understand sort of you

517
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,079
know what's the right players

518
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:57,760
are the plays of the insurance space are

519
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,279
there plays in the in the investing

520
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:00,160
space and and

521
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,880
and if yes or no to those do we need

522
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,880
legislation do we need

523
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,560
regulation like what if you know sit

524
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,839
down in silicon valley i know the

525
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:08,880
general view is

526
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,880
you know government can stay out there

527
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,000
that's great and i think that's

528
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,199
generally been how it's how it's

529
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:13,760
happened

530
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,959
but there is a push now for the

531
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:16,079
government to get more involved in

532
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:17,199
what's happening in the valley

533
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:18,480
how do you see that and then what's your

534
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,560
sense of it yeah

535
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,519
you know we're seeing um a lot of cyber

536
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,680
security mgas so

537
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,639
managing general age agents uh you have

538
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:30,480
the coalitions out there

539
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,519
at bay resilience insurance and their

540
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:35,120
models are all a little different some

541
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,320
are approaching

542
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,040
the s and the smb some are doing upper

543
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,240
mid market

544
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,240
uh but what they're all doing in

545
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,240
different different levels is

546
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,880
doing security scans before they write a

547
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,839
policy

548
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:50,399
and during the course of the policy some

549
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,399
are looking at hey how do we do

550
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:55,839
difr on the back end how do we

551
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:57,279
keep the hygiene up because at the end

552
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:59,199
of the day in the cyber business

553
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:01,360
it's about your loss ratio so if they

554
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,360
could keep the loss ratio down it's more

555
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,959
advantageous to them

556
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:08,000
and then it becomes this kind of um

557
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,759
you know ooda loop if you will with the

558
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:11,279
customer

559
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,120
um they're right they're writing more

560
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,040
premiums the loss ratio is less

561
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,120
cyber hygiene's going up especially in

562
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,320
the smb

563
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,639
uh and you know everyone's everyone's

564
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:21,519
happy uh

565
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:24,639
theoretically um so i i think that's a

566
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:27,360
great first step it's very early days

567
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,880
in that industry but there's a lot i

568
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,160
mean look at the amount of funding

569
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,360
that's going in

570
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,000
uh i think appa just just announced 185

571
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
million round yesterday or today

572
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,639
so it's uh as far as the government

573
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:39,839
coming in

574
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:41,440
i think the government should get their

575
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,199
their own house in order first

576
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:45,680
right uh like you know quite frankly and

577
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,079
you know follow the executive order

578
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:51,120
obviously with jen easterly at cesa

579
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,800
right uh in new burger and in the white

580
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,639
house like there's some really a

581
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:57,839
players uh and um at the end of the day

582
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:59,839
it's shared responsibility so

583
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:01,519
let's get our own houses order and then

584
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:03,040
share information

585
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,520
uh which uh you know i'm sure you you've

586
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,559
lived that

587
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,599
um that hardship right because the

588
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:10,959
government never wants to share they

589
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:12,720
don't take any information you give

590
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,199
it's hard for them to share right right

591
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:15,919
yeah

592
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:19,199
yeah i'm a huge fan of you know the

593
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:20,880
coalition and resilience and those

594
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,160
models that you know the

595
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,199
the cyber insurers being more um uh both

596
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:26,319
more data driven

597
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,799
and more uh you know and providing

598
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:29,679
frankly you know

599
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:31,440
in some ways light managed services on

600
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,200
their clients behalf

601
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,440
really raises the bar and and and yeah i

602
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,640
think it's it's not just

603
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,679
in the fact that of the insured i think

604
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:40,240
you know

605
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,799
what what i'm hopeful for is that they

606
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:44,799
have the ability to bring people who are

607
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,480
not currently insurable

608
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,960
into the market uh which is a you know a

609
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,640
huge change in our

610
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,799
in our base cyber hygiene and so that

611
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:53,840
that uh

612
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,760
that you know finding ways to help

613
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,039
people get insurable

614
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:59,200
is a uh is a big deal well you know

615
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,799
david on that point you know one of the

616
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:02,320
things that governments have done when

617
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,200
we're talking about you know car

618
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,400
insurance and the like is they sort of

619
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,440
require

620
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,640
insurance companies to take on some

621
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,160
amount of managed risk right some amount

622
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:08,799
of sort of

623
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:10,640
you know the 18 year old me driving

624
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,559
around you know nobody nobody wants to

625
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,640
insure that guy right and so

626
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,720
so uh you know there is there are some

627
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,000
some earlier models for that

628
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,600
but i have a sort of a related question

629
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,640
you know one of the things that ernie

630
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,280
mentioned

631
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,679
uh was this idea of of you know of

632
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:25,039
companies coming in and trying to figure

633
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:25,360
out

634
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,720
you know what the problems are before

635
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,760
they go in right whether it's with an

636
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,400
investment

637
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,080
we've heard a lot about this in the m a

638
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,840
space right with insurers right

639
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,360
sort of assessing companies from the

640
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,280
outside sometimes from the inside right

641
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,400
we've there are a lot of companies that

642
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,840
have created businesses

643
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,360
out of doing that type of assessment

644
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,360
i've always wondered how

645
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,200
sort of capable those assessments are

646
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,120
right is it really realistic to be able

647
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:45,840
to tell

648
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,760
how vulnerable a company might be from

649
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,200
scans you do from the outside or the

650
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,799
scans you do from the inside

651
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,320
right and you've been at service

652
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,919
providers that have come in both before

653
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:55,760
and after the fact to try and figure out

654
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,799
you know what these couple

655
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:59,039
what it looks like do you have a sense

656
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:00,240
of whether particularly from a critical

657
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,760
infrastructure perspective and

658
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,919
from a vulnerability to ransomware or

659
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:05,280
frankly any type of malware it's you

660
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,160
know in a lot of ways

661
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,919
ransomware's simply an example of that

662
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:10,080
right can you can you really tell

663
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,160
that from the outside in or from the

664
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,320
inside out and if so yeah is it a good

665
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,840
measure for insurance and

666
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,120
m a and you know diligence for investors

667
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,600
yeah i mean so so uh for the city yes

668
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,120
and in full disclosure that's the

669
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,320
business that these

670
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,640
is in today but i i didn't know that

671
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,440
yeah

672
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,240
but but let me tell you why why it works

673
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,760
that's what the adversaries do

674
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,760
uh you know that that uh if you know

675
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,600
that you can you can have

676
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,799
you can take the perspective of the

677
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:38,640
defender and and uh

678
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,360
and dig in um but uh they're you know

679
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,640
that's what the adversaries do

680
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,360
and it's working for them so they're

681
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,799
testing their testing from the outside

682
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:47,919
to see who's vulnerable

683
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:49,360
and as a result sort of that's what if

684
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,799
we do that we can get a sense for it too

685
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,080
is that your point yeah yeah i mean

686
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,200
that they're you know they're they're

687
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,880
using showdown they're using you know

688
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,440
that the

689
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,640
the other they understand what's

690
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,640
vulnerable um you know i

691
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,799
i think you know the the thing from a

692
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,159
service perspective side i think the

693
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,120
thing that where people

694
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,159
get uh get very big challenges but and

695
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:07,360
particularly when you talk about

696
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,480
insurance or

697
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,480
um you know or supply chain things is

698
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,000
that some of the

699
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,799
you know it it's very hard to identify

700
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:15,760
the um

701
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,520
you know the the true external foot

702
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,960
private organization and so

703
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,400
we have actually one of one of ernie's

704
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,320
uh companies bishop fox actually has a

705
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,480
has a great offering here too is i think

706
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,200
what what everyone has the story of a

707
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,520
supply chain scorecard that you know

708
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,440
had some got some terrible score because

709
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,200
it included their guest network or

710
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,039
franchise or those things and so

711
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,760
you know the the chat yeah i think the

712
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,679
challenge to it is doing it well

713
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:42,240
uh but um but i think again our our

714
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,440
adversaries are doing it well it's like

715
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,159
hey i

716
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,880
i'm looking for you know i mean they're

717
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,760
they're going hey

718
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,440
i'm looking for things that have this

719
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,280
you know this known vulnerability that

720
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,880
they exist in this space

721
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,720
for an organization that i think has the

722
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,559
capability of paying this ransom

723
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:59,039
uh that is it that is in a country that

724
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:01,200
either doesn't have judicial reach to me

725
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,480
or um you know or or you know law

726
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,080
enforcement action that uh

727
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,320
that would prevent this and so they're

728
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,520
clearly doing it

729
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,120
and i think you know we we have to

730
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,200
leverage that same you know intelligence

731
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,159
capabilities

732
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:16,000
uh uh ourselves but i think the

733
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,360
important thing is doing it responsibly

734
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,400
you know doing it and

735
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,159
giving you know giving someone a you

736
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:22,159
know a bad grade

737
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:24,559
publicly is not uh i don't think it's

738
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:25,600
gonna help us where we

739
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,280
where we need to be right fair enough

740
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,520
fair enough so no name and shame unless

741
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,640
it's unless it's the chinese of the

742
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,520
russians not foreign

743
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,360
yeah and yeah look there's there's a

744
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,640
point where you know

745
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,320
you you need to be a certain height to

746
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,159
ride the internet but over there we got

747
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:41,440
we got to realize that

748
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,120
no one's ever going to be perfect in

749
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,200
this and that we uh we got to figure out

750
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:45,919
how we

751
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:49,200
again how we motivate not uh not just uh

752
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,200
penalize fair enough so jim one of the

753
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,799
things that david just talked about was

754
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:54,000
this idea of sort of supply chain

755
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,600
vulnerability right we've seen

756
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,520
this has become a really hot topic i

757
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,799
mean it's been a hot topic for a long

758
00:21:58,799 --> 00:21:59,120
time

759
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,720
but it's gotten really hot in light of

760
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,559
this ransomware attacks in part because

761
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:03,919
you know people think about you know

762
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:05,600
what happened with solar storm and the

763
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,400
fact that was

764
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,159
a supply chain vector and now with

765
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:09,919
cassette that's supply chain vector

766
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:11,520
right people also concerned of the

767
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,600
downstream effects of of an attack on a

768
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,120
thing like colonial pipeline right

769
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,960
and that has sort of spillover effects

770
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,400
that's not quite a supply chain that's a

771
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,520
slightly attack

772
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,880
but it shows the sort of spillover

773
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,640
effects and then of course the kova 19

774
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,360
pandemic and

775
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,960
we've seen the vulnerabilities in

776
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,960
america's supply chain are dependencies

777
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,400
on on certain foreign countries

778
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,240
including adversaries like china

779
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,720
so jen help me understand you know from

780
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,600
a from a

781
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,200
you know sort of what the government can

782
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,799
do perspective right um and what

783
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:38,720
or at least what what you know

784
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,159
legislation might do to help address

785
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:41,600
these supply chain threats one of the

786
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,080
things

787
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,679
that's talked about in the executive

788
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:45,360
order right with respect to federal

789
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,400
cyber security

790
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,720
is sharing of information between

791
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,559
private sector actors contractors work

792
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:51,679
for the government right

793
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:52,880
requiring them to share information

794
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,720
about incidents and potential incidents

795
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,240
we've now heard legislation up on the

796
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,840
hill moving uh where there's

797
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,360
an effort to get people to disclose it

798
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,799
goes beyond data breaches but disclose

799
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:02,400
any incident you might have

800
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,480
tell tell us how to think about that and

801
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,760
will will disclosure

802
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,679
incidents sort of be enough to sort of

803
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:09,200
address any supply chain threats or is

804
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,640
it a bigger problem that we've got

805
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,280
we've got to go further on and and is

806
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:13,760
even

807
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,360
into disclosure a worthwhile thing to

808
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,480
even get in the business of talking

809
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,159
about

810
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:22,080
i mean i think just it's it's really i

811
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:22,720
think it'll

812
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,440
we'll find out when it plays out um but

813
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:25,840
i think

814
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,760
it's hard to say i think i think it's

815
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,760
disclosure i think is a is a step in the

816
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,520
right direction right it's that same

817
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,679
sense of wanting to understand so you

818
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:35,840
can measure right you can you can

819
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,280
understand if you can't

820
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:40,240
if you can't evaluate it then how can

821
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,360
you respond to it

822
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,360
appropriately right and so we need to

823
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,039
create metrics across

824
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:47,200
a very more than just our own

825
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,039
organizations to understand what's going

826
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:49,679
on

827
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:51,120
and i think there's a sense whether it's

828
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,960
ransomware whether it's a supply chain

829
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:53,919
issue

830
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:56,559
that when companies experience an event

831
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:58,080
right they they really don't want it to

832
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:58,320
be

833
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,120
a breach they want it to stay an event

834
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,159
and not even

835
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:06,000
kind of we deploy all our resources try

836
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:06,640
to understand

837
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,640
what to do on our company's own best

838
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,840
interest if

839
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,480
if there's a directive to to share that

840
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,520
outside of that which

841
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,880
i think a lot of companies a lot of

842
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,279
lawyers who are comfortable

843
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:18,960
and have points of contact within

844
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,120
federal agencies like are

845
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,200
are already comfortable reaching out to

846
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,720
try to pick up interesting

847
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,240
whether it makes sense to disclose

848
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,919
something but yes

849
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:30,960
that says you you need to you should we

850
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,000
want you to

851
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,640
and and and there there's no sense of

852
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,440
impending

853
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,000
penalties right penalties come when you

854
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,279
do something poorly

855
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:41,120
the penalties don't come when you show

856
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,799
that you were vulnerable

857
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:44,880
everybody every company is vulnerable

858
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,840
there's no sense of

859
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,159
like um you know we talk about zero

860
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:49,120
trust there's no

861
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,760
100 percent security like that would be

862
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,760
an amazing state to exist within but no

863
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,400
company

864
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,799
exists within that state so right that

865
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:58,960
that directive that says

866
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,240
share let us know is is around that

867
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,279
that attempt to try to create metrics

868
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:05,600
that

869
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,080
allow for a valid response that can be

870
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,039
coordinated

871
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:11,120
across more than just one company and i

872
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,880
think that's very laudable i think that

873
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:13,840
is a step

874
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:16,000
for sure a step in the right direction

875
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,200
whether it's going to be effective and

876
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,000
how quickly

877
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,080
that's very hard to say yeah yeah that's

878
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,600
a great it's a great point about

879
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,360
sort of the the need for information to

880
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,559
get out there in the marketplace in

881
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:25,120
order to

882
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,120
first coordinate responses so ernie you

883
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,799
know go into this question of responses

884
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:30,240
right you served in the government you

885
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,440
served the department of defense you

886
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,480
were in the military

887
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,240
um you served at diu and now you've come

888
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,440
out and you're in the investment space

889
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,640
in cyber security

890
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,240
but you know one of the things that's

891
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,919
been talked a lot about is that the

892
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:41,279
government not only needs to get its own

893
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:42,960
house or on the defensive side

894
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,799
but it needs to do more potentially

895
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:46,159
offensively right the government needs

896
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:47,679
to respond more effectively

897
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:49,840
uh to these types of attacks you've seen

898
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,760
uh now the bio demonstration talk about

899
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:52,559
the fact that

900
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:54,080
you know we're gonna name the countries

901
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,320
involved we're gonna start talking about

902
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,960
holding countries like russia like china

903
00:25:58,960 --> 00:25:59,919
responsible

904
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:01,120
for some of things that happen in their

905
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,200
space even if they're not nation state

906
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,880
actors but if there are criminal gangs

907
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,000
operating their space and they know

908
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:06,480
about it

909
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,960
we might hold them accountable what what

910
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,559
is this the right road to go down do we

911
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:11,840
want to behold one

912
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,200
do we want to treat ransomware as the

913
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,200
fbi director said like terrorism

914
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,159
which i think was code for if you harbor

915
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:19,679
these guys will start treating you like

916
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:20,960
you're responsible right is that

917
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,799
is that the right approach um and then

918
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:25,039
second do we need to get more offensive

919
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:25,360
i mean

920
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,799
do we need to be punching back more

921
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:28,240
often i like to use the analogy sort of

922
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,919
the bully on the playground right where

923
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:32,000
you know we all tell our kids you know

924
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,279
yeah go tell the teacher the teacher

925
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:34,080
i'll tell the principal and then we'll

926
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,360
have a meeting we'll solve the problem

927
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:35,679
right

928
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:37,679
but we also all really know that if in

929
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:38,720
fact you want your kids something to

930
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,760
build on a playground

931
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,360
the best thing to do is put them in a

932
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,720
self-defense class and punch the bullet

933
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,919
in front of everybody

934
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:45,120
and the bull's gonna stop bothering them

935
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,240
and nobody else is gonna bother too now

936
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,480
nobody say tell your kids that right

937
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,279
but it works and so you know should the

938
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:52,960
government be punching back harder in

939
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,120
cyberspace

940
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,840
obviously this is a great question and

941
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,360
um

942
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,640
i think that on the classifying them as

943
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,159
terrorists you know

944
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:06,960
i i look at it with with cyber there's a

945
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:07,919
beno line

946
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:10,720
there's there's criminal activity and

947
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,400
nation-state activity

948
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,919
that looks to that's directed at

949
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:18,159
you know data-rich companies whether

950
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:20,480
it's pure ransomware extortion where

951
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,799
right and then what we've seen recently

952
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:25,760
with with jbs with colonial pipeline

953
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,480
now we have essential services that are

954
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,679
being attacked

955
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:33,120
and it's one thing to you know blow up

956
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,039
a nuclear facility something that

957
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:36,480
extreme it's another thing when

958
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,559
you shut down the supply chain of oil

959
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:40,960
and gas on the east coast

960
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,399
and i think back this might be a

961
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:46,640
interesting analogy but i was living in

962
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,880
new jersey when hurricane sandy hit

963
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:52,000
yeah lost power for almost two weeks run

964
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,320
up in gas prices people fighting at home

965
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,520
depot for generation

966
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,840
it caused chaos and if you think of a

967
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:58,880
cyber attack

968
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:02,080
it's it it can have those physical

969
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,240
effects in or those effects in the

970
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,360
physical world

971
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,760
so to me there's a clear distinction

972
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,480
there

973
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,799
and are they you know if you're

974
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:11,600
harboring

975
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,000
these these cyber criminals uh i think

976
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,360
you should be held accountable

977
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,559
uh for for letting them um operate with

978
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:19,520
impunity

979
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,880
on the offensive side yes

980
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,720
we should be more offensive you know

981
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,640
general nakasoni at the nsa

982
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,960
ever since he took over the whole he had

983
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,960
the whole concept of defend forward

984
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,279
right and to me that's you know start

985
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:34,399
punching a little more

986
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:35,679
and going into other people's

987
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:37,840
neighborhoods and showing them hey

988
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,360
what's what's going on here so

989
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,559
i i agree with that mentality now what i

990
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:44,000
don't know being out of the government

991
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,919
now is what happens behind the scenes

992
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:47,679
all the clandestines

993
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:49,840
but over um overtly we should be

994
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,279
punching back harder

995
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:53,600
yeah so so dave dave you know you've

996
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,440
seen some of this stuff you you when you

997
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,039
worked at blue void you all defended

998
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:58,640
some of the largest financial sector

999
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,080
players in the business

1000
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:03,440
um talk to us about how how bad

1001
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,679
is the threat when it comes to critical

1002
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:06,640
infrastructure right

1003
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,480
you know you you've seen a lot of you

1004
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,080
sell a lot of rapid seven too so talk to

1005
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:10,960
us about

1006
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,320
um how bad the threat looks and

1007
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,559
and is what ernie says right if the

1008
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:18,080
government starts punching back more

1009
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,679
so if we get more aggressive on on

1010
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:21,039
general auxiliary's effort on defend

1011
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:22,799
forward persistent engagement right

1012
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:24,320
you know we've got is there any point

1013
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,440
out we've got all these amazing people

1014
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,880
in cyber now we've got chris singles

1015
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,720
nash cyber director jen easterly

1016
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,640
at dhs we've got ann newberg at the

1017
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,080
white house i mean rob

1018
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,000
joyce is back at nsa on the on the

1019
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,200
defensive side i mean it is

1020
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,480
it is like a who's who of of cyber cyber

1021
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,000
defenders people frankly who are willing

1022
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:40,720
to go a little

1023
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,240
sort of a little more up against the

1024
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,159
enemy and and punch him right

1025
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:46,799
so so from your perspective having seen

1026
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:48,000
what the threat is the critical

1027
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,039
infrastructure is this the right

1028
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:50,080
approach or

1029
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,360
or you know a lot of people said we

1030
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,200
shouldn't punch back because we live in

1031
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,159
a glass house

1032
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:56,240
right and if we punch too hard they're

1033
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,279
going to hit us really hard and we're

1034
00:29:57,279 --> 00:29:59,279
more vulnerable and more likely to

1035
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:00,799
more likely have problems than they are

1036
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,159
is that is that right i mean how do you

1037
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:03,279
how do you think about this

1038
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:05,760
yeah i i i i'm not sure i'd say

1039
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,720
glasshouse

1040
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,520
say but i think we you know while we are

1041
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,120
likely the most capable

1042
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,360
uh from an offense perspective we also

1043
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,440
likely have the most to lose defensively

1044
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,279
uh and i think that has to factor into

1045
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:18,640
our you know the policy of how we think

1046
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,360
about this but

1047
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,039
see if you talk about critical

1048
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:23,120
infrastructure i mean it's a fascinating

1049
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:23,679
term

1050
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:24,960
we're sitting here talking you know in

1051
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,799
the ics village which is you know very

1052
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:28,559
focused on the industrial control side

1053
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:31,440
i mean dhs categorizes 16 categories of

1054
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,880
critical infrastructure i mean

1055
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,520
yeah in some ways everything is critical

1056
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,760
infrastructure in a lot of ways and

1057
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,679
i exaggerate a little bit for the point

1058
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:41,600
but i think the challenge of it is is

1059
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,440
we we often think that particularly i

1060
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,640
think on the policy side

1061
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,520
get get wrapped up in the haves versus

1062
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,840
the have-nots is you know a you know an

1063
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,399
investor in utility or you know a money

1064
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:53,440
center bank

1065
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:57,039
um you know has amazing capabilities uh

1066
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:59,519
you know but the you know by nature of

1067
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:00,080
of

1068
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,360
these industries we're talking about

1069
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,640
they're all highly interconnected you

1070
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,000
know financial services

1071
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,919
particular but you know is is is

1072
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:07,840
obviously you know highly connected but

1073
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,320
but i think folks you know on the uh

1074
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,519
like the energy industry

1075
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:13,039
when you you you know you've lived in

1076
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:14,799
noewell is uh there's

1077
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:18,320
um you know we have a handful of grids

1078
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,159
uh and one of them has an impact

1079
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:22,640
and there's there are from major

1080
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,760
investor owns

1081
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,200
you know multi-billion dollar

1082
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,000
organizations uh to very small rural

1083
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,279
co-ops and i think

1084
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:31,760
what we what we often forget are the the

1085
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,039
state of the have-nots

1086
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:35,760
uh and and uh you know then i think you

1087
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,960
know wendy now there's a great piece

1088
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,080
years ago of living

1089
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,919
you know below the security poverty line

1090
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:41,120
and so you know there's there's

1091
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,320
organizations that you know

1092
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,799
have have 10 people on i t uh on our

1093
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:47,039
power

1094
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,720
and so i think that um when we talk

1095
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,080
about things like

1096
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,720
you know information sharing and uh you

1097
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,480
know and public partnership

1098
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,320
like those things are great you know

1099
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,559
when you can when you you can take the

1100
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:02,960
you know the the intelligence team from

1101
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,240
exelon or from

1102
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,799
jpmc uh and you know have them talk to

1103
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,240
their peers you know when it's the

1104
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:11,600
uh when it's a you know you know a small

1105
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,279
rural electoral co-op it's a very

1106
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:14,720
different conversation

1107
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,360
and you know as we've seen from uh i'm

1108
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,360
blanking on the details attack but as we

1109
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:19,760
saw

1110
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,399
you know in in one of the the you know

1111
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:23,600
uh russian

1112
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,679
uh attributed attacks on our uh peter

1113
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:27,440
parker you came in through

1114
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,480
a uh a maintenance supplier and a small

1115
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,440
real co-op so

1116
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,880
i think that that that's that smb

1117
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,720
conversation is one that's just so

1118
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,919
critical uh

1119
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:40,159
to to our overall you know

1120
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:42,159
infrastructure security that we

1121
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:44,640
we just that that leaves us vulnerable

1122
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:47,360
in the uh in the punchback side again

1123
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,799
there's there's definitely places for

1124
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:50,720
for punching back and i'm i'm all for it

1125
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,360
i think we've

1126
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,679
you know i i love that we've been uh

1127
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:54,720
more aggressive and

1128
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,200
recovered money and uh and things over

1129
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,480
right so i think there's there's

1130
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,840
there's a lot of roles for that and i

1131
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,600
think a lot of really um

1132
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,840
impressive and creative collaboration

1133
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:04,799
and finding

1134
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:07,360
ways to legally you know take down

1135
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,640
infrastructure or take over

1136
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,600
infrastructure

1137
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,120
uh so i think there's a lot more we

1138
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,720
could be doing but i think uh

1139
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,919
we just have to keep keep keep our

1140
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:18,159
you know our state in mind as we do that

1141
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:19,120
yeah well so

1142
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,880
on that on that front jen you know one

1143
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,640
of the things that that uh that we've

1144
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,399
seen the government do a lot of right is

1145
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:26,240
is indict cyber criminals you're a

1146
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,760
former federal prosecutor

1147
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,640
uh right uh or former prosecutor you uh

1148
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,799
have seen some of these cases go down

1149
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:35,919
uh you know is is it really

1150
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:38,159
sensible to for indict folks we know

1151
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:39,360
we're never going to get right we got

1152
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,399
these chinese

1153
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:42,399
you know military officers with these

1154
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:44,000
russians these russian

1155
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,679
cyber criminals some of whom are

1156
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:46,960
associated with the government right

1157
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:47,360
there's

1158
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,960
no chances that we're going to get these

1159
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,799
folks here and so in a lot of ways it

1160
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:52,399
feels like just a name and shame game

1161
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:53,919
when it comes to these indictments

1162
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:55,120
right is there any value in these

1163
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,720
indictments and if there is or there

1164
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,360
isn't

1165
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,360
right um what about getting more

1166
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,799
aggressive are there are there any legal

1167
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:02,240
concerns we might have with doing the

1168
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,360
kind of things that ernie's talking

1169
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,080
about sort of

1170
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,360
uh you know getting more aggressive

1171
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,440
punching back right or

1172
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,800
you know are there are there legal

1173
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,399
concerns with helping the smaller

1174
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:12,480
providers can we can we do something

1175
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,679
as a legal matter to help these small

1176
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:15,199
providers get the information they need

1177
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:16,719
if they have small teams can we can we

1178
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:17,918
push in the information

1179
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:20,159
um or focus information on them uh

1180
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,679
without you know without having

1181
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:23,199
a problem where we're not helping these

1182
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:24,399
other folks right is there is there a

1183
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:25,918
problem when we treat people differently

1184
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:28,079
given how they're situated so a number

1185
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:29,199
of questions there sorry about that

1186
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:31,679
that was i think a three-parter okay i'm

1187
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:33,199
gonna address them all together

1188
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:35,760
um that's a great question uh no i think

1189
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,719
uh

1190
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:38,320
i think the word that comes to mind when

1191
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,079
i think about the prosecutions is

1192
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:42,320
like symbolism right like it's it's a

1193
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,599
symbolic

1194
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:47,599
sort of um shot um it's a long shot

1195
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:51,040
right the idea that these people be held

1196
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,719
accountable you know in a court of law

1197
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:54,399
in the united states is very

1198
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:57,280
far-fetched um but is it is it

1199
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,720
meaningless

1200
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,880
probably not right because i think i

1201
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,040
think there's a sense that

1202
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:06,079
even identifying you know somebody who

1203
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:08,880
is hacking you know whether it's smbs or

1204
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:09,359
like

1205
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:12,400
you know our nation itself is bootable

1206
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,000
like that person has

1207
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,960
an identity behind a screen in a place

1208
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:17,599
that is very

1209
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:20,560
many time zones away but still the idea

1210
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,440
of like

1211
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,960
literally like throwing down the

1212
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,480
gauntlet that this is the person

1213
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,560
we know it's you yes that's that is i

1214
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,400
think there is something very

1215
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,800
um gratifying about that i don't think

1216
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,960
it'll go so far as being gratifying

1217
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,200
as far as putting them in one of our you

1218
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,160
know um

1219
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:39,359
jails um that'll be amazing but but

1220
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:40,160
probably not

1221
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,400
but i think you know the the question of

1222
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,440
what is

1223
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,760
an appropriate response and how do we

1224
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,040
properly defend

1225
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,680
you know our country and our companies

1226
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:50,320
um

1227
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:53,520
is is multi-layered i think a lot of

1228
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,200
a lot of the time like we haven't even

1229
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,359
touched on like diplomacy right like

1230
00:35:57,359 --> 00:35:59,280
there's the idea of sanctions

1231
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,440
the idea of like which which country is

1232
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,640
is this coming from

1233
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,720
and will they be responsive to the

1234
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:05,920
diplomacy

1235
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,680
that kind of accompanies the sense that

1236
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,119
sanctions have

1237
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:11,920
the right repercussions for that kind

1238
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:12,160
and

1239
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,320
and then can you lean on that country to

1240
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,560
then help you find justice against those

1241
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,839
individuals who are

1242
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:19,760
part of it now in a lot of the countries

1243
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,040
that we're talking about today

1244
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,760
those those individual actors are not

1245
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,680
individual actors per se right like we

1246
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:26,560
talk about right

1247
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,960
in their own hr departments within

1248
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,400
criminal organizations

1249
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,400
they're very organized they're probably

1250
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,160
state-sponsored and that's just not a

1251
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,119
realistic outcome

1252
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:38,720
yeah i think it's interesting you know

1253
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,880
last week you know there was there there

1254
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,800
was a bill there's a bipartisan bill

1255
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,920
that's being introduced

1256
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,079
allowing companies to hack back and i

1257
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:47,040
don't know if you guys have

1258
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:50,320
seen that yeah that that was a 2017

1259
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:50,960
initiative

1260
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,200
it's you know it's been revived and the

1261
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,800
question there is like

1262
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,560
you know what would be the right

1263
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,720
proportion of action by a company

1264
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,800
how would a company say all right you

1265
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,920
did this like

1266
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,480
okay now you get this that you could

1267
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,960
rise that level of sophistication

1268
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,200
like the question and at the gc level

1269
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,480
right like a lot of us are kind of

1270
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,680
questioning like

1271
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,599
do we want to be the individual who's

1272
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:15,040
saying go for it

1273
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,520
yes like right like it's awesome since

1274
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,960
go like give it to them

1275
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,359
like that is it it feels very

1276
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:23,119
far-fetched but that is a legitimate

1277
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:23,760
bill

1278
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,160
that is coming through that is well yeah

1279
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,520
there are some that bears some

1280
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,200
consideration because that's

1281
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,200
if that's where we're at you know we

1282
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,240
might as well put everything on the

1283
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,079
table and think through that because

1284
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:36,800
there aren't many other options and

1285
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,200
remedies for companies

1286
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,200
yeah so so ernie look this has come up a

1287
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,680
number of times right this idea of of

1288
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,359
private sector hacked back right

1289
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:47,760
it dates back right as a military matter

1290
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,119
back to the founding of our nation right

1291
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:50,480
where we actually

1292
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,960
use private private ships to sort of

1293
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,200
form a navy for us and really defend to

1294
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,800
defend our coastlines right even though

1295
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,400
we had a nascent navy right

1296
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,000
we would often give these letters of

1297
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,760
mark and reprisals people as people

1298
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:02,560
refer to them you know

1299
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,400
it's in the constitution right and give

1300
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,599
these things to private individuals to

1301
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:07,280
go fight back on behalf the nation

1302
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,040
uh we obviously have today a cyber

1303
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,960
command they have offensive capabilities

1304
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,720
even before cyber command existed we've

1305
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,000
had we had the joint functional

1306
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,760
component command for network warfare

1307
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,040
that did some more of the offensive

1308
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:20,000
stuff but there is a lot of discussion

1309
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,440
about private companies being able to

1310
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,800
respond in some way

1311
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,400
right some people talk about active

1312
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,480
defenses meaning you know look if if

1313
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,680
somebody hits me

1314
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,839
i can send sort of the way i would like

1315
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:30,960
a die pack in

1316
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,040
in a package of money right it'll go

1317
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,240
explode in their network i'll know it

1318
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,760
was them it'll beacon back it'll tell me

1319
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,720
it was them right

1320
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,480
never mind that beaconing activity looks

1321
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,079
a lot like what malware does right at

1322
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:41,599
the outset but okay whatever

1323
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:43,280
finds it'll beat them back to me and

1324
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,040
maybe even it'll detonate and it'll

1325
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,079
destroy my data

1326
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:47,760
right but then what if it goes a little

1327
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,119
further right ernie is this the place we

1328
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:50,240
should be going where

1329
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,760
well maybe it detonates and takes down

1330
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,760
their infrastructure not not in not

1331
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:54,960
their whole systems but just the stuff

1332
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,000
they use to attack

1333
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,160
me right is that a place we should be

1334
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,200
going and

1335
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,839
should we be worried about if this is as

1336
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:03,599
as jen points out potentially

1337
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:04,560
even though it looks like criminal

1338
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,160
activity it might be state-sponsored

1339
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:06,960
activity

1340
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,119
right is there a threat that we might

1341
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:10,400
have private sectors companies get us

1342
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,400
into that so-called you know land war in

1343
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,119
asia do we have to worry about that

1344
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:16,960
that's a tough one that's a really tough

1345
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,800
one because part of me

1346
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,440
says yeah you should be able to defend

1347
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,960
your organization

1348
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,359
um and you should be able to respond

1349
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:26,800
proportionately or

1350
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,200
maybe disproportionately the other part

1351
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,040
of me you know thinks with kinetic

1352
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,640
warfare there there's always collateral

1353
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,920
damage

1354
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,359
uh and there there could be fracture

1355
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:37,119
side uh so

1356
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:38,560
i mean look at that look at not pets

1357
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,240
here right i mean not petcha an attack

1358
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,000
by the russians against ukrainians you

1359
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:42,400
know

1360
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,359
300 million dollars per company right 10

1361
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:45,920
million

1362
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,800
worldwide perf perfect example perfect

1363
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:49,760
example

1364
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,960
you know the i i think

1365
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,119
as much as i'd like to see something

1366
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:56,560
like that i think it would get too

1367
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,839
chaotic

1368
00:39:57,839 --> 00:39:59,599
you'd have the collateral damage you'd

1369
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:02,160
have you know it's not like

1370
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,800
when we had stuxnet there there was an

1371
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,640
organization that could use four zero

1372
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,200
days and do it very accurately right

1373
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,680
that you can you can't expect you know a

1374
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,599
mid-more even an enterprise jp morgan to

1375
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:14,560
do that

1376
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,480
so i i think i don't know i don't know

1377
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,160
jamie dimon might might disagree with

1378
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,560
you he's got renewed so

1379
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,880
well they might be the one exception but

1380
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,000
you know when they were

1381
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,319
when the financial institutions were

1382
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:28,640
attacked in 2012 by the iranians

1383
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:31,200
right the government didn't help uh my

1384
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,160
understanding

1385
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,960
is and i know people that were involved

1386
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:35,520
uh

1387
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,119
the government said no and and

1388
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:39,040
ultimately the

1389
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,760
um the you know call it enemy servers

1390
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:42,720
went dark

1391
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,599
uh and it was the israelis right they

1392
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:46,480
came in

1393
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:49,040
so anyway it's it's a slippery slope uh

1394
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,800
i i think we got to be very careful with

1395
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:51,440
that

1396
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,960
yeah so jen what about from a legal

1397
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,280
perspective let's say we did grant these

1398
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,880
letters of marketing reprisal to

1399
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,079
companies that you know

1400
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:00,240
that that that um that are that are

1401
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,280
being attacked critical infrastructure

1402
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,960
companies only and only really capable

1403
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,319
ones right only the big ones and all the

1404
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:05,599
smart ones right whatever

1405
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:07,359
uh we pick them we give this authority

1406
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:08,720
we say you can only do these set of

1407
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:09,200
things

1408
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:12,319
right do we want private sector

1409
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:13,359
businesses

1410
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:14,880
doing this sort of thing right is is are

1411
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,400
there any legal concerns with that and

1412
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,760
here's our legal concerns are there

1413
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,520
policy concerns about allowing private

1414
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,400
sector companies

1415
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,240
even with all the law all the legal

1416
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,359
authority in the world from the us

1417
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:24,079
government a little

1418
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:26,079
favor saying you're acting on our behalf

1419
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:28,960
do we want them in that business

1420
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:32,000
i mean at the risk of alienating all of

1421
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:32,880
my friends for

1422
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,200
general counsels i would say i would say

1423
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,560
probably not i mean

1424
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:39,440
general counsels are not cyber experts

1425
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:39,920
you know

1426
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:42,880
by merit of having except for you well

1427
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,400
i'm i'm still working on it that's why

1428
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,680
i've got to spend a lot of time around

1429
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:46,400
it

1430
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,880
um no but but i think i think it's the i

1431
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,560
think that's the problem right i mean

1432
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,880
general counsels are the word general is

1433
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:53,839
in there for a reason

1434
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:56,160
like we are just at the heart of it if

1435
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,200
we're not then

1436
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,960
it's very hard to execute against so

1437
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,319
many different things that affect a

1438
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:01,119
company

1439
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:03,200
um the question of like whether we want

1440
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,640
to be empowered to

1441
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:08,160
use force under a un charter like

1442
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,160
probably not it's probably the same

1443
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,359
question as like should i

1444
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:13,359
be carrying a gun even if i can get a

1445
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:15,359
gun from it probably not

1446
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:18,560
uh that's i think it is it's an

1447
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,839
interesting question i mean i i think

1448
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:21,440
there are legal ways through it right

1449
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,040
and there are corporate governance ways

1450
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,160
through it you can create

1451
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:26,240
committees that can evaluate things that

1452
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:28,400
can get down to like a very

1453
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:31,040
narrow issue and protect itself and

1454
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,960
understand that it's making a decision

1455
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,960
in the best interest of the entity

1456
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,960
and then taking into account all the

1457
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:39,200
other considerations which would be

1458
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,800
you know the country the collateral

1459
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,880
damage the repercussions

1460
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,720
and and do it in a coordinated way with

1461
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,319
government um

1462
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:48,960
that maybe if that then possibly but i

1463
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:49,760
would still

1464
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,359
you know err on the side of what ernie

1465
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:53,040
said which is yeah

1466
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:55,359
it's a big it's it's it's a big leap of

1467
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:56,720
faith right and it's a

1468
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,720
faith that may not even be successful

1469
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,880
even if you had the technical chops

1470
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,359
to execute it what are you going to get

1471
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:05,119
is it that sense of redemption

1472
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:08,160
right doj style like you know

1473
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,319
we've now named it we've done something

1474
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:12,319
yeah is it is how how

1475
00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:14,160
it's probably very gratifying but is it

1476
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,000
is it ultimately effective

1477
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,960
yeah yeah yeah so david you know it

1478
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,079
sounds like ernie

1479
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:21,839
and general are like look we're not

1480
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:23,040
pricing company doing it's not the

1481
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:24,079
greatest idea

1482
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:25,440
right so let's let's say that's right

1483
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:26,480
let's say we're we're not going to price

1484
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,160
the company companies do this and we're

1485
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:29,119
really going to take

1486
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:30,720
uh you and ernie up on on your

1487
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,240
suggestion that the government gets more

1488
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:33,200
aggressive and

1489
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,520
sort of does its part right does the

1490
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:36,880
government know enough

1491
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,880
about what the private sector is being

1492
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:41,359
hit by to effectively respond to it and

1493
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:43,520
and sort of deter behavior right i mean

1494
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:44,640
it's one thing to say okay the

1495
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:46,079
government's not willing to do it right

1496
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:47,520
which they haven't been for a while and

1497
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:48,960
now hopefully under general oxygen

1498
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,000
they're getting more aggressive and they

1499
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:50,960
have more authority right

1500
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,800
so maybe they are willing to turn maybe

1501
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,240
even capable of deterring

1502
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:56,800
right do they know who to go after they

1503
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,400
know how to go about it do they do they

1504
00:43:58,400 --> 00:43:58,960
have the

1505
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:01,200
information they need to really sort of

1506
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,040
deter those who are coming up against

1507
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,720
our private sector or do they need

1508
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,079
you know we've talked about information

1509
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:07,359
sharing and that's all great and well

1510
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:08,000
right you know

1511
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,720
more data fine great terrific right but

1512
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:11,599
a lot of it needs to be about

1513
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:13,040
collaborating in real time too right

1514
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:14,079
working together

1515
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:15,920
consistently day to day day in day out

1516
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,839
holding hands as these things happen

1517
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:20,400
are we are we anywhere near that yeah i

1518
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,400
mean i think if we're if we're talking

1519
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,400
hit back from a cyber attack i think

1520
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:25,520
that's a very

1521
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,280
that's a much more complex conversation

1522
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:28,640
and and you know information sharing

1523
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:30,000
becomes a uh

1524
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,839
you know really really challenging uh

1525
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:34,160
chat yeah i i i had a conversation

1526
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:35,839
you know a few years ago with uh with

1527
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:38,160
someone at the senior level

1528
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,079
at a at a state uh law enforcement

1529
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:42,079
agency and you know that this idea is

1530
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:44,240
like talking to the fbi is like um

1531
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:45,520
you know being a psychiatrist in the

1532
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:47,760
chase lounge is like they ask all the

1533
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,280
questions you do all the talking

1534
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:51,920
uh and uh and you know it was a very a

1535
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:53,920
very one-way conversation so i i do

1536
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:54,480
think a

1537
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:56,880
you know a two-way um you know

1538
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:57,760
communication

1539
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:00,720
is uh you know is is critical uh yeah

1540
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:02,560
you know and but

1541
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:04,319
just not only for accuracy but also

1542
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:05,760
things like collateral damage like

1543
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,200
like you do this and you're going to

1544
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,119
take out you know you know the

1545
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:11,200
you know the east coast you know like

1546
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:12,319
you're gonna take out a pipeline or

1547
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:13,440
you're gonna take out

1548
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:15,200
yeah so understanding the dependencies

1549
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:16,800
is challenging but what but

1550
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,640
what i think we're missing in the in the

1551
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:19,920
hackback conversation and

1552
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,400
part part of why i love the naming names

1553
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:22,960
uh

1554
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:26,160
you know side is attribution is really

1555
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,520
important for two things one

1556
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:30,720
is uh you know it's um yeah it it can

1557
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,960
give you organizational insight as to

1558
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:35,440
who's doing it so is is this one person

1559
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:36,880
you know or a small group of people who

1560
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:38,319
are financially motivated does it

1561
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:40,400
you know is it a is it a broader network

1562
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,079
that's accomplishing other goals how are

1563
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:43,280
they being financed

1564
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:45,520
uh and and when we know those things we

1565
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:46,800
can all of a sudden take

1566
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,319
uh take very different actions it

1567
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:49,520
doesn't have to be just in stable

1568
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:50,319
infrastructure

1569
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:51,920
it can be you know stop their ability to

1570
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,680
move money uh you know

1571
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:55,920
not just cyber yeah there's a lot of

1572
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,359
other things that

1573
00:45:57,359 --> 00:46:00,160
uh that we can do i mean i again i agree

1574
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:01,359
with jen that the likelihood these

1575
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:02,880
people ever showing up in the u.s jail

1576
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:04,079
is low but uh

1577
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:05,680
i just kind of grin and go well there's

1578
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:08,240
a we just took a lot of places that uh

1579
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:09,680
they can't go on vacation and spend that

1580
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,200
money they're making

1581
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:12,960
that's that's where extradition comes

1582
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,359
into play so i i do think there's a much

1583
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:17,520
broader set of actions that when we know

1584
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:18,160
the

1585
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:20,640
the individuals um you know and then the

1586
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,640
entities they're part of behind it that

1587
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:25,520
that the us government's um you know the

1588
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:26,240
you know

1589
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:28,079
has actions that can take and that's a

1590
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:29,839
very different coordination problem that

1591
00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:30,560
you know

1592
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:33,280
that coordinating a you know a cyber

1593
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:34,400
defense mission a

1594
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:37,440
you know a a financial you know crimes

1595
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:37,920
mission

1596
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,400
a uh you know money laundering or ofac

1597
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:41,440
like things like that

1598
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:42,800
that's a very different degree of

1599
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,160
coordination that i'd like you'd love to

1600
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:45,200
see you know

1601
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:47,119
a a difficult sprint around on the

1602
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:48,960
government side and sorting that out

1603
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:51,599
yeah so so this is really interesting so

1604
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:52,079
you know

1605
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:54,319
we're coming up on on the end of our our

1606
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:56,400
time together

1607
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:57,839
and one of the things i want to sort of

1608
00:46:57,839 --> 00:47:00,720
end on um is a question about

1609
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:01,839
ransomware itself right because the

1610
00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:03,040
topic of our panel is critical

1611
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:04,640
infrastructure and ransomware

1612
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:06,640
one of the things that got really

1613
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:08,960
interesting about the colonial pipeline

1614
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:11,680
hack right was that uh early on in in

1615
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:12,800
the in the attack

1616
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,400
uh colonial pipeline took their systems

1617
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:17,040
offline right uh they did some stuff

1618
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:18,400
and then they came back up fairly

1619
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,319
quickly everyone was concerned about

1620
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:22,000
the potential for a major supply chain

1621
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,319
disruption of oil on the east coast

1622
00:47:24,319 --> 00:47:25,760
there were even some people who were

1623
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:28,319
hoarding gas crazily putting bag

1624
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:30,079
gas in plastic bags by the way for those

1625
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:31,599
who out there don't put gas in plastic

1626
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:33,520
bags it doesn't work it's a bad idea

1627
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:35,760
please don't do that um but but there

1628
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:37,280
were these concerns right legitimate

1629
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:38,079
concerns about

1630
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:39,920
about about a supply sheet destruction

1631
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:41,440
and colonial pipeline avoided it i'll

1632
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:43,119
come to find out later on

1633
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:45,040
that they had paid the ransom right now

1634
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:46,160
yes the fbi went

1635
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:47,359
and they were able to get get something

1636
00:47:47,359 --> 00:47:48,640
back that's a whole nother question

1637
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:50,880
about how the fbi had the private key

1638
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:52,400
uh to the bitcoin to get that to get

1639
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,000
that uh that grants it back that i'll

1640
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,200
leave for the audience

1641
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:56,960
but i have a question for for each of

1642
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:59,119
our panels which is

1643
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:01,599
should we be permitting companies to pay

1644
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:02,800
ransoms

1645
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,960
in order to get them back up and running

1646
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:07,200
faster and if your answer is

1647
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:08,480
yes or at least for critical

1648
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:11,119
infrastructure a qualified yes

1649
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:12,640
doesn't that incentivize the business

1650
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,480
and if it does how do we solve that

1651
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:16,160
problem aren't we sort of quote unquote

1652
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:17,359
negotiating with the terrorists i'll

1653
00:48:17,359 --> 00:48:19,359
start with you david and i'll end i'll

1654
00:48:19,359 --> 00:48:20,319
end with jen

1655
00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:21,520
because she's the lawyer in the room and

1656
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:23,200
i want to get the lawyers out but david

1657
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,480
first see you

1658
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:27,040
i thought i i i would not uh i'm not

1659
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:28,800
supportive of the government um

1660
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:31,119
having a no ransom policy uh today is

1661
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:32,400
that that folks

1662
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:34,319
that that people need to make a a

1663
00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:36,000
risk-based decision their business and

1664
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,520
i it it i again it i loathe

1665
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:41,920
uh the fact that it supports uh these

1666
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:42,640
actors and

1667
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:45,760
and continues to um uh it helps

1668
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:47,839
propagate the problem but i think that

1669
00:48:47,839 --> 00:48:48,480
you know

1670
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:50,960
any the the government telling a uh a

1671
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:52,000
private sector

1672
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,079
um you know entity what they can or

1673
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:55,520
can't do you know with

1674
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:57,520
you know financially in a risk situation

1675
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:58,800
uh you know we we

1676
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:01,200
you know taking i tried all parallels we

1677
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:02,960
didn't go back and say you couldn't take

1678
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:05,119
yeah you couldn't pay kidnapping ransoms

1679
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:07,040
uh that uh you know we dealt with that

1680
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:07,359
as

1681
00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:10,000
uh as a as a law enforcement problem and

1682
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:10,400
so

1683
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,319
i i think we're not quite ready for that

1684
00:49:12,319 --> 00:49:14,000
i do think there are a number of

1685
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,319
um there are some things where some

1686
00:49:16,319 --> 00:49:17,440
tools that

1687
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:20,240
we that that while you say yes you can

1688
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:20,800
pay

1689
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:23,040
uh i do think we're under leveraging the

1690
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:23,920
um

1691
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:27,119
you know the the ofac and uh uh and

1692
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:29,200
you know money moving process that yeah

1693
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:30,240
there's a there's a

1694
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:31,839
small growing kind of school of thought

1695
00:49:31,839 --> 00:49:33,440
that paying ransom

1696
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:35,680
uh should should require some more

1697
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:37,119
knowledge and attribution of the entity

1698
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:38,720
to make sure that you're not funding

1699
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:41,280
uh you know as a as a us entity you

1700
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:42,559
can't fund things that are

1701
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:45,599
that are sdns uh so i i think

1702
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:47,520
there are ways that we could um we can

1703
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:48,720
wield other things

1704
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:51,599
uh beyond the individual uh companies

1705
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:52,480
okay

1706
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,000
but can i can i ask about that so i

1707
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,280
always hear this right like okay we

1708
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:56,000
should make sure

1709
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,520
as long as they're not paying terrorists

1710
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:59,440
or or you know whatever but look they're

1711
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:00,160
paying

1712
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:02,240
cyber hackers right for all we know

1713
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:03,200
these high records are fun

1714
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,480
i mean what do we suppose to ask them

1715
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:06,400
for id before we pay them like what

1716
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:07,839
how how is that going to work i don't i

1717
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:09,680
don't get that yeah i mean yeah i mean

1718
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:11,599
yeah look there's there's there's

1719
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:12,880
there's ways um

1720
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:14,880
there are there are services out there

1721
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:15,920
that help with this

1722
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:18,559
there are um and i think you know there

1723
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:19,359
there's

1724
00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:20,960
you know perhaps there's ways you can

1725
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,800
come come to

1726
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:24,160
knowledge about the transaction that

1727
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:26,000
gets you to a comfort level uh

1728
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,400
but we you know we we've had this sdn

1729
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:29,280
methodology

1730
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:31,440
you know as a as a country for a long

1731
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:32,319
time and it's

1732
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:33,599
you know while it's not perfect it's

1733
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:36,720
been it's been quite effective at uh

1734
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:38,640
taking out you know particular groups of

1735
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:40,079
actors and i'd love to see

1736
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:42,319
use more here and sdns are especially

1737
00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:43,520
designated nationals right people who

1738
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:44,880
aren't sort of the terrorists and the

1739
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:45,920
like

1740
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:48,160
sanctions list um all right ernie over

1741
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:49,280
to you um

1742
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:52,400
should we allow companies to pay ransoms

1743
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:54,319
and if so what about this uh this threat

1744
00:50:54,319 --> 00:50:55,680
that it'll just incentivize the business

1745
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:56,880
more

1746
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:58,640
yeah so first i i don't think it should

1747
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:01,200
be binary you either pay or you don't

1748
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:04,000
uh in a recent study i read only eight

1749
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
percent of organizations got all their

1750
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,040
data back

1751
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:09,599
and 29 got half which blew my mind

1752
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:10,240
because

1753
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:11,680
i thought if you paid you probably like

1754
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:14,079
a 75 percent chance to get it back

1755
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:16,880
uh so today i agree with david it's

1756
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:18,079
you're not going to tell like if you're

1757
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:20,079
if your kid gets taken hostage

1758
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:21,200
you're not the government's until you

1759
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:22,800
don't pay the ransom you want your your

1760
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,079
child back so

1761
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:25,280
they might but you're still going to pay

1762
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:27,119
the rent yeah

1763
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:30,079
but it's it's a risk-based decision is

1764
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:30,559
is

1765
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:33,760
pii on the line uh or is it an essential

1766
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:35,520
service is it affecting national

1767
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:38,000
infrastructure is it affecting you know

1768
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:38,720
um

1769
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,640
something that that could cause actual

1770
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:41,839
physical heart you know

1771
00:51:41,839 --> 00:51:44,079
harm in the physical world so i i think

1772
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:45,359
it's up to the businesses

1773
00:51:45,359 --> 00:51:48,720
i i don't like it but i think there's no

1774
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:50,960
there's there's no you know binary

1775
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:52,480
answer to this yeah can i just follow up

1776
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:53,520
on that though so okay so

1777
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:54,960
let's see let's it sounds like you'd be

1778
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:56,319
more willing to accept payment of

1779
00:51:56,319 --> 00:51:57,920
ransoms if if critical infrastructure's

1780
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:59,599
involved is that did i hear that right

1781
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:01,839
that that's yeah it's you have to look

1782
00:52:01,839 --> 00:52:03,200
at first second third

1783
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:06,079
and yeah yeah okay so so if that's right

1784
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:06,800
though

1785
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:09,280
aren't we just telling the bad guys hey

1786
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:10,800
you know what you should really go after

1787
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:11,599
you should go up to critical

1788
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:12,240
infrastructure

1789
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:13,040
because that's where we're gonna be

1790
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:14,720
willing to pay the biggest ransom so hey

1791
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:16,319
clone pipeline that was smart

1792
00:52:16,319 --> 00:52:18,160
do more of that you'll get paid more

1793
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:19,359
often

1794
00:52:19,359 --> 00:52:22,800
yeah i i would not write that down or or

1795
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:25,920
suggest that it would it it's again it's

1796
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:27,359
business risk

1797
00:52:27,359 --> 00:52:29,119
with the business knowing what type of

1798
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:31,520
risk uh that that that ransomware and

1799
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:33,119
extortion where it's going to affect

1800
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:36,319
on their customers and on our calculus

1801
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:38,480
all right jen you have the first word

1802
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:39,680
you get the last word

1803
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:41,599
tell us what you think about about

1804
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:42,720
ransomware

1805
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:44,079
you know and and should we be allowing

1806
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:45,760
companies to pay ransoms and what about

1807
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:46,000
this

1808
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,760
incentive effect right if we if we tell

1809
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:49,119
them like ernie says hey look

1810
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:50,960
the one place i'm willing to pay ransoms

1811
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:52,319
is critical infrastructure for sure

1812
00:52:52,319 --> 00:52:54,319
well doesn't that make quirky voucher

1813
00:52:54,319 --> 00:52:56,319
even bigger critical infrastructure

1814
00:52:56,319 --> 00:52:56,960
sorry

1815
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:59,040
uh an even bigger target than it already

1816
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:00,079
was

1817
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:03,200
yeah i mean i agree with both david and

1818
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:06,079
ernie so i'm going to kind of layer on

1819
00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:07,119
to their

1820
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:08,960
sort of suggestions but also kind of go

1821
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:11,119
far which is like can we get to a point

1822
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:13,920
with with public sector with government

1823
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:15,839
agencies where like because the thing

1824
00:53:15,839 --> 00:53:16,960
that we're not talking about with that

1825
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:18,559
ransomware is that it's a very rapid

1826
00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:20,079
response that's required

1827
00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:22,800
so making a very quick decision and as a

1828
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,480
company everything that you do

1829
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:26,000
as an officer is in the company's best

1830
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,800
interests that's kind of the overarching

1831
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:29,599
theme like

1832
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:31,200
obviously the collateral effect is

1833
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:32,640
important but if it

1834
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:34,880
but if it's if it is if it's

1835
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:36,160
contraindicated by

1836
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:37,680
something legal then that takes it off

1837
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:40,160
the table i i kind of query whether we

1838
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:40,800
could get

1839
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,559
through this like you know the biden

1840
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:44,640
orders and the sense of collaboration to

1841
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:46,240
a point where companies feel like they

1842
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:46,559
can

1843
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:48,480
turn to law enforcement during a

1844
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:49,920
ransomware attack

1845
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:52,400
to say this is happening we're gonna do

1846
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:54,319
this we're letting you know

1847
00:53:54,319 --> 00:53:56,800
and and maybe get some some some sense

1848
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:57,839
of assistance

1849
00:53:57,839 --> 00:53:59,920
even to try to get to that level of

1850
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:00,960
attribution

1851
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:02,480
right like maybe that's where this all

1852
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:04,319
goes maybe you split it

1853
00:54:04,319 --> 00:54:05,839
and try to get there and that's kind of

1854
00:54:05,839 --> 00:54:07,920
the best case for right now because it

1855
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:08,559
is a very

1856
00:54:08,559 --> 00:54:10,880
repeated issue i think companies are in

1857
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:12,800
a really bad situation especially

1858
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:14,640
as ernie said when there's pii on the

1859
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:16,480
line the government is not willing to

1860
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:17,359
indemnify you

1861
00:54:17,359 --> 00:54:19,359
right from all those suits that are

1862
00:54:19,359 --> 00:54:20,640
coming so

1863
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:22,559
so you've got to still make the best

1864
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:24,079
decision for your company that's a

1865
00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:26,319
that's a very multi-layered question

1866
00:54:26,319 --> 00:54:28,079
right well it looks to me like that's a

1867
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:29,839
great note to end on thank you so much

1868
00:54:29,839 --> 00:54:30,720
