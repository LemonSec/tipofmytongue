bug hunter's guide to bashing for car

5
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,359
hacking bug bash or contest

6
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,520
okay so who am i uh i'm jay torilla or

7

ship code um jetman and ruthcon

8
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,480
uh i'm a security ops manager

9
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,320
from the philippines at bug crowd and

10
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,440
i'm a i'm also a rude gun goon which is

11
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,079
a

12
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,399
hacker conference in the philippines and

13
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,600
also with cfb review board

14
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,840
i'm not the author of touring malware

15
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,680
despite my

16
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,239
family name i'm not even russian i'm

17
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:01,680
filipino

18
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,559
so i'm also one of the main organizers

19
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:04,959
for

20
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:07,439
the car hacking village at rutgon and

21
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,119
the philippines or

22
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,640
carhack village ph so i

23
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,840
i've also contributed to metasploit uh

24
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,640
some auxiliary and exploit modules so

25
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,080
from time to time before i contributed

26
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,200
some modules

27
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,920
and actually the last module that i've

28
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,280
contributed

29
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,400
is related to car hacking or

30
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,040
the msf hardware bridge which you could

31
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,159
use for

32
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,280
you know hacking your car

33
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,640
so um about this topic

34
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,119
it's actually not a mental health topic

35
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:46,399
so it's

36
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:49,600
but the purpose of this is to encourage

37
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,960
other bug hunters especially

38
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,200
application security hackers or

39
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,119
researchers

40
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,000
to hack cars you know to invite them

41
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
that

42
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
they are also welcome to try out car

43
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,759
hacking even though

44
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,560
they might only know web or mobile

45
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,598
hacking

46
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,599
so there are tips and tricks that i'll

47
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,120
be

48
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,400
showing showing in the presentation and

49
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,959
also some preparations to do for day

50
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:19,840
zero

51
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,520
which is uh

52
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,920
a day before the event or the bug bash

53
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,440
or the contest

54
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,480
so there are also some

55
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,840
tips and tricks to focus for

56
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,959
the bug bash and also to clear out

57
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,400
misconceptions

58
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,519
that car hacking bug bashes are not just

59
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:41,920
for

60
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,920
hardware and car hackers right

61
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,000
like i said there are there are a bit

62
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,760
tips and tricks but there will be no

63
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,959
demo

64
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:53,920
for nda purposes because some of the

65
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,800
demos

66
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,959
usually for you know bug bashes

67
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:03,760
have nda so and lastly

68
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,400
it's more about my experience as a tree

69
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,519
edger

70
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,400
for car hacking bug bashes so my

71
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,239
experience really

72
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,920
i've learned a lot from my experience as

73
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,879
a car hacker myself and as the one who

74
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,239
triaged

75
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:24,480
bugs that were submitted to a bug bash

76
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,000
where the company that i work with

77
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,879
so yep as a summary it's really

78
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,519
how to succeed in in a car hacking bug

79
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:36,640
bash

80
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,760
phone to own um any hacking contest that

81
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,760
involves hacking cars

82
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,680
and as what you can see from the picture

83
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,400
uh

84
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,519
you got spectres and

85
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,640
ian's aboard or mintenet and some of the

86
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,640
guys that you may be familiar with who

87
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,360
are in the car hacking village or

88
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,400
car hacking bug bashes and

89
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,920
the guys that that you can see in the

90
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,400
picture are actually successful

91
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,239
in being able to hack some of the

92
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,000
components of the vehicles or

93
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,519
some of the uh scopes of the

94
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,879
of the bug bashes so

95
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,680
this picture tells collaboration between

96
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,320
teams real

97
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,919
all right so this is a sample picture of

98
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:25,520
the car hacking blog bash

99
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,560
sample payout so two years ago we've

100
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,800
actually paid

101
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,639
224 hundred thousand us

102
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,160
dollars and you can see some of the top

103
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,960
uh car hackers the private user that you

104
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:39,520
can see

105
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,759
is uh wrong one and

106
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,280
um he choose to be anonymous but

107
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,680
if you go to the car hacking village you

108
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,120
might be familiar with him

109
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,520
i just don't want to you know spoil the

110
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,560
fun of

111
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,600
you know challenging you who that guy

112
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,120
might be or

113
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,600
uh maybe you want to guess him but he's

114
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,880
really a good car hacker

115
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,800
and then this is a sample clippings that

116
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,720
i got from zitidet

117
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,840
from the pawn to own contest so as what

118
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,560
you can see

119
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,639
a researcher duo who hacked tesla car

120
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,120
win the competition's overall standings

121
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,320
they also get to keep the car so imagine

122
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,479
that

123
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,880
team florist eight made up of amad kama

124
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,759
and richard

125
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,560
zoo hacked the tesla car via its browser

126
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,600
they use a

127
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,960
jet bug git bug in the browser renderer

128
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,320
process to execute

129
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,080
code on the car's firmware and show a

130
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,360
message on its

131
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,520
entertainment system or infotainment

132
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,639
system

133
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,720
as per the rules announced last fall the

134
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,479
dual now gets to keep the car

135
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,720
so which is very interesting you know if

136
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,000
you also get

137
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,919
the car itself from the car hacking bug

138
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:53,360
bash

139
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:58,800
so they also receive 3 500 35 000

140
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,680
us dollars as a reward so aside from the

141
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,319
car

142
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:05,520
they also get 35 000 us dollars

143
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,880
which is really good

144
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,440
so i guess this might you know encourage

145
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:18,800
some other hackers to hack cars as well

146
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,560
so the question now is what if

147
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,120
i am not a car hacker yet what if i'm

148
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,120
still starting what if i want to start

149
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:27,759
in

150
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,319
hacking cars so no need to worry about

151
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:30,880
that

152
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,160
i got you bud

153
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,240
uh first of all my favorite book about

154
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,680
car hacking is the car hackers handbook

155
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,319
a guide for the penetration tester by

156
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,720
craig smith

157
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,560
you could also go to the online version

158
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,840
which is for free

159
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,319
but if you want to buy the ebook or the

160
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:53,919
paperback

161
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:57,280
um it's on amazon or other

162
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,160
um bookstores that you could actually

163
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,440
buy i got the

164
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,880
back myself and it has a sign from craig

165
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,840
smith

166
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,800
so craig smith is really a good guy and

167
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,000
in fact

168
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,160
i've learned a lot from his book itself

169
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,880
there are also some good car hacking

170
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,720
resources which i want to

171
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,840
reiterate if you want to start your car

172
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,680
hacking journey or your

173
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,120
if you want to prepare for bug bash um

174
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,840
the first one is of course the nano can

175
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,880
which is

176
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,080
you know a five dollar car hacking or

177
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,599
can bus hacking tool that you could

178
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:38,800
actually

179
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,599
solder or play with uh i actually got

180
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,199
like

181
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,960
a lot of pcbs of them and also

182
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,080
i also got my own which i soldered and

183
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:50,800
also

184
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,240
mintonette gave me the

185
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,080
his version from a conference and

186
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,960
b sides i forgot the name but i got that

187
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,759
one

188
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:04,479
and then if you just go to his github

189
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:05,840
link you can see

190
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,440
the uh some of the sketches and also how

191
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,560
to create

192
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,240
the pcb or replicate the pcb

193
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,440
and then there's also a link from the

194
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,160
carhackingvillage.com

195
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,160
about getting started with car hacking

196
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,280
it's pretty much

197
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,199
like how to get started with

198
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,639
the can utils and you know

199
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,479
some techniques that you could use with

200
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,120
the can utils like ken stuffer

201
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,120
um kanji and also some of the can util

202
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,880
tools

203
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,399
and then of course

204
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,320
another tutorial by ian sabor

205
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,360
on a conference can bus basics with

206
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,959
hands-on fuzzing

207
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:55,120
the reason why i reiterate this because

208
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,200
ian subor simplified it

209
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,839
and also because um he has a good

210
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,600
hardware to practice with

211
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,120
in that song and

212
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,279
many of you may not know but ian aboard

213
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,360
is one of my mentors for car hacking as

214
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,880
well

215
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,600
and then next up we have a curated list

216
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,160
of awesome resources

217
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:23,839
books hardware

218
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,720
uh utilities tools people to follow

219
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,920
in the car hacking or automatic

220
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,200
automotive security field and then of

221
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,080
course uh

222
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,959
because car hacking also made an

223
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:52,480
inspiration to me to start car hacking

224
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,920
to start hacking cars i mean car hacking

225
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,959
village videos

226
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:00,720
it's in youtube as well so you could

227
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,079
visit that one and of course if you

228
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:06,079
are in a hacker conference please do

229
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:07,200
visit

230
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,440
it's car hacking village there are a lot

231
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,920
of hacker conferences right now

232
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,959
that have car hacking villages in fact

233
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:18,000
even in uh in my

234
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,839
country we started the car hacking

235
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:21,760
village we started from start

236
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,279
we've got simulators um

237
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:29,519
some um virtual

238
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,640
virtual boxes for running virtual cans

239
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,760
and also

240
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,000
some instrument clusters and some ecu's

241
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,680
that they could play with

242
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,320
and in other countries as well they

243
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:40,800
really

244
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,120
beef up their car hacking village in

245
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,200
fact some of the

246
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,200
conferences right now have their own

247
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,560
cars

248
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,320
that they want to show for car hacking

249
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,040
or

250
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,240
for other people to play with um

251
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,360
i myself i got to play like

252
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,920
i think that was like four years ago or

253
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,279
three years ago

254
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:06,800
with with a car that was presented in

255
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,160
the car hanging village in defcon before

256
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,720
and then there's also a good link

257
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,360
adventures in building a can bus differ

258
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,560
uh from tech maker ua my friends

259
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,000
founders

260
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,120
and uh the guys from techmaker ua they

261
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,120
are also very good

262
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,760
uh car hackers i've seen them how they

263
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,360
hack

264
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,480
i've seen how they got

265
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,160
some good prices and rewards for their

266
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,640
uh hacks that they did on a car hacking

267
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,680
blog bash

268
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,720
and the technique is you know

269
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,279
understanding the can bus and also it's

270
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:45,920
all about

271
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,940
teamwork and collaboration

272
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:51,440
[Music]

273
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,279
and then next is um

274
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:58,399
really how i started back in the day the

275
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,240
first thing that i did

276
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,600
it's really about baby steps and i think

277
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,440
you can also do it as well

278
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,560
first thing that that that i did the

279
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,880
first thing is

280
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,560
of course uh playing with my

281
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,880
infotainment system on my car

282
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,720
and i was able to you know uh

283
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,680
create my own poc and being able to

284
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,399
execute

285
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,760
command injection on the infotainment

286
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,320
system via the

287
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,200
universal serial bus or usb port and

288
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,720
then from the left side

289
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,240
i started with playing with an

290
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,240
instrument cluster which was given to me

291
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,360
by

292
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,279
um internet and then i used nanocan and

293
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:42,320
other

294
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,360
slcan devices to play with it

295
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,240
also uh the second cluster that i played

296
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,680
with was a master

297
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,560
instrument cluster which i myself and my

298
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,480
friend you know play with

299
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,279
it was really fun so i learned a lot

300
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:58,800
from that experience

301
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,480
so i know that a lot of guys started

302
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,600
with virtual can

303
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,680
based on the talks that i've seen from

304
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,519
other countries

305
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,920
i would i would really advise to start

306
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:10,720
playing with an

307
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,399
actual instrument cluster or you know

308
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,839
hook it up with an ecu or play with your

309
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,959
infotainment system but

310
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:22,840
you must know the risk of it

311
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,399
[Music]

312
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:27,120
and then of course like i said there are

313
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,800
some simulators that you can play with

314
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,600
uh you've got the uds simulator by craig

315
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,639
smith

316
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:37,120
you have the icm simulator by craig

317
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,320
smith

318
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,600
and also you've got um

319
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,199
there are actually hardwares that you

320
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:44,639
could buy for

321
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:49,199
an ecu simulator which you can see from

322
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:51,760
the left side of the screen or the

323
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,240
picture

324
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,399
that you can see when it has um

325
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:59,760
protocol and then you can see that the

326
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,120
mileage is off

327
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,240
so this is actually a sample ecu

328
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,800
simulator that i bought from taiwan

329
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,839
and i bought it from tmd it's

330
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,639
not really much of that you can play

331
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:15,360
with but it's a good thing to start with

332
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,120
so but if you want cheaper one i would

333
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,639
really advise

334
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,880
instrument cluster which costs like

335
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,240
twenty dollars

336
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,199
thirty dollars or forty dollars and if

337
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,800
you want to have

338
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,440
your own ecu kit it just costs like a

339
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,519
hundred dollars or a hundred and twenty

340
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:34,240
dollars

341
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,720
in ebay there are a lot of things that

342
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,880
you could buy on ebay in fact i've been

343
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,839
collecting

344
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,320
collecting some vintage computers as

345
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,680
well from ebay

346
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,320
uh uds server is one of my favorites as

347
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,160
well it allows you to

348
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,519
understand if you try to fuss the ecu

349
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,800
so craig smith did a good one on this

350
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,440
and also the instrument cluster

351
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,040
simulator

352
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,920
these are uh these tools are our

353
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,000
utilities are available in github for

354
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,279
free so

355
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:12,320
you know you might want to check it out

356
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,959
so like i said uh my main inspiration

357
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:16,560
really is

358
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,000
the car hacking village and um

359
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,720
when i first went to defcon which was my

360
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,079
first defcon was actually defcon 24.

361
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:29,120
and well i was just amazed

362
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,160
but this picture is actually from defcon

363
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,519
25 or 26

364
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:36,720
i think i took the picture myself

365
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:41,440
and there are actually some good bench

366
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,320
test bench that you can play with setups

367
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,920
that you can play with

368
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,440
so it's it's it's really fun that if you

369
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:55,839
visit the car hacking village

370
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:59,600
and then um my advice if you really want

371
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,800
to start

372
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,120
you know playing with the cannabis

373
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,560
network or

374
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,880
the other protocols of the car

375
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,000
i would suggest to embed invest or

376
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,440
acquire some tools required for

377
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,120
interacting with can

378
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,680
so here are some of the samples that i

379
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,680
have

380
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,480
i have a value can i have the canvas

381
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,399
differ by attack maker

382
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:28,320
i have nano can and

383
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,839
a p1 from

384
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:35,759
machina p1 so there are actually other

385
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:37,759
tools that i have in my box so i have my

386
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:38,560
own box

387
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,279
which contains some of the tools i used

388
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:42,000
for

389
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,959
playing with my car

390
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,079
so there's also some

391
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:53,440
open source tools that you could uh

392
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,839
start playing with so if you go to car

393
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:58,560
hacking tools by jay gamblin

394
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,279
um it's on github if you just clone it

395
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:02,560
there are

396
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,119
some tools that you could use with it's

397
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,720
a collection of scripts to help jump

398
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,880
start car research and hacking

399
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,359
and all the scripts are designed to run

400
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:12,559
on ubuntu

401
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:16,000
debian and kali and then

402
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,439
from the right side of the screen you

403
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:19,439
can actually see some of the tools that

404
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:20,160
are

405
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,559
in there

406
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,799
and then uh from what i usually see

407
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:32,000
from car hacking bug bashers

408
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,840
these are the common enterprise tools on

409
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,840
the block that they use so we have the

410
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,799
vehicle spy

411
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:39,200
and canoe right i don't want to promote

412
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,320
the product but you know

413
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,280
for we these are also good enterprise

414
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,000
tools and

415
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,720
i've seen a lot of guys using them as

416
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,960
well

417
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,720
then um like i said

418
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,120
car hacking bug bashes are not just for

419
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,559
car hackers

420
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:04,080
it's also for hardware hackers iot

421
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,360
hackers

422
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:09,679
and if you're good in network fan test

423
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:12,000
you could also bring some of the tools

424
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:12,960
that you used for

425
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,000
penetration testing and

426
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,960
i would like to reiterate that you need

427
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,000
to

428
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,160
prepare yourself and bring some of your

429
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,760
hardware hacking tools

430
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,840
or network hacking tools or pentas tools

431
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,679
in fact you can see from the box there

432
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:31,520
that i have a pineapple

433
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:35,039
i also have the hackaraf

434
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:38,880
alpha and also some canbus hacking tools

435
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,679
and zigbee device and also

436
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:47,200
some you know getting it getting with

437
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,840
hardware hacking to interact with the

438
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,600
uart

439
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,039
and some other hardware

440
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:58,240
uh you know instances that you can play

441
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,480
with

442
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,520
these are the sample ratings or common

443
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,880
classification

444
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,240
from bankroll.com vrt or the

445
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,760
vulnerability rating taxonomy um i'm one

446
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,679
of the guys who contributed to this one

447
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:18,400
which is actually open source

448
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,440
this actually serves as a guide

449
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,200
and for car hackers about the priority

450
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,919
of the vulnerabilities that you can

451
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:28,960
submit

452
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,880
to a car hacking blog bash or a contest

453
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,000
and so as you can see the first

454
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,760
uh the first one that you can see there

455
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,360
is the p2 leakage

456
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,400
and or the pii linkage i mean i'm sorry

457
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,600
about p2

458
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,000
and it's under p1 which is a critical

459
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,280
vulnerability

460
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,840
and then if you have key fob cloning if

461
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:50,960
you could

462
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,160
clone the key fob on the fro from the rf

463
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,039
hub

464
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:58,160
we consider that one as a p1 and

465
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,200
if we could execute

466
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,320
command injection from the infotainment

467
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:04,960
the radio

468
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:09,520
head unit and then you are able to

469
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:13,039
uh go to the can bus

470
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:16,720
you you do a can bus pivot or pivot

471
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,000
so that we consider that one as a p2

472
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,559
and if there is no can bus pivot just

473
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:23,919
command injection

474
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:27,280
it's pretty much like p3 and there are

475
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,480
also some

476
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,280
can injections that you could refer to

477
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,880
take for example

478
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,799
the battery management system the

479
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,240
steering control

480
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,720
uh the pyrotechnical device development

481
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,039
tool the headlights the sensors

482
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:44,480
uh it's pretty much like p3 if you could

483
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,480
interact with it

484
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,000
we used to have this as p1 but

485
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,960
um we did some classification we

486
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,080
reorganized it

487
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,919
with a classification together with our

488
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:57,760
partner and we decided

489
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:01,679
it would be a p3 based on the tara or

490
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:02,080
you know

491
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,679
threat assessment that we have but

492
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:08,720
what remains is of course if you could

493
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:13,520
um you know do key fob cloning

494
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:17,520
ota firmware manipulation that's p2

495
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,240
do a code execution or a can injection

496
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,600
from the rf hub that's considered as p2

497
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,120
so if you need to go to

498
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,159
background.com vrt you are free to do so

499
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:33,600
it's free open source in fact any car

500
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,360
hackers could also contribute to the

501
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,480
github

502
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,039
so that they can suggest some of the

503
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:40,080
attacks that

504
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:45,840
can be done from the car

505
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:49,120
next up is wait what's this

506
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,159
classification

507
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:52,799
so i want to simplify it the reason why

508
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:55,760
we have those classification is because

509
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:59,840
we want to assess

510
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,320
the attacks that are done of course

511
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,600
we we used to have

512
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:11,679
an incomplete task of prioritizing

513
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:15,039
car hacking bugs or automotive security

514
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:16,000
bugs

515
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,480
but right now with the improvement for

516
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,440
the vrt for automotive security bugs

517
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,600
we've classified it based on

518
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,120
the impact of the bug the exploitability

519
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,159
of the bug

520
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:33,120
the proof of concept that the hacker

521
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,240
presented

522
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,919
the proximity of the attack and also the

523
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:39,120
cia triad

524
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,400
no not the mafia but it's the

525
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,559
confidentiality

526
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:45,840
integrity and availability so we also

527
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,600
consider that one take for example the

528
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,520
pii leakage so

529
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:53,120
um of course the more ranking of

530
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,760
the confidentiality for that because

531
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,320
those are

532
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,200
personable identified identifiable

533
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,960
information

534
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,679
and this there are other things that we

535
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:04,400
classify

536
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,520
and it's part of our threat assessment

537
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,000
and rumination analysis or tera

538
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,120
so p1 is critical

539
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,159
and p4 is low

540
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:18,960
and if it's p5 it's pretty much not

541
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,679
rewardable or out of scope for

542
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:25,039
a car hacking block bash

543
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:29,600
here are some some common checklist or

544
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,320
common bugs or common issues

545
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:36,000
the reason why i put this one on

546
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,880
on the slide is you know to give some

547
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,080
information about

548
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,120
some of the common checklists or hacks

549
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,760
uh the car hackers do first before

550
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,480
anything else

551
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:51,039
um one of the things that they do

552
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:51,760
usually

553
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,559
is to send messages from the dirty side

554
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:55,600
to the clean side

555
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,960
and most of the these are ready to ecu

556
00:23:58,960 --> 00:23:59,840
resets

557
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,400
uh airbag deployment via the obd2 for

558
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,440
example

559
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,240
uh infotainment radio control controls

560
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,760
etc or radio

561
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,480
head units so if they can send messages

562
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,559
from the dirty side to the clean side

563
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:14,799
that's something that they usually look

564
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:16,400
for because

565
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,960
they just don't know maybe they will get

566
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,159
rewarded and

567
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:23,440
in fact um two years ago for this kind

568
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,080
of hacks

569
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:27,600
uh the rewards are pretty much like 25

570
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:32,159
000 us dollars just for this um

571
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:35,760
you never know uh you also

572
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,799
get to find these kind of attacks but

573
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:41,200
the problem is in a car hacking bug bash

574
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,200
these are the most common ones that are

575
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,080
found

576
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:47,440
that means that um it should be the

577
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,679
first reporter who should be rewarded

578
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:52,000
so the chances are if you are not fast

579
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:52,720
enough

580
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,840
to do this uh someone could get

581
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:59,679
uh could beat you and your budge

582
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:02,960
will just get duplicated right so it's

583
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,320
pretty much like

584
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:09,440
um always create a better plc

585
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,640
and then submit it right away

586
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,960
okay so you need to submit it right away

587
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,080
with a good poc

588
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:22,320
next is injecting disallowed messages in

589
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,679
the can bus so

590
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:25,919
these are also some of the common things

591
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:26,960
that they do

592
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,480
so they inject the salad messages which

593
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,919
can or which can cause a denial service

594
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:34,640
or

595
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,600
interact with some of the uh components

596
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,080
or

597
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:41,279
attack services of a car

598
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:45,440
and then um of course th this one uh

599
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:49,600
uh so far uh i've seen like

600
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,840
two submissions on this or four

601
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:52,960
submissions

602
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,480
and previews uh car hacking bug bashes

603
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,360
but these are actually known hacks and

604
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,640
i've seen

605
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,000
uh some friends at from china

606
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,799
who've actually submitted this one as

607
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:08,400
cvs for

608
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,000
other cars and then in fact bmw

609
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,200
has some cvs related to this one and if

610
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,559
um it's found by

611
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:22,480
someone from i forgot i'm sorry i forgot

612
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,720
but it's a known company as well but

613
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,159
format string vulnerabilities to the

614
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:30,080
infotainment radiohead units

615
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,440
uh via bluetooth wi-fi or radio

616
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,240
these are some of the common bugs so and

617
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:36,880
also

618
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,799
are very easy to replicate and also very

619
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:41,760
easy

620
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:45,279
to conduct so or you know uses a proof

621
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:47,120
of concept so if you

622
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,279
take for example name your cell phone or

623
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:50,159
your wi-fi

624
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:53,840
to point

625
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:58,640
point zero zero or uh percentage

626
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,760
x percentage x percentage x and then if

627
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,480
you

628
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,640
let your car connect to it and it costs

629
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,880
the of service so that's a sample of a

630
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,559
format string

631
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:11,840
vulnerability or attack

632
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,799
and then we have no authentication at

633
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,279
services for telematics infotainment

634
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:21,760
infotainment radiohead units so

635
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,880
it could be that if you connect your car

636
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,880
to the internet or to your router or to

637
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,399
your isp

638
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:31,440
and then if you try to you know do a

639
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,559
recon

640
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:35,760
and use nmap to scan for the services

641
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,760
some of the most common things that you

642
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,960
could discover

643
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:43,120
are no authentication when you do a

644
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:43,679
telnet

645
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:46,080
to one of the services like for example

646
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,120
on port

647
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,080
uh 23 which is of course a telnet and

648
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,840
then there are also some ports wherein

649
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:52,720
if you just use

650
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,760
netcat uh you are taken to a shell right

651
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,200
away so

652
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,600
those are some of the common uh common

653
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,440
things that are found and

654
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,760
if you're not fast enough your bug will

655
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,720
get duplicated

656
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,279
next is denial of service on the canvas

657
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:12,240
network using can bus floods

658
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,480
the fire hose attacks so there are if

659
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,360
you could

660
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,960
somehow cause a denial of service um

661
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,039
it's also rewardable but in some car

662
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:23,440
hacking bug bashes or contests

663
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,000
it could be uh out of scope so you need

664
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,200
to read the scope for that one

665
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,720
uh replay relay and roll jump attacks on

666
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,840
the kifa

667
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,760
in most car hacking bunk bashes they are

668
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,360
considered as p5

669
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:41,200
but you never know maybe uh in some

670
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,960
contests they are considered as p4 or p3

671
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,200
so you know maybe you might want to try

672
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,320
your luck but

673
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,159
be sure to read the program brief if

674
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:53,440
they are out of scope

675
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,520
and then i'll say firmware manipulation

676
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,279
it's also one of the common bugs that

677
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:58,720
are submitted

678
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:02,080
um key fob cloning source code

679
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:05,840
source code dump not just the ecu but

680
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,799
of course some of the hardware for the

681
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:10,960
infotainment system the radiohead unit

682
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,080
and other

683
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,440
um hardwares that are in there

684
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,559
especially for example the security

685
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:21,440
security gateway which are considered to

686
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,279
be firewalls

687
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:26,399
you know for the cars

688
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:29,279
then um bluetooth stack buffer overflow

689
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:32,480
which leads to remote code execution

690
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,520
i mean to code execution so

691
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,480
uh tencent security keenlab have a lot

692
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,159
of proof of concepts on

693
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:42,159
on this from their blog so if if you

694
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:43,360
want to

695
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,559
visit their blog they have actual

696
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:48,960
good proof of context uh proof of

697
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,720
concept about

698
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:54,080
buffer overflows related to the

699
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,399
infotainment system

700
00:29:56,399 --> 00:30:00,080
and other system as well

701
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,320
and then code execution via the usb

702
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,039
drive the sd card sd drive etc

703
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:06,640
so these are some of the common

704
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,080
checklist or

705
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:12,799
bugs next up of course this is a sample

706
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:16,240
tip if you can send any of these frames

707
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,360
from the dirty side

708
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:21,760
so take for example the obd2

709
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,960
or the infotainment system if yes

710
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:28,080
it is considered as a p1

711
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,880
or considered as broken off or secure

712
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,000
gateway

713
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,360
bypass if there is an sgw or secure

714
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,640
gateway

715
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:40,159
and then these scan frames

716
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:44,080
um 7df or 7e1

717
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,640
if you could actually do this and then

718
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,720
how do you know if it's successful

719
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,399
this should be the positive reflex from

720
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:52,480
the frame so you have zero two five one

721
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,679
zero one

722
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:56,240
and the negative responses starts with

723
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,320
zero times zero three

724
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:02,000
and um the this actually allows you to

725
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:02,799
do

726
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:06,720
ecu hard resets on the car

727
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,760
yep if we could do this on an obd2 port

728
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:13,919
that's something that we re we reward

729
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:17,600
and then if you could somehow interact

730
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,080
with

731
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,640
unauthorized scan access i got this

732
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,880
picture from black hat and

733
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,720
if you could actually find some of the

734
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,080
things you know

735
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,760
an authorized can access and then you

736
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,760
interact with it

737
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,760
you may never know what you can discover

738
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:34,158
as well

739
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,480
this is a sample of a poc for a fire

740
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,279
hose attack

741
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:42,559
uh we're in a bash strip

742
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:45,679
you send uh

743
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:49,279
the arbitration ib00 and the

744
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:52,799
um zero zero data

745
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:55,760
so maybe you don't know that you could

746
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,840
also perform can injection or denial of

747
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:01,840
service

748
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,720
next is one of the tools that i really

749
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,519
like which i

750
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:08,559
discovered from the car hack car hackers

751
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:10,960
handbook

752
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:16,559
if you are sad or if sad with you uh the

753
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:18,799
the ideas that you found that you could

754
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:19,840
try

755
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,960
or recon and do a uds

756
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,440
discovery with caring caribou it's open

757
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,080
source and you need python 3

758
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,960
and make sure to install python can for

759
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,200
python 3 so that it will work

760
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,720
uh if you have problems with making it

761
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,360
work

762
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,840
just message me on twitter

763
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:44,480
of i really like to play with it and you

764
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,120
know

765
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:48,080
i fix most of some of the people's

766
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,279
problems with it

767
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:52,080
but it's really good it's one of it's

768
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,120
one of my

769
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,080
favorite tools for uds discovery and in

770
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,360
fact there are some

771
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,720
some of um util

772
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,919
utilities you can do with uh carrying

773
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:04,799
caribou

774
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:08,000
it's a car exploration tool

775
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,720
so you can do uh there's also a command

776
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,919
that lets you do an

777
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:14,960
ecu hard reset on it or interact with

778
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:19,120
xcp so might want to

779
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:24,000
clone carrying cardboard right now

780
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,840
and then of course uh

781
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:32,320
people think that metasploit is

782
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:35,360
you know nothing that you could play

783
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,960
with for card hacking

784
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,320
but people are wrong about it

785
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:43,919
if you go to automotive

786
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:45,679
you use the command search automotive

787
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:47,679
with metasploit you will find

788
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:51,840
some eight modules that are written

789
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,600
geared towards car hacking

790
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,600
and of course you need the hardware

791
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,600
bridge server for it

792
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:01,519
and also the uh

793
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:05,120
you know you need to

794
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:09,040
interact with the can to play with it

795
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:12,000
so there there's the can flood which can

796
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:12,960
be used you know

797
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,918
to perform uh denial of service on the

798
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:16,320
can

799
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,320
and then there's a module to probe

800
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:21,440
different data points in a can packet

801
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,280
get the vehicle information such as the

802
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,040
vin from the target module

803
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:28,159
uh scan bus for diagnostic modules

804
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:31,440
and then there there are you may you may

805
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,560
want to consider it

806
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,960
as an auxiliary module that allows you

807
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,199
to

808
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:41,280
flood the temp gauge on a 2006 malibu

809
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,639
and maybe you don't know

810
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:45,679
maybe you could also cause a dos if you

811
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:46,239
try to

812
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:49,040
work it work on it on some some of the

813
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,719
cars

814
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:52,399
uh that you can play with and then

815
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:54,320
there's a master ii instrument cluster

816
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,440
accelerometer

817
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,960
mover which i actually created and then

818
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:02,640
um this uh the last one is

819
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:05,280
uh the pdt module which allows you to

820
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,680
check for prep the pyrotechnic devices

821
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,359
the airbags

822
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:12,560
battery clamps etc and it allows you to

823
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,760
deploy airbags

824
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,599
if it's vulnerable to the simple

825
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:17,760
algorithm in unlocking the

826
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,680
airbugs through the can so there's a

827
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,119
good paper about it

828
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,599
in fact if you use the info from the

829
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:24,400
module

830
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,440
you will see the actual pdf file that

831
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,320
contains

832
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,920
the research about it so if you want to

833
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,359
try playing with it

834
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:36,160
you can fire up your virtual can and

835
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,839
then you know

836
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:42,560
um use the modules to see for yourself

837
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:45,599
some of the sample attacks you know

838
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:48,720
in the can bus network

839
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:53,200
and here's a sample i used the uh

840
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,640
can can flood and then

841
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,800
just a sample on a weekend zero which is

842
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,240
a virtual can

843
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:04,880
and when i tried kanda these are

844
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:08,480
some of the things that i can see from

845
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:11,680
the dump of the can bus so

846
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:15,200
you can see that there are a lot of

847
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:18,960
arbitration ids and then some subsets of

848
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:19,440
data

849
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,920
or different kinds of data being thrown

850
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:22,960
in so

851
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,440
that's just a sample and you never know

852
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,480
maybe you could use it

853
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,520
there's also a good hardware hacking

854
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,440
cheat sheet for hardware hackers out

855
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,480
there

856
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:37,599
it's made by m aaron magish i

857
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:41,599
saw this one in a sphere and i decided

858
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:42,320
to

859
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:45,599
place this one of course credits to him

860
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:46,800
these are some of the things that you

861
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,839
could play with um if you have some

862
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:51,839
if there are some hardware that you

863
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:52,880
could rip off

864
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,720
during the car hacking bug batches which

865
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:55,920
is actually true

866
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,520
there are some hardware that will be

867
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,599
given to you that you can play with

868
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:01,119
so you know fire up some of your

869
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:04,400
hardware hacking tools with it

870
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,440
and then there's a good guide for

871
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,640
example

872
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:12,320
um there's a link on it

873
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,079
from the mass that weeks which is on a

874
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:16,079
master infotainment system

875
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:19,920
uh we play with in getting a shell so

876
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,880
you have the rxdx and the ground where

877
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,640
to place it so

878
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:27,760
uh this serves that you could actually

879
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,880
play with

880
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,760
some of the infotainment system because

881
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,480
most of them

882
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:36,000
are have uart on it or

883
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,320
other hardware hacking for referrals

884
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,320
so this is one of the things that i

885
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,000
would like to reiterate

886
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,359
car hacking bug bashes

887
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:52,720
it's not just about iot hardware radio

888
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:55,040
and can bus attacks

889
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,200
web and mobile hacking are also

890
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,640
essential kills

891
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:03,040
uh skills i mean android and ios apps

892
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,200
connected through telemetry or for

893
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:08,799
interfacing with the infotainment

894
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,400
these are some of the things that you

895
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,960
could hack update servers

896
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,960
firmware updates cloud for example

897
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,680
you need to think how connected is the

898
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,200
car does it have api

899
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:24,640
endpoints so how do you do that if

900
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:27,040
you want to try it so you need to do a

901
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:27,760
recon and

902
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,680
identify attack services that have web

903
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,440
servers and apis

904
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,839
and what you're gonna do with it of

905
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:35,920
course the os top 10

906
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:39,040
right because the os top 10 is

907
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:39,920
everywhere

908
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:43,359
so maybe there's a web server up or

909
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:46,800
there's an api that your infotainment or

910
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,720
one of the mobile apps that your car is

911
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,079
connected to

912
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:53,359
has it connects to a certain api

913
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:55,440
maybe you could do sql injection on the

914
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,119
update server as well

915
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:59,440
or maybe there are some things that you

916
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,800
can do with

917
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,560
the update server called command

918
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,480
injection so they are

919
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:08,720
somehow could be part of the scope

920
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,359
and then web web hacking essential

921
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:12,800
skills you have

922
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,280
the oas often vulnerabilities burp and

923
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,440
os is a friend

924
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:21,119
um you need to you know try intercepting

925
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:22,320
requests

926
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,960
from the mobile app the update servers

927
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,200
and the pki bridge

928
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:30,960
and i would highly recommend sqlpy burp

929
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,160
extension

930
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:35,839
it's a good tool for automating your

931
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:39,200
sql injection attacks in burp and

932
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,680
another thing that you can do is if you

933
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,760
could check if you can manipulate some

934
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:47,680
vehicle functions with unprotected apis

935
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:51,119
all right so these are the reasons why

936
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:57,280
web hacking is essential

937
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:00,000
another thing is mobile hacking is also

938
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,680
an essential skill

939
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:04,800
so you have the apps that you can

940
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,560
interface with

941
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:09,920
you know your vehicle so especially with

942
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,280
the infotainment system or the

943
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,640
entertainment system

944
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,960
so you need to decompile the binaries

945
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:17,119
the apk or the ipa

946
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:20,160
and then i would recommend genie motion

947
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:23,359
for android emulation and

948
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:26,000
so that it's easier for you to intercept

949
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,280
the request

950
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:30,319
via burp proxy and then

951
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:33,760
another thing that you can check with is

952
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:36,079
to check for possible clear text

953
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:37,680
database storage

954
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:40,720
like the sqlite database so if you could

955
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:43,920
find um information

956
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,920
that's actually one of the bugs we are

957
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,440
looking for

958
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:50,480
and then yep all was really

959
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:53,040
applies to this as well because you can

960
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,560
intercept the request

961
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:58,400
from burp and then adb shell is love

962
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:03,280
if um there are some android devices

963
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,960
connected to the car especially the

964
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,200
infotainment system so why don't you try

965
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,280
to fire up adb shell

966
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:12,480
and then always check for hard-coded api

967
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,599
keys when you

968
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:17,119
have a decompiled binaries for apk or

969
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:19,440
ipa you never know what you can find

970
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,640
really

971
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,760
so the last one

972
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,560
is to repeat and check how the app

973
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,880
interfaces with the car

974
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:32,160
and if this is not enough uh

975
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:35,520
go to the os mobile checklist or

976
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,599
top 10 there are some things that you

977
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:39,839
can learn for mobile hacking

978
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:42,160
especially for apps attackers who are

979
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:45,359
not into mobile hacking

980
00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:50,240
so here's the sample for example

981
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,400
um i'm not sure if you guys remember the

982
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,319
nissan leaf fiasco

983
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:57,839
but the problem with that is the vein

984
00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:00,960
the vin was used for authorization

985
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,720
purposes and controlling some of the

986
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,119
features take for example the check

987
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:06,560
climate control

988
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:09,680
so the whole api is authenticated and

989
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,040
only require the bin

990
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:14,079
to target a vehicle so the url

991
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:17,520
domain is redacted but here is a sample

992
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:20,800
um request a get request that

993
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,640
if you have the complete vienna of the

994
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,040
car you could actually control some of

995
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,400
the features

996
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,520
of the nissan leaf which is a hybrid

997
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:32,800
which is an electric car and this is a

998
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,440
sample of being able to

999
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,200
do the check climate control and then

1000
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,359
you are given with the response

1001
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:41,599
and from this you can see that the whole

1002
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:42,839
api is

1003
00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:46,079
unauthenticated uh

1004
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:48,319
if you go to the link below credits to

1005
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:50,480
try hand you can see some of the

1006
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,640
things that were done in assessment of

1007
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:54,879
this

1008
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:57,839
so yeah web hacking is an essential

1009
00:42:57,839 --> 00:43:00,160
skill

1010
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:03,359
next up what if you're in the event

1011
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:04,160
right now

1012
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,160
okay what if you're in the bug bash

1013
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:08,000
right now it's day one

1014
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,960
you're scared okay because you don't

1015
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,079
know some of the people

1016
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:15,359
but yeah really most of the kayaking bug

1017
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:16,319
batches

1018
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:19,520
they really know the people but um

1019
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:21,280
it's just that maybe some of the people

1020
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:24,079
there are two or three or five people

1021
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:26,240
that are actually new to the car hacking

1022
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:27,359
block bashes

1023
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:31,359
or new to car hacking so but

1024
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:35,440
car hacking is a uh is really a small

1025
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:36,400
world because

1026
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:39,440
um in a car hacking village i think most

1027
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,520
of the people that i met there

1028
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:44,160
i have seen in some of the car hacking

1029
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:47,920
bug matches as well or contests

1030
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:50,000
right so the first thing that you need

1031
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
to do is

1032
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,920
you need to read the program brief or

1033
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,200
rules in the bug bash

1034
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:58,720
all right take note of the scope of the

1035
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,800
program

1036
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:04,160
and then um you need to focus on the

1037
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:06,160
scope and exclusion of the program

1038
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:07,920
take for example these are the common

1039
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:09,839
ones that are out of scope

1040
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:12,960
gps spoofing uh denial service via cat

1041
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,560
injection

1042
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:17,280
no i would like to reiterate that please

1043
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,079
don't

1044
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:21,119
uh submit out of scope bugs if it's in

1045
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:22,720
the brief

1046
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:26,160
no need to submit about it you could get

1047
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:28,000
penalized for it

1048
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,599
so um

1049
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:34,400
the program brief also contains some of

1050
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:37,440
the things that you may want to look for

1051
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,599
so it could be that the program reef

1052
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:40,960
would say that

1053
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:44,160
we want to look for firmer

1054
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:47,599
ota manipulation how you can uh

1055
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:50,160
reverse engineer the firmware so somehow

1056
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:52,640
it also gives you

1057
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:55,359
an overview about what to hack okay it

1058
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:56,800
also contains

1059
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:59,920
take for example we want our

1060
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:02,319
gateway to bypass here are some of the

1061
00:45:02,319 --> 00:45:03,680
things that you can do

1062
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:06,720
so those are some of the things that you

1063
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,560
can read from the program brief it also

1064
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:09,599
gives you

1065
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:12,480
somehow common attacks that you can do

1066
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:15,040
with a car

1067
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,960
and then check on what security bugs are

1068
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,800
of interest to the program

1069
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,400
so you have the authentication or

1070
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:23,839
firewall bypass

1071
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:27,359
can injection attacks code execution and

1072
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:29,599
again what can messages can you send

1073
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:30,800
from the dirty side

1074
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,920
so these are one of the common ones

1075
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:36,720
the program brief also has this kind of

1076
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:38,480
information

1077
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:41,520
so that's why always read the program

1078
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:44,720
brief or the rules

1079
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:49,440
so do you need more um

1080
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,359
if you want more information maybe you

1081
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:53,760
could ask the program owners or

1082
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:56,480
the ase assigned maybe you could ask for

1083
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,079
dbc files

1084
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:00,079
which are proprietary format that

1085
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:02,560
describes the data over a canvas

1086
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,720
known issues and vehicle network

1087
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,000
architecture

1088
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,480
so in some cases they would provide the

1089
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:10,400
vehicle network architecture

1090
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:13,119
and in some cases as well they could

1091
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:14,880
provide known issues that were submitted

1092
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,720
before and maybe you could

1093
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:19,440
somehow create a bypass for it if it's

1094
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:20,240
fixed

1095
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:22,960
maybe create a bypass for it or submit

1096
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:23,760
it again and

1097
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:27,359
check if you can do another technique

1098
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:28,000
related to

1099
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,319
it do you have friends in the event

1100
00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:34,319
if you're in the event how about team up

1101
00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:35,760
or collaborate

1102
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,920
one of the things that i notice is some

1103
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,319
of the most successful or

1104
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:42,960
bugs were submitted involve

1105
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,000
collaboration

1106
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,680
right there are um in fact there's

1107
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:49,760
there was a team before they were

1108
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:51,359
composed of

1109
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:53,920
i think more than five people and they

1110
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:55,280
submitted

1111
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:59,440
more bugs right than other

1112
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:02,640
than other um than other players or than

1113
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:03,760
other

1114
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:06,480
teams but you know it's really good

1115
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:07,040
because

1116
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:08,319
it has something to do with

1117
00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:10,720
collaboration teaming up

1118
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:14,160
and then you know they got some good

1119
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:15,839
rewards as well that they could

1120
00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:18,640
you know just split up so take for

1121
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:20,079
example

1122
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:24,400
uh they got a p1 and they're

1123
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:28,480
only two so pretty much like

1124
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:30,480
what if they got thirty thousand us

1125
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:32,480
dollars as a reward they can split it up

1126
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:33,440
for

1127
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:36,480
fifteen hundreds us dollars right

1128
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,720
so it's all about collaboration i've

1129
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:41,200
seen some good collaboration

1130
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:44,960
and if you want if you have tools that

1131
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:46,000
are

1132
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,119
um that you don't have maybe you want to

1133
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:51,200
get that guy and collaborate with

1134
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:53,359
right and if you think that there is

1135
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:55,520
something that could be done with

1136
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:58,160
um the radio and you don't have much

1137
00:47:58,160 --> 00:47:59,839
information about the radio but you know

1138
00:47:59,839 --> 00:48:01,119
a guy that

1139
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:04,319
probably knows more about radio security

1140
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:05,680
then maybe you could

1141
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:07,839
team up with that guy all right i've

1142
00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:08,880
seen some

1143
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:10,960
people collaborating even though they

1144
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,640
don't know the person

1145
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:15,119
or they just heard of the person or

1146
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:16,960
they've noticed

1147
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:19,200
that person playing or poking something

1148
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:20,800
during the car hacking blog pass

1149
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:25,040
all right don't be shy make friends

1150
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:30,800
so next up is how to write a good report

1151
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:34,079
all right you need to to submit clear

1152
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:36,800
reproduction steps this is a sample

1153
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:40,559
so you need to describe

1154
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:43,680
the vulnerability and you need to

1155
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:46,640
enumerate the replication steps you need

1156
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:48,880
to make sure that it's easy

1157
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:52,240
to understand for the triager or the one

1158
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:53,599
that will be handling

1159
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:56,240
the report so they for example rename

1160
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:58,319
your phone to blah blah blah

1161
00:48:58,319 --> 00:48:59,599
connect your pair your phone to the

1162
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:01,520
infotainment via bluetooth

1163
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:03,440
use the navigation buttons to control

1164
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,200
the infotainment and it should remain

1165
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:06,000
stuck

1166
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,319
with which means you were able to break

1167
00:49:08,319 --> 00:49:09,839
the infotainment system

1168
00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:13,440
and then um provide another information

1169
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:16,160
i also tried restarting the infotainment

1170
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:16,960
and this

1171
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:20,079
does not resolve the issue it only works

1172
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:20,960
fine

1173
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:24,160
after doing a hard reset blah blah blah

1174
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:24,960
blah

1175
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:26,960
and then make sure to submit a

1176
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:29,599
screenshot or a picture of the bar

1177
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:32,880
right if there is a picture

1178
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:35,680
it's easier to reproduce as well if you

1179
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:37,040
have a video

1180
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:40,640
attach a video all right don't let the

1181
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:43,279
tree edger

1182
00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:46,000
left in hanging when you submit a report

1183
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:46,800
all right

1184
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:50,079
make sure you include all the poc steps

1185
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:53,599
easy to understand pictures

1186
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:57,520
and also videos if you could reproduce a

1187
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:58,720
video

1188
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:01,839
right or also provide

1189
00:50:01,839 --> 00:50:05,440
