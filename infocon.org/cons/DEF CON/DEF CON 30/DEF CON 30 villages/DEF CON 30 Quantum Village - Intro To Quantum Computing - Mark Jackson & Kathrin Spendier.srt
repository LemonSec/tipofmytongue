1
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:11,280
hello Quantum Village People it's uh

2
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,259
it's great to be here so I'm Mark

3
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:14,580
Jackson

4
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,680
and this is Catherine spender and we are

5
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,900
the quantum evangelists that's actually

6
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:21,779
our title at Continuum how many of you

7
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:24,720
have heard of Continuum

8
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,619
no okay good so um so Continuum is the

9
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:30,359
recent merger between Honeywell Quantum

10
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:32,520
Solutions and Cambridge Quantum

11
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,739
Computing and so uh we're one of the

12
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:36,059
largest Quantum Computing companies in

13
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:37,320
the world and we're very proud to be

14
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,600
here taking part in the world's first

15
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,600
Quantum Village and Quantum Capture the

16
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,000
Flag competition so there are three

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,680
parts to what I want to talk to you

18
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,239
about today

19
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,100
the first is just what is quantum

20
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,719
Computing because I think a lot of you

21
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:53,520
based on some of the discussions that

22
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,500
we've had here in the back don't know

23
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:56,760
what Quantum Computing is and how

24
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,920
amazing it is and and what it's good for

25
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,379
even the second part is going to be

26
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:04,019
about ticket which is our software

27
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:05,700
development kit

28
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,619
um and uh and it's open source and it's

29
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:09,840
free and it's available for anyone to

30
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,780
use and in particular it's the basis for

31
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,580
a lot of the challenge problems that we

32
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:17,159
have set for capture the flag and there

33
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:19,260
might be hints and things in there and

34
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:21,180
so us all talk generally about what

35
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,040
ticket is and how it can help you and

36
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,020
then Catherine is going to take over and

37
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,000
she's going to go through some examples

38
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,460
and again this might be useful for

39
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:30,960
someone to capture the flag type

40
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,360
challenge problems so um so that's what

41
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,460
we have today for the next hour or so

42
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:38,579
and tomorrow my colleague Thomas over

43
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:40,259
there in the back he's going to be

44
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:42,420
talking about Quantum natural language

45
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:46,320
processing and things like that so uh so

46
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,840
let's get started so why all this fuss

47
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,060
about Quantum Computing why do we go to

48
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,920
all the bother of building quantum

49
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,420
computers like you just heard about from

50
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:57,240
Oxford Quantum circuits it's not just

51
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,579
because quantum computers are a faster

52
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:02,399
computer that's not it it's because we

53
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:03,720
think they will be able to do things

54
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,340
that we never ever could have done

55
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:08,098
before and a prime example is in

56
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:09,720
chemistry so there on the upper left

57
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,760
hand corner this is my favorite molecule

58
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,319
this is caffeine

59
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:16,260
it's not an especially large molecule

60
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,540
we know what the equations are we've

61
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:19,980
known for a hundred years what the

62
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,720
equations are to simulate this on a

63
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,800
computer

64
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,840
the problem is that if you put this on a

65
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,760
computer it would need to be about the

66
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,099
size of the Earth to do this to figure

67
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:32,160
out the chemical properties of caffeine

68
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,720
uh if you wanted to put this on a

69
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,819
computer and if you wanted a larger

70
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:38,340
molecule like penicillin there

71
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,379
it's not even theoretically possible you

72
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:41,760
would need a computer the size of the

73
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,739
entire universe to do that

74
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:45,780
so clearly normal computers have a lot

75
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:48,540
of problem simulating molecules and

76
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:51,000
figuring out chemical properties now in

77
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,920
contrast quantum computers can do this

78
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:56,280
with a very modest number of qubits so a

79
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,560
qubit is the basic ingredient in a

80
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,780
quantum computer it stands for Quantum

81
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,480
bit and we spell it there with a Q and

82
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,700
as you've just heard we're talking about

83
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,560
building quantum computers with

84
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,420
thousands or hundreds of thousands or

85
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:12,720
millions of qubits so just try to think

86
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,220
about that for a second that's how

87
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,379
powerful quantum computers are compared

88
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:18,840
to normal computers the amazing thing is

89
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,060
this is not science fiction we actually

90
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,980
have quantum computers so you've just

91
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:25,739
heard about one from from oqc using

92
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:28,379
superconducting technology and this is a

93
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:30,480
technology used by IBM and Google and

94
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,300
several others we have one at Continuum

95
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:36,360
which uses ion trap technology there's a

96
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,400
photonic approach and there's many

97
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,620
others so we we don't just have one

98
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,180
method of building quantum computers we

99
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,640
have several each of of which has

100
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,680
advantages and disadvantages there's no

101
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,780
obvious winner yet

102
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,760
I'm sure every person in this room has

103
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,200
heard of Moore's Law

104
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,180
so we have seen over several decades

105
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,220
that computers have doubled in power

106
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:58,739
roughly every 18 months or so

107
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:00,959
quantum computers are in a much faster

108
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,480
trajectory so this top line here this

109
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,459
shows the progress made in What's called

110
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:06,959
the quantum volume which is kind of an

111
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:08,400
estimate of the power of a quantum

112
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,200
computer and we've been able to increase

113
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,439
this by a factor of 10 every year

114
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,840
so because of this we think that we will

115
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,940
have commercial applications in as soon

116
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:20,820
as three years this is this is not 20

117
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,380
years from now maybe they'll be useful

118
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:25,380
we think in just a few years companies

119
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:27,240
will be deploying Quantum software to

120
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,580
solve real world problems so this is why

121
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,380
we're so excited about it and this is

122
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,300
why we're here today to get you

123
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:36,479
programming on quantum computers

124
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,160
this is what a Quantum program looks

125
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,840
like I've had many people come up to me

126
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,360
and ask well I'm a programmer how can I

127
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,160
start programming quantum computers it

128
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,560
is completely different the whole logic

129
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,479
behind programming quantum computers is

130
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,820
based on quantum physics and so this is

131
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,320
how we do it I know it kind of looks

132
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,180
like a child's game or something but

133
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,639
every horizontal line represents a qubit

134
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,340
every colored block represents an

135
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,919
operation on the qubit

136
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,139
so we initialize them and then we do all

137
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:06,540
these operations and we put the qubits

138
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:09,060
in what are called superpositions which

139
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,620
means they're they exist in two

140
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,000
different configurations at the same

141
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,400
time or entanglement which means the

142
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,740
value of this qubit depends on the value

143
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:19,259
of this qubit even if they're separated

144
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:21,300
and this is a purely quantum physics

145
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,460
effect and then at the end of the

146
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,500
calculation we measure the qubits we

147
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,199
force them to choose are you zero or are

148
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:29,220
you one

149
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,500
up until then it's in this weird Quantum

150
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,539
State and that's what a Content program

151
00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:36,479
does it mixes them all up so that the

152
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,639
correct answer pops out at the end and

153
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,979
the wrong answers get diminished but we

154
00:05:40,979 --> 00:05:42,780
don't get to find out what it is until

155
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:45,780
the very very end

156
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,699
this is what we think we can do with a

157
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:49,139
quantum computer these are some of the

158
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:52,199
applications and I want to mention this

159
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:54,360
is probably a very incomplete list

160
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,820
there's probably going to be some very

161
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,620
smart young person who thinks of some

162
00:05:58,620 --> 00:05:59,940
killer app that we never would have

163
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,860
considered before but some of the things

164
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,780
that we have thought of already are

165
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,000
chemistry like I've talked about being

166
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,039
able to simulate much larger molecules

167
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:09,600
and figuring out what their chemical

168
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,400
properties are and this can be used for

169
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,840
Material Science and it could be used

170
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,820
for pharmaceutical companies when they

171
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,199
design medicine

172
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:18,360
we could have things like supply chain

173
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,280
scheduling and Job Shop scheduling and

174
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,840
things like that trying to find the

175
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,840
optimal value of something

176
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,340
obviously there's a lot of financial

177
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:29,039
implications because a lot of banks have

178
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,419
trading algorithms based on machine

179
00:06:30,419 --> 00:06:32,520
learning and so Quantum machine learning

180
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,460
is becoming its own subfield so there's

181
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,199
now a lot of quantum machine learning

182
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,240
algorithms that especially financial

183
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,220
institutions are employing for more

184
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,560
efficient trading and then finally cyber

185
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,720
security and given the audience this is

186
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,039
probably the one thing that you know

187
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,380
about Quantum Computing it does have the

188
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:52,139
capability to undo a lot of forms of

189
00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:54,840
encryption Maybe not today but at some

190
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,060
point in the future and a lot of groups

191
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,860
and government agencies are very aware

192
00:06:58,860 --> 00:06:59,940
of this and are already taking

193
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:02,520
precautions about that

194
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,780
so

195
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,880
what do we do when we program quantum

196
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,500
computers so at the very top level of

197
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,360
the stack we have applications so these

198
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,460
are things that companies or individuals

199
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,199
want to solve so these are real world

200
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,460
problems

201
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:16,440
these in turn depend on Quantum

202
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,580
algorithms

203
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,319
so this is the just like a normal

204
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:21,060
algorithm so these are kind of recipes

205
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:23,220
that people have developed but they're

206
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:25,319
completely Quantum so we would have to

207
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:27,539
swap out the classical part and replace

208
00:07:27,539 --> 00:07:29,940
it with a Content part these Quantum

209
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:32,580
algorithms depend on tickets so ticket

210
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,500
is the software development kit and the

211
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,840
compiler which interfaces between the

212
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,060
different algorithms and either the

213
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:41,099
hardware or the simulator that you use

214
00:07:41,099 --> 00:07:42,840
because quantum computers are still

215
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,940
pretty expensive and we don't always

216
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,560
have easy access to a quantum computer

217
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,960
so oftentimes we still use simulators to

218
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,940
do this

219
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,979
so uh so this is why we've developed

220
00:07:52,979 --> 00:07:54,900
ticket we've spent several years doing

221
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,120
this and last year we made it open

222
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,220
source it's really the the liaison

223
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,740
between any type of quantum computer you

224
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:04,740
have and any type of algorithm and it's

225
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:07,620
becoming increasingly popular as of last

226
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,419
night we've had almost half a million

227
00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:11,639
downloads so so again we've spent eight

228
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:13,080
years developing this it's now open

229
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:16,380
source it's a very widely used tool not

230
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:18,960
just a Continuum of course but all

231
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,660
across the quantum Computing field

232
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:25,500
we support nearly every Quantum platform

233
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,060
so pretty much every quantum computer

234
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,680
that you've ever heard of is on this

235
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,780
list of including Oxford Quantum

236
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:33,360
circuits you see there at the bottom

237
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,820
there are other compilers and sdks but

238
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:38,159
ours is by far the most universal and

239
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,200
we've also put a lot of emphasis in

240
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,360
having ticket make the most efficient

241
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,740
execution of your code because

242
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:46,020
especially nowadays when we don't have

243
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:48,720
that many qubits and there's still a

244
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,760
relatively High error rate you want to

245
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,920
be sure to get the most power out of

246
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,540
your software

247
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:56,940
so how does ticket do this how does it

248
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,380
find the most efficient way to run your

249
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:01,320
Quantum software on any computer so

250
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,660
there's two components to this the first

251
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:06,000
component is optimizing just your

252
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,980
Quantum program or circuit as we call it

253
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,540
and this has nothing to do with the

254
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:11,040
hardware you're running it on it's just

255
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,720
your program itself

256
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,180
the second component is specific to the

257
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,459
hardware you're running so as you

258
00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:19,200
probably figured out all these different

259
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,820
quantum computers they have different

260
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,860
idiosyncrasies they use different

261
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,480
technology the qubits are connected

262
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,800
differently they have different error

263
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,140
rates there's a lot of differences

264
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,420
ticket is aware of all of that so that

265
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:32,399
you don't have to be so ticket will take

266
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,740
all of that into account and find them

267
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,380
the best way to run your program on that

268
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:40,140
Hardware that you've chosen so

269
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:41,880
to focus a little bit more on the first

270
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,620
part here

271
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,940
when you want to when you run your

272
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,740
program you want to use as few

273
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:49,620
operations or Gates as possible because

274
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:52,080
every operation takes a little time and

275
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,240
it's another source of potential error

276
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,279
and so what ticket will do is it will

277
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:58,560
first go through your program and it

278
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,060
will look for certain combinations of

279
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,279
gates and it will try to find a simpler

280
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:04,500
way to express that so mathematically

281
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,660
your program is untouched it's identical

282
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,640
to what it was before but there might be

283
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,279
a simpler way to express that the second

284
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,200
part is more macroscopic it looks for

285
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,779
larger patterns and again it tries to

286
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:17,760
just find a simpler way to do that so

287
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,140
here are some examples

288
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,720
so these are combinations of gates that

289
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,339
ticket will look for and so you see that

290
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:25,440
these are kind of little sub components

291
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,540
of a larger Quantum program

292
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,880
the simplest one up here is the upper

293
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,519
left hand corner so that's two c naught

294
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:34,800
operations in a row so I mean so it's

295
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,660
it's actually entangling these qubits

296
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,459
twice

297
00:10:38,459 --> 00:10:40,640
the funny thing is is that this actually

298
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,500
one operation undoes the other so even

299
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,640
though you have these two operations

300
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,440
they actually cancel each other out

301
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,720
leaving the qubits untouched so if

302
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,000
ticket sees this it just removes those

303
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,040
two gates which means your program runs

304
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,899
a little bit faster and it's a little

305
00:10:54,899 --> 00:10:57,240
bit less likely to make an error these

306
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,700
other Replacements are less obvious but

307
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,680
if you're curious I I published the

308
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,839
scientific article here explaining all

309
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,660
the mathematical theory behind this

310
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:09,540
so once it does that then it moves on to

311
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:11,820
the constraints for your Hardware so it

312
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,920
takes into account how how the qubits

313
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,680
are connected it takes into account the

314
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,480
native operations on that computer

315
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,279
because these aren't necessarily the

316
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:21,660
native operations that you would use in

317
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:22,860
your program

318
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:25,380
and then some computers including ours

319
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:27,000
have what's called mid-circuit

320
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,200
measurement where it can actually

321
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,260
measure a qubit and use the result for

322
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,360
the rest of the circuit to continue and

323
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,959
so ticket knows all this for you

324
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:38,640
and it will take this into account so

325
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,380
here are a few examples so these are

326
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,899
three quantum computers by three

327
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:45,000
well-known companies they all use

328
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,220
superconducting technology

329
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,140
so they have something in common but you

330
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,519
see that the way that the qubits are

331
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:53,040
connected is very different and these

332
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,420
are these are superconducting physical

333
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,459
qubits so they're locked into place

334
00:11:56,459 --> 00:11:58,079
there's nothing you can do

335
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,240
so ticket knows this and it also knows

336
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,459
that the the basis Gates so the native

337
00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:04,200
operations on that platform are very

338
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,060
different so ticket will automatically

339
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:08,880
do the configuration to map your qubits

340
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,399
on your program into those and to map

341
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:14,160
your operations into those

342
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,140
so for an example of how important this

343
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:18,240
could be the circuit on the right hand

344
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,200
side

345
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,660
this is a typical circuit you'll notice

346
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:24,000
that it has five cubic couplings so the

347
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,100
two qubits at the bottom there they're

348
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,380
entangled with each other as well as the

349
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,779
top three so there are some five cubic

350
00:12:30,779 --> 00:12:32,459
couplings we say

351
00:12:32,459 --> 00:12:34,740
the machine on the left though by by IBM

352
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:38,579
it has at most four Cubit couplings

353
00:12:38,579 --> 00:12:40,620
so naively we might think there's no way

354
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:43,079
to run this program on this computer

355
00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:45,839
that's not true we actually can do that

356
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:47,339
but we have to be a little bit clever

357
00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:48,779
about it what we have to do is something

358
00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:51,300
called routing so we have to move the

359
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,399
information on the qubits around

360
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:55,079
and this is a perfectly legitimate

361
00:12:55,079 --> 00:12:57,000
operation we do it using something

362
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,160
called a swap gate and you can do that

363
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,200
by introducing the C naught Gates as

364
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,279
shown here

365
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:04,579
but of course remember what I just said

366
00:13:04,579 --> 00:13:06,839
adding more gates is what we don't want

367
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:08,040
to do we're trying to make the program

368
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,019
smaller not larger

369
00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:13,019
and so ticket will do this routing but

370
00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:15,060
only as it needs to to make your program

371
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,860
work and again it has a built-in

372
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,839
heuristic Optimizer so you don't need to

373
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:20,339
do anything ticket will figure this out

374
00:13:20,339 --> 00:13:22,800
for you obviously we use ticket

375
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,540
internally for our own application

376
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,760
development but many many other groups

377
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:29,459
use it as well IBM uses it Google uses

378
00:13:29,459 --> 00:13:32,100
it even CERN the physics lab in Geneva

379
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,660
they use it and these are some of the

380
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,820
Articles which they've written

381
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:38,160
there have been many benchmarks done

382
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,320
studying ticket compared to some others

383
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,420
this is an independent group called

384
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:44,459
Arlene and they showed that in almost

385
00:13:44,459 --> 00:13:46,139
every case ticket will make your program

386
00:13:46,139 --> 00:13:47,760
run faster

387
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,860
so um so we are constantly updating it

388
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:52,139
and as I mentioned last September we

389
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:54,420
made it open source so it's free there

390
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,459
are no licensing restrictions every line

391
00:13:56,459 --> 00:13:58,200
of code is available for you to download

392
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,540
and inspect if you have a clever idea

393
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,339
for how to improve it and make make the

394
00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:03,899
optimization work better you're

395
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:05,940
absolutely welcome to contribute if you

396
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,560
happen to have a quantum computer in

397
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,779
your backyard and you want to write your

398
00:14:09,779 --> 00:14:11,279
own extension so that people can run

399
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:13,019
software on your machine you're

400
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:14,279
absolutely welcome to write that

401
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:17,820
extension and and people have done that

402
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,620
we have a lot of exciting things coming

403
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:21,360
up so right now you download it from

404
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,000
GitHub and you run it locally but a

405
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,800
future version will be on the cloud and

406
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,480
this will be necessary as programs

407
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,300
become larger and more sophisticated

408
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,500
you'll need to access things like like

409
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,019
my Azure and AWS to do the compilation

410
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:35,880
and such

411
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,680
so this is how you download it if you'd

412
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,240
like to take a screenshot I would

413
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,160
encourage you to do so so this is the

414
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,839
the GitHub repo

415
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:44,639
it's uh it's completely straightforward

416
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,040
so that's how you would do it

417
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,019
there are some examples and notebooks

418
00:14:49,019 --> 00:14:50,459
and things to help you get started

419
00:14:50,459 --> 00:14:52,500
Catherine is going to talk a lot more

420
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,019
about that in a second

421
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:57,000
and you install it just using the usual

422
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,740
pip install it's uh it's completely

423
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,300
straightforward so you install Pi ticket

424
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,519
so that's the python version of that

425
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:04,980
plus whatever Hardware you think you

426
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,839
might use whether it's IBM or Google's

427
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:08,760
or Oxford Quantum circuits or or

428
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,019
anything like that and you can install

429
00:15:10,019 --> 00:15:12,060
as many as you'd like of course

430
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:15,779
um it's up to you and so um so that's a

431
00:15:15,779 --> 00:15:18,000
very quick summary of quantum Computing

432
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,519
enough ticket and uh if you have any

433
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:23,300
questions by all means please email me

434
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:25,800
and so now Catherine is going to talk

435
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,180
about ticket in more detail and she's

436
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:29,220
going to go through some examples of how

437
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,019
you can get started and learning to

438
00:15:31,019 --> 00:15:32,940
program and again this is a fantastic

439
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,560
opportunity if you've ever wanted to

440
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,360
learn Quantum programming I would

441
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,980
encourage you to do so we've set a lot

442
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:40,019
of challenge problems up some easy and

443
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:42,600
some less easy and and we'll have a

444
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,639
prize at the very end and we'll actually

445
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,339
keep the competition open uh even after

446
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:49,320
Defcon is over to encourage people to do

447
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,880
that so uh so with that I'm going to

448
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,899
hand it over to Catherine

449
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,839
foreign

450
00:15:57,430 --> 00:16:01,160
[Applause]

451
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:04,040
thank you Mark

452
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:16,699
hello okay great

453
00:16:22,199 --> 00:16:24,779
okay it takes a little bit of time to

454
00:16:24,779 --> 00:16:27,560
connect

455
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:44,339
okay great so hello everyone

456
00:16:44,339 --> 00:16:47,220
so I am here to help you get started um

457
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:50,100
the CTF right so how many of you have

458
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,440
now logged into and signed up for the

459
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,459
CTF

460
00:16:53,459 --> 00:16:58,139
okay great awesome so please do so go uh

461
00:16:58,139 --> 00:17:00,899
the corner Village sign up for the CTF

462
00:17:00,899 --> 00:17:02,699
um and you are able to

463
00:17:02,699 --> 00:17:04,919
um try out the first time probably to do

464
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:07,020
a Quantum circuit and how to code it and

465
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:09,780
then play around with it so I am here uh

466
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:12,480
this weekend I'm gonna be a ticket

467
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,079
um point of contact and um for a ticket

468
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,959
specific challenges please find me I'll

469
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:20,880
be in the back there and I can give you

470
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,579
a specific technical uh guidance on it

471
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:26,520
okay so first of all um as Mark Rowley

472
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:29,640
mentioned ticket is kind of like the

473
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:32,520
liaison between the hardware and

474
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,919
different Quantum languages you have for

475
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:38,160
example kisket or Cirque or so on and

476
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,020
then we can access different Hardwares

477
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:42,559
with ticket for example the

478
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:45,900
oqc which are here today so if we can do

479
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,580
this this will be great so anyways to

480
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,140
get started with ticket what you have to

481
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:51,419
do is you have to first of all have your

482
00:17:51,419 --> 00:17:53,700
python environment set up I would

483
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:56,940
suggest you're going to do 3.9 or 3.10

484
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:00,960
okay if you set up the python

485
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,640
um then what you will do is you want to

486
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,299
do a pip install buy ticket okay so

487
00:18:06,299 --> 00:18:09,299
sorry apologize here there's a typo

488
00:18:09,299 --> 00:18:12,660
I gotta take this out right now

489
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,160
um so you're going to do a bibbon style

490
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,559
buy ticket okay this is gonna install

491
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:18,960
the latest version of buy ticket I think

492
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,660
it's 1.15

493
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:24,600
then um if you want to start doing a

494
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,179
Quantum circuit in buy ticket what you

495
00:18:27,179 --> 00:18:28,860
want to do is you want to import the

496
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:32,280
circuit class okay and then you wanna uh

497
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,679
to find your circuit and you do a

498
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:36,780
circuit with the numbers qubits there is

499
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,940
going to be a challenge questions in

500
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:41,580
there so go look at the information

501
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:45,020
about how you do circuits and buy ticket

502
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:47,460
and then you can actually one of the

503
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,960
multiple choice questions is going to be

504
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,480
on this so maybe I should expand here a

505
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,740
little bit on it so you have ticket

506
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:55,799
which is the compiler right the quantum

507
00:18:55,799 --> 00:18:58,080
software development kit and bytech kit

508
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,900
is the Python language package for you

509
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:04,440
to use right so so ticket is pretty much

510
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:07,500
the C plus plus that goes into the pi

511
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:10,980
ticket so in any case I will use it kind

512
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,380
of ticket and buy tickets

513
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:14,220
interchangeably so make sure that you

514
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,900
understand the buy ticket is just a

515
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,340
python package

516
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:21,299
to any case um how many of you know uh

517
00:19:21,299 --> 00:19:24,360
what a qubit is

518
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:28,020
okay some of you okay good so so you

519
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,940
have a classical qubit right oh it's

520
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:32,160
classical bit with a zero one and a

521
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,280
qubit is typically something that um is

522
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,840
on a block sphere so how many of you

523
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,880
know what the block sphere is

524
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,160
a few of you okay so maybe I should show

525
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,179
this

526
00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:43,740
I figured I should probably have a

527
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,539
picture of a block sphere so this is a

528
00:19:45,539 --> 00:19:48,299
block sphere and typically on the poles

529
00:19:48,299 --> 00:19:50,520
you have the state in this basic C basis

530
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:54,120
which is a zero and the one basis on the

531
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,039
C basis app is a zero so imagine you

532
00:19:56,039 --> 00:19:57,780
have a vector pointing out that would be

533
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,940
zero and a vector Point down on a block

534
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:02,400
sphere that would be one and in Quantum

535
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,559
Computing what you have you have a

536
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:06,539
vector right it can be in any of these

537
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:09,059
positions on this block sphere it can be

538
00:20:09,059 --> 00:20:12,360
up down uh it could be an X or y-axis

539
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,640
but you can have it in any phase any

540
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,320
phase anywhere on this block sphere so

541
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,640
this is the very unique thing about

542
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,799
Quantum Computing you just don't have

543
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:22,860
zero and one you have all the states in

544
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:25,020
between okay and that makes Quantum

545
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:27,900
Computing super cool so when you are um

546
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,640
when you are doing Quantum Computing

547
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:32,039
what you're doing more or less is you're

548
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:34,020
starting with a state in your block

549
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:36,539
sphere you are like maybe initializing

550
00:20:36,539 --> 00:20:38,100
it to be in a serious State and then you

551
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:41,340
apply Quantum Computing algorithms or

552
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,080
code like your ID years and then you

553
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:46,980
start to rotate your state on this block

554
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,720
sphere and then eventually you're going

555
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,340
to measure it you're going to measure

556
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:52,260
the state on this block sphere and

557
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:54,360
that's then your output but you cannot

558
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,580
only do it once you have to do it many

559
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:58,559
many many many times you have to do it

560
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,120
like a thousand times in order to get

561
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,620
your answer or like more than that

562
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,960
because it's all probabilistic so

563
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:07,679
Quantum Computing is a probabilistic

564
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:09,720
um idea it's not just deterministic

565
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,280
right so you have to run it many many

566
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,919
times so any case what you do when you

567
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:16,320
do a Quantum circuit you play with this

568
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,480
Vector on a block sphere right you're

569
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,280
like switching around moving around do

570
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,960
your computation and then eventually

571
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,100
you're going to measure it you're going

572
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:26,880
to measure the the values of your log

573
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,320
sphere anyways

574
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,580
um I don't want to give too much away

575
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:30,960
but you're going to have to learn the

576
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,700
block sphere and you're going to have to

577
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:35,220
learn how to do vectors and you're going

578
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:37,380
to have to know what a vector is

579
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,659
absolute value of it you know in order

580
00:21:39,659 --> 00:21:41,460
to measure it and understand what the

581
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,799
value is of a qubit so that's going to

582
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:45,780
give you a way that

583
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:48,240
so um yes so this is what I want to do

584
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,760
so in any case uh the understanding now

585
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:53,280
that you're on a block sphere what you

586
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,039
want to do is you want to develop a

587
00:21:56,039 --> 00:21:57,419
circuit right so you have a circuit

588
00:21:57,419 --> 00:21:59,640
class and then what you want to do is

589
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,860
you want to start to rotate this circuit

590
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:04,559
so you want to rotate your your vector

591
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:06,419
right so for example you have different

592
00:22:06,419 --> 00:22:08,820
types of gates so you can have an RX

593
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:12,659
gate an RC gate an X not gate and each

594
00:22:12,659 --> 00:22:13,980
of these Gates does something different

595
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:16,919
for example the RX gate has an X

596
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:19,260
rotation of a angle Pi on the Block

597
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:20,520
sphere it's just a matching your block

598
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,919
sphere again and then you would start at

599
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:25,500
a zero State and then you would rotate

600
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:28,080
around the x-axis by an angle of high

601
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,900
right so it's all rotation so you can

602
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:33,480
also rotate about the C axis and X

603
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,400
naught this is a gate and I'm going to

604
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,900
show you a circuit soon where you

605
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:39,539
actually can connect the qubits so here

606
00:22:39,539 --> 00:22:42,000
I'm connecting and entangling two qubits

607
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,860
I'm an entangling qubit zero an

608
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,840
entangling qubit 2.

609
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,059
so in any case this is how you convert

610
00:22:48,059 --> 00:22:50,640
them circuit then you can measure your

611
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,400
circuit because in Quantum Computing if

612
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,960
you don't measure your circuit you have

613
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,820
not accomplished what you wanted so you

614
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:59,100
have to measure a circuit you also make

615
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,200
sure that this is uh in your code when

616
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,220
you do this

617
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:04,919
so here now um I'm showing you

618
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:07,080
a circuit which I just made so

619
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,860
initialize your the three qubit circuit

620
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:12,720
the first qubit we rotate it uh in

621
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,419
around the C axis by a quarter of Pi

622
00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:18,480
here we rotate about the x axis by pi

623
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,880
and then here this is your X naught gate

624
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,400
so we're connecting qubit 0 and qb2

625
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,440
these are now entangled so this is a

626
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,600
very simple circuit right you can

627
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,280
explore during the CTF you're going to

628
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,900
be exploring more and more complicated

629
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:33,240
circuits and then what you see here what

630
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,880
Mark already said so this is one these

631
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,860
horizontal lines are your qubits and

632
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:40,440
then you have your classical register so

633
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:43,140
what is the idea of a classical register

634
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:47,000
why do we need a classical register

635
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:51,960
right so we have to measure the state of

636
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,159
the cube and for that we need a

637
00:23:53,159 --> 00:23:55,200
classical mesh register so when you're

638
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,240
in any kind of language doesn't matter

639
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:00,000
if you use ticket you just Circ or you

640
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,980
use kisk it you're going to have this

641
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:03,780
measure function you're going to have to

642
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:06,360
apply it to your circuit okay and then

643
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,640
to do that then eventually you actually

644
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,500
able to

645
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:13,500
um read out the state of a given qubit

646
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,659
in your classical register okay so this

647
00:24:15,659 --> 00:24:18,120
is what this little measure button is

648
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,220
what it shows you and that now you know

649
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:22,380
we measured your system

650
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:24,840
so now how do you run a circuit so this

651
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,700
I showed you how to develop a circuit

652
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,080
you can do only kind of different Gates

653
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:32,760
and Yana would uh for the CTF I go out

654
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,200
there and learn about different what

655
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,880
different Gates do right on their on

656
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,559
your block sphere learn about what is

657
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:41,039
the Hara Market do what does a CX gate

658
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:43,500
do and so on right so learn about this

659
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:46,140
and make your circuits depending on the

660
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:48,240
Challenge questions

661
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,059
then how do you run a circuit so there's

662
00:24:51,059 --> 00:24:54,059
different ways of running a circuit

663
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:55,740
um first of all what a lot of people are

664
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:57,120
doing is you're running on simulators

665
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,460
right classical simulators but you can

666
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:02,280
also run it on the back end okay so if

667
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:05,280
you want to explore so we have um

668
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,559
um our Lucy available for you right so

669
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:09,000
you can try to figure out how to run

670
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,220
circus or Lucy right

671
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:12,720
um or how many of you have heard about

672
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,940
IBM

673
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:17,039
some of you so you can uh for example

674
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:20,159
set up an IBM Q account right and there

675
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:22,380
you don't have access to their backends

676
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:24,600
so anyways you can do simulators or you

677
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:27,720
can do IB backhands just like Lucy or

678
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:32,100
for IBU Q IBM or you can use um

679
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,140
assure

680
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:37,140
um how many of you know Amazon bracket

681
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:39,179
some of you if you're interested in

682
00:25:39,179 --> 00:25:41,520
accessing quantum computers through

683
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,320
Amazon you can also set up a bracket

684
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,960
account okay and then a microscope Azure

685
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:49,200
has also uh accessed for you to quantum

686
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,559
computers so it shows check out so ibmq

687
00:25:51,559 --> 00:25:54,179
uh Microsoft are sure they all have

688
00:25:54,179 --> 00:25:56,700
access but today I would tell you please

689
00:25:56,700 --> 00:26:00,360
try to get access to Lucy I know Lucy is

690
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:03,419
on some of them too right

691
00:26:03,419 --> 00:26:05,400
um one of the like I think bracket and

692
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:08,100
ashore I believe so

693
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,380
but you have access to Lucy today so

694
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:13,440
please do that anyways um if you want to

695
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,240
do the

696
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,340
um if you want to get a hold of IBM for

697
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:20,100
example then what you would install you

698
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,559
would install pip and Style by ticket

699
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:25,620
kiskit so buy ticket can go with kisket

700
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:26,820
buy ticket

701
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:29,640
um Circ right buy ticket bracket buy

702
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,679
ticket assure buy ticket

703
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:34,260
um ocq this is how we get the different

704
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,120
backends so this is the call you want to

705
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,440
look for

706
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,179
um and I will show you then a little bit

707
00:26:39,179 --> 00:26:41,400
of a documentation where you can go and

708
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,360
explore

709
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,980
anyways then you have to do different

710
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:45,539
extensions you have to do a little bit

711
00:26:45,539 --> 00:26:47,640
of coding here and here right now we

712
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,039
take the air backhand from IBM this is

713
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:51,900
simulator it will simulate your circuit

714
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:54,299
right how you can run it

715
00:26:54,299 --> 00:26:56,400
so anyways you run this code

716
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,020
um and then you can

717
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:00,960
um simulate your circuit in this case I

718
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,179
simulate it so here you have the number

719
00:27:03,179 --> 00:27:05,340
of shots so you can do it a couple of

720
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:07,740
times so maybe it's too much let's do

721
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:11,039
two thousand shots here okay we try to

722
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:13,080
implement our circuit we made right so

723
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:15,179
the three keyword circuit so what are

724
00:27:15,179 --> 00:27:17,159
the outcomes right each of these qubits

725
00:27:17,159 --> 00:27:19,140
could be a zero or one because we're

726
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:21,240
measuring in the C basis right so the

727
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,400
qubit Siri could have a serial one for

728
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,440
qubit one you can have a zero one for

729
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,240
qubit and two it can have a zero one

730
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,820
right so your measurement could be zero

731
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:33,299
zero zero zero one zero zero one one and

732
00:27:33,299 --> 00:27:34,740
so on right you still have so many

733
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:35,520
different

734
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,299
um

735
00:27:36,299 --> 00:27:38,760
um you have three to the end different

736
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:42,000
um two to three different options right

737
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,559
um you can have so the two three is how

738
00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:44,640
much

739
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,740
eight okay good so you have eight

740
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:48,299
different solutions you could have right

741
00:27:48,299 --> 00:27:50,880
in any case you can run this now

742
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,460
and go ahead and in this case when you

743
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:56,159
run it some 2000 shots if I can read

744
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:59,340
write I run it and now we'll see it

745
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:01,080
takes a little bit I think

746
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:04,080
uh no and then we do print counts

747
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,120
so now you see right so this specific

748
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:08,820
way this circuit uh gave you a thousand

749
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:13,020
shots for zero zero zero and 991 shots

750
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:15,900
on zero one zero right so if you would

751
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:18,059
go in here now I'm just playing around

752
00:28:18,059 --> 00:28:20,880
because we can do that right

753
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,120
um so for example we can do another one

754
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,179
what have we not done

755
00:28:26,179 --> 00:28:29,760
uh let's put a haramigate on qubit 2

756
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,440
just for fun

757
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,179
so we go up here

758
00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:35,279
and then we're gonna do uh here we're

759
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:38,000
gonna do a Circ

760
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,799
Ada Margate and we're gonna put it on

761
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:44,700
Cupid 2 right so now I'm going to run it

762
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,919
so here this is a way of output now

763
00:28:46,919 --> 00:28:48,659
we're gonna render it

764
00:28:48,659 --> 00:28:52,220
into a circuit measure oh

765
00:28:54,179 --> 00:28:57,120
okay so here now you see uh what

766
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,380
happened

767
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:00,620
foreign

768
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:03,120
oh I probably have to sorry about this I

769
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,799
probably have to just run it again

770
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:10,580
let's run it again

771
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:15,900
okay

772
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,880
so you see here now is the Hat on my

773
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:21,179
gate it's it's it's right here right so

774
00:29:21,179 --> 00:29:23,340
we have added how to make it so after we

775
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:25,260
did the rotations and we did the X

776
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:27,059
naught commission so entangled cubic

777
00:29:27,059 --> 00:29:28,860
zero and two we'd then apply to

778
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:30,899
haramagate so that's what I want to tell

779
00:29:30,899 --> 00:29:33,120
you too when you do this circuits be

780
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,059
careful how you uh coat the gates right

781
00:29:36,059 --> 00:29:38,940
because they're gonna be added Along on

782
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:40,919
your circuit right so even though we

783
00:29:40,919 --> 00:29:42,960
want to maybe initialize

784
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,179
um the hadam again at the beginning we

785
00:29:45,179 --> 00:29:46,740
can do it the other you have to be

786
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:48,659
careful about the

787
00:29:48,659 --> 00:29:50,520
um yeah sequence you apply a gate okay

788
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:53,460
that makes sense so um so for example if

789
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:54,960
you would want to do the how to make it

790
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,760
here at the beginning you would have to

791
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,500
make sure that it's one of the first

792
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,840
calls in your circuit class

793
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:03,480
okay anyways so now we can run this

794
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,760
circuit again

795
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,100
and see if you get a different outcome

796
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,659
see now we've got a total different

797
00:30:09,659 --> 00:30:11,880
outcome right we added one gate right

798
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,860
the head of my gate which puts the

799
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:16,740
specific Cube into Super positions so it

800
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:19,620
I had them again what it does it it puts

801
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:22,320
the qubit into a superposition between

802
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:27,240
um the uh like the zero and the one

803
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,500
state so you have the fifty percent

804
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,720
chance of being in a one chain State and

805
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,460
a fifty percent of chance being in a

806
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:34,860
serious state but now just um looking at

807
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:37,020
the program here you now can see right

808
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:41,760
we got more answers right so more Cubit

809
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:46,620
um uh so we have a 0 1 0 with 500 shots

810
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:49,559
zero zero with around 500 shots zero

811
00:30:49,559 --> 00:30:50,940
zero one with four and seventy five

812
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:53,760
shots and zero one one with uh 472 shots

813
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,960
right

814
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,059
um typically these simulators have seats

815
00:30:57,059 --> 00:30:58,860
so depending on which seat you're using

816
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:00,299
you may get the same answer but a

817
00:31:00,299 --> 00:31:01,440
different C to get a different answer

818
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,960
right so be also aware of that that

819
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,940
seats are very important

820
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:08,159
um uh to choose from and it is what I

821
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:10,320
haven't done here now we could run this

822
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:13,020
on the back end but in order to run on

823
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:14,760
the backhand you're going to need a API

824
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,620
right you need some account information

825
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:20,279
you have an API token and then you can

826
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:22,200
code that in

827
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,179
so if you have questions about how to do

828
00:31:24,179 --> 00:31:27,899
that you can go and just Google Pi

829
00:31:27,899 --> 00:31:30,539
ticket manual okay so it's very

830
00:31:30,539 --> 00:31:33,299
important for your CTF go online Google

831
00:31:33,299 --> 00:31:36,299
buy ticket manual and there you can go

832
00:31:36,299 --> 00:31:39,539
through and will tell you about uh how

833
00:31:39,539 --> 00:31:41,960
to construct a circuit right

834
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:44,340
go through everything how you construct

835
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:46,919
a circuit my mouse is super sensitive

836
00:31:46,919 --> 00:31:49,700
but it's all right there so for the CTF

837
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:52,860
I suggest go to buy tickets manual and

838
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:55,559
go ahead and do that right the other one

839
00:31:55,559 --> 00:31:58,880
is so as Mark mentioned before

840
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:02,700
Honeywell Quantum and Cambridge Quantum

841
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:05,940
Computing they merged right so um all

842
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:07,500
the ticket to

843
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:10,320
um like um the ticket tutorials and

844
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,320
ticket um

845
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,460
documentation a lot you're also going to

846
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:18,419
find on the cqcl GitHub page okay if you

847
00:32:18,419 --> 00:32:19,559
go there you're going to have buy ticket

848
00:32:19,559 --> 00:32:21,659
you can click on examples and here

849
00:32:21,659 --> 00:32:23,640
you're also going to have some pretty

850
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:26,220
neat examples secret analysis secret

851
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:29,159
generation compilation how to run a

852
00:32:29,159 --> 00:32:31,799
different backends okay so everything is

853
00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:34,200
out there for the CTF for the ticket

854
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,960
examples right you learn how to go

855
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,299
between kiskit and ticket between the

856
00:32:39,299 --> 00:32:40,500
IBM

857
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,880
um

858
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,980
um on Python language kiskit and how to

859
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:46,080
go to ticket right you will learn how to

860
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,600
compile the different Android backends

861
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,399
you will learn how to optimize circuits

862
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:53,340
turn to CTF so uh stuff Mark mentioned

863
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:56,580
earlier okay so any case um here's the

864
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:59,340
technical part of it

865
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:01,500
um look at this look at the buy ticket

866
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:04,440
examples go to the manual we have for

867
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,679
you available online and then work it

868
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:09,899
out okay make your first Quantum circuit

869
00:33:09,899 --> 00:33:13,559
play around with it use a simulator

870
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:17,519
uh it is up to you to um now create and

871
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:19,860
have fun with this okay

872
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:22,699
and find me

873
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:27,530
okay

874
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:30,539
[Applause]

875
00:33:30,539 --> 00:33:33,059
happy hacking

876
00:33:33,059 --> 00:33:35,779
