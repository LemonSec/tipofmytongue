cryptocurrency a bridge across the

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,480
digital dubai

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,800

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,680
stuffed up to my ears

12
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,640
uh my voice uh may be a little hoarse

13
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,440
because i'm still getting over that

14
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,840
but i'm trying to do the best that i can

15
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,800
but i wanted to apologize beforehand

16
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:43,319
that being said let's move along

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,760
so who am i

18
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,079
as i said before my name is stephanie

19
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:49,360
barnes

20
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,160
i

21
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,120
am a recent master's graduate

22
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,640
with a degree in cyber security from

23
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,960
excelsior college i also have a

24
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,440
bachelor's degree from excelsior in

25
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,840
information technology

26
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,159
before that i had a psychology degree

27
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,400
from florida a m

28
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,600
i've been in the infosec field

29
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,960
for

30
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,600
about four years now working in a

31
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,560
security operations center as a sock

32
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,040
analyst

33
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,920
excuse me

34
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,080
so of course i want to start off with

35
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,400
um an agenda

36
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,079
so that you guys can keep me honest so

37
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:33,439
that i can

38
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,439
keep myself honest um we're going to

39
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:38,240
talk about the digital divide

40
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,159
i'm going to talk about black people in

41
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,840
cryptocurrency slash the blockchain

42
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,720
cyber security and cryptocurrency the

43
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,560
digital dollar

44
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,159
and a cycle i think as a people uh we

45
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,399
should avoid

46
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,719
so

47
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:00,000
this is the webster's

48
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,240
definition of

49
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,079
what the digital divide is

50
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,399
it

51
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:09,840
includes

52
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,720
not just educational but social and

53
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,080
economic inequality disparities between

54
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,480
people who have computers people who do

55
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,319
not people who have

56
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,879
uh are readily have

57
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:26,640
online access and those who do not

58
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,720
you can think that this could be a

59
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,840
simple thing and maybe

60
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,959
20 30 40 years ago it wasn't such a big

61
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:36,400
thing but now

62
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,239
with the way that our lives are

63
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:40,800
interconnected with computers

64
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,519
with digital media and

65
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:45,280
with the internet

66
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,920
not having um

67
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,560
something like a computer at home

68
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,080
are computers in your schools our online

69
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,680
access that

70
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,760
is unlimited

71
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,560
limits your possibilities it is the

72
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,519
difference between somebody saying that

73
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,760
they've been coding for nine years and

74
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,440
somebody's saying

75
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,760
that they've only been coding for 29

76
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,640
years

77
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,560
the kind of portfolio that you could

78
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,640
have if you had that 20 years head start

79
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,120
is drastically different from somebody

80
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,200
who just started yesterday

81
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,200
and to not

82
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,560
see that or not recognize that disparity

83
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,959
disparity does a disservice um to us all

84
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:31,760
so

85
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,599
a lot has been said and it's been

86
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,920
written about digital divided and it's

87
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,840
been spoken of

88
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,040
even

89
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,519
in our

90
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,239
kind of hiring practices right that's

91
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,040
why people have

92
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,799
diversity

93
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:50,799
and inclusion

94
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,799
personnel

95
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,080
that's

96
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,599
why we we try to provide avenues for

97
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,280
historically underrepresented

98
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,239
communities to have access not only to

99
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,840
computers and and be online but to also

100
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,239
have access to

101
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,799
the programs that will put us on

102
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,840
equitable footing

103
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,920
as others that already have that kind of

104
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,399
access

105
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:30,800
so breaking off that did you know um

106
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,680
this is all coming from forbes

107
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,919
uh african-american households only hold

108
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,880
less than four percent of the 116

109
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,680
trillion dollars in wealth in the us

110
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,080
it's a very very small percentage like i

111
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,720
can't give you the exact amount

112
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,759
but

113
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,840
knowing that it's a single digit is

114
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:56,679
enough to know that it's very very small

115
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,919
but despite this despite only having

116
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,160
four percent of this wealth

117
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,479
we are the largest demographic of

118
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:10,000
cryptocurrency investors currently and

119
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,919
that 23 percent

120
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:14,799
is set to double

121
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,880
but even with having already four

122
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,160
percent of the wealth and

123
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,720
being a large percentage of the

124
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,520
investors

125
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,120
13 of our households are unbanked and

126
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,479
when it means unbanked it could be from

127
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:35,280
from historical banking practices so

128
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,520
that they they can't

129
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,479
get um

130
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,160
a an account

131
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,039
um

132
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,039
or could be because there's not a bank

133
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:47,919
in the neighborhood it could be because

134
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:51,199
the bank in the neighborhood is

135
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:52,639
inefficient

136
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:53,840
are

137
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,960
it can be

138
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,240
something like there are still predatory

139
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,240
banks and still predatory banking

140
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,800
practices there can be that there's just

141
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,240
a distrust of of banks

142
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,720
but for whatever reason any of those

143
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,639
multitudes of reasons and more that i

144
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,759
haven't even spoken of 13 of

145
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:18,080
african-american households are unbanked

146
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,160
so this all feeds into each other

147
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,240
because it's all about our wealth it's

148
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,400
all about how we spend our money how

149
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,960
we're saving our money if we're able to

150
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,720
save money or do we have the

151
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,680
institutions in our neighborhoods that

152
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,360
would assist us

153
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,479
to

154
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,720
to save our money to build up our

155
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,280
communities to put the wealth that we

156
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,720
may have back into uh african-american

157
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,360
communities

158
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:47,840
so how does that feed into

159
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,280
cryptocurrency

160
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,080
in

161
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,479
my research and in my view

162
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:56,080
black inbound people have a history

163
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,960
of making their own way when the way

164
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,599
forward has not been equitable and is

165
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:02,639
not

166
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,479
about equality we've always been able to

167
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:10,319
kind of read the room and

168
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:11,759
invent

169
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:15,120
our way out of the situations that we

170
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,560
might be in

171
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,880
are

172
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,960
develop

173
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,720
a new way

174
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,400
right

175
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,000
so

176
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,919
for our communities

177
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:29,840
it really is where there's a will

178
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,440
there's a way

179
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,479
many

180
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:33,759
black people in

181
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,400
cryptocurrency and the blockchain and

182
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,440
even now in nfts

183
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,759
see the potential that these emerging

184
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,400
technologies have and it's appealing

185
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,400
and it could be because it's something

186
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,199
new

187
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,879
it could be because

188
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,120
we've seen in the past where something

189
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,360
like bitcoin has really skyrocketed and

190
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,440
we've wanted a piece of that

191
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,000
and maybe because it's something new

192
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,280
and it's not burdened by all of the

193
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,199
past problems and the

194
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,240
past inequalities we see that it might

195
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,199
have a more likely chance of

196
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,720
being successful

197
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,160
for our community for our individual

198
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,479
lives um because they're not tied to

199
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,360
the banking institutions or to the

200
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,319
government that we might be distrustful

201
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,599
of so i can see why

202
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,919
we would have that 23

203
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,240
excuse me that 23

204
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,399
that is investing

205
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:39,200
into cryptocurrency because

206
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,120
it doesn't have the ties and it doesn't

207
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,120
have the historical

208
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,680
baggage that something

209
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,959
like

210
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,160
a bank

211
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:48,959
or

212
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,720
even regular

213
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,440
everyday investing might have it also

214
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,000
doesn't have the cost

215
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,519
barrier

216
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,440
where you can put pennies into a

217
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,959
cryptocurrency

218
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,360
and then with the right

219
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,959
turn of events come out a thousand error

220
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:09,920
or millionaire in some cases

221
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,040
you couldn't do that

222
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,240
with the access that we have to

223
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,279
something like a market account or

224
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,600
investing in stocks

225
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,480
it's happened yes but usually there's a

226
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,160
higher barrier

227
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,880
for entry initial entry for

228
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,000
those kind of accounts as opposed to

229
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
cryptocurrency

230
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,080
like i said we've been there from the

231
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,360
beginning it's not something new

232
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,240
that

233
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,640
there have been black people investing

234
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,440
in

235
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,880
are developing in cryptocurrency

236
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,519
um these four people are just a small

237
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:52,480
pool

238
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,320
of pioneering

239
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,680
black people

240
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,680
in the cryptocurrency

241
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,800
realm

242
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,000
um

243
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,720
first we have in the green so i'm

244
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,200
starting from is cleve

245
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,720
uh the cider and i might be saying her

246
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,680
name incorrectly and if i am i apologize

247
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,640
um

248
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,800
but she leads the national policy

249
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,959
network of women of color and they

250
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:22,560
advocate for diversity in cryptocurrency

251
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,000
markets

252
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,959
next we have vernon j

253
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:30,959
and he's the founder of equity coin

254
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,720
next to him we have deidre ramsey

255
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,720
mcintyre who co-founded

256
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,760
the

257
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,800
support and advocacy advocacy group

258
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,000
black people and cryptocurrency and then

259
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,680
last is sean wilkinson the founder of

260
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,720
storage

261
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,800
s-t-o-r-j

262
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,120
which uses the blockchain

263
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:55,840
um to

264
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,200
[Music]

265
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,839
aid in cloud

266
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:00,959
storage so

267
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:02,880
there are black people out here that are

268
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,839
making their own coins they are

269
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:07,839
building on the blockchain there are

270
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:10,800
people that have advocacy groups that

271
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,160
are teaching

272
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,399
others in the community about how to

273
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,320
invest in cryptocurrency how to use a

274
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,440
black trade how to develop how to

275
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,360
use these kind of emerging technologies

276
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,800
to build up

277
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,240
right

278
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,200
and

279
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,160
there are other black pioneers than the

280
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,160
ones that i have on the screen and there

281
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,800
i continue to be more in my opinion

282
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,359
because

283
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,360
we tend to seek out emerging trends and

284
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,440
build our own

285
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,760
off of those trends because we've seen

286
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,920
that they can be successful

287
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,720
for others are like i said before it

288
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,360
doesn't have the barrier of entry

289
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,560
that

290
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,680
odor

291
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,959
avenues have

292
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,720
but with that and with building

293
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,040
on these emerging technologies we also

294
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,680
have to take

295
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,839
into account security

296
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:15,200
um not just for ourselves but

297
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,800
for the community

298
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,959
for anybody that's new entering in

299
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:23,040
but also because

300
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,760
in this day and age security goes hand

301
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,200
in hand with

302
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,560
everything

303
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,920
we have to be more security minded

304
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,800
when we build digital

305
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,079
devices

306
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:39,920
digital technologies because if we get

307
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,560
to a far ahead in development

308
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,399
before we think about

309
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:45,839
is it secure

310
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,000
how secure can i make it

311
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,839
there's just a lot of backtracking that

312
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:51,600
you have to do but if you build

313
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,040
something secure

314
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,720
as you are building that thing

315
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,880
then security is always the first step

316
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,519
they always go hand in hand they always

317
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,399
are developing with each other

318
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:08,000
excuse me so that being said what are

319
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,040
some of the cyber security implications

320
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,839
in cryptocurrency

321
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:15,760
and all of these

322
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,040
boxes

323
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,839
are a way

324
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:22,560
that cryptocurrencies have been kind of

325
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,279
targeted

326
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:27,040
for

327
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,560
attack

328
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,360
there

329
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,880
have been

330
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,440
illegitimate exchanges that have popped

331
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,079
up that will get

332
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:38,639
not just people's money but also

333
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:41,519
a lot of their personal information

334
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,079
because in many of these exchanges

335
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:47,120
especially now that there's been more of

336
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,560
a governmental eye on it

337
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,120
they will ask you for personal

338
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,440
information such as you know your name

339
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,360
or even your social security number or

340
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,880
something to identify you may be a

341
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,920
picture

342
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,880
of

343
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,040
your passport or a picture of your id

344
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:03,920
card

345
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,639
and that can be used to

346
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:09,120
impersonate you you know in the wrong

347
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,480
hands

348
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,240
then there are some of these exchanges

349
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,360
that the only way that you can

350
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,639
get

351
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:19,920
the coin or access

352
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,320
um any of your investments you have to

353
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,320
use like a third-party

354
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,680
application

355
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,560
and

356
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,160
you know as well as i know that the more

357
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,920
kind of parties that you have to have

358
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,199
into

359
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:35,519
the larger the attack area the larger

360
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,600
the surface right

361
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,519
then because these technologies are

362
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:40,880
still new

363
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,959
there's still a lot of confusion

364
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:45,519
from the end user on

365
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:46,959
what they're doing

366
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:49,760
how they should do it is this correct

367
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,519
does this sound right

368
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:54,240
um if i press this button am i making a

369
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,240
trade if i press this button am i buying

370
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,320
something am i giving them too much

371
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,040
information am i too excited about the

372
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,800
possibility of making more money that

373
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,560
i'm making a misstep

374
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,040
and without the proper guidance there

375
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,079
you could be and it could be

376
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:15,040
insignificant or it could be

377
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,880
the difference between being able to pay

378
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,120
your rent this month

379
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,000
um

380
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,399
and then there's of course fishing it's

381
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:23,760
always there's always going to be a

382
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,160
target fishing for anything that's

383
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,560
popular any company really

384
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,279
i barely have any crypto and i receive

385
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:33,759
phishing emails about crypto exchanges

386
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:36,079
all the time exchanges that i've never

387
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:38,560
heard of

388
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,839
but

389
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,000
there have also been

390
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,959
cryptocurrency schemes out there

391
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:50,800
such as uh

392
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,720
one coin which

393
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,120
turned out to be just a multi-level

394
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,959
marketing scheme

395
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:58,800
and besides just these things that i

396
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,120
have on the screen there have been

397
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,720
recent attacks on things like uh nft

398
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,800
stores and

399
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,480
cryptocurrency exchange there have been

400
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,680
cryptocurrency exchange that have

401
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,600
kind of lost solvency and

402
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,759
not wanted to give people their money so

403
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:19,440
that they

404
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,759
so that they wouldn't close down um to

405
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,680
avoid shut down and that kind of thing

406
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,279
and because

407
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:28,320
it's so unregulated or not regulated to

408
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,720
the extent that it probably would need

409
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,880
to be

410
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,199
what's the recourse

411
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:38,639
um other than you being upset about it

412
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,880
what can who can you really call

413
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,759
to help you

414
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:46,720
but the unregulated nature of

415
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,440
cryptocurrency was the thing that pushed

416
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,120
its growth

417
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,040
it's the thing that gets the coin

418
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,920
shooting up there to thousands

419
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,079
and thousands of dollars

420
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:00,800
but it's also one of its most worrying

421
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,920
worrying

422
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,920
attributes

423
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,760
and when we have that

424
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,959
that's where we get the push to have a

425
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,679
digital dollar or the

426
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,640
central bank digital currency as they're

427
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,240
calling it right now

428
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,280
and

429
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,480
this talk of it has been going on for a

430
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,520
while

431
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,359
but with the current administration

432
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,039
they've actually

433
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,039
put a little bit of money into

434
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:32,480
researching it

435
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,600
into seeing how we might have a digital

436
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,520
dollar in the united states what would

437
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,640
that look like how would it work

438
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,880
and in their press release for it they

439
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,520
say that this is supposed to

440
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,640
help

441
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,400
the people who don't use bank so

442
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,120
ba as we still have our 13 that's

443
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,120
unbanked

444
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:59,479
this is for those people

445
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:00,960
if

446
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,440
excuse excuse me

447
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,240
but it also affects the people that are

448
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,039
using cryptocurrencies and the people

449
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:10,160
that

450
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,840
are reliant on fintech

451
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:16,240
and are banking online

452
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,919
because it's not just a change in

453
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:22,559
whether or not you can

454
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,360
just use your digital dollar

455
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,600
for things that are online instead of

456
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,520
putting in your bank account there's a

457
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,559
lot of gray area maybe even a lot of

458
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:35,039
black area and how this would work and

459
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:36,640
that's because it's just in its

460
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,039
researching phase but it's something

461
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:41,039
that you have to think about

462
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:44,320
how will this digital dollar work right

463
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,679
how will it affect the cryptocurrency

464
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,720
that i have now um is it the only thing

465
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,320
that they're looking at

466
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,559
just creating this digital dollar i know

467
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:56,960
for a fact that that's not true it's not

468
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,799
just going to be a digital dollar just

469
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:01,440
this morning there was an article wired

470
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,559
about

471
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,960
how the united states and europe are

472
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,640
looking at ways to regulate

473
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,039
cryptocurrencies and that's quite

474
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:12,080
possibly because of all the recent news

475
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:16,480
of falling prices and again of

476
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,440
um

477
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,559
infosec concerns and

478
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,160
breaches

479
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:26,640
and excuse me um

480
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,039
excuse me infosec concerns and breaches

481
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:34,799
and things of that nature that have

482
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:39,600
happened with these exchanges that now

483
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,880
that there are more people that are

484
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,160
investing

485
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,120
and have money tied up in this

486
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,160
hey

487
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,480
we should make sure this is secure for

488
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,919
the people

489
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:52,160
or even if it's not about that and you

490
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,000
think the worst that you're just like

491
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,840
they just want to over regulate us to

492
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,679
death it's still something that they're

493
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:00,480
looking at right it's still gonna

494
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,240
change the way these things operate and

495
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,400
we have to be able to either change with

496
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,640
it or fight against it

497
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,400
but the only way to do either one or the

498
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,480
other is to understand

499
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,039
what's going on and keep up to date

500
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:16,000
about

501
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,320
what's happening

502
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,760
so what's the difference between the

503
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:25,440
crypt currency and the cbdc

504
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,240
cryptocurrencies are decentralized right

505
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,320
they're peer-to-peer base

506
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,799
and the price and worth fluctuates like

507
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,640
i said that's one of the things that

508
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,360
drew a lot of people to it to begin with

509
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,840
is because the fluctuation

510
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:43,919
for a lot of people in a lot of uh coins

511
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:46,840
it meant coming up on a windfall if

512
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,840
you if you cashed out

513
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,840
at the right time

514
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,039
with the cbdc it's government control

515
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:57,520
there's less price fluctuation and it's

516
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,600
one to one with the dollar however much

517
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,840
the dollar is worth that's how much the

518
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,400
digital dollar is going to be worth

519
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,760
regardless

520
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,960
you know

521
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,799
it has pluses to it

522
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,480
especially if you

523
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,760
are somebody that feels that regulation

524
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,600
makes you safer

525
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,559
right

526
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,880
um it's not something where you would

527
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,520
get that windfall it's just

528
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,000
a translation of however much money you

529
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,480
have if you have five dollars in digital

530
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,080
dollars you're gonna have five dollars

531
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,320
in real life if you have five dollars in

532
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,960
bitcoin

533
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,520
up until i mean even now if you have

534
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,039
five dollars in bitcoin it's a

535
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:39,039
significant amount of money

536
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:39,840
but

537
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:44,159
it could also be five dollars in less in

538
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:46,960
a month in two years in three years a

539
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,559
dollar is always going to be a dollar

540
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:50,720
it's not going to be worth a dollar all

541
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,640
the time but it's always going to be

542
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,120
equal at least

543
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,520
so all those are both digital they're

544
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,159
not the same they're not interchangeable

545
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:02,000
but they both impact

546
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,360
our community

547
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,120
the development of both

548
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,400
um

549
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,640
and

550
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:10,799
they both

551
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:15,440
have some sort of a power some sort of

552
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,559
usage

553
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:18,880
for us

554
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,679
but

555
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,200
why should we care

556
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,320
right

557
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,840
if you're not if you don't have any

558
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,679
cryptocurrency cr

559
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:28,080
currently are

560
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,080
if even if there's a digital dollar and

561
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,159
it's just like oh that's just it just

562
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:35,200
means that i can use it in cyberspace

563
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,760
that's great

564
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,080
why should you care about these things

565
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,559
if you don't have any holdings and a

566
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:45,200
digital dollar is just

567
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,440
a thing that might exist because it

568
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,679
doesn't exist now why should you care

569
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:52,080
right now

570
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,480
for me it has more to do with something

571
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,520
that could lead to a bitter cycle of us

572
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,919
as a people being

573
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:03,120
more

574
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,039
oppressed are

575
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:07,760
in a worse standing

576
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:11,919
economically than to begin with

577
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:16,320
and i say this because not only are we

578
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,200
the leading investors in cryptocurrency

579
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,480
are not only are we significantly

580
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,480
unbanked but we're also the leaders in

581
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,720
using digital wallets

582
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,840
we lead in banking through our phones

583
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:35,600
and using fintech applications like cash

584
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:39,200
apps your venmos your paypals we lead in

585
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,640
those kind of things

586
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,799
quite possibly because we're unbanked

587
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:46,400
you can hold large amounts of uh cash

588
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,880
in cash and cash app

589
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,400
um or you can do all your business

590
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,080
transactions

591
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,760
for

592
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,559
your your small business

593
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:01,200
through paypal or square or something

594
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,880
like that

595
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,520
and we've taken advantage of that

596
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,559
right

597
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:07,679
but

598
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:10,960
with the move towards digital currency

599
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,559
those kinds of exchanges

600
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:17,120
are interactions with these digital

601
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,200
wallets which you're banking through

602
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,760
your phone or being able to just send

603
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:25,039
money with an app on your phone

604
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:26,080
is

605
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,480
likely to increase

606
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,720
because we're gonna be

607
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,799
possibly more reliant on a digital

608
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:34,480
currency if they have

609
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,679
a one-to-one ratio that you have a

610
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:39,679
thousand dollars in your bank so that

611
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:41,520
means you have a thousand digital

612
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,919
dollars that you can use with a push of

613
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:47,279
a button it's ease right it's more

614
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:49,200
likely for you to do it you won't have

615
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,960
to go to the bank you don't need to have

616
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,520
a bank in your neighborhood because it's

617
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,039
all right here on your phone and you

618
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:57,440
always have your phone right we all

619
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,200
always have our phones

620
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,279
so it's more likely to increase the use

621
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:04,080
of digital services but the problem with

622
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,320
these services currently

623
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:09,120
is that they have been rampant with

624
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,120
complaints with

625
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:14,240
the services just closing closing down

626
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,360
accounts

627
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,159
and taking people's money money and

628
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:21,840
scamming and there have been

629
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:26,480
data breaches at them they are not

630
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,360
regulated like banks are because they're

631
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,880
not banks

632
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,279
not all of them some some do have uh

633
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:34,159
banks

634
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:35,440
attached to them

635
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,279
excuse me because

636
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:40,240
cash app technically would have a bank

637
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,600
attached to it now that it's bought

638
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,520
what is that credit credit karma now

639
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,120
that they bought credit karma and credit

640
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,559
karma has a bank

641
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:51,440
uh our banking apparatus to it

642
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,440
cash app with or at least that bank

643
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,840
apparatus would be subject to some kind

644
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,880
of regulations but a lot of these don't

645
00:25:58,880 --> 00:25:59,679
have

646
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:02,320
banks attached to them so

647
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,400
you have your money

648
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,679
that you've never

649
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:07,919
touched physically

650
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:08,840
and you're

651
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:12,159
unbanked and it's just

652
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:14,240
in the ether really

653
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,240
like it exists

654
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,200
but if this

655
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,240
tech company decides that you've broken

656
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:25,760
some arbitrary rule are

657
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,400
going against their terms of services

658
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,679
that

659
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:32,559
nobody reads because it's such small

660
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:33,760
print

661
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,360
you've lost

662
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,720
your money

663
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,159
and for somebody that is economically

664
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:41,440
sound

665
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,240
it

666
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,320
is a blip on the radar

667
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,520
but

668
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,480
for somebody that's historically not

669
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,200
economically sound it's not a blip

670
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,720
anymore

671
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,039
and

672
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:57,200
that's the kind of thing that concerns

673
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,000
me

674
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,080
because

675
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,000
there is this research for doing a

676
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,400
digital dollar it is supposed to help

677
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,080
the unbanked but it can hurt them

678
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,039
um

679
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:11,440
so if we are utilizing these services

680
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,120
more often

681
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,640
and these services aren't as regulated

682
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,840
they're not

683
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,679
banks if there is something that's

684
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:25,200
negatively happening it hurts those that

685
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,480
are

686
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,520
in a less equitable or are

687
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,720
equal position more than somebody that

688
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,559
is not

689
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:35,440
right

690
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,120
and we want to avoid that we want to

691
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:40,480
avoid getting into a cycle where we're

692
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,039
i don't know excuse me early adopters

693
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:45,600
and early pioneers of this kind of

694
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,440
technology because it makes our lives

695
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,559
easier

696
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:50,000
um and

697
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,399
it also

698
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:54,799
is

699
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:58,880
helping us in a way to have thriving

700
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:03,120
small businesses are to to send cash to

701
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,880
our family members

702
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,640
it just makes like i said it makes our

703
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,159
lives easier

704
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:09,919
but

705
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:13,039
because of the way that it's not

706
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:15,440
regulated are

707
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,200
because of the way it's not

708
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,120
run by

709
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,679
somebody that has our best interests at

710
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:24,399
heart it's a business you know it's not

711
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:27,120
it's not about helping the little guy no

712
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:31,679
matter how much they say it is right so

713
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:34,320
if it's if it's if it's set up and it

714
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,399
might hurt somebody it's gonna hurt

715
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:41,120
those who are at the bottom the most

716
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,559
so what do i think is needed um i feel

717
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:48,480
like

718
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,360
there should be a focus on education to

719
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:54,240
avoid exploitation it's how you get away

720
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,120
from users being confused it's how you

721
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,760
get away from people thinking that they

722
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,279
could put in

723
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:03,760
a dime and make 10 million

724
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:07,840
right um it's not just about educating

725
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,240
about cryptocurrencies and about

726
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:14,240
investing in cryptocurrencies but also

727
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,520
having community kind of outreach which

728
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,000
some of those peoples that that i taught

729
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,159
peoples some of those people that i

730
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:23,440
talked about

731
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,399
um

732
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:26,799
on the pioneer page have those kind of

733
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:30,480
advocacy groups and

734
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,880
other kind of groups that educate the

735
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,799
community on

736
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:36,240
what to look in

737
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,640
what to look at um when you're trying to

738
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,480
invest in cryptocurrency

739
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,840
or this is how the blockchain works are

740
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,840
this is what an nft

741
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,000
does and i've seen

742
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,240
that there have been a lot of

743
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,080
outreach

744
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:55,360
especially in schools to teach the

745
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,240
incoming generation about these kind of

746
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,360
technologies and that helps

747
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:04,320
that's how we use education so that when

748
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:07,120
you get older and you can

749
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,520
invest your own money or you see that

750
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:13,279
this could be an opportunity for

751
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:15,679
economic freedom that

752
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:17,520
you won't be exploited

753
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,120
because you might be able to see the

754
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,720
signs and you won't let others be

755
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,360
exploited because each one teach one

756
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,200
that's the community thing that we've

757
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,200
had for forever right

758
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,159
um

759
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:30,559
but also there should be diversity in

760
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:32,960
development and that's not way for

761
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,760
somebody to say hey

762
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,480
we want you to fill this space but

763
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:41,520
making our own spaces as well

764
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,760
it shouldn't just be an investment

765
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,320
vehicle but also

766
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,840
like the maker of equity coin and

767
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,520
i know that there was another coin that

768
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,919
was started by a brother it was um

769
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:56,640
guap coin i think

770
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,039
like developing your own coin

771
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:01,440
not in a in a scammy way in an actual

772
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,440
way where we're we're doing the

773
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,360
programming all right even if we don't

774
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,600
go that avenue and

775
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,679
it's more of

776
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:13,919
how can we make this more secure or

777
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,440
what can we use the blockchain for

778
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,960
other than

779
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,600
coin other than investment

780
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,039
like

781
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:25,840
sean wilkerson did with storage and used

782
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,840
it as cloud storage

783
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,880
how can we use this emerging technology

784
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,519
to develop something new to fill in a

785
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:34,340
boy to

786
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:36,320
[Music]

787
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,960
make something that's going to last

788
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,640
right

789
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,399
and then if there is going to be a

790
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:45,440
digital dollar if there's going to be

791
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,840
the government whether it's here whether

792
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,159
it's in europe whether it's anywhere and

793
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:51,679
they're going to say we're regulating

794
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:53,760
this and we're going to do this this

795
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,159
this this and that to make sure that

796
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:59,519
it's it's more safe for everybody to

797
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:00,480
invest

798
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,799
and use these exchanges if that's what

799
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:05,440
we're going to do we should advocate for

800
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,440
ourselves

801
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,919
even if they're not going to regulate

802
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:11,919
the coins that are already out there

803
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:14,799
which i sincerely doubt even if they're

804
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:16,240
just going to come up with additional

805
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,080
dollar you can't

806
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,440
help

807
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,919
the unbanked without speaking to the

808
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:23,679
unbanked this

809
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:25,840
isn't a nanny state that's not what we

810
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:28,480
want what we want is equity we want his

811
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,960
justice and if you want those things

812
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,120
and you're committed to having those

813
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,039
things come to fruition

814
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:36,240
then

815
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,120
those

816
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,360
people that are you that you're talking

817
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,240
about that you're advocating for helping

818
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,320
should be able to say this is what we

819
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,200
need

820
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,440
and we need this because

821
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,760
xyz this is what would make it more

822
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,519
equitable this would

823
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:54,559
is what would make it more just and more

824
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:56,480
fair if

825
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,960
these things were provided you know it's

826
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,039
not just about having a digital dollar

827
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:03,600
that doesn't help the unbanked if the

828
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,399
the transmission of that digital dollar

829
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:08,960
is subject to shut down at any time it

830
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:12,240
doesn't help to have a digital dollar

831
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,600
if

832
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,440
the

833
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,399
applications that that are popular that

834
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:19,760
they're using

835
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:20,960
um

836
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,640
can't exploit them

837
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,519
right

838
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:26,159
it turns this bridge that

839
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:27,440
we we

840
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,320
tried to pioneer that we've tried to

841
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:33,039
grow that we've invested in

842
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:35,279
into something that's just another way

843
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:36,720
for us to be

844
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,279
oppressed and exploited

845
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:42,480
and that's not what we want right

846
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,440
so if we're not part of the development

847
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,760
if we're not focused on educating each

848
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:51,279
other and not just looking at it as an

849
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:53,919
investment vehicle but actually as an

850
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:56,159
avenue where we could spin off into

851
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:57,440
something else

852
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:00,720
or develop something new

853
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,399
that we're just putting ourselves in a

854
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:05,120
place where we can be exploited and

855
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,159
we've already been exploited and

856
00:34:07,159 --> 00:34:10,560
disenfranchised enough

857
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:13,119
so

858
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:14,159
for me

859
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:16,639
this is some advertised further reading

860
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:18,839
if you're interested
