1
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,799
i'm pony ip with the red team village

2
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:08,559
and today i have the pleasure of talking

3
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:10,559
with one of our gold sponsors bc

4
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:12,880
security we have hubble and coin here to

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,320
tell us a little bit about their company

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,839
and their plans for hacker summer camp

7
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:17,920
this year to start off can you tell me a

8
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,480
bit about bc security

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,439
yeah so uh we're a specialized security

10
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:25,359
company that focuses on security

11
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:26,720
compliance

12
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,359
we do both training red teaming and pen

13
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:31,519
testing for companies uh we're kind of

14
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:33,360
an interesting space we do both

15
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,800
enterprise networks we do like

16
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,239
non-traditional systems so think iot ics

17
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:41,200
scada bus systems and wireless

18
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,640
which kind of allows us to get into a

19
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,320
space where not a lot of other companies

20
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,640
operate

21
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,360
and can you tell me a little bit more

22
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,520
about what you do specifically

23
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,320
yeah so i'm coin i'm the ceo but i'm

24
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,719
also the director of security research

25
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:57,600
uh

26
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,960
my background's electrical engineering

27
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,960
so i focus a lot on the wireless and iot

28
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,120
devices so i go out do look at different

29
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,519
products uh find vulnerabilities of them

30
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,200
do software development and then also do

31
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,400
the training development as well

32
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,960
yeah and then i'm uh hubble i'm our ceo

33
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,439
as well as our red team operations lead

34
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:17,200
uh so i focus on planning our

35
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,680
engagements when we do pen tests and uh

36
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,920
red team engagements as well as some of

37
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,280
our threat uh

38
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,560
intel research to allow for that kind of

39
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,520
threat emulation that we focus on where

40
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,159
we are trying to emulate specific apts

41
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,119
or apt um categories

42
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:36,720
for people uh

43
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,000
instead of just kind of doing like a

44
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,560
generic like pen test or a red team

45
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,079
where we use like the same playbook

46
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:44,479
every time

47
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,799
definitely speaking of music to my ears

48
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,159
you know one thing i've noticed in the

49
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:50,320
offensive security realm is that

50
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,000
sometimes engagements have become just a

51
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,759
commodity where it's the same playbook

52
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,680
over and over again uh what are your

53
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,159
thoughts on that

54
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,479
um yeah i think it's something that uh

55
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,960
can be worked on in our in our industry

56
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,880
right now like there is absolutely a

57
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,479
place for it um like i don't want to

58
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:07,600
take away from those companies doing

59
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,440
that because there's a place for it but

60
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,720
we engage with a lot of media

61
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,800
where they just don't have the

62
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,840
resources and teams to be able to

63
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,280
address like a top level apt

64
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,480
threat that and so we try to go

65
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,319
get them the best bang for their buck

66
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,560
and emulate uh either threats they're

67
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,239
specifically worried about from

68
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,560
incidences they've had in the past or

69
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,800
using our threat intel research model

70
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,760
apts that are likely to target them in

71
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,319
like a a widespread

72
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,160
campaign rather than a specific targeted

73
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,239
like high-end apt or nation-state type

74
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:46,400
of threat

75
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,319
that's great what i was hearing was just

76
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:49,760
a lot of tailored a lot of tailored

77
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,280
engagements for your customers to make

78
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,200
sure they get the most value out of that

79
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,400
yeah

80
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,840
that's great to hear

81
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,959
um

82
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:58,319
can't thank you enough for your

83
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,200
sponsorship uh uh you really enable the

84
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,360
the village to uh to complete our

85
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,920
mission of trying to uh educate others

86
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,680
in this field to bring as many folks

87
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,440
that are interested uh in offensive

88
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,360
security as possible uh but i'd like to

89
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,560
ask you know what's the best part of

90
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,239
that sponsorship

91
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:15,440
for

92
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,400
for us like it's really um

93
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,840
getting to be engaged with stuff that uh

94
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,000
you know focuses on that red team aspect

95
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,840
of adversary emulation all that stuff to

96
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,760
get that kind of concept out there into

97
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,440
the industry more it's you know really

98
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,840
grown in the last few years of uh people

99
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,599
focusing on like red teaming versus pen

100
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,840
testing um as well as we just like

101
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,640
giving back to the community i uh coin

102
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,360
and i def both got our start at defcon

103
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,959
villages i remember sitting in pack a

104
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,239
hacking village when i didn't know how

105
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:45,760
to run wireshark and learning that kind

106
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,360
of stuff and so

107
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,519
uh getting to give back to the community

108
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:50,720
and help those people that are just

109
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,400
getting started out in their careers is

110
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,760
something that we find really cool and

111
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,760
it's just fun to engage with you guys

112
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,000
too

113
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,519
def con uh black hat b-sides uh lv a

114
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,760
diane initiative so much going on uh

115
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,640
going on in one week there uh what other

116
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,400
plans do you have uh while you're gonna

117
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,280
be there in vegas this uh this summer

118
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,519
uh so we're teaching a class at black

119
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,680
hat we also got an arsenal talk that

120
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,160
we're doing there then over at uh defcon

121
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,839
we're doing two demo labs

122
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,080
uh we're doing bad rats uh initial

123
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,840
access made easy it's one of the tools

124
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,759
that one of our employees developed and

125
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,199
then we'll also be talking about empire

126
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,759
obviously i got a demo lab for that

127
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,560
empire 4.0 and beyond going over what we

128
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,000
did over the last year on software

129
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,720
development as well as a demo of 5.0 and

130
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,000
what we're bringing to the table into

131
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,280
the future

132
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,639
we also have a workshop that we'll be

133
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:43,840
teaching

134
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,520
free which is great for everybody if

135
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,440
you're able to score a ticket it's a

136
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,280
evading detection a beginner's guide to

137
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,639
obfuscation

138
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,840
it is a evasion and obfuscation workshop

139
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,199
if you're able to score a seat great

140
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,400
we'll be able to see you guys there

141
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,759
otherwise

142
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,280
typically a couple people drop out so

143
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,560
you can kind of wait in line and try to

144
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,600
score a seat there as well

145
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,759
and uh i can't thank you enough for all

146
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,840
the work that you've done on empire it's

147
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,520
a fantastic tool that i think that

148
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,600
you've made even better since uh since

149
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,080
you forked it and started maintaining it

150
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,160
um and speaking of projects like that

151
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,080
especially uh you know a lot of effort

152
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,000
goes into these passion projects what

153
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,759
would you say is the importance of open

154
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,160
source in our community

155
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,759
um open source is just a really

156
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,479
community for a variety of reasons um it

157
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,080
gives people opportunity to showcase

158
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,639
their skills to break into the industry

159
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:37,039
that's actually kind of how coin and i

160
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:39,919
got started um and kind of propelled bc

161
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,080
security forward of uh

162
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,919
we were working our very first workshop

163
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,000
we ever taught it at defcon happened to

164
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,759
be the same year that spectre ops

165
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,759
stopped uh supporting

166
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,639
empire um i created a fork specifically

167
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,160
for the workshop that we were doing

168
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,600
because there were some unique things

169
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,039
that we were doing with it

170
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:59,280
um and so after the

171
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,520
lack or the end of support was announced

172
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,400
um

173
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,759
quite a few people in the community

174
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:05,120
reached out to us and asked if we'd keep

175
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,160
supporting it because they thought the

176
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,080
tool was awesome

177
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,240
and uh it also just lowers the barrier

178
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,440
of entry for people trying to um

179
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,680
not only get into the into the community

180
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,840
but barrier of entry for

181
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,680
uh security teams that may not be able

182
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,840
to afford those super high-end tools

183
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,520
like cobalt strike and that kind of

184
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,000
stuff um because not every company has

185
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,440
you know hundreds of thousands of

186
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,440
dollars for their security budget so

187
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,840
providing the tools for people to be

188
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,680
able to uh continue their career in

189
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,840
their jobs and help secure

190
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,360
smaller businesses

191
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,440
with a lower budget is something that we

192
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,080
find important

193
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,560
absolutely and i i can only imagine how

194
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,560
many hours uh your team has put into

195
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,800
just keeping it maintained that's uh

196
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,400
that's something that everybody benefits

197
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,479
from and so you know big thank you uh

198
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:53,919
thank you on that

199
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:56,400
and uh and speaking of uh barry's entry

200
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,880
to our industry uh one one mission that

201
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,720
we have with the red team village is to

202
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,199
provide a lot of hands-on education uh

203
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,199
that's kind of our goal for this year at

204
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,000
def con we run a few a few events uh

205
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,160
throughout the year including a pretty

206
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,639
big ctf uh that we we have at defcon um

207
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,240
with that right what we're trying to do

208
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,759
is just kind of you know open our arms

209
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,199
and invite everyone over to the

210
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,199
offensive side uh you know we we ended

211
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,039
up here and we stayed because we love it

212
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:24,880
and so uh you know what what would be

213
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,720
some of your top recommendations to

214
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,240
anybody wanting to start a career in

215
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,960
cyber security or uh if they're on the

216
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,639
off uh the defensive side you know and

217
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:33,599
they're looking to switch in the

218
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,599
offensive side and what would you say

219
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:37,680
would be good advice for them

220
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,520
uh so one of the things that i always

221
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,440
tell new people when i do some

222
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,280
mentorship or they get asked questions

223
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,280
at conferences and stuff saying action

224
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,560
for them to go to

225
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,639
but kind of something to keep in mind is

226
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,400
that um our cr our career field or like

227
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,560
uh you know domain of knowledge is so

228
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,800
large that it's impossible for us to for

229
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,479
one person know everything you can't be

230
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:01,919
an expert in bluetooth protocols and in

231
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,720
windows processes and active directory

232
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,680
and just on and on so just because you

233
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,440
don't know everything doesn't mean that

234
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,960
you're not making progress or that

235
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,280
you're not uh able to contribute to a

236
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,319
project or something um i can't i don't

237
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:17,759
think there's ever been a training class

238
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,840
that i've taught uh where i haven't had

239
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,560
a

240
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,080
to me a question where i'm like i've

241
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,919
never thought about that before that's a

242
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:25,199
that's a really good question let me go

243
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:26,960
look it up and i've been doing this for

244
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,879
quite a while you'll never be

245
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,280
uh all knowledgeable in everything

246
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,240
so

247
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:32,958
just

248
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:35,120
try to avoid overwhelmed and feel like

249
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,399
just because

250
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,559
uh you've been studying for a year and

251
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,240
someone still asked you a question

252
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,200
you're like i've never even heard of

253
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,958
that topic before don't feel like it

254
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,399
means that you haven't started making

255
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,880
progress in the industry

256
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,519
and just to build off of that is uh just

257
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,760
don't be afraid to ask questions

258
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,519
i know that's a big thing that uh

259
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,120
everybody gets scared of is going out

260
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,320
there and being like oh i don't know

261
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,200
this topic and and that's okay um

262
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,320
typically when you ask the question

263
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,080
there's a dozen other people that that

264
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,160
also have the same question that there's

265
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,600
haven't been out there and just haven't

266
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,680
asked asked it yet so

267
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,360
put yourself out there ask questions and

268
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,200
learn a lot from everybody else because

269
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,279
you know that's the fun part is learning

270
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,040
yeah and then

271
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,839
to continue building off of that um

272
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:19,600
community engagement is really important

273
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,959
too

274
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:23,040
both uh things like there's all kinds of

275
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,440
discord channels and slack channels and

276
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,200
those kinds of things where you start

277
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,040
engaging with the community uh it's a

278
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,880
really good place to

279
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,320
begin meeting people for networking

280
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,600
you'll find tons of people that are

281
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,040
already in this in the industry that

282
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,560
give you some guidance on on how to

283
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,519
progress

284
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,920
um as well as just you'd be surprised

285
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,320
who you run into on random discord

286
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,320
servers and slack channels you'll meet

287
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,160
really big names that are and those

288
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,959
people are more than happy to

289
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,120
answer you know even basic questions

290
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,720
like how do i write my first powershell

291
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,959
script uh the community is generally

292
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:56,480
really friendly to

293
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,839
uh people um when you're seeking how to

294
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:00,880
learn and

295
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,440
new things and that kind of stuff

296
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,120
absolutely especially if you want to get

297
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,959
involved uh you know it doesn't matter

298
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,560
where you are whether you're an expert

299
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,640
or a beginner just just being there

300
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,480
being present trying to get involved

301
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,920
trying to help out right there's

302
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,560
probably a thousand projects out there

303
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,079
that could use some help and so if

304
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:20,240
you've got some dev chops and or you

305
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,839
want to grow uh getting involved with

306
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,320
that is i think a huge benefit for

307
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,320
the you know the primary maintainers as

308
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,959
well as the new folks and so uh you you

309
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,120
can almost access get access to anybody

310
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,880
in this space by joining the right

311
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,560
discords and uh

312
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,160
and taking a look at some of those

313
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,880
organizations
