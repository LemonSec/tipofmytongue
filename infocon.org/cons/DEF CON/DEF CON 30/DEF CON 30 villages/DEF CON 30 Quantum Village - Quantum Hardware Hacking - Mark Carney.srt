1
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:07,859
develop closer to gpus than they are to

2
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:10,320
real CPUs although they are Universal

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,440
right you have to really do quite a lot

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,660
of work in order to access one you have

5
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:18,840
to join a cloud queue for an hour and

6
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,220
then you have to wait for your slot to

7
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,020
come along and hope they don't go down

8
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,960
for a recalibration window it's very

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,359
very complicated it's very very fun it's

10
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,119
like a game of roulette except it takes

11
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:31,859
forever

12
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:33,480
and you have to trust that the other

13
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,160
person isn't rigging the game on the

14
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,500
other side so

15
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,880
Hardware hacking is a thing that I

16
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,800
started to call the extension of my old

17
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,260
work my name my name is Mark I am the

18
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,239
co-organizer with Victoria of quantum

19
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:46,860
Village some of you may know me better

20
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:49,200
as large Cardinal where I did a load of

21
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,360
Hardware hacking stuff like long time

22
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,260
ago

23
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,120
um like I also did stuff like calling

24
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,160
out like cran Sterling a few years ago

25
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,140
that was kind of fun I nearly got sued

26
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,360
but didn't so

27
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,739
what we're going to talk about today is

28
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:03,000
quantum Hardware hacking what are we

29
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,379
going to be doing with Quantum Hardware

30
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:07,140
that is very hacky that is hackish that

31
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:08,700
is actually interesting and I'm going to

32
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:09,960
walk you through some ideas that I've

33
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,180
had some ideas I've managed to make work

34
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,040
and other ideas that we're sort of

35
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,360
pushing forward at the Village so

36
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,460
Hardware hacking for this has a very

37
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,080
loose definition that is going to be

38
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,720
changing and morphological as we go

39
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,700
through this particular presentation so

40
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,799
without further Ado let's introduce my

41
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:28,200
little companion this is blocky it's

42
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,740
like clippy but for you know quantum

43
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:33,479
no

44
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:34,920
it looks like you're trying to hack a

45
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,540
quantum computer

46
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,040
do you want to make an install a

47
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,259
malicious circuit do the redirect Global

48
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:42,479
traffic for a targeted sndl attack or do

49
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:43,680
you want to put a Quantum algorithm

50
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,020
where none has been put before do you

51
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,579
want to also spell algorithm correctly

52
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:50,460
in that slide but never mind you know I

53
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,200
I proofread this a certainly so this is

54
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,479
part one part two of this talk is going

55
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:55,680
to come later in the year at a

56
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,600
conference to be confirmed

57
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,100
we're going to give you a little walking

58
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,479
tour of where we're going to be going

59
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,460
today okay this is the road map so we're

60
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:03,659
going to have a little refresher the

61
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:06,119
road to y2q you've probably seen that q

62
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:08,818
a is coming y2q is on the way we're

63
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:09,959
going to give you a little bit of a

64
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:12,180
context switch a little bit of a way of

65
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,280
going you know what here's what's really

66
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,920
going on okay now

67
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,540
how are we going to actually sort of do

68
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,940
this we're going to say Q day is coming

69
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,379
it is

70
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:26,099
it is the 14th of April 2030 according

71
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:29,340
to the cloud security Alliance okay in

72
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,800
case you're wondering um it's a Sunday

73
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,379
so you know don't take that weekend off

74
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:36,360
make sure you're working uh because

75
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,800
that's where that's when it goes down

76
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,599
according to the cloud security Alliance

77
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,360
this seems a little bit oddly specific

78
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,700
but nevertheless this is what we've been

79
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,280
given okay and some people say oh it's

80
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,440
probability it's going to be you know 50

81
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,319
50 by that time and I get that but the

82
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:53,879
headline was pretty strong and I was

83
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:56,459
like I can't tell yet if this is helpful

84
00:02:56,459 --> 00:03:00,480
or not so when you talk about Quantum

85
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,239
security security Quantum technology for

86
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:05,160
security there's a lot of interesting

87
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,379
things you get told okay I have

88
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:09,720
legitimately been on a vendor call and I

89
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,300
was told that space lasers are going to

90
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,280
fix my security and I was like oh wow oh

91
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,879
my God what space lasers it's amazing oh

92
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:20,760
wow okay what is quantum

93
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,400
okay is it just space lasers no it's

94
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,659
toilet paper

95
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:26,519
this is a brand of toilet paper from the

96
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:29,159
UK called quantum

97
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:32,280
so you can literally wipe your anyway so

98
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,220
a Quantum is just the smallest piece of

99
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:38,459
a thing okay a Quantum of something

100
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:40,620
Quantum effects well you've heard about

101
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,120
some of them already entanglement

102
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:46,080
superposition okay it sounds dodgy I

103
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,720
know it sounds like some kind of blooper

104
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,480
reel from a very dodgy Bluey film but

105
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,860
really these are the phrases that are

106
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,900
used and they have a lot of very rigid

107
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,599
mathematical meaning okay so everything

108
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,819
you see has a good chunk of maths

109
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:02,220
underneath it I say this because I'm a

110
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,440
mathematician that's what I do for fun

111
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,720
really I love it if you want to come and

112
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,019
talk maths talk matsy to me

113
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:12,180
when entanglement is used you see it

114
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,220
less than you see as your position so

115
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,139
when you do these CDs talks you'll often

116
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:18,180
see that it superposition is the real

117
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:20,459
kind of Workhorse entanglement becomes

118
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:21,660
something that gets one and more

119
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,280
important as we go on through different

120
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,160
areas of effect so four domains first is

121
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,080
quantum Computing how would it affect

122
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,880
classical cryptography is a big question

123
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,740
the next one is post Quantum

124
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,780
cryptography okay how are we going to

125
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:36,000
combat the threat that we just found on

126
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,100
the quantum computers right and then

127
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,780
you've got Quantum key distribution you

128
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,759
just heard a kind of a tattoo debate

129
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,500
right you've also had some talks you're

130
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,240
going to hear more talks tomorrow okay

131
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,460
on this particular subject this is where

132
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:50,400
you use quantum physics to actually fix

133
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,800
things okay and the reason the idea is

134
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,360
is that because it's quantum physics

135
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,520
even a quantum computer with all of its

136
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,580
optimizations and speedups can't break

137
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,979
through okay and then you have Quantum

138
00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:03,660
algorithms now Quantum algorithms are

139
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,460
actually really useful okay quantum

140
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,560
computers could have some major

141
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,660
superpowers especially when it comes to

142
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,520
optimization problems so traveling

143
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,919
salesmen-esque problems finding Global

144
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,380
Minima at the moment we use these very

145
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,180
slow gradient descents like in machine

146
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:21,120
learning right it's very slow very

147
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,220
careful designs and if you have these

148
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,740
graphs that do this you'll you find one

149
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:28,139
you go oh that's low enough with Quantum

150
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:31,440
in theory you could just go it's here

151
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,419
and there's the answer

152
00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:35,880
so with the um it's not quite that

153
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,020
straightforward but you know

154
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,639
romantically speaking that's kind of

155
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:39,960
where we're trying to get to

156
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,940
so these are the kind of four domains to

157
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:44,280
keep in mind throughout this entire talk

158
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,320
and indeed the entire Village

159
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,860
now here's a theorem

160
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:52,560
I put bunny ears simply because even in

161
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,300
the original paper there's no formal

162
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,220
proof and I'm a mathematician so if

163
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,419
there's no formal proof it's a little

164
00:05:57,419 --> 00:05:59,639
bit difficult to call it a theorem but

165
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:02,220
the idea here is quite simple

166
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:04,680
when you have a particular problem

167
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,060
say you want to measure the

168
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,800
effectiveness or how long you have to do

169
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,139
a post Quantum solution for it

170
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:12,419
the time trade-off

171
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:14,220
looks something like this

172
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:19,259
if you have a time Z or Z taken the

173
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:21,360
content first to emerge

174
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,639
that's kind of your upper limit

175
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:25,020
you then have to have certain

176
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:28,740
requirements so I you know work in a

177
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:31,440
large company we have data retention

178
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,240
requirements you have some things it's

179
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,039
seven years but some things it's two

180
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,139
years okay there's lots of laws and

181
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:39,240
things about that so I have to remember

182
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,539
that the last piece of data I encrypt

183
00:06:42,539 --> 00:06:44,699
we're using an old method

184
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:46,979
has to then be kept for seven years and

185
00:06:46,979 --> 00:06:49,020
I have to either re-encrypt it which

186
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:51,600
requires effort or just accept that I'm

187
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,500
going to have that potential

188
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,000
vulnerability for seven years depending

189
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,220
on when a quantum computer comes about

190
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:59,460
so the idea here is as X and Y should be

191
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,039
less than or equal to Z If X and Y are

192
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:04,860
greater than Z we start worrying has

193
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,000
problem

194
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,639
all right what does it look like well

195
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,860
2030 was the date we were given

196
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:13,440
so here's some you know why estimates

197
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,960
about four years to implement a pqc

198
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,180
solution who thinks it can be done in

199
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:21,240
all Enterprises in four years

200
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,880
good there's there's no unicorns here so

201
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,919
if you so as we did do it in four years

202
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,560
uh yeah UK police data you have to keep

203
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,759
for two years

204
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,380
whereas commercial data is kept for

205
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:33,419
about four years tax records in most

206
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:34,740
countries are kept for seven years

207
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,539
government records can be kept for 10 or

208
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:39,240
more years mortgages government bonds

209
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,580
long-term kind of uh financial

210
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:43,620
instruments can be

211
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,419
you know characters that are valid for

212
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:47,580
up to 30 40 50 years for government

213
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:48,660
bonds

214
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:51,419
so any kind of digital security you

215
00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:53,639
apply to these things now you eventually

216
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:56,340
have to go this is going to work

217
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:58,740
I'd have to maintain working

218
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:01,620
for long after Quantum is supposed to be

219
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:04,199
here even if you think April 14th of

220
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:06,840
April 2030 is optimistic you can safely

221
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,639
say in 50 years something should have

222
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,440
happened with quantum

223
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,539
so the idea is we're always going to be

224
00:08:12,539 --> 00:08:14,280
trying to push these things down two

225
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,740
very useful Concepts to think about and

226
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,479
these come sort of from conversations

227
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:21,300
that I've had with my co-conspirator for

228
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,639
this Village Victoria V wave

229
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:25,860
um where we have this notion of data

230
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,960
depreciation first and data amortization

231
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,840
second data depreciation data has a

232
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,599
value and that value decays over time it

233
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,520
goes down this is a fairly you know

234
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,200
blunt force way of looking at it and I

235
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,399
promise the hardware stuff is going to

236
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,719
be coming up

237
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:41,159
but when we think about these things

238
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:42,599
it's important to know that underlying

239
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:44,339
this we have a notion of data that is

240
00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:46,260
realized like oh it's always useful or

241
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,540
it's never useful and that's not none of

242
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:51,180
those are right okay what's the truth of

243
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:53,339
the matter is that data is valid for a

244
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:55,080
particular amount of time it is valuable

245
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,880
for a particular amount of time and that

246
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,220
time that value intact decreases like

247
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,240
that

248
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,760
and how it decreases is also dictated by

249
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,500
amortization who's familiar with

250
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,240
financial amortization

251
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,360
yep the idea here is quite similar so

252
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,920
the

253
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,980
the the the lowering of data's value

254
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:16,200
dictates exactly how we should be

255
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,640
approaching it from a kind of an

256
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,980
operational standpoint the more that you

257
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:22,019
have to spend to fix something the more

258
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:24,660
you should be able to work out the that

259
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,580
data's depreciation case in points what

260
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:29,459
I paid for my Starbucks this morning the

261
00:09:29,459 --> 00:09:30,959
fact that I had a Starbucks this morning

262
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,240
isn't particularly useful to anyone

263
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,980
right now

264
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:38,100
right but what my mortgage rate is might

265
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,680
be okay so these things have various

266
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,360
interplayers these are ideas that we're

267
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,260
kind of working on if you've got

268
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,820
comments or questions please do come and

269
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,380
speak to us after we want to get this

270
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:47,580
discussion kind of rolling because

271
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:50,160
people aren't we think we're thinking

272
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,959
about this too much or maybe they are

273
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:53,820
it's very difficult to gain so thoughts

274
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,260
and comments afterwards I'm going to

275
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,160
move on

276
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,920
let's look then at where these problems

277
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:02,339
come in all right the qpu tech stack

278
00:10:02,339 --> 00:10:04,019
this is a quick overview if you've been

279
00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:05,640
wondering where all these things sit

280
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,260
you've heard of python libraries like

281
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:09,899
ticket and kiss kit and Circ you've

282
00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:11,399
heard of language like Q sharp I mean

283
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:13,320
any guess who invented Q sharp yes it's

284
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,580
Microsoft

285
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,800
um you know d-wave libraries also things

286
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,839
like bracket so Amazon have their own

287
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:20,640
library and it's quite well put together

288
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,380
I say that because I've contributed a

289
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:23,940
little bit to it and it's kind of like

290
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,080
nice to see that they're also a

291
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,060
cross-platform there's a ticket or Penny

292
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,920
Lane if you've heard of it who he has

293
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,260
played with any of these

294
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,060
by the end of this Village I hope all

295
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,399
the hands are going to go up okay now we

296
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:37,080
also have some Quantum Computing

297
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,180
manufacturers so we have Arctic concept

298
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,339
circuits who are at the back somewhere

299
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:43,440
uh sort of ferreting away fixing a

300
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,300
quantum computer for us we have IBM

301
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,800
we're getting we have different types of

302
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,420
superconducting this is Ion trap

303
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:52,019
Continuum make uh wait formerly

304
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:54,540
Honeywell uh make uh quantum computers

305
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:56,579
that you literally suspend atoms

306
00:10:56,579 --> 00:10:58,920
individually in radio frequency Wells

307
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:02,040
and then they hit them with lasers

308
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,680
to make computations happen

309
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:07,560
like this stuff is so cool okay like

310
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,420
however you say it this stuff is cool

311
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:12,000
right you have other sort of ideas like

312
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,440
topological qubits which about something

313
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,000
that Microsoft's put a lot of time and

314
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,500
effort into

315
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,540
um does it work well I would have said

316
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,940
uh maybe a few months ago or a year ago

317
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,260
but now there's actually good results

318
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:24,060
that indicate it might

319
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,140
so you're going to see these things

320
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:27,240
develop faster and faster as more and

321
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,800
more money time and effort is put into

322
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,140
them okay so what does that actually

323
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,579
look like when you have a quantum

324
00:11:32,579 --> 00:11:33,959
computer this is a kind of a block

325
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:36,660
diagram it's a little more detailed than

326
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,519
the diagram that you saw earlier but

327
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:41,399
it's broadly true across most Quantum

328
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:42,899
Computing Stacks that I've had to look

329
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:44,760
at and I've looked at quite a few

330
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,779
because

331
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:47,700
you know I like them they're cool like

332
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,500
it's cool like oh oh you're gonna show

333
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,540
me how you hit a laser on an individual

334
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:54,600
Atom from over there that's cool okay so

335
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,760
you have a user the user interacts with

336
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,500
a python Library the python Library

337
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,779
talks to an API it's all very standard

338
00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:03,839
kind of Web 2.0 stuff right that then

339
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:07,440
sends some kind of of instruction to the

340
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,240
actual preprocessor the preprocessor is

341
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,399
where the magic is by the way that's the

342
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:13,620
real value like quantum computers are

343
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:14,820
actually quite straightforward to

344
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,500
manufacture if you know what you're

345
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,240
doing the real value is in the

346
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,279
optimization so is in the compiling the

347
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:22,980
transpiling the recoding all of these

348
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:24,959
things that take it from being a circuit

349
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,959
on 12 qubits that's a thousand slices

350
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:31,320
long with many thousands of gates down

351
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,240
to just a few slices and a few dozen

352
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,079
Gates

353
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:35,880
okay there's a lot of work that you've

354
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,920
been alluded to and that's really where

355
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,360
a lot of the value of these things is

356
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,220
kept you then have a kind of a staging

357
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,660
operation this is again back to things

358
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:45,060
that we really understand very well

359
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:47,459
um the CTO of octal quantum circuits for

360
00:12:47,459 --> 00:12:49,019
example used to work in the gaming

361
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:51,360
industry as in uh online games I think

362
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,459
I'm not sure it's EA but like you know

363
00:12:53,459 --> 00:12:54,720
he's used to building a very big

364
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,360
hyperscale things where you have lots of

365
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,519
queuing and lots of organization things

366
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,959
to do like that's actually the actual

367
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,000
engineering problem that's the quantum

368
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,339
Computing right as opposed to just

369
00:13:05,339 --> 00:13:07,260
Quantum magic which is actually just

370
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,899
here so the message doesn't get sent

371
00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:12,360
over to a control system that just turns

372
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:15,959
these constructions into waves

373
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:19,320
because waves talk to photons particles

374
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:22,260
Etc and those particles then do a thing

375
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,240
you then have some way of measuring it

376
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,279
out so you get the result down

377
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:27,660
now

378
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,639
the hacker mindset kicks in at some

379
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:30,720
point doesn't it

380
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,839
how many of these things are running

381
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:36,420
Tech that we're very familiar with

382
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,579
like you know windows

383
00:13:38,579 --> 00:13:40,200
or Linux

384
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,500
or similar I pretty much all of it

385
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,779
all right the only thing that isn't is

386
00:13:45,779 --> 00:13:47,160
the qpu

387
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,500
everything else is running a system that

388
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,720
we know how to affect and we know has

389
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,420
potential vulnerabilities and issues

390
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:55,860
but the question then becomes like well

391
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:57,540
what would you do

392
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,620
so

393
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,660
malicious circuits

394
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:02,820
you who will be told certain things that

395
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,440
can't be done

396
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,240
and then you'll realize actually they

397
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,459
can because there's oddly specific

398
00:14:08,459 --> 00:14:10,920
parameters in physics and what we're

399
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,720
doing here is we're sort of seeing it

400
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,279
and going a little bit around it so

401
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:15,839
let's just think about this what happens

402
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:17,339
within the quantum circuit where could

403
00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:19,260
we have hackers poking well pretty much

404
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:21,839
anywhere right hackers could appear at

405
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,820
any point in this tool chain and that

406
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:26,339
means we actually as hackers as people

407
00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:28,440
who understands cyber security we should

408
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,240
be interested in this right because

409
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,040
quantum computers are getting a lot of

410
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,120
attention they're getting a lot of

411
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,860
valuable information passed through them

412
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:37,440
okay at some point I'm fairly convinced

413
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,899
you'll have a pen test which involves a

414
00:14:39,899 --> 00:14:42,779
quantum computer stack right and it will

415
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:44,399
be the stack it won't be the quantum

416
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:45,899
computer because the quantum computer is

417
00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:48,060
just microwaves hitting something that's

418
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:50,820
really cold or in a really empty space

419
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:54,000
like a vacuum an ultra vacuum right so

420
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,279
the control system the rest of it is

421
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:58,260
really where the attack surface lies

422
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,880
okay

423
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,199
so what we're going to do suppose you

424
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:02,820
could hack a quantum computer or what

425
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:03,660
next

426
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,880
suppose you get access to a controller

427
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,459
why well here's a little bit of quantum

428
00:15:08,459 --> 00:15:09,959
information theory for you this little

429
00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:13,260
friend is the C naught gate okay the

430
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:16,380
controlled knot so the control is the

431
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:19,199
black blob the knot is the lower circle

432
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:20,820
with a cross in it

433
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:23,160
the knock gate does exactly what you

434
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,800
think it does it takes a qubit that is

435
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:29,519
pointing up and it makes it Point down

436
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:30,779
okay

437
00:15:30,779 --> 00:15:32,760
that's what it does the control bit

438
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:36,180
means that if the upper qubit is off

439
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:37,680
then it won't

440
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,160
flip it and if the upper qubit is on it

441
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,300
will flip it

442
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,579
and then you realize that when you

443
00:15:44,579 --> 00:15:46,740
actually do the logic gate circuit it's

444
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:49,920
an xor on the lower qubit

445
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,959
that's going to be important

446
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:54,839
because xor is addition without carry

447
00:15:54,839 --> 00:15:57,240
correct yeah

448
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,860
so here's what we would do here's what I

449
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:01,560
would do suppose I'm a hacker and I'm on

450
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,360
one of these systems and I have access

451
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,920
to the control mechanism what would I do

452
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,440
I would find empty qubits

453
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,100
and I would add c not Gates like this

454
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,019
so suppose you have 20 qubits on a

455
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:14,220
Quantum system

456
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:17,339
and you have 10 in use I have 10 free

457
00:16:17,339 --> 00:16:19,320
I can take a full copy

458
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,180
and it's just code

459
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,620
right if you've done some of the

460
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:24,180
challenges this is just code you just

461
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:25,860
add some code to the thing and then you

462
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:28,320
can take a copy out now someone will say

463
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,760
oh but there's a thing called the no

464
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,560
cloning theorem it's very important the

465
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,779
no cloning theorem but it doesn't apply

466
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:36,060
here because we're not talking about the

467
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:38,220
total Quantum State we're talking about

468
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:42,180
the state inner basis remember ketz or

469
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:44,820
bracket notation here is always going to

470
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,860
be pointing up for zero pointing down

471
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:47,820
for one

472
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:51,120
and so our our basis is in that vertical

473
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,579
okay because that basis is in the

474
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:55,320
vertical that's where we can actually

475
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,180
apply this and get a perfect copy out

476
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:59,699
and if you'd like I will happily show

477
00:16:59,699 --> 00:17:01,500
you a demonstration of this later okay

478
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,940
but that's literally a thing you can do

479
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:06,000
it seems very simple it seems like oh

480
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,520
that should be a thing but people aren't

481
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,740
I don't think quite getting some of this

482
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:11,880
you can also do this here's another

483
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:15,959
funnel so on the left you have uh you

484
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:17,579
can see my last yeah on the left you

485
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:19,679
have an entanglement circuit so if you

486
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,839
put a hadamar gate that's a

487
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,099
superposition

488
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:25,799
and then with a c not gate those two

489
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:28,559
qubits are now entangled

490
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:31,140
now this is just an example circuit so I

491
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:32,940
know what the output is going to be it

492
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:37,200
should always be zero zero or one one

493
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,820
and there's some noise that Creeps in so

494
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:40,679
you get other answers sometimes

495
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:43,200
but what I'm doing here on the right is

496
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,419
I'm adding noise I'm adding a little

497
00:17:45,419 --> 00:17:48,000
rotation I'm just taking things just

498
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,919
slightly out of alignment

499
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:52,200
and ultimately in the short term you

500
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,880
probably wouldn't notice here as actual

501
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,460
graphs I ran these this morning

502
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:59,280
okay so this is on real Quantum Hardware

503
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,600
from IBM

504
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,600
this is quite nice it's a kind of bias

505
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,539
so you have zero zero and you have one

506
00:18:06,539 --> 00:18:09,059
one and there's a few in the middle

507
00:18:09,059 --> 00:18:13,200
yeah if you add some noisy Gates and

508
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,179
then notice in this circuit I use a c

509
00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:17,400
knot to just add that noise in

510
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,660
yeah

511
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:21,720
then I get a little bit of noise being

512
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,299
carried over here you get noise amping

513
00:18:24,299 --> 00:18:27,179
up in the circuit all right now what is

514
00:18:27,179 --> 00:18:28,740
that important on the short term you

515
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,179
might not notice this

516
00:18:30,179 --> 00:18:31,980
but if this is added to all the circuits

517
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:34,440
that you run you start being uh the the

518
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,419
reliability of your circuits especially

519
00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:38,520
as the circuits get longer the liability

520
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,660
goes down

521
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:42,419
so it's effectively a Quantum DDOS

522
00:18:42,419 --> 00:18:44,340
right this is what you would do to

523
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:45,960
really sort of mess with about where the

524
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,240
measurements that are going on okay

525
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,980
and this is the kind of thinking that I

526
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:51,600
think we should be fostering this is the

527
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,380
kind of thing I think we should be

528
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,940
looking at to go what would we look for

529
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,980
what would we try and do what we try and

530
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,780
say what is a threat to someone taking

531
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:00,000
over your controller apart from just

532
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,640
stealing quantum computer time which is

533
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,200
very valuable I won't give you numbers

534
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,640
but if you want to come and find me

535
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,020
later like sort of there's a lot of

536
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,600
there's a lot of value in this

537
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:13,400
real world issues I'm I'm quite sort of

538
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,660
keen to talk about the real world

539
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,580
problems that we have when it comes to

540
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:20,220
Quantum computing so this is the CIA

541
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:22,260
triangle we've seen this a dozen times

542
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:24,299
you might notice it in hexagons but I'm

543
00:19:24,299 --> 00:19:26,039
kind of Arty like that I'm not Arty at

544
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:28,620
all I'm totally not asking

545
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:29,760
things like certificate management

546
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,679
transport layer security digital

547
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:33,539
signatures you know upset tunnels

548
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:35,160
encrypted confidential Communications

549
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,960
Key Management identity management these

550
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,280
are all vulnerable

551
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,720
okay

552
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,820
I was once asked

553
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,380
by a professor in Quantum information

554
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:44,880
Theory what would a criminal do with a

555
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,320
quantum computer

556
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,900
well suppose you have a certificate

557
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,880
there's RSA signed

558
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,940
and you can crack the RSA private key so

559
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,320
you can use a quantum computer to get

560
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,460
the factors

561
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:57,840
what would you do

562
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,700
well I would fake a load of credit notes

563
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,460
and sign them from the bank

564
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:05,520
you know like crime doesn't change

565
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,280
the tools and mechanisms of crime will

566
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:12,240
change but like how would I oh

567
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,220
whoops it Daisy

568
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,380
the tools and mechanisms of crime will

569
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:19,980
change but crime itself no

570
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:22,620
no have I actually seen that no like no

571
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:24,240
one's actually doing that that's not a

572
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,179
real thing but the look of Terror on my

573
00:20:27,179 --> 00:20:28,980
aggressionist face when I said oh yeah I

574
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,900
just do crime you know if I was a

575
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,460
criminal like because I mean the clues

576
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:34,020
are the name right like that's kind of

577
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:35,039
what they do

578
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:36,840
um so the idea that we sort of have

579
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,760
these issues and then I was like oh yes

580
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,200
but we just shortened the circuit

581
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,240
shortened the certificate lifetime it

582
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,679
doesn't matter if a certificate is on a

583
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:44,760
chain and all I'm doing is validating

584
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,559
certificates on a chain and the dates

585
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,600
line up with a credit note that it

586
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,580
doesn't really matter I can fake most of

587
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:52,799
those things because you know I'm a

588
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,000
criminal

589
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,220
so that's that's really how these things

590
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:57,840
are going to go down potentially

591
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,940
this is a mess of a slide I'm really

592
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,860
sorry but hopefully you'll understand

593
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:04,260
something you heard about earlier was a

594
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:06,179
store now decrypt later

595
00:21:06,179 --> 00:21:07,919
now I have a problem with the way this

596
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:10,340
is written

597
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:12,780
Stone Advocate later means you take a

598
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:14,520
Quantum capable attacker

599
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:17,220
but they're not quite Quantum enough yet

600
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:19,200
so there's a store stuff

601
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,940
and then they decrypt it later

602
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:22,559
when that content computer gets good

603
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:26,400
enough they go and they decrypt it now

604
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,200
how is that going to be sort of actuated

605
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,400
what's actually going to sort of happen

606
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,480
well

607
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,600
if you actually took a dump of all of

608
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,980
the internet or even just all of the

609
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:36,780
data going in and out of a company for a

610
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:39,780
day or 10 days or a year you've you can

611
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:41,760
decrypt it sure but you've also made a

612
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,679
data problem interestingly enough I did

613
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:45,960
a problem that I don't think is made any

614
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:49,080
more tractable with a quantum computer

615
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,760
all right the content computer doesn't

616
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,320
help you though

617
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,919
right so the problem is you you store

618
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:57,720
this data you decrypt this data you

619
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,460
still have to go through index and sort

620
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:03,360
right and that's not necessarily trivial

621
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,880
so what would you do well

622
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:08,940
I would focus on known endpoints

623
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:11,280
so you know vpns or other sort of

624
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,020
point-to-point wand technology

625
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:16,140
and I would say well could I manipulate

626
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:18,960
some bgp to redirect the important

627
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:23,280
traffic encrypted to me and maybe take a

628
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,280
copy because then I know that I got

629
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,620
valuable stuff it doesn't matter how

630
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:30,360
much valuable stuff I've got I just

631
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,940
search it and I find something valuable

632
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:36,539
you know like has anyone heard any bgp

633
00:22:36,539 --> 00:22:38,900
attacks

634
00:22:39,299 --> 00:22:41,760
couldn't possibly come in anyway

635
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,980
so

636
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:46,740
the last definite the last way in which

637
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,659
and I know I've got I've I'm a little

638
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:50,760
bit ahead of time but I'm I'm just sort

639
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,080
of going through some ideas that we've

640
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,280
had so that I've been putting all this

641
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,380
together uh for all Quantum Villages it

642
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:56,100
is

643
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,659
um we want to sort of also look at

644
00:22:57,659 --> 00:22:59,159
Hardware hacking in a very different

645
00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:00,240
sense

646
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,039
um one thing you will find is we're

647
00:23:02,039 --> 00:23:03,360
going to boldly put Quantum where

648
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,159
Quantum has ever been put before and

649
00:23:05,159 --> 00:23:07,020
there might be a reason for that but we

650
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:10,140
don't care because we're hackers so

651
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:11,280
um we've actually going to release this

652
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,380
later today we've built what we think is

653
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:15,059
the first ever embedded Quantum

654
00:23:15,059 --> 00:23:16,140
simulator

655
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:20,039
and I've got it here

656
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:21,539
it's this

657
00:23:21,539 --> 00:23:24,720
it runs a little pie Pico and it has

658
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,299
four qubits and a menu

659
00:23:27,299 --> 00:23:29,940
and a colorful logo

660
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:32,480
um why did we do this because we good

661
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,580
and you know and it's kind of cool and

662
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,559
it's actually really handy I was sitting

663
00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:39,299
next to someone on the plane over to

664
00:23:39,299 --> 00:23:42,299
Vegas and I handed it to them uh plugged

665
00:23:42,299 --> 00:23:43,799
in on the side so they have power I

666
00:23:43,799 --> 00:23:45,000
wasn't mean

667
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,200
um and and they were they were playing

668
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,179
with it for like 10 15 minutes and I got

669
00:23:48,179 --> 00:23:50,220
a lot of work done and then you know

670
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,419
they sort of had questions at the end

671
00:23:51,419 --> 00:23:53,039
and they were stimulated by the whole

672
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:54,600
the whole it's in your hand and you can

673
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,039
do things with it you wouldn't

674
00:23:56,039 --> 00:23:58,020
necessarily think that this is actually

675
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,340
going to make a difference but then

676
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:02,340
suddenly it does right I think that

677
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,080
actually this is just a bit of fun uh

678
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,539
we're gonna release the code later we do

679
00:24:06,539 --> 00:24:08,580
have a couple of these

680
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:09,600
um I know a lot of people picked up

681
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,280
there we're gonna sort of reserve them

682
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:14,580
for CTF challenges first and then after

683
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:16,500
that we'll see sort of how we divvy

684
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,940
things out based on you know whatever

685
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:20,760
but it's just a wave Share Board and

686
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,440
then uh Raspberry Pi Pico on the back

687
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,059
and it works really well I could

688
00:24:24,059 --> 00:24:25,559
probably get up to six or seven qubits

689
00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:27,000
on it but then I run out of space on the

690
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,700
UI because I build uis like I build

691
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:34,440
anything else out of dreams and tears so

692
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,880
so you know this is but this is like

693
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,200
sort of this is the thing that you we

694
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,580
should be doing like we should be

695
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:40,380
putting concept simulators the code is

696
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:41,940
written as if it's a library so you

697
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,380
could just import this and then you've

698
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:45,120
got a Quantum simulator on your next

699
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,740
Arduino project

700
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:49,080
you might not want it but that's a

701
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51,960
different problem all right so

702
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,460
another thing we've been looking at is

703
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:55,500
like sort of use of quantum algorithms

704
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:58,260
for security I alluded to this earlier

705
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:59,880
right so

706
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:03,000
who here has ever used or have ever

707
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,039
heard of attack graphs as in attack

708
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:08,039
networks a few people who here has used

709
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:10,140
bloodhound

710
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:12,299
wow not that many people from what I

711
00:25:12,299 --> 00:25:14,159
what I anticipated okay fine so for

712
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:16,320
those who don't know Bloodhound is a

713
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:19,140
tool that treats a network a Windows ad

714
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:23,220
Network as a graph a network graph and

715
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:26,580
it lets you plot routes to domain admin

716
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:29,820
so attackers think like that right we we

717
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,740
think in terms of going from here

718
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:33,960
finding a way go to here find a way

719
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:36,299
around go to here and then got the

720
00:25:36,299 --> 00:25:39,059
network right that's how we think

721
00:25:39,059 --> 00:25:41,340
Defenders going the other way is much

722
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:43,980
harder okay because you've got to think

723
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:46,320
this way and then very completely think

724
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,240
around that problem and then think

725
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,159
completely around again and then look

726
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:52,440
for very complicated kind of ideas and

727
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,240
it's not that straightforward

728
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,760
Now using graphs is a really good idea I

729
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,919
will tell you this is one reason why if

730
00:25:58,919 --> 00:26:01,320
you can store your vulnerability data as

731
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,520
a graph

732
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,679
right because whenever you get the data

733
00:26:04,679 --> 00:26:07,260
from any vendor it comes host first so

734
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:08,460
here's a host with a list of

735
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:09,539
vulnerabilities

736
00:26:09,539 --> 00:26:11,520
you never ask it those questions though

737
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,919
do you you go which hosts have this

738
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:15,539
vulnerability

739
00:26:15,539 --> 00:26:17,100
so you get the date of the wrong way

740
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:17,940
around

741
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:20,220
but if you put it into a graph database

742
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:23,700
you just look at the edges choose a node

743
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:26,460
value ID look at the right edges and it

744
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,020
automatically comes out everything takes

745
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,460
about the same length of time as

746
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:31,500
everything else but actually things work

747
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:34,380
really well Pro tip and you can do this

748
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:36,120
on like sort of you know very minimal

749
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,919
resources I recommend it so we've been

750
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:39,120
looking at how you can actually then

751
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,520
apply content to that because you can

752
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,440
because remember the traveling sales

753
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,539
problem traveling salesman problem is

754
00:26:45,539 --> 00:26:47,700
just a network problem

755
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:50,340
when you apply it and you can solve that

756
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:52,559
with some quantum computers

757
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:55,140
so maybe one day we will have quantum

758
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:58,860
computers fixing patch prioritization

759
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:01,440
because we've started to do some fun

760
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:05,720
kind of toying with it and it works

761
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:07,919
I was very surprised but that was kind

762
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:09,179
of where we were going

763
00:27:09,179 --> 00:27:12,000
so I I'm not occupied all of my time I

764
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,500
know I'm just going to get down to very

765
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,840
quickly a very short closing because I

766
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,100
know that it's getting a little bit on

767
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,480
and we're going to have a little bit of

768
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,980
a break and then the last talk is at 4

769
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:22,200
30. an amazing talk from James Howe

770
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,419
James are you here

771
00:27:24,419 --> 00:27:26,340
that's a no so I'm gonna I'm gonna go

772
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:27,960
and Hunt James

773
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,000
um and he's gonna give you an amazing

774
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,520
talk on pqc he he lives and breathes it

775
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:36,480
and I think it's great so closing

776
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,000
have a read

777
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,760
this is a really good book on pqc

778
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,220
this is a really good book on Quantum

779
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:45,840
computing

780
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,580
people used to say oh but I don't know

781
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:49,440
the Maths for this I don't have the math

782
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,440
for it that's fine the book on the right

783
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:55,020
has all the linear algebra in the last

784
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:57,000
part it comes in three parts the last

785
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,179
part is all the linear algebra you need

786
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:02,640
so with that I'm going to thank you for

787
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,700
your attention I will take questions

788
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:09,260
and happy hacking thank you

789
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:14,159
a question

790
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:17,659
you shouted at me I'll repeat it

791
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:40,020
so the question seems to be and I might

792
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:42,059
get this wrong but the question is uh

793
00:28:42,059 --> 00:28:44,640
how much do we consider the quantum

794
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,940
algorithm in play to be vulnerable

795
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:51,559
you can come up here it's fine

796
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,179
oh yeah

797
00:28:57,179 --> 00:28:59,820
oh okay right okay so voltage glitch

798
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:01,919
attacks against quantum computers right

799
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:03,659
um I don't know of any mainly because

800
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:05,400
it's very difficult to get close to a

801
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,900
quantum computer I've been trying for

802
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:09,539
years I mean it they're they're quite

803
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:12,000
expensive I found you know 15 20 million

804
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,640
a piece for some of them so

805
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,960
um you know they're

806
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,520
they're not they're not quite as

807
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,020
straightforward to get a hold of so they

808
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,460
probably do have lots of side Channel

809
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:22,080
attacks but we don't know about them yet

810
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,419
because no one can get close enough to

811
00:29:24,419 --> 00:29:26,640
side Channel them

812
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,640
question

813
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,899
so the question is why couldn't you fix

814
00:29:33,899 --> 00:29:35,940
a Noisy Neighbor attack with uh regular

815
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,500
signal processing methods for line noise

816
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:40,140
uh you absolutely can the point is is

817
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:41,580
that you're still applying a statistical

818
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:43,440
bias deliberately and it's actually

819
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,600
artificial to the system so when you do

820
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,640
it you reliably get skewed results out

821
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,380
the other side and if you do things like

822
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:52,200
sort of try and do I try to do some qml

823
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,700
training with it with a similar with a

824
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:57,419
simulator so this is all in theory uh

825
00:29:57,419 --> 00:30:00,000
but like the the model never converged

826
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
it just refused to act now could I get

827
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,820
that out with some DSP like

828
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:09,240
um techniques yes I probably could

829
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,220
um however there is the idea that I will

830
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:13,020
probably know what I'm looking for I

831
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,460
know what I'm fixing because I know what

832
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:16,740
the attack was so it would be

833
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:18,840
determining how much it's an attack and

834
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:21,600
detection of it versus something else so

835
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,940
that's a really interesting question

836
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:26,779
any others

837
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:32,470
[Music]

838
00:30:50,059 --> 00:30:52,679
well that's it

839
00:30:52,679 --> 00:30:54,419
come and get it from here thank you very

840
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:56,130
much

841
00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:59,639
