1
00:00:05,899 --> 00:00:08,220
thank you Mark

2
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,500
um I assume everyone can hear me I'll

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,420
try to stay as close as possible to the

4
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,940
microphone but I have a tendency to walk

5
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:17,279
and show so and I don't know if that let

6
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:20,580
me try to see if I can carry it with me

7
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:23,820
yeah yeah it works wonderful okay

8
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,439
um so yeah I'll talk to you about a

9
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,980
special team in uh in in quantinium a

10
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:30,840
team called it's the Oxford team it's

11
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,180
located in Oxford United Kingdom and

12
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,399
it's a team called Quantum compositional

13
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:37,739
intelligence and it's a team that is

14
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:40,440
focused on working on the theory on

15
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,920
Quantum logic and Quantum foundation so

16
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,040
we do very theoretical work indeed where

17
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,440
where the possibly the only team that

18
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,660
doesn't have any commercial pressure so

19
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,059
I know that Defcon you know

20
00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:56,879
um it's um you know we are doing things

21
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,860
that are not cooperate in that team

22
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:01,559
we're really doing pure research

23
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:04,799
okay and so the agenda for this talk

24
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,780
today is

25
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:10,140
um our talk to you about yeah what is

26
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:11,700
quantum logic and Quantum foundations

27
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,220
and why we are working on this field

28
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,500
that is very abstract and seems to be

29
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,119
actually very disconnected from

30
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:20,159
applications but you'll see that there

31
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,500
is some value in doing that

32
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,320
um and then I'll talk to you about a new

33
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,540
language that we developed

34
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,280
um I'll tell you what that means but

35
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,979
this is very very powerful

36
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:35,340
and then I'll I'll give you a success an

37
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:38,340
example of a success uh from this

38
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,680
research so you think like you know very

39
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,259
theoretical research Can it have any

40
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:47,340
practical uh usefulness it does and the

41
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,020
example is ticket I mean Mark talked to

42
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,340
you about tickets yesterday for those

43
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:51,600
who are here

44
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,280
um I'll tell you a bit more why ticket

45
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,200
is the best compiler in the world in

46
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,320
Quantum and that is actually a result of

47
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,240
the res of the research we do in theory

48
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,979
and and Foundations

49
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:05,939
in the Oxford team then uh I'll show you

50
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:08,880
some uh I'll talk to you about a very

51
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,760
very uh fascinating project and I'm sure

52
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,260
some of you especially though that are

53
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,120
not those that are not very well versed

54
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,640
in linear algebra will find very very

55
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,260
interesting

56
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:22,200
and I'll briefly talk about the culture

57
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,640
of our team

58
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,819
um and I'll finish with an introduction

59
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:28,640
to Lambeck which is

60
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,319
the you know the open source toolkit

61
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:34,140
that uh those of you were doing the

62
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:36,420
challenge the CTF Challenge on Quantum

63
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:37,800
natural language processing will be

64
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,480
using

65
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,340
if you want the slides I'll send them to

66
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,239
you afterwards um

67
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,160
so you wonder what we're doing in this

68
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,620
team we're doing this

69
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:52,319
um we're also doing that

70
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:55,379
and we're doing this as well and so you

71
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:56,640
see like all these very beautiful

72
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,379
pictures

73
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:00,060
um you obviously don't know what they

74
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:03,180
mean don't ask me to explain to you what

75
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,640
they mean in detail uh this is this is

76
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,519
some very rigorous mathematics

77
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:11,459
in fact it's um it's an area of

78
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:13,019
mathematics that is called category

79
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:14,519
Theory and I don't know if some of you

80
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:16,500
have heard of category Theory but

81
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,480
category theory is possibly the most

82
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,360
abstract field of mathematics the goal

83
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,400
of category theory is to build a meta

84
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,040
theory of mathematics so when you deal

85
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,599
with categories you deal with the most

86
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,959
you you abstract any objects or every

87
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,300
every field of mathematics and you look

88
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:36,000
at relationship between them so I don't

89
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,099
think that in in any field of knowledge

90
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:39,599
you can go more abstract than this this

91
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:43,080
is this is logic at its purest form

92
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,480
so you think like okay well if it's if

93
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,760
it's pure and abstract

94
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,040
how could this be useful

95
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,299
um

96
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:54,120
I I'll tell you but but it's very useful

97
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,239
so that I think so a lot of people here

98
00:03:57,239 --> 00:03:59,400
are interested because they believe that

99
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,360
Quantum technologies will be a a major

100
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,040
technological Revolution or at least

101
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,200
there is a high chance for Quantum

102
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,239
technology to be one of them one of the

103
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:10,920
largest technological revolution of all

104
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,900
time of course I'm working in the field

105
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,340
I really believe that it's possibly

106
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:15,720
going to be the largest industrial

107
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,298
revolution of all time but what no one

108
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:20,699
knows is how it will look like no one

109
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:22,500
knows exactly how

110
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,540
um this industry would look like in 10

111
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:27,120
years 20 years 30 years in the same way

112
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,500
that no one when they were working on

113
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,479
transistors would would foresee that we

114
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,220
have the technology we have now and the

115
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,979
usage we have now and I think the best

116
00:04:34,979 --> 00:04:38,100
way to deal with uncertainty in that um

117
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,960
in this you know in this in this

118
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,660
emerging field is to not just look at

119
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:45,479
applications but also to look at every

120
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:47,940
level of the every every part of the

121
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:49,259
chain

122
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:51,300
um from very applied science to very

123
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,940
fundamental science and I think that

124
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:57,259
having a team working on on foundations

125
00:04:57,259 --> 00:05:00,180
is is actually what makes continuing my

126
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:02,280
company unique because we are like you

127
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,320
know like a country we're not just

128
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,900
investing in the applied stuff we are

129
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,280
investing in the fundamental stuff so

130
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,780
that will give us you know we're

131
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,940
building an ecosystem so there will be

132
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:14,160
interactions and I think it's it's it's

133
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,860
a good way of of of of innovating you

134
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,960
need to be need to be knowledgeable at

135
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,660
every level of the of the chain

136
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:22,860
um

137
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:26,280
just a note on our team when I say it's

138
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,259
it's a pure research team it's actually

139
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:30,360
a spin-off of the University of Oxford

140
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,419
Quantum logic and Quantum foundations uh

141
00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:35,280
research group so that group that was

142
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,720
working on fundamental research in

143
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,020
Oxford spun out and now it's part of

144
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,600
Continuum

145
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,680
um

146
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,139
yeah so that's another example of these

147
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:49,380
diagrammatic algebra so we call this

148
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,360
diagrammatic reasoning or diagrammatic

149
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,880
algebra so this is a rigorous form of

150
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,400
mathematics but

151
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,800
um it's it's using pictures and the

152
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,440
reason behind it

153
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,600
is that again I'll send you the slide

154
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,160
afterward don't worry

155
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:05,880
um

156
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,120
is that um

157
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,860
let's go to the fundamentals actually

158
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:13,800
when we speak when we use language we

159
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,699
when we write for example we write from

160
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:19,440
doesn't matter you know if it's English

161
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,900
it's from left to right if it's French

162
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:24,539
from left to right uh if it's Arabic

163
00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:26,940
it's from right to left if it's Hebrews

164
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:29,520
from right to left as well and I guess

165
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,560
in ancient Chinese

166
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,000
um you know it was from top to bottom

167
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,460
but at the end of the day no matter what

168
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:38,580
language you speak you only always write

169
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:41,160
linearly it doesn't matter you know you

170
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,780
could say okay well Chinese characters

171
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,880
are pictures but then you compose them

172
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,520
one after the other right and the reason

173
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,740
behind this is possibly because when we

174
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:52,620
speak we can only say things in a linear

175
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,259
way of course your your the voice sound

176
00:06:55,259 --> 00:06:57,240
is going to go in three dimension sound

177
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,860
propagates in three dimensions but

178
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,780
whether you listen to it here or there

179
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,520
it's the same message it's a linear

180
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,139
message you don't say three things at

181
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:05,160
the same time in three different

182
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,960
directions right and you can only

183
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,479
process this information with you here

184
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:11,280
linearly right

185
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,860
but and it's the same in mathematics

186
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:16,380
when when we express Concepts or when we

187
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,940
try to describe the world the physical

188
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:20,639
world we use we use mathematics and we

189
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,319
express it in linear ways then you could

190
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,300
say oh well how about matrices you know

191
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,400
matrices are you know three by three you

192
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,720
know they're they're two-dimensional

193
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,120
objects but yet matrices you always

194
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,400
compose them one after the other you've

195
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,199
never seen you know well yeah you've

196
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:35,819
never seen something or you can compose

197
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:37,680
them in parallel but your your language

198
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,080
is only going to be linear you're never

199
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,580
going to see you know matrices here and

200
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:43,560
then you you add it above and add

201
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,139
another one below you it wouldn't make

202
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:48,599
sense right and there is nothing in

203
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:51,539
nature that there is no law of nature

204
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:54,900
that says that Concepts would want to

205
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,479
live on a one-dimensional medium there's

206
00:07:57,479 --> 00:08:00,539
nothing that says that and so we human

207
00:08:00,539 --> 00:08:03,060
have been constrained by language to

208
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,819
express and describe Concepts in a

209
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,380
one-dimensional way which is not

210
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:09,660
necessarily very well suited to describe

211
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:12,060
those Concepts and by that we've added

212
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,860
what we call you know some sort of

213
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,840
bureaucracies to constrain them in this

214
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,860
medium

215
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,960
so it means that possibly this medium is

216
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,940
not very efficient and one of the things

217
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,500
that we've shown in our group is that

218
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,120
okay this for people we're good at

219
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,800
linear algebra I will be I wouldn't say

220
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,539
it's obvious but I would require a few

221
00:08:27,539 --> 00:08:29,580
seconds of compute time but there will

222
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,199
they will be able to say that the left

223
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,520
hand side is equal to the right hand

224
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,200
side for those who've never done linear

225
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,320
algebra well it's not so obvious but

226
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,719
still it's an easy example but still

227
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:41,700
required some compute time

228
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,979
in diagrammatic reasoning

229
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:45,600
it looks like this

230
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,140
and there is no loss of information of

231
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:50,700
course you haven't studied diagrammatic

232
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,980
reasoning so you can only believe me on

233
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:55,620
this but the two the two right hand side

234
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:57,720
and left hand side that are expressed in

235
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,399
two different ways with linear algebra

236
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:01,920
are expressed in one unique way

237
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,380
in diagrammatic reasoning and of course

238
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,420
this is just one example so it doesn't

239
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,220
prove the rule doesn't prove the theory

240
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:10,380
but we have many many other examples and

241
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,360
I'd be very happy to send you

242
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,740
um you know references and things to

243
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:16,019
look at this the point behind this is

244
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:16,860
that

245
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,060
um

246
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:21,060
these two things are equal and the

247
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,580
diagrammatic one is wait much more

248
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:26,580
efficient and intuitive to express this

249
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:28,500
and

250
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,860
this is so where you know I'm going to

251
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,600
talk about ticket that Mark introduced

252
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,100
yesterday Mark and Catherine introduced

253
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,620
tickets yesterday this is one of the

254
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:40,860
reasons that ticket is the best compiler

255
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:43,680
right now in um Quantum Computing this

256
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,860
is the reason why even IBM is using

257
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,420
ticket to

258
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:51,000
um to work on their own system and

259
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,200
they're actually very interested about

260
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,100
that

261
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,260
this is also why Google is actually

262
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,720
using diagrammatic reasoning to do

263
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,339
circuit optimization

264
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:02,220
so yeah diagrammatic reasoning is used

265
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,380
to do circuit optimization that's uh the

266
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:05,940
slide from Mark yesterday showing you

267
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,580
you know the the different you know uh

268
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,580
series of gates that can be simplified

269
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,779
using diagrammatic reasoning

270
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:14,220
representing Quantum circuit with

271
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,740
diagrammatic reasoning makes it much

272
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,060
more intuitive

273
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,980
you know as you could see in the in the

274
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:21,660
algebra versus diagrammatic reasoning

275
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:24,420
for the system to see the

276
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:26,220
simplifications we actually came up with

277
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:28,560
a series of rewriting rules so when we

278
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,240
represent a system with a you know

279
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,700
diagrammatic way then we can easily

280
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,440
convert it in a much simpler form

281
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,380
without any loss of information and

282
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:39,180
making it literally completely

283
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,660
equivalent

284
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:45,360
um but maybe more profound than this

285
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,339
um is that

286
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:50,160
teaching physics using diagrammatic

287
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,200
reasoning could make it

288
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,920
much more intuitive and we're actually

289
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:58,680
running an experiment uh right now uh I

290
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,660
mean we're about to start we've we've uh

291
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,339
We've designed the experiment we've

292
00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:03,899
we're in the process of recruiting

293
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:07,260
students in which we're teaching quantum

294
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:09,779
mechanics Quantum information Theory to

295
00:11:09,779 --> 00:11:12,660
high school kids

296
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:15,180
and at the end of the experiment so it's

297
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:17,820
going to be a three month course and at

298
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,260
the end of the experiment we're going to

299
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:22,740
give them an Oxford Master student

300
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:24,060
paper

301
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,100
and not only we're actually pretty

302
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,600
confident that some of those high school

303
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,000
kids will perform as well

304
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,640
we actually expect that even some of

305
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,440
them may perform even better than some

306
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,779
Oxford students so what do we do I mean

307
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,700
of course we're not giving them the the

308
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,500
linear algebra version with Hilbert

309
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,480
spaces and for Neumann formalism of

310
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,279
course we're taking the paper we're

311
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:46,500
converting it rigorously into this

312
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,600
diagrammatic formats

313
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,579
and we teach the kids for three weeks

314
00:11:50,579 --> 00:11:52,740
the rewriting rules and the you know the

315
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,839
general nutritions be behind Quantum

316
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,279
quantum mechanics and Quantum

317
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:58,079
information Theory and we're giving them

318
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,279
the exact paper

319
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,079
and of course the Oxford student We

320
00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:02,519
compare the results with Oxford student

321
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:04,620
using the fundament formalism but we

322
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:07,800
want to show that using this we can

323
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,600
actually lift a portion of the

324
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,860
population because of course if high

325
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:13,019
school kids can can do quantum mechanics

326
00:12:13,019 --> 00:12:14,940
then pretty much most of the adult

327
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:18,060
population can do it right and and why

328
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,800
is this important is because

329
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,380
you know if you if you assume that

330
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:25,079
Quantum Revolution is going to be

331
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:27,660
a profound Industrial Revolution

332
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:29,519
just look at what other Industrial

333
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,620
Revolution did in the past every

334
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,899
Industrial Revolution raised the

335
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:36,360
well-being of population that's one

336
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,519
positive you know one positive aspect

337
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:40,860
but on the contrary and it's a fact it

338
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,000
doesn't matter whether you're left and

339
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,800
left wing or right wing

340
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,260
it also increased inequalities between

341
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:48,240
those who didn't have things and those

342
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,839
who had things you know and um

343
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:55,380
we want to try to I mean that would be a

344
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:57,779
brilliant things you know what if you

345
00:12:57,779 --> 00:12:59,839
could a lower portion of the population

346
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:02,940
to also have access to this technology

347
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:04,380
because this technology right now is

348
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:06,540
reserved to a trained Elite we did you

349
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:07,680
know several years at least of

350
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,600
mathematics or programming or you know

351
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,579
who has this engineering mindset or

352
00:13:11,579 --> 00:13:13,980
scientific mindset what if we can bring

353
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:16,920
an entire new portion of society and and

354
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,500
and give them that ability to to learn

355
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,540
that science and the cool thing is that

356
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,399
it doesn't just work for quantum

357
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:25,560
mechanics or physics it could work for

358
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,839
chemistry it could work for biology so

359
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:29,639
what if you know I guess like it was

360
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:31,260
like a hundred years ago someone where

361
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:32,760
the master would considered an expert

362
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,740
now nowadays without a postdoc you're

363
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,959
not considered an expert so the the you

364
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:38,459
know the level you need to have to be an

365
00:13:38,459 --> 00:13:40,680
expert in a Technologies has increased

366
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,300
maybe there's been some great inflation

367
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,220
but not just that of course that is

368
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,779
probably the amount of knowledge that is

369
00:13:45,779 --> 00:13:47,220
required to be an expert at something is

370
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,899
also increased

371
00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:51,420
um if now we can lower that limit again

372
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,980
that would be that would be tremendous

373
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:55,320
we could probably have impact on every

374
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:58,040
level of society

375
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,240
um so yeah that's the kind of things we

376
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,339
do in Oxford where we're a bit of a team

377
00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:03,779
of rebellious people

378
00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:05,760
um especially the the boss I'm not I'm

379
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,420
I'm a just normal person but but so uh

380
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:11,880
Ross is the inventor is the one of the

381
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,399
well he's the head developer of ticket

382
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:15,600
Bob is um

383
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,060
is the I mean Ross and Bob developed

384
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:20,760
actually this diagrammatic reasoning I

385
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,620
mean the one type of diagrammatic

386
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:24,240
reasoning the ZX calculus that we're

387
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,220
using for circuit optimization

388
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,800
and uh yeah he's the head of the quantum

389
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,079
compositional intelligence team he used

390
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:33,660
to be a professor at Oxford in uh in uh

391
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:35,279
Quantum foundations and Quantum logic

392
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,680
and all of them love drinking beer and

393
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,680
and and uh and and and and do you know

394
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,560
doing Jam sessions and uh doing you know

395
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:47,459
odd hard metal music with with uh you

396
00:14:47,459 --> 00:14:49,560
know uh it's very fun we actually have I

397
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,880
did I don't have a picture of this but

398
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,220
we have a a music studio in the basement

399
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:55,620
of the office and it's really fun and I

400
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,600
met yesterday someone will be playing

401
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,000
some Quantum music later

402
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,160
um he's not here in the audience but

403
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,320
he's going to play at some point uh and

404
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,240
I think it's it's very cool it's the

405
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,980
kind of tough stuff that my my team also

406
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:10,139
does and and really likes

407
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:12,240
and one last Point

408
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,459
um is that this research

409
00:15:14,459 --> 00:15:17,880
also have has unexpected results

410
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,980
one of them is that toolkit that we

411
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:22,320
developed and that we some of you will

412
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,540
use in the in the capture the flag we

413
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:25,800
have a couple of challenge that we've

414
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,300
uploaded

415
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:30,000
um the history behind it is that

416
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,860
um one day Bob that you saw in the

417
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,779
previous slide uh was giving a talk at

418
00:15:33,779 --> 00:15:36,000
McGill in Montreal explaining his you

419
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,040
know his new diagrammatic formalism to

420
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,380
to describe Quantum processes

421
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:42,660
and one man in the audience called

422
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:44,940
Joachim Lambeck with a K we would just

423
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:46,980
change it with a Q obviously

424
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:49,440
um was in the audience and

425
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,720
pointed at Bob saying okay Bob what

426
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,279
you're describing is not quantum

427
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,860
teleportation it's actually grammar and

428
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,540
Bob was like no no I mean this is this

429
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,040
is quantum teleportation I worked on

430
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,779
quantum teleportation but what lembeck

431
00:16:00,779 --> 00:16:03,120
meant is that the mathematics that Bob

432
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,519
developed for describing Quantum

433
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,040
processes was actually compatible with

434
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,560
the mathematics that he Joachim Lambeck

435
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,820
developed so he's one of the most

436
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:14,339
prominent formal grammarian in the world

437
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:16,320
like Chomsky in the following of Chomsky

438
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,899
and and and the mathematics that Bob

439
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:20,639
developed was actually very compatible

440
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:22,800
with the mathematics that he uses to

441
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,899
model meaning and language you know

442
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:26,579
Linguistics is the study of language but

443
00:16:26,579 --> 00:16:28,560
one of the main challenge in linguistics

444
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,019
is ambiguity

445
00:16:31,019 --> 00:16:33,839
um you know grammar and syntax you know

446
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:35,100
they're trying to make it they're trying

447
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,800
to add more and more rules to to make it

448
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,959
more bulletproof and make it better at

449
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:43,320
actually describing meaning but this is

450
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,420
this is a very challenging thing and

451
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:47,759
using the simple math is not sufficient

452
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:49,440
and so the math that we've been

453
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,920
developing in order to make sense of the

454
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,620
unapparent you know um

455
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:57,839
you know awareness of quantum of the

456
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,240
quantum world is a more powerful math

457
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,980
and that more powerful math can actually

458
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:05,579
be applied to other fields as well

459
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:08,400
um I'm gonna if you want to I'm also

460
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,020
happy to make it a bit interactive but I

461
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:12,900
I can actually guide you through the

462
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,760
pipeline of Lambeck how lambek works

463
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,040
okay

464
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,480
so

465
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,819
Lambeck has a so as a pipeline in five

466
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:22,740
steps the first step is to parse the

467
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:23,579
sentence

468
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:26,400
so what parsing means is

469
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,400
um

470
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:31,559
when you have some of you have NLP

471
00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:33,240
background or

472
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:36,000
okay so we don't use parsing anymore in

473
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,580
NLP pretty much I mean it's it's done

474
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:42,480
implicitly statistically uh by these

475
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,120
very large uh models of course these

476
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,400
very large models are very powerful they

477
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,320
can do amazing things there's still some

478
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,059
challenges you know conversational

479
00:17:51,059 --> 00:17:54,000
agents I mean you can be bluffed maybe

480
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,980
once in a while but most of the time

481
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:59,940
it's not very good machine translation

482
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:02,100
for some basic translation it works

483
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,660
pretty well but for when you want to

484
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,220
actually go into the the actual

485
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:08,460
translation it's pretty bad and so we

486
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,919
haven't sold we're far from solving uh

487
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:13,740
artificial general intelligence I think

488
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:16,380
um but but but the current NLP systems

489
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:17,700
are very good at automating language

490
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:18,900
tasks when you want to process

491
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:21,000
information extract information they're

492
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,080
really good

493
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,480
but what they're not good at is being

494
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,460
interpretable these are statistical

495
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:28,080
Black Box models of course they're

496
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,660
research being done trying to you know

497
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,780
interpret how you know why a specific

498
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:35,640
Transformer leads to a specific you know

499
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:38,640
result but it's still very you know

500
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,640
there was a there was a sentence from I

501
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,440
think it was from Darwin was saying that

502
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,460
a mathematician was a blind man when a

503
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,380
dark room is looking for a black cat who

504
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:51,240
is not there I think it's probably

505
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,760
describes kind of well the research

506
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,820
being done on on Transformers

507
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,919
um and

508
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:01,919
so the previous approaches in NLP were

509
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:03,780
relying on parsing so they were relying

510
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:05,460
on explicit rules to decrypt the

511
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:08,220
structure of of sentences of course

512
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:10,440
they're not as powerful as the as a

513
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,900
Transformer statistical approaches but

514
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,360
if we can push them with this new

515
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,120
technology we can possibly create a

516
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,460
formalism that will make sense uh and

517
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,380
model the flow of meaning in sentences

518
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:24,120
and that's what we're trying so the

519
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:27,120
first step is given a sentence we parse

520
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,940
it so we decompose it into different uh

521
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:32,640
grammar type we call them Atomic types

522
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,640
and so you know Park is a noun there is

523
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:39,059
a determiner but we we describe it by n

524
00:19:39,059 --> 00:19:41,640
slash n which means that this one is the

525
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,520
inverse of n so when they

526
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,960
actually there it's equivalent to a

527
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,280
number that's why in English we call it

528
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,160
a noun phrase the park is called a noun

529
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,020
phrase because it's it's basically

530
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:54,539
equivalent to a noun and we repeat that

531
00:19:54,539 --> 00:19:56,160
through all the world's uh all the words

532
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,740
of the of the sentence uh in Lambeck

533
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,179
it's represented like this but it's

534
00:20:00,179 --> 00:20:01,679
equivalent

535
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:04,200
and then we applied category Theory we

536
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,000
model it using this diagrammatic

537
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,039
formalism I mean I'm simplifying this

538
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:09,780
I'm simplifying things right here right

539
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:12,240
now but this is the idea and we call

540
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,880
this this um this data structure we call

541
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,740
it a string diagram and it's very useful

542
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:20,460
for us to manipulate language

543
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,559
um we can simplify the string diagram

544
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:25,260
using the rules that we have and then we

545
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:26,760
can use what we call a nanzat and

546
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,919
hypothesis to transform it into a

547
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:31,020
Quantum circuit so this is the Quantum

548
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,340
circuit this is the parameterized

549
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:34,200
Quantum circuit for John walks in the

550
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:34,919
bar

551
00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:37,740
this is a representation with kiskit but

552
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,480
we can do it with ticket is the is the

553
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,460
same thing so all this is described in

554
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:43,980
this paper qnlp in practice

555
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:46,760
and we've actually run it

556
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:49,799
uh on an actual Quantum hardware and it

557
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:52,020
works so we've actually shown that using

558
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:54,299
quantum physics we can process the

559
00:20:54,299 --> 00:20:56,039
meaning of sentences so it's not just us

560
00:20:56,039 --> 00:20:58,860
trying to add Quantum to be to surf on

561
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:01,200
the on the hype really it's really

562
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,240
intrition that came at the foundations

563
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,580
level that turns out to be potentially

564
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:08,460
useful for this and why do we call

565
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:10,140
ourselves Quantum compositional

566
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:11,820
intelligence is because

567
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,919
if we can describe language with this

568
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:15,600
you know language is at the heart of

569
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,980
intelligence even let's just look at the

570
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:19,620
Turing test it's a language task and and

571
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:21,059
this is the best thing that we have

572
00:21:21,059 --> 00:21:24,600
humans to to determine intelligence so

573
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,679
far

574
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:26,340
um

575
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:28,020
we call it quantum compositional

576
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:30,240
intelligence because we hope that with

577
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,159
this research we'll be able to pierce

578
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:33,360
the secrets of its artificial

579
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,980
intelligence

580
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:36,539
so if you want if you're interested

581
00:21:36,539 --> 00:21:38,880
about that do our land back challenges I

582
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,380
think they're really they're really good

583
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:42,960
at you know introduction uh to this

584
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:47,400
field and uh yeah uh feel free to ask me

585
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,640
questions or Charlie even now or or you

586
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,679
can talk to me at the end it's fine I

587
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:54,960
think Charlie will uh will maybe give

588
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,720
you a a quick demo of how lamback works

589
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,280
for those who want

590
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,280
uh

591
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,600
on the microphone

592
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:10,039
not much as much as you want okay

593
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:18,179
thank you all right can everyone hear me

594
00:22:18,179 --> 00:22:20,220
cool

595
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:23,480
as soon as this comes up

596
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:31,939
or not

597
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:49,799
hey what

598
00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:52,140
oh okay

599
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:55,020
um okay well well I'll talk talk

600
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:56,760
um until it comes up but I'm gonna try

601
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:59,039
and show you there's a there's an actual

602
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,980
python library for lamback in which you

603
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:05,340
can do these things and allow you

604
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:08,460
to speak louder let me hold this okay

605
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:11,580
it's a it's a python library that lets

606
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:14,400
you do Quantum natural language

607
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,000
processing as it exists currently it

608
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,520
uses this diagrammatic formalism that

609
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,720
that Thomas was talking about it's

610
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,640
called

611
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,580
distributed compositional semantics so

612
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:28,380
in the olden days when they did natural

613
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:30,179
language processing there was

614
00:23:30,179 --> 00:23:31,980
compositional semantics which is that

615
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:34,919
the meaning of a sentence or a document

616
00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:37,140
or something is

617
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:39,480
comes from how it the small parts

618
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,640
combine how the words combine it's a

619
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,500
natural way to think about it a sentence

620
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,299
is made up of words the combination of

621
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:47,220
the words in their order and how they

622
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:48,960
combine gives you the meaning but

623
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,460
they've moved away from this with

624
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:52,320
current NLP and it's almost all

625
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,200
distributional the meaning of a word is

626
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,840
what's around it and it's encoded as a

627
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,419
vector of numbers that's how all NLP

628
00:24:00,419 --> 00:24:02,039
works at the moment

629
00:24:02,039 --> 00:24:04,080
so with Lambeck

630
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,419
we try and combine those so the

631
00:24:06,419 --> 00:24:08,580
compositional structure

632
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,140
how everything connects together

633
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:13,620
determines how your Quantum circuit will

634
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:16,200
look your circuit describes your

635
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,059
sentence or your document

636
00:24:18,059 --> 00:24:21,179
then the distributional bit comes in in

637
00:24:21,179 --> 00:24:24,780
that we parameterize this circuit so

638
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:28,140
each box so this here this is a box this

639
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:30,600
is a noun this is just a noun by itself

640
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:33,600
this has no meaning on its own apart

641
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,039
from the meaning that a human can give

642
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:37,440
it but to a computer there's no meaning

643
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,500
to instill meaning in this we can

644
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:43,440
convert it to what here is a Quantum

645
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,140
circuit this is a parameterized Quantum

646
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:48,600
circuit so these are three gates that

647
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:51,780
will rotate your input qubit so by

648
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:55,260
training these Gates you imbue meaning

649
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,900
on the computer so if you want Alice to

650
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:00,179
be different from Bob you train the gate

651
00:25:00,179 --> 00:25:02,400
so that for Alice your state may come

652
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,559
out as a one with very high probability

653
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:07,200
and for Bob your state will come out as

654
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,840
a zero with very high probability so

655
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,880
this is how you go from the structure

656
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,340
and here we can see this is the

657
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:15,720
structure of a sentence this is a

658
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,940
grammatical structure but in a

659
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,620
diagrammatic form this is actually it's

660
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:22,500
called a combinatory categorical grammar

661
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,740
gives you this structure for a sentence

662
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:27,960
then by putting meaning into the Boxes

663
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,059
by adding Quantum Gates

664
00:25:30,059 --> 00:25:32,880
you have a circuit that has meaning on a

665
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,520
quantum computer so down here this is

666
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,020
what the circuit will look like this is

667
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:39,179
a real runnable Quantum circuit you can

668
00:25:39,179 --> 00:25:41,820
run this on a computer and by training

669
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:43,260
the gates because these are rotations

670
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:45,299
there's a classical parameter for each

671
00:25:45,299 --> 00:25:47,640
of these Gates which is how much it

672
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,980
rotates the state by and then the

673
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:52,020
combination of these boxes with their

674
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:54,120
structure and their meaning means that

675
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:57,000
on this wire here you get some output

676
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,159
and that's the meaning you train it so

677
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:01,740
it gets the right meaning so if one of

678
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:03,240
the challenges you have a bunch of

679
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,159
sentences about cooking and a bunch of

680
00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:07,500
sentences about Computing and you want

681
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,179
to train a model that can differentiate

682
00:26:09,179 --> 00:26:11,039
them differentiate whether the topic is

683
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:13,740
cooking or computing you build circuits

684
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:16,080
for each of these sentences and they

685
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,980
share boxes so each box if a box is the

686
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:23,700
word computer every time that appears in

687
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,440
every different sentence you use the

688
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,720
same parameters and so by training

689
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,880
multiple of these you imbue meaning into

690
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,940
each of the boxes so it now will

691
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:35,580
transform the word computer into a given

692
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:38,039
state every time and by combining that

693
00:26:38,039 --> 00:26:39,779
with the other words it will generally

694
00:26:39,779 --> 00:26:41,460
be able to pick out that a sentence

695
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:43,500
containing computer means it's about

696
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:46,320
Computing and a sentence containing fish

697
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:49,559
means it's about cooking so by adding

698
00:26:49,559 --> 00:26:51,600
meaning to the boxes and combining them

699
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,279
together you can get a complete new

700
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,080
sentence once you've trained your boxes

701
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,179
so that they have the correct meanings

702
00:26:57,179 --> 00:26:59,279
with a grammatical sentence you build

703
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:01,260
the structure you combine them you turn

704
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:03,360
it into a circuit and for a brand new

705
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,419
sentence you now have the meaning coming

706
00:27:06,419 --> 00:27:07,919
out of the quantum computer just by

707
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:10,919
running it so this is this is it in in

708
00:27:10,919 --> 00:27:13,679
ticket this is the circuit for I think

709
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:15,840
it's Alice loves Bob something like that

710
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:19,559
yeah this is this Alice loves Bob on a

711
00:27:19,559 --> 00:27:21,539
quantum computer this is this is just

712
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:24,900
kisket and then

713
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,760
you want to train a model though one

714
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,679
sentence is cool but if you have one

715
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:30,779
sentence you're not learning anything

716
00:27:30,779 --> 00:27:32,520
you can you can make it output whatever

717
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,200
you want by setting the parameters

718
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,000
correctly what you want is for the word

719
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,659
Alice to have a meaning in in the state

720
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:42,960
that comes out so here what we do is we

721
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,640
take in a data set of a bunch of

722
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,720
sentences

723
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:48,659
so these are different sentences you can

724
00:27:48,659 --> 00:27:50,820
see here organization Church established

725
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:53,340
organization that team join and they

726
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:55,559
have labels depending on what the

727
00:27:55,559 --> 00:27:57,539
sentence is about all these sentences

728
00:27:57,539 --> 00:28:00,000
are are about the same thing so they

729
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,039
have the same label but the final

730
00:28:02,039 --> 00:28:04,500
sentence is are about different things

731
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,299
they have different labels and you can

732
00:28:06,299 --> 00:28:08,580
train a model to split these sentences

733
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:09,720
up

734
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,860
so

735
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:13,200
we build our structures for all the

736
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,900
sentences in fact I need to run this

737
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:16,799
here

738
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:18,480
here's a structure for one of the

739
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,100
sentences again it's a grammatical

740
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,240
structure

741
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,679
we

742
00:28:22,679 --> 00:28:24,480
get them all

743
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,220
we get them all

744
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:28,740
we convert them into Quantum circuits

745
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:31,500
like this so each sentence will have its

746
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,960
own circuit but with shared parameters

747
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,779
because each box has the same parameters

748
00:28:36,779 --> 00:28:40,760
in every sentence where that box appears

749
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:45,659
and here we're training a model on these

750
00:28:45,659 --> 00:28:49,500
sentences to discern the sentences so

751
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:52,140
here we can see it's this is only it's

752
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:54,600
been trained twice to looping over all

753
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:57,539
the sentences it has an accuracy of 71

754
00:28:57,539 --> 00:29:00,299
about if you train this longer it'll get

755
00:29:00,299 --> 00:29:02,460
perfect accuracy because the boxes have

756
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,440
meaning they combine together you could

757
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,179
put in a brand new sentence using the

758
00:29:06,179 --> 00:29:08,279
same words and it will be able to tell

759
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:10,140
you whether it's from the first class or

760
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:12,799
the second class

761
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,620
sorry

762
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:25,559
and then here so I didn't want to run it

763
00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:27,600
for much longer because I'm only up here

764
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,880
for a little bit but in in the

765
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,919
challenges there is a lamback task where

766
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:34,260
you are going to train a model to be

767
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:35,940
able to it's actually what it's going to

768
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,200
do is it's going to take a pair of

769
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,940
sentences and tell you whether they're

770
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:40,440
about the same thing or a different

771
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,580
thing

772
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:45,059
now this was a a very quick introduction

773
00:29:45,059 --> 00:29:47,880
so any questions I would be happy to

774
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,940
take because yes please

775
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:54,380
oh my God it's so loud

776
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,220
how do you mean

777
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:03,000
um

778
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,899
I mean yes that there will be you know

779
00:30:06,899 --> 00:30:09,240
like any machine learning model it's

780
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,980
probably not going to get 100 accuracy

781
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:13,860
on a very simple task get well

782
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:15,179
but

783
00:30:15,179 --> 00:30:16,980
yeah

784
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:19,600
uh yes

785
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,699
[Music]

786
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:25,940
Training Center

787
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:32,880
forgot the mic forgot the mic

788
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,480
um yeah so so you you build it up

789
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,480
and then your boxes constitute your

790
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:42,120
model effectively the structure is is

791
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,860
less of the model the structure is fixed

792
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:46,260
for every sentence we don't change the

793
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:48,720
structure with training but by training

794
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,220
the boxes and combining them together

795
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:51,840
you get the meaning of the overall

796
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,260
sentence

797
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,320
gotta fall down

798
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:12,059
yeah the classifications all all done on

799
00:32:12,059 --> 00:32:13,860
a quantum computer there's there's no

800
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:15,899
classical involved except to build the

801
00:32:15,899 --> 00:32:18,419
structure and that is a ccg password

802
00:32:18,419 --> 00:32:21,260
it's just a standard bog standard parser

803
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:23,520
effectively sorry was there another

804
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,879
question

805
00:33:08,419 --> 00:33:12,720
so so if if you'd never seen that word

806
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,640
before in in the context you're talking

807
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,919
about during training and it was a brand

808
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:20,960
new way of using a word in test

809
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:32,220
so if if the word is is being used in

810
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:33,480
the same way because obviously there are

811
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,740
some words that that can have different

812
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:36,240
meaning in different places and if you

813
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,740
only had one meaning in your training

814
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:39,480
and the other meaning in your testing

815
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,880
it's not going to work but that's also a

816
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,500
problem with with any classical model

817
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:46,559
you have but but if you're if you're

818
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:49,620
using it the same way in a new context

819
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:51,840
that should be fine it should have

820
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:55,260
learned that your your hope is that the

821
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:57,179
meaning of the word is learned by the

822
00:33:57,179 --> 00:33:59,159
parameterization so that if you use it

823
00:33:59,159 --> 00:34:01,980
within a completely new context

824
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:03,779
through the structure it's able to

825
00:34:03,779 --> 00:34:05,940
combine that with the stuff around it to

826
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:08,720
do the right thing

827
00:34:48,418 --> 00:34:52,020
uh I'm I'm not sure about that I'm I'm

828
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:53,219
not sure I understood the question I

829
00:34:53,219 --> 00:34:55,399
will

830
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,619
foreign

831
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:28,320
I don't know if you if you want to come

832
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,359
up and say it again for everyone and

833
00:35:30,359 --> 00:35:31,680
then maybe I'll hear it a bit better

834
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,900
yeah no

835
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,700
sorry about that um I tried to like yell

836
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,020
out loud but I was thinking like so like

837
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:38,880
when it's studying and learning a word

838
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,880
it does so because it's related to the

839
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,320
different contexts around it to give it

840
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,540
meaning so I was thinking if you if you

841
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:47,940
had the sum of all contexts the word is

842
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:50,700
used in could it derive the use of that

843
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:52,920
word in a new context

844
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:56,220
uh because it's the the context that is

845
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:59,579
new implies some kind of use of the sum

846
00:35:59,579 --> 00:36:01,200
of all of the contexts that word has

847
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,240
been in is it recognizing that word or

848
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,880
is it just recognizing the the all of

849
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,680
the different words associated with it

850
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:10,920
to bring on new associations and use a

851
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:13,380
word in a new context or vice versa

852
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,359
would it pick out and say oh well this

853
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:16,859
word was used in this context I've never

854
00:36:16,859 --> 00:36:20,040
seen before but I know the all of the

855
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:22,320
other contexts around it and based on

856
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,359
the the completeness of these other

857
00:36:24,359 --> 00:36:26,220
contexts it would make sense to use it

858
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:28,560
in like a new place with different

859
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:32,460
associations because of the like the the

860
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:35,520
way it Associates Maybe

861
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:39,720
so what one thing I'd say is that

862
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:41,520
depending on the number of parameters

863
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,400
you're using to encode a single word

864
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,320
it's it's not going to be able to

865
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,180
remember that many contexts it's been

866
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:51,079
used in before but if you had enough

867
00:36:51,079 --> 00:36:54,720
parameterization enough parameters I

868
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,359
think what you're saying sounds sounds

869
00:36:57,359 --> 00:37:00,060
like sounds right sounds like it it

870
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:01,980
should be able to use

871
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:04,320
well it'll have the new structure the

872
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,660
next time it it gets used

873
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:08,760
and I think based on the old context

874
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:11,099
that are encoded in the box now plus the

875
00:37:11,099 --> 00:37:13,560
new structure it should

876
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,660
be able to figure out how to use it in

877
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:16,740
the new one

878
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:18,839
I um I will I'll talk to you after

879
00:37:18,839 --> 00:37:20,880
because I'm not sure I

880
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,500
I think there's other questions yeah

881
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,420
please please come up

882
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:26,880
um I don't know yeah yeah come come come

883
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,880
on I don't know

884
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:33,240
to State it in a more simplistic way can

885
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,680
a single word

886
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:38,240
have different meetings

887
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,640
um so a single word

888
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:44,160
uh noun specifically

889
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:47,280
yeah so so different words are encoded

890
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,740
in different ways a noun is always is is

891
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:52,800
generally encoded as as

892
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,960
um just some rotations following a qubet

893
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:58,320
no that noun in the in in a different

894
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,119
context is always going to come out with

895
00:38:00,119 --> 00:38:02,300
the same state

896
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:05,520
verbs are generally the nouns are

897
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,859
connected into them so they will change

898
00:38:07,859 --> 00:38:09,960
depending on the context

899
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:13,500
but the the the so in the diagrams I

900
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:14,940
showed I don't know if it'll come up

901
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:17,420
again but the ones at the very top level

902
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,380
they're always going to have the same

903
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,839
meaning because because there's nothing

904
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:23,640
being there's no context being given

905
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,380
into them the information flows through

906
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:28,440
the diagram top to bottom and nouns are

907
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,960
generally at the top because of how ccgs

908
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,119
work and the flow through that it's

909
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:34,619
always going to be the same state but a

910
00:38:34,619 --> 00:38:37,320
verb is generally lower down has nouns

911
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,900
flow into it this will change depending

912
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,240
on the context

913
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,220
um yeah if that answers

914
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:46,700
yeah

915
00:38:48,839 --> 00:38:51,720
how much information

916
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:55,619
do you use to track each word or

917
00:38:55,619 --> 00:38:58,280
the phrase

918
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,320
to track

919
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:04,020
so if I have one word and you say you're

920
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:05,940
talking about the state of that word how

921
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:08,339
much information is that

922
00:39:08,339 --> 00:39:09,359
so

923
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:12,060
um in in the simplest in the simplest

924
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:12,960
form

925
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,000
um when we do it a noun will be a single

926
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,720
qubit followed by three rotations

927
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:20,099
parameterized rotations which will allow

928
00:39:20,099 --> 00:39:22,260
that single qubit to be in any state

929
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:24,180
after that depending on the rotations

930
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:26,940
but yeah one qubit so two complex

931
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:28,740
numbers

932
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:30,119
um in the simplest case when you want to

933
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:31,940
do bigger sentences more complex things

934
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:34,380
Lambeck lets you use more you could you

935
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:37,020
can use as many qubits as you want to

936
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:38,579
encode a single word

937
00:39:38,579 --> 00:39:41,040
uh but but

938
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,839
with the restrictions of Technology at

939
00:39:42,839 --> 00:39:45,960
the time uh you can what's the biggest

940
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:48,180
one you can do 12 qubits up to a depth

941
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:50,280
of 12 gates with High Fidelity currently

942
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:52,500
so if you want to use more than a single

943
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:55,260
qubit for a word in you're gonna you're

944
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:56,700
gonna struggle a lot running it on a

945
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:59,960
real quantum computer currently

946
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:03,119
oh yeah yeah

947
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:05,820
um yeah this guy first because

948
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,619
and then and then I think probably you

949
00:40:07,619 --> 00:40:09,240
and then I probably have to go I don't

950
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:12,259
know how much time I have

951
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:14,640
so when you when you're presented with a

952
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:17,099
word and it's context uh are you able to

953
00:40:17,099 --> 00:40:20,820
infer a new word or a are you based are

954
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:23,220
you able to infer a uh an unfamiliar

955
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:24,780
word based on its context when you have

956
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:26,160
that same context for a word that you

957
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,660
know

958
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:29,820
so um

959
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:32,700
you could and it's it's gonna depend on

960
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:33,839
how you

961
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:35,940
that doesn't come for free it's gonna

962
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:37,800
depend on how you set up your model and

963
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:38,579
stuff

964
00:40:38,579 --> 00:40:40,740
but but it is possible you could you

965
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:42,240
could get a contact circuit you could

966
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,000
put in a a toke a blank token or

967
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,980
something and then you could ask the

968
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:49,500
model at the end to maybe output three

969
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,900
numbers prescribing to what rotations

970
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:54,660
the model thinks that model should be

971
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,520
but you would have to train it to do

972
00:40:56,520 --> 00:41:00,079
that it doesn't come for free

973
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:04,279
lost lost one and then I'll go

974
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:08,700
so it creates a new circuit for every

975
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:10,440
line right so does that add like latency

976
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:12,119
to training time and like have you

977
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:13,380
thought about like

978
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:15,780
adjusting that or improving it

979
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:18,300
um so yes it does because you you have

980
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:21,000
to iterate over every sentence we have

981
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,380
we're currently developing a new

982
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:25,320
framework that lets you encode entire

983
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:28,680
documents as as a single circuit but

984
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:31,020
again with current technology we can

985
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:33,000
only run those on simulators

986
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,700
so yeah so that that can't be run on a

987
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:37,800
real thing these little ones here you

988
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,359
can run on a real quantum computer if

989
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:41,160
you want you can you can train it it's

990
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:42,839
going to take forever because an iron

991
00:41:42,839 --> 00:41:46,619
trap computer takes loads of time but um

992
00:41:46,619 --> 00:41:48,660
we are working on bigger ones where you

993
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:50,339
can you can learn context over whole

994
00:41:50,339 --> 00:41:52,260
documents stuff like that

995
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:54,900
but it's it's not gonna be able to run

996
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:57,300
on a quantum computer for we expect

997
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:00,119
quite a while a lot of this is is very

998
00:42:00,119 --> 00:42:02,280
speculative work in that we assume

999
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:04,560
quantum computers work then we do a

1000
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:07,200
bunch of stuff and then we hope that our

1001
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,900
other team makes them work at some point

1002
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:12,300
but um thank you very much

1003
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:15,140
um I'm gonna head off now

1004
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:22,040
do the challenges
