00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,079
last year and i think uh this year it's

17
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:40,079
gonna even be bigger so i'm just kind of

18
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:41,440
wondering you know what are you most

19
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,600
looking forward to this year at defcon

20
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,760
honestly i look forward to mostly seeing

21
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,079
people um last year i got to meet you

22
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:49,680
guys in person for the first time after

23
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,039
you know a few years of working with you

24
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:51,760
all

25
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,920
but also um i feel like there was a

26
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,760
piece missing last year

27
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:56,960
there was a lot of people that showed up

28
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,320
and also a lot of people i didn't show

29
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,239
up because of the pandemic that was

30
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,000
happening so honestly it's just it feels

31
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,680
good for conferences to be back it feels

32
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,280
great to know def con is back it's in

33
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,040
person a lot of people back are in

34
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,960
person i get to see friends that i don't

35
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,640
usually see unless we go to vegas every

36
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,640
year

37
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,000
for sure uh

38
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,040
you uh

39
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,720
you've we've we've been involved with

40
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,119
the hom con for a few years now as well

41
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:22,799
uh the conference that you run can you

42
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:23,920
tell us a little bit about the origin

43
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,200
story there

44
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,360
yeah so um it all started with another

45
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,400
conference actually it was called

46
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,759
versacon

47
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,640
and uh lucky for us and unlucky for the

48
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,920
world we planned uh versacon to be that

49
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,600
first weekend when everything was shut

50
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,799
down

51
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,479
everything was completely shut down and

52
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,640
the entire world was at home and

53
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,159
unfortunately it worked out in our favor

54
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,000
even though there was a pandemic uh the

55
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,920
whole idea was i know i

56
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,040
most people that have gone to know me or

57
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,079
have met me that have met me at a

58
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,360
conference they've seen my content from

59
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,119
a conference i've gone to a lot of

60
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:56,320
conferences

61
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,399
but i've always saw the conferences as

62
00:01:58,399 --> 00:01:59,360
too

63
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,200
big there's a lot of topics that get

64
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,799
covered if you go to b-sides there's a

65
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,560
lot of things like red team absec blue

66
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,960
team everything gets covered right

67
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,560
and it wasn't something that i wanted to

68
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,800
go to all the time so the whole idea was

69
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,800
how do i put on a conference that i want

70
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,480
to watch and it's only content that i

71
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,319
like selfishly with my conference and i

72
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,239
was like who would i want to talk to who

73
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,160
would i want to be involved so

74
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,200
at the time heath the cyber mentor was

75
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,879
just becoming really he got a lot of

76
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,239
attraction he was one of the co-hosts

77
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:27,440
and stoke was one of my friends and

78
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,280
still is one of my friends we all came

79
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,440
together and we hosted it and heath

80
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,800
actually

81
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,319
introduced me to john hammond's like hey

82
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,720
i know this guy is brilliant his name is

83
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,560
john he could do a ctf for us i didn't

84
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,480
know who john was like screw it let's

85
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,920
work with him he seems amazing let's

86
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,959
just bring him on and that was the big

87
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:46,800
the turnout that we got was incredible

88
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,080
and i did all that we did all that with

89
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,000
charity there wasn't you know everything

90
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,480
we did was i went to a charity called a

91
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,360
leukemia lymphoma society i want to say

92
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,840
that conference raised about 56 000

93
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,080
dollars that went to them uh in the span

94
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,680
of a month

95
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,840
and uh when that happened you had almost

96
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,440
3000 people watching and i just sat in

97
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,640
my office in the same room and i was

98
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,319
like holy crap

99
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,319
if we can do this for charity i wonder

100
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,080
if we could actually put on a legit con

101
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,360
not that that wasn't legit but it was

102
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,280
just very casual we didn't expect you

103
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,120
know anything big out of it

104
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,200
so i couldn't come up with a name

105
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,319
and i just like i'm just going to do the

106
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,239
hong kong it's not going to stick

107
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,640
so naham khan happened it was way bigger

108
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,720
than i expected it to be ever

109
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,640
and i saw the problem with that name i

110
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,239
don't it's not that i don't like it but

111
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,080
the whole purpose was to be not about me

112
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,519
in the community

113
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,400
but uh it stuck honestly and uh it's

114
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,080
been it's been insane from someone who's

115
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,239
gone to conferences you know i

116
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:41,519
didn't having my own conference

117
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:42,720
happening and people taking their

118
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,879
saturdays to come and you guys even take

119
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,879
your time to be willing to help me and

120
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,120
you know other con other villagers like

121
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,200
um iot village helping me i and he's

122
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,120
gotten involved in the past uh don

123
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,200
ethical hacker was involved helping me

124
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,319
seeing all these different big

125
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,000
communities being

126
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,400
willing to help me as a person

127
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,879
it just feels incredible so i've uh done

128
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:05,280
three of them so far and honestly every

129
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,159
year

130
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,480
we found a way to make him bigger and

131
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,239
i'm kind of worried about this year's i

132
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,319
don't know how we're gonna top it off

133
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,239
but the entire thing was how do i make a

134
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:15,280
conference that's more about the

135
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,600
community and it's talks for a niche

136
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,959
community like bug bounties and red

137
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,199
teamers that it's just focused on that

138
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:22,960
it's just a one track it's like what you

139
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,320
guys are it's focused on red teaming

140
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,479
right but it's very much it's in that

141
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,160
niche and people are going to enjoy the

142
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,680
content and relate to it or learn from

143
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,919
it at least

144
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:33,440
no that's amazing i know i personally

145
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,520
have always loved naham khan and kind of

146
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,759
being able to get involved every year uh

147
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,680
so kind of what what kind of led you

148
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,120
down that path though to get involved

149
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,400
with the red team village like why did

150
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,240
you decide to get involved

151
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,479
so originally um

152
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,080
omar and i

153
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,320
i want to say omar and uh i think it's

154
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,160
somebody else omar and i were talking

155
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,199
about the hong kong versus khan and then

156
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,960
activity con that i also for hacker when

157
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,000
i was there

158
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,759
and um

159
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,840
when the pandemic hit so i did my talk

160
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,919
the the the year before the pandemic i

161
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:05,680
was just a speaker out of team village

162
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,080
and then the pandemic happened and i

163
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,360
don't know who reached out but they were

164
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,400
like hey we want to do something virtual

165
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,440
um

166
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,039

215
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,080

00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:53,919
of those volunteers but just never knew

223
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:55,840
what it meant so this naturally

224
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,440
happening on its own and me being able

225
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,680
to volunteer to help with the thing that

226
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,199

228
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,360
i can't plug that enough like no matter

229
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,720
what village you're interested in even

230
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,160
if it's not red team village right

231
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,360
they're all looking for volunteers

232
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,720
defcon's always looking for goons

233

234
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,840
the other so just get involved right all

235
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,919

240
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:26,639
yeah so

241
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:27,759
i feel like

242
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:30,560
with red teaming it's such a broad

243
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,039
category right you have your web guides

244
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,759
you have your uh linux guy the next

245
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,520
person your windows person

246
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,720
you have all these different the

247
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,639
physical person everyone has a skill set

248
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:41,919
that they bring to the table right you

249
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:43,599
have you know anywhere from five to

250
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:44,960
whatever that number is like a big team

251
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,560
of people like helping

252
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,560
and everybody wants to get into red team

253
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,400
but people don't

254
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,879
know exactly what they want to do yet

255
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,240
what do you want to do the physical pen

256
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,520
test part you want to do that what

257
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,680
portion what do you want to do right so

258
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,039
the whole goal of the keynote was

259
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:01,919
instead of doing this a talk on here's

260
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,120
the things you need to do and learn

261
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,400
which is great if you're doing one of

262
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,160
those it's more of a bringing people

263
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,680
that have done those things or to have

264
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,639
the skills uh someone like john hammond

265
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,720
who is pretty much a swiss army knife at

266
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,080
this point he knows everything and

267
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,120
everything

268
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,960
he's got a great value show how did you

269
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,479

270
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,560

00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,760
fished uh recruiters from a resume he

278
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,360
was telling me he did on my one of my

279
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,360
streams one day and having someone

280
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,958
that's actually done the job was doing

281
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:41,120
the job to be able to verify some of

282
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,120
these things that we were going to claim

283
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,399
and explain some of his stories to us

284
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,920

00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,720
person is oday he is uh

286
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,279
the number one hacker on try hack me

287
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:53,279
and the reason why we asked oda to come

288
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,040
on board was he just has a very cool

289
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,040
story of what his background was am i

290
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,640
going to spoil it is that some really

291
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,240
cool stuff but also

292
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,680
becoming number one hacker on an

293
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,959
educational platform whether it's hacked

294
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,279
about to try hack me it's a lot of work

295
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,440
and he's always been number one it's not

296
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,760
just he's he's went up to number one and

297
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,440
fought back and went back up he's always

298
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,680
been number one and being number one in

299
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,959

300
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:16,720

00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,320
different skills that you need to learn

304
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,560
i think he could also share how he

305
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,160
how much time he's dedicated what did he

306
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,240
do how did you learn those things and

307
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,920
what is he doing now is he using those

308
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,279
skills and how it's helped him with his

309
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,680
career

310
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,880
