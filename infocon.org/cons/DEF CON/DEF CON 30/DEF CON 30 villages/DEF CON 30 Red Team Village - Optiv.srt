my name is ryan dory i am the practice

18
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,680
director of the attack and pen team

19
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,600
inside of our larger threat management

20
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,280
team here at optiv

21
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,280
we have about 50 dedicated uh pen

22
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,360
testers inside of attack and pen i've

23
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,079
been with the company about 10 years now

24
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:53,760
and i've had the the privilege of

25
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,520
calling attack and pen home the entirety

26
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,120
of the the 10 years

27
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,280
uh once upon a time i was technical and

28
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,359
delivered the the fun offensive security

29
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,600
services and attack and pen but uh now i

30
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,959
have the the privilege of leading with a

31
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:07,200
bunch of other solid leaders here uh on

32
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,360
the team and and primarily a business

33
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,400
focused of with regard to attack and pen

34
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,240
excellent thank you so much

35
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:14,960
and

36
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,439
i am very familiar on how you

37
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:20,000
continuously contribute to the community

38
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,240
and you sponsor so many events and you

39
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,439
actually have

40
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:25,280
different events

41
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,439
that have been very well attended in the

42
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,439
community but can you tell us a little

43
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:31,360
bit of about why

44
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,920
it is important to actually foster

45
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,520
that community and why you are

46
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,720
sponsoring

47
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,600
the deaf congratulations this year

48
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,759
yeah absolutely we uh historically i

49
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:42,960
mean to be honest it's something we

50
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,240
could have done better in the past and

51
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,680
really been trying to work hard to give

52
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,360
back to the community in different ways

53
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,840
go uh you know going forward uh one of

54
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,399
the ways obviously is sponsorship of

55
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,560
specific events such as red team village

56
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,520
or other um you know maybe smaller local

57
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,280
uh security conferences

58
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,119
uh another thing that we've

59
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:03,280
gotten a couple going so far is a

60
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,439
collegiate involvement so um i believe

61
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:06,479
that's actually the connection that

62
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:07,840
brought us to red team village

63
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,440
ultimately traced that back but we've

64
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,959
partnered with uh cyber security

65
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,480
collegiate programs

66
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,800
and done technical talks uh at those

67
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,879
events um as well as like career

68
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:18,239
mentoring or even just like personal

69
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,080
one-on-one mentoring with some of the

70
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,400
aspiring cyber security professionals in

71
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,879
those college uh uh scenarios and

72
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,239
also i mean i'm actually partnering with

73
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,200
my local college and and doing a cyber

74
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,280
cyber camp for a local high school or

75
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,280
for high schoolers actually next week so

76
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,480
it's pretty neat to give back to

77
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,760
community

78
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,519
to help foster you know those those

79
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:39,519
future pen testers

80
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:40,959
and the last thing that we're really

81
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:42,720
starting to to get some momentum and

82
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,959
steam going on is our source zero

83
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:46,720
presence to give back to the industry at

84
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,160
large as well so

85
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,160
what that is is we have a technical blog

86
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,840
for red teamers and blue teamers uh

87
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,160
where we release a lot of new articles

88
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,040
as far as cves to ttps to even some

89
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,280
basic stuff as well

90
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,280
on our source zero blog um and

91
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,599
accompanying that is we just completed

92
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,200
our second year running of the source

93
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,840
zerocon so it's a completely free uh to

94
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,000
attend security conferences i think this

95
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,519
year we had three separate tracks over

96
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,519
three days um with a whole bunch of

97
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:15,440
different talks and and sp

98
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,440
individuals speaking to a broad range of

99
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,040
technical topics

100
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,480
and to go along with all that we also

101
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,800
have our open source tooling um that's

102
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,640
partnered with source zero right in our

103
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,319
github as well to give back

104
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:29,440
to the assessors in the industry

105
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,200
excellent that's actually perfect segue

106
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,640
for my next question

107
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,400
which is

108
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,159
what are your top three recommendations

109
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,080
i know that there may be a lot of things

110
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,760
that we can recommend for people that

111
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,760
are getting started but if i'm getting

112
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,680
started today and especially in

113
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,440
offensive security what are your top

114
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,760
three things that i should focus on

115
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,360
yeah that's a great question i get asked

116
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,360
that quite often and it usually in my

117
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,439
opinion skips a couple steps people ask

118
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:54,799
like hey how do i hack things or how do

119
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:56,480
i get into hacking or you know the cyber

120
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,560
security offensive security space

121
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,360
um in my opinion the the formula stayed

122
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,280
relatively the same over the years and

123
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,760
that it requires a deep intimate

124
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,040
understanding of the underlying

125
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,120
technologies and so what i mean by that

126
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,599
is understanding how something works

127
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:13,200
really really well before you can

128
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,120
manipulate it in say an offensive or

129
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,918
malicious way right um so understanding

130
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:20,399
how active directory works uh how linux

131
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,600
works uh how networking uh functioned at

132
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,440
a very deep and comp you know you know

133
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,720
in-depth level right um web apps etc so

134
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,960
you need to have those fundamentals

135
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,280
fully intact before you can go into the

136
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,360
next level of say again manipulating

137
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,080
them

138
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,560
um other things uh sit in a similar vein

139
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,040
is once you do get into the security

140
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,880
space and maybe start doing a little bit

141
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,080
of work there

142
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,000
do it as manual as possible a lot of

143
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,160
folks like to get into automation and

144
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,160
rely on tooling heavily

145
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,680
do it as mainly as possible so you

146
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,960
understand the actions that you're

147
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,960
taking and what the cause and effect is

148
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,960
of those actions are on say the

149
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,560
environment the operating system or the

150
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,800
application as compared to a tool that

151
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,800
you just point at at a host and hit go

152
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,120
and you have no clue what it's doing so

153
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,360
um do it as manually as possible be very

154
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,720
leery of tools and understand what

155
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,199
you're doing and then lastly get

156
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,880
involved with the community

157
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,600
postcode is more true than ever um it in

158
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,520
that it could be virtual versus say your

159
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,600
local you know whatever meetup uh

160
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,360
location but get involved in the

161
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,960
security community make a bunch of

162
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,919
friends there's multiple benefits there

163
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,120
first of all you're going to have the

164
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,479
opportunity for great knowledge share

165
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:29,759
and learning opportunity but then

166
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,840
there's also going to be a great social

167
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,240
um the social aspect of probably getting

168
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,080
a good career opportunity as well just

169
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,759
