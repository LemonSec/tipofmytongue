1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:03,179
all right good afternoon everyone

2
00:00:03,179 --> 00:00:07,379
Welcome to our talk my name is Cassandra

3
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:11,040
Pierre and on the call with me is Nathan

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,340
Chung we are going to be talking about

5
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:16,320
neurodiversity and cyber security and

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,420
how you can find your competitive

7
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:22,560
advantage today so thank you for joining

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,340
wonderful what exactly is neurodiversity

9
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:27,740
um Nathan I'll start with a definition

10
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:31,080
it's the idea that it's normal and

11
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,059
acceptable for people to have brains

12
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:35,579
that function differently from one

13
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:37,140
another

14
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:38,719
um normally when you hear the term

15
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:42,120
neurodiversity mentioned some of the

16
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,420
things that come to mind would be autism

17
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:48,239
ADHD dyslexia

18
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:52,320
um dyspraxia Tourette's

19
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,899
um it I would say neurodiversity is

20
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:56,520
something that I think a lot of people

21
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,460
are hearing a lot more about I would say

22
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,000
in the last two to three years and a lot

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,760
of people are sharing

24
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,659
um

25
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:09,600
about their neurodiversity and also

26
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,799
about

27
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,400
um their advocacy for this uh cause you

28
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,920
see that Nathan as well

29
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,100
absolutely I'm quite happy about that

30
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,240
because

31
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,700
new diversity always carries a negative

32
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,159
stigma so to see people coming out

33
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,200
openly that they have a condition it's

34
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,640
just autism ADHD or turrets it's amazing

35
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,900
absolutely amazing absolutely agreed

36
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,759
so

37
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:42,299
the Crux of our talk today is to talk

38
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:45,119
about cyber security and then also to

39
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,240
talk about how it can be an amazing

40
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,240
career for people who are neurodiverse

41
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,119
so currently in the United States there

42
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:57,119
are many jobs that are open

43
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,880
um in May 2021 there were almost 500 000

44
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,180
open jobs in cyber security across all

45
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:07,020
sub genres of the industry

46
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:07,680
um

47
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,598
you know in in talking to a lot of

48
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:12,540
people in cyber outside of cyber people

49
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,520
in a black community

50
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,440
um there has been conversations about

51
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,080
how we are best preparing future

52
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,200
generations to graduate to go to college

53
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,660
or not a vocational school and then to

54
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:27,660
Pivot into a career I hope we can unpack

55
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:30,000
some of that today but our primary focus

56
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,920
is to talk about

57
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,560
um how we can support neurodiverse

58
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,019
individuals and your diverse youth to

59
00:02:37,019 --> 00:02:40,440
investigate and look at Cyber as a great

60
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,180
career path

61
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,760
um some of the reasons why uh I think

62
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,640
cyber is an amazing career path even for

63
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,379
someone who may be looking at a second

64
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:52,560
career is the Financial Freedom that can

65
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,379
be achieved most of these jobs are high

66
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:57,720
paying the stability obviously the

67
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,280
creation of generation wealth

68
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,459
generational wealth not only for you

69
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:04,440
know your immediate family but you know

70
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,540
for your grandkids and and for your

71
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,700
surrounding family

72
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,800
um the career opportunities that come

73
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,159
along with that and also it's a career

74
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,140
where you are constantly learning new

75
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:19,080
technology so intellectual stimulation

76
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,760
if that's something that interests you

77
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:24,980
cyber security would be a great fit

78
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:28,260
so again can it be an ideal career path

79
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:31,440
for people of color I believe so

80
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,180
um I think you know with organizations

81
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:36,659
like Vic and um you know other other

82
00:03:36,659 --> 00:03:38,280
technology and cyber security

83
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,500
organizations

84
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,959
um they're laying the foundation and the

85
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,120
framework for a lot of people to upskill

86
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,879
and and to Pivot

87
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:50,940
um I think a lot of the support is there

88
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,980
um if someone is interested in pivoting

89
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,900
to cyber security it's just a matter of

90
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,939
hooking up with the right network of

91
00:03:56,939 --> 00:03:59,340
people who will support and encourage

92
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,920
you it's not an easy pivot but it is

93
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,560
possible if you set your mind to it and

94
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,599
you're willing to do the work

95
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:08,819
um cyber security I believe it's a great

96
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:10,980
career path for

97
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:14,119
um for people of color

98
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:18,238
so again uh benefits of cyber security

99
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,160
um I would say one of the benefits that

100
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,139
I've seen I'm not yet working in the

101
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:25,199
field uh Nathan but I would say also is

102
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,960
that cyber security has a really good

103
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,820
community

104
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:33,000
um and lots of opportunities for people

105
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,680
to

106
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,620
um come together to share knowledge and

107
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:40,139
then also to share Community I think

108
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:42,139
that's how we met right

109
00:04:42,139 --> 00:04:46,139
absolutely went through a recess and

110
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:48,540
and we we are both part of many many

111
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,940
other organizations we can to help out

112
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,620
very happy with that

113
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,660
yeah I've met some really great people

114
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,280
and

115
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,440
um you know always willing to pitch in

116
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,259
to help to explain you know a concept if

117
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:03,240
I didn't understand

118
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,400
um to help me with interviews so on and

119
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,220
so forth uh it's definitely a supportive

120
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:11,340
uh community and organizations like Bic

121
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:15,419
makes it uh very very easy to kind of

122
00:05:15,419 --> 00:05:19,380
get in and to to see or to find out what

123
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:22,280
um your Niche is

124
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:26,520
so here are the numbers of

125
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:30,360
neurodiversity and cyber security

126
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,580
um Nathan I know this is something that

127
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:34,800
we've been talking about for a very long

128
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,539
time right

129
00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:39,000
um neurodiversity as

130
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,699
you know something that people uh talk

131
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:44,280
about right now openly

132
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,860
um but also are concerned about what is

133
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:49,259
happening to our youth

134
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:51,000
um specifically those who may be in

135
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,120
special education who have an IEP so on

136
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,120
and so forth so we do know that autism

137
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,100
in black children has increased

138
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,919
exponentially

139
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:03,479
um you know back when I worked in

140
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:07,520
education I can say that uh the support

141
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,500
for students and for their parents

142
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:14,580
really was not there nor was

143
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,680
um the open-mindedness I would say that

144
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,800
we see with neurodiversity as a whole it

145
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,740
was very stigmatized uh those students

146
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,060
were

147
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,639
um

148
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:29,699
frequently in uh suspended from school

149
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:32,699
or in timeout it was they were often

150
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:36,300
penalized instead of being provided with

151
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,500
support

152
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,020
um I think now we see a lot of parents

153
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:43,440
becoming more educated around uh the

154
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,120
difficulties that their children have

155
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,400
and there being a better advocate for

156
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,680
their children in school moving along

157
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,080
with that is you know the amount of

158
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,720
black adults that

159
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,539
um are now getting diagnosed right with

160
00:06:57,539 --> 00:06:59,280
with ADHD

161
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,259
um later on in their in their in their

162
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:04,080
lives and in their professional careers

163
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,520
um something that they struggled with

164
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,460
for a very long time and only because

165
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:11,940
this conversation is is coming up

166
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:13,680
um they're going and seeking a

167
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,960
professional evaluation and a

168
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,880
professional opinion so

169
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,139
um I think that's a great thing because

170
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:21,900
people can get the support

171
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,840
um that they need and then you know

172
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,940
three percent percent of infosep jobs

173
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:30,360
are made up by African Americans I think

174
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,580
that's a dismal number

175
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:37,319
um considering the the wide amount of um

176
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:39,660
open roles there are

177
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,580
um the the job wrecks that we see

178
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:43,620
companies are advertising they have

179
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,360
openings

180
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,319
um why we as a people aren't able to

181
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:51,300
connect to those openings and to land

182
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,860
the job

183
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:55,500
um that's a that's a conversation for

184
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,599
another day but it's definitely

185
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,919
something that um I think in my position

186
00:08:00,919 --> 00:08:03,780
uh you know not only in Tech development

187
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:06,960
but also uh with other organization

188
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,580
Affiliates it's something that I want to

189
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:10,080
look into more

190
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,240
um to see how we can open more doors for

191
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,819
people to to Pivot

192
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:17,099
um so what about uh what do you what

193
00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:20,879
about students who are studying stem

194
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:25,199
um Nathan we see here only 34.3 percent

195
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:26,940
um are studying stem why do you think

196
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,039
that is

197
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,440
it's very hard because like you said

198
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,958
that there are a lot of barriers in it

199
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:35,899
for a lot of folks especially for women

200
00:08:35,899 --> 00:08:39,059
it starts as early as Middle School in

201
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:40,200
high school

202
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,080
if they are turned away from stem at

203
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,880
that early age they they never recover

204
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,480
they just totally lose interest so

205
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,019
but at the study show there is a strong

206
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:54,180
I say strong indicator that a lot of

207
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:56,700
people who are autistic want to go into

208
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,519
stem so as much as possible we need to

209
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:01,560
encourage them and to keep keep them

210
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,320
going because we here in the U.S

211
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,600
we there's a lot of brain drain like

212
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,180
with a with a recession and the current

213
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,620
global economic

214
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:13,519
crises that's going on a lot of people

215
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,600
probably don't even want to go to the

216
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,399
stems like they're in survival mode so

217
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:21,360
we gotta do more to encourage people to

218
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,720
learn stem in school and into college

219
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,240
yeah definitely agree and as you can see

220
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:30,180
only nine percent of stem graduates were

221
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:32,279
black and and like you said there are

222
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:34,320
many reasons for that um it could be

223
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,620
lack of support uh University level

224
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,120
um lack of support and making the

225
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,480
transition after graduation to a career

226
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,480
um you know needing to maybe seek a

227
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,760
career that has more stability or better

228
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,640
benefits right to support a family

229
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,160
um or to be able to connect to a salary

230
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:56,880
that is um you know isn't something

231
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,680
that's going to scale up as they gain

232
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,360
experience but something that right out

233
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,880
of the gate they'll be able to to make a

234
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,540
living wage so we have a lot of work to

235
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:07,440
do

236
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,980
um I think when it comes to not only uh

237
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:13,920
neurodiverse African-Americans

238
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,079
um period but also those who are

239
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:18,540
interested in cyber and want to make

240
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:20,940
um a change

241
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:24,060
so uh this is something that comes up a

242
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:27,959
lot you know the the pros of of being a

243
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:30,779
neurodivergent individual and

244
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:33,540
um the competitive advantages that come

245
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:35,339
along with it I'll talk about the first

246
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:37,500
couple Nathan and I'll let you get the

247
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,880
bottom

248
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,180
um definitely attention to detail

249
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:44,880
um being Adept at research having a high

250
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,160
love for learning new things and

251
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:50,399
defining and for finding out new things

252
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:51,959
um highly skilled with throat and

253
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:54,839
mechanical tasks uh being great at data

254
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:57,779
entry being great at looking at logs

255
00:10:57,779 --> 00:11:00,300
um being great at looking at

256
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:03,060
um you know uh research papers and

257
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:08,040
whatnot I think uh people who are new

258
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:11,279
divers come with a specific set of

259
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:15,720
skills that make them highly highly uh

260
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:19,440
skilled and a great fit not only for

261
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,260
cyber roles but for many roles

262
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:24,000
um it's just a matter of finding the

263
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,880
right job the right support system

264
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,200
um and we'll get into that a little bit

265
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,480
later you want to talk about the the

266
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,720
last four Nathan sure absolutely and

267
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,140
um for the

268
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:40,200
they're also have Superior long-term

269
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,959
memory recall they can for example

270
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,240
listen to

271
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,860
uh like

272
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,839
like uh something

273
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:51,240
they can memorize specific dates and

274
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,220
they can just spot on they can just tell

275
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:55,860
you exactly the exact numbers like like

276
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:59,220
wow you also Infinity for logic math and

277
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:01,560
pattern recognition tremendously useful

278
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,839
for instance response where you need to

279
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:06,959
be able to identify

280
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,820
potential hackers or nation state

281
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:12,240
attackers as quickly as possible picture

282
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,540
and other box anchors sometimes to be

283
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:17,160
really good security you need to go to

284
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,380
think on the box and think like a hacker

285
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:20,160
and

286
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,200
especially for certain tasks like

287
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,800
malware analysis or threat hunting where

288
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,660
you need to be able to

289
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:29,639
think out of the box like what what will

290
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:31,380
the Hat will the

291
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:33,899
pen testers or hackers try to do what

292
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:35,700
would they do inside the system if

293
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,680
they're getting and lastly most

294
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,839
importantly is innovation and creative

295
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,320
problem solvers super reliable in

296
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:46,200
especially in instant response because

297
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,959
in a crisis a lot of a lot of people who

298
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,720
are no version are very they go into

299
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,540
overdrive and they can they can solve

300
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,940
their incidents a lot faster than

301
00:12:56,940 --> 00:13:00,060
other folks yeah that's that hyper Focus

302
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:02,300
right hyper Focus

303
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:05,339
the moment when you can uh essentially

304
00:13:05,339 --> 00:13:09,180
fixate on a task until you can remedy it

305
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:12,060
um and then get uh you get the

306
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:14,100
um desired outcome or solution that you

307
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,740
want awesome

308
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,959
so I guess this is a point in the

309
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,820
conversation where you know for those of

310
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:24,180
you who are listening or watching after

311
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,740
all that we've said do you think that

312
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:28,560
cyber could be the right career for you

313
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,899
um is this your first time hearing about

314
00:13:30,899 --> 00:13:33,480
cyber and not and you know the

315
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,160
possibility of you making a pivot have

316
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,260
you thought about it before what do you

317
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,519
think would make

318
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:40,019
um what about you do you think would

319
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:42,360
make you an ideal candidate

320
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,940
um what skill set do you currently have

321
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:47,519
that could either be honed or developed

322
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,980
what are the soft skills that you have

323
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:53,339
um that are your competitive Advantage

324
00:13:53,339 --> 00:13:53,940
um

325
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:56,459
how would someone right who

326
00:13:56,459 --> 00:13:59,459
traditionally I would say in a job or in

327
00:13:59,459 --> 00:14:02,339
a role or in another environment who

328
00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:04,740
doesn't traditionally fit in buying

329
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:07,260
their space or find their place in cyber

330
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:09,660
and then what skills do you have that

331
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:12,480
set you apart and make you different

332
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,459
um from everyone else and how can you

333
00:14:14,459 --> 00:14:15,959
highlight those

334
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:17,459
um to maximize your strengths we're

335
00:14:17,459 --> 00:14:19,620
going to get into that

336
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:21,560
I'll share a little bit about myself

337
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,839
like I said I've been

338
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:27,420
um I guess cyber adjacent that's the

339
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,880
best way to put it for the last two and

340
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,620
a half years or so

341
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:35,880
um I had the a privilege of working

342
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,339
um initially with Bic and being a part

343
00:14:38,339 --> 00:14:41,519
of their community meeting some really

344
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:43,500
great people there leveraging their

345
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,300
resources getting on their Discord

346
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,560
Channel

347
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,480
um met lots of friendly people and this

348
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,339
is one of the reasons why um I thought

349
00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:52,440
it was really important for us to bring

350
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:55,139
this information to

351
00:14:55,139 --> 00:14:57,959
um to Defcon so again cyber and

352
00:14:57,959 --> 00:15:00,240
Technology Enthusiast I love anything

353
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,620
Tech

354
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,240
um love to Tinker with different things

355
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,160
on top of that

356
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:08,040
um I have about I would say 15 years 10

357
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,740
years or so experience working in mental

358
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:13,920
health both in special education with

359
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:18,180
children up to age uh 18 and then also

360
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:21,120
adults in an acute psychiatric setting

361
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,880
so I bring my love for mental health and

362
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,940
psychology to my work and you know day

363
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:29,579
to day I try to spread information about

364
00:15:29,579 --> 00:15:32,160
mental health awareness and physical

365
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,320
wellness stress reduction that kind of

366
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,579
thing

367
00:15:35,579 --> 00:15:37,620
um one one interesting thing about me

368
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:40,680
also is my intersectionalities right

369
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,680
um and obviously a black female from the

370
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,199
Caribbean and I received a very late

371
00:15:46,199 --> 00:15:48,000
diagnosis

372
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:48,660
um

373
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:51,240
about three years ago

374
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,519
um I've been you know in and out of

375
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,740
therapy for a very long time it's

376
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:57,420
something that I actively sought out

377
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:59,699
because I think it's important for you

378
00:15:59,699 --> 00:16:01,680
to really have a space a safe space

379
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,839
where you can talk about you know things

380
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,240
that are bothering you but

381
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,339
um at my age now this is something that

382
00:16:08,339 --> 00:16:11,339
was missed all of these years it was

383
00:16:11,339 --> 00:16:14,759
just an eccentricity right that people

384
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:16,800
um thought that I had or that I was

385
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,959
dealing with and I was misdiagnosed for

386
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:23,100
a very very very very very long time

387
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:26,699
um partially I think because of the lack

388
00:16:26,699 --> 00:16:29,720
of research that's out there for women

389
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,399
specifically black women

390
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:36,300
um and also because of you know a lot of

391
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:38,940
of mental health practitioners are not

392
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:42,660
of color so it's very difficult to find

393
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:45,060
um someone who gets you and can help you

394
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,440
you know kind of figure out what's going

395
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,440
on with you so as a result of that I've

396
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,360
made it my mission right now to really

397
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,180
reach out and to want to share my story

398
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,339
about what I go through

399
00:16:56,339 --> 00:16:58,680
um as someone who is more Divergent

400
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:02,279
dealing with you know ADHD and

401
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:05,400
um Spectrum issues and you know really

402
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,740
advocating for people who are younger

403
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:11,660
than me who are graduating who are trans

404
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:14,099
transitioning into college you know

405
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:15,480
trying to figure out what their career

406
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,679
is

407
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:18,359
um providing them with the support so

408
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:19,679
they kind of don't have to go through a

409
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,780
lot of the hardships that I did

410
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:22,859
um and I think that's what really

411
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:26,339
encourages me and also finally I'm also

412
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:28,820
the um president and one of the founders

413
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:31,980

but this is just one of the things that

418
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,039
I think Nathan and I have been plotting

419
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:44,400
about for the last uh couple of months

420
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,039
um to really solidify and to start to

create a place where people like us uh

422
00:17:51,179 --> 00:17:53,880

Implement to ensure that they are

482

it starts with the job description

492
00:20:56,659 --> 00:20:59,940

number three

505
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:31,980
ask for or even allowing accommodations

506
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:34,320
during interviews very critical

507
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,260
before ask candidates were tools they

508
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:38,940
need to thrive

509
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:41,159
because everyone is different everyone

510
00:21:41,159 --> 00:21:43,919
has different needs so you just got to

511
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:46,260
ask them what what do they need

512
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:49,140
and also most importantly provide remote

513
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:52,140
or flexible interview options because

514
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:53,640
the old school in-person interview

515
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,780
that's

516
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:57,179
that's pretty much guy on the door and

517
00:21:57,179 --> 00:21:59,280
for people like myself

518
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,919
I do so much better with the remote

519
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:06,480
interviews so much better agreed I

520
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,500
definitely agreed with that

521
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:12,720
I will also let you get into this one

522
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,000
um sure then I love the fact that you

523
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,159
made a great

524
00:22:17,159 --> 00:22:20,340
um distinction between ideals and less

525
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:22,620
ideal rules for for newer diversity yeah

526
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:25,559
jump into that so for a lot of people

527
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:28,140
who are dual diversion and

528
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:30,299
ideally you want a

529
00:22:30,299 --> 00:22:32,880
a more technical role but I do stress

530
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,039
again everyone's different but for me

531
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:37,820
and a lot of people like me We thrive in

532
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:40,140
very technical

533
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:42,059
feels where there's less human

534
00:22:42,059 --> 00:22:44,179
interaction like double threat Hunter

535
00:22:44,179 --> 00:22:46,860
forensics analysts infant response

536
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:48,299
malware engineer

537
00:22:48,299 --> 00:22:51,179
meditation tester and consultant

538
00:22:51,179 --> 00:22:52,860
now

539
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,900
the advantage of a lot of these jobs is

540
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,159
you're

541
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:58,500
essentially what you get in a Zone and

542
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,840
you're hyper focused you can do an

543
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,940
amazing job you could think

544
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:06,059
specialists a specialists in these

545
00:23:06,059 --> 00:23:08,520
fields especially can do an amazing

546
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,260
thing just

547
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:12,780
it's harder if you get distracted by all

548
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:14,880
this have a meeting let's talk to people

549
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,919
and it becomes a lot harder

550
00:23:16,919 --> 00:23:17,940
so

551
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:20,760
that's why the inverse is less ideal

552
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,380
jobs would be like security project

553
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:25,260
manager or privacy officer

554
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:27,240
security auditor or compliance risk

555
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,260
badger

556
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:30,960
those jobs I've I've done a lot many of

557
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,120
those jobs before and it can be very

558
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,940
stressful especially in many many Ming

559
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:38,240
that go on forever and ever

560
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,559
it's it

561
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:43,860
fills me with anxiety and it equals to a

562
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:48,600
mental burnout a lot quicker definitely

563
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,340
um like you said the back-to-back

564
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:53,039
meetings you know constant interaction

565
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:56,580
with people that pull you out of your uh

566
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:57,960
zone of

567
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,360
um concentration

568
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:03,299
um and and just overall cognitive uh

569
00:24:03,299 --> 00:24:05,159
burnout and you know this is something

570
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:09,419
that goes on day by day by day it can be

571
00:24:09,419 --> 00:24:11,700
very detrimental

572
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:15,120
um to you know an employee who wants to

573
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,299
create a a career that will grow right

574
00:24:18,299 --> 00:24:20,700
and where they can be promoted so it's

575
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:23,520
very important for you to think about

576
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,020
um you know when you're choosing what

577
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:28,260
role or what area of cyber is a good fit

578
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:31,799
for you also choose also think about

579
00:24:31,799 --> 00:24:34,559
what your day-to-day in your role may

580
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:37,080
look like if you don't really know this

581
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,760
is when you kind of need to reach out to

582
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:42,000
your network get on Discord channels you

583
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,440
know find people who are currently in

584
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,020
that role and ask them about what their

585
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:48,360
you know job is like what they do for a

586
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,440
day

587
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,200
um you know they they you know how they

588
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,520
trained

589
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,380
um and see if those are the things that

590
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:57,539
that fit well for you um I think talking

591
00:24:57,539 --> 00:24:59,460
to real people about what they do is the

592
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:01,740
best way to find out if a role is for

593
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:03,779
you or not

594
00:25:03,779 --> 00:25:06,120
so there are a lot of accommodations

595
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:08,820
that employers can provide either during

596
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:12,120
the hiring process or once a new hire

597
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,860
has onboarded

598
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:16,380
um supports that they can provide to

599
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:18,120
their employee to ensure that they can

600
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,799
do their job to the best of their

601
00:25:19,799 --> 00:25:23,159
ability I hope that one day we will move

602
00:25:23,159 --> 00:25:25,860
from calling these accommodations and

603
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:27,539
they're just readily available things

604
00:25:27,539 --> 00:25:30,059
that people have that they don't have to

605
00:25:30,059 --> 00:25:32,760
ask for so interview questions made it

606
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,980
available in advance I also had an

607
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:36,360
opportunity

608
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:39,240
um to interview and was provided with

609
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:42,480
questions in advance and it made

610
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,059
um like Nathan said it really removed a

611
00:25:45,059 --> 00:25:47,640
lot of the anxiety that people feel when

612
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:51,240
it comes to being able to uh perform on

613
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,940
the spot noise reducing headphones I

614
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:56,820
have a pair on my on my desk these are

615
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:58,380
important especially if you work you may

616
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:01,020
work in a in an open floor plan office

617
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:03,059
or even if you're at home it's good to

618
00:26:03,059 --> 00:26:06,600
cut the norm noise out you know that may

619
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,240
distract you being able to work from

620
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:12,539
home or having uh maybe one or two days

621
00:26:12,539 --> 00:26:15,120
in the office and working remotely

622
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,400
um flexible schedule some of us work

623
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,799
better early in the morning and need to

624
00:26:19,799 --> 00:26:22,020
take a arrest or you know during the day

625
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:24,419
and then log back on at the end of the

626
00:26:24,419 --> 00:26:26,640
night to kind of finish things up that

627
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,380
gives you opportunity to really keep an

628
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:32,340
eye on your energy levels and

629
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,659
um to ensure that you're not pushing

630
00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:36,539
yourself to the Max and and leading to

631
00:26:36,539 --> 00:26:39,480
you know uh patterns of burnout that's

632
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,000
something that you don't want to have

633
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,220
captions or transcriptions definitely

634
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:46,200
very helpful

635
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,460
um especially if you have meetings back

636
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:50,460
to back it detracts from the cognitive

637
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:52,320
overload when you can just look at the

638
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,140
text on a screen as opposed to trying to

639
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:57,360
differentiate voices from background

640
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,880
noise from clicks from people chewing

641
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,980
from people laughing the dog barking all

642
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:04,080
of those things these are the the

643
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,640
reasons why those things are important

644
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,980
and last but not least ergonomic

645
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:10,260
Furniture we also you know we talk a lot

646
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:11,820
about our Mental Health

647
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:14,039
taking care of our physical body is also

648
00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:17,039
very important with a cyber role most of

649
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:18,840
them you will be sitting at a desk for

650
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,419
most of the day so get a stand-up desk

651
00:27:21,419 --> 00:27:24,179
you know ask for ergonomic chair that is

652
00:27:24,179 --> 00:27:27,000
supported on your feet uh foot rest all

653
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,039
of these things and you put the totality

654
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:31,320
of all these things together it provides

655
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,059
you or can provide you with the support

656
00:27:33,059 --> 00:27:36,360
that you need to be fully functional at

657
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,460
work

658
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:41,039
so just a couple things Nathan I'll let

659
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:42,659
you uh jump in because I think you have

660
00:27:42,659 --> 00:27:44,880
a lot of great things to add here

661
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,980
um when it comes to retention you know I

662
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:49,380
think a lot of times we don't really

663
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:52,440
think about you know the employees that

664
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,600
don't really say much right and then

665
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,520
when they leave we want to know why they

666
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,419
left

667
00:27:57,419 --> 00:27:59,100
um they were such a great worker why did

668
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,419
they leave

669
00:28:00,419 --> 00:28:02,880
um I think a lot of times employers

670
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,039
don't really try to implement a solution

671
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:07,740
until people actually leave the job so

672
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:09,299
these are some of the things that

673
00:28:09,299 --> 00:28:12,539
employers can do starting today to

674
00:28:12,539 --> 00:28:14,880
ensure that they're creating a safe

675
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,520
space for their employees listen people

676
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,940
are going to put themselves out there to

677
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:22,860
share insights about things that can be

678
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:25,140
improved listen to what they have to say

679
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:28,679
it may not um mesh or go well or maybe

680
00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:30,240
you do not want to hear what they have

681
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,159
to say but understand people are putting

682
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:34,860
themselves on the line to Share

683
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:36,539
um their feelings give them their

684
00:28:36,539 --> 00:28:38,760
accommodations if they request you you

685
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,020
know the fact that they would like a

686
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:43,440
flexible schedule and it is a reasonable

687
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,960
accommodation it does not disrupt you

688
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,299
know work provide that to them you'll

689
00:28:48,299 --> 00:28:49,740
find that they become even more

690
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:52,620
productive and um even you know better

691
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:54,659
at doing their job

692
00:28:54,659 --> 00:28:56,760
um you know the job that they signed up

693
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,480
for

694
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:00,179
flexible career paths a lot of us are

695
00:29:00,179 --> 00:29:03,659
multi-potential meaning that we are we

696
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:06,299
have multiple interests

697
00:29:06,299 --> 00:29:08,820
um in many different areas right so we

698
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:10,440
may get into a role you see it's a lot

699
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:13,799
of with people who have ADHD they have a

700
00:29:13,799 --> 00:29:15,539
lot of interest and a lot of

701
00:29:15,539 --> 00:29:18,799
intellectual strength in many areas

702
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:21,960
provide them with opportunity to start

703
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,240
new projects or you know to work on a

704
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,340
different engagement or to go on a tour

705
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:28,020
Duty these are the things that keep

706
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:30,299
people engaged and

707
00:29:30,299 --> 00:29:33,059
um interested in their work you want to

708
00:29:33,059 --> 00:29:36,899
finish these up Nathan sure and

709
00:29:36,899 --> 00:29:38,640
to add to what you said about speech

710
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,440
about career path

711
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:43,620
a lot of businesses they still have it

712
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:46,440
I always call it an old school mentality

713
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,779
where you're automatically pushed into

714
00:29:48,779 --> 00:29:51,179
the manager slash executive ranks

715
00:29:51,179 --> 00:29:53,100
whereas a lot of people like me

716
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:55,679
specifically I have the zero desire to

717
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:58,260
be a manager because of the all the

718
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:01,559
social the social us issues and the

719
00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:04,140
mental overload brings

720
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:06,000
so ideally you want to have a flexible

721
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,860
career path for example it if you don't

722
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:10,679
want to be measure you can do should not

723
00:30:10,679 --> 00:30:12,360
have the choice to go in alternate

724
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:15,000
passages architect and not interact with

725
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,860
as many people

726
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:20,100
Barry next you want to reduce the

727
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,720
barriers to productivity

728
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,640
you want to make the your employees feel

729
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:26,039
very comfortable to do their job

730
00:30:26,039 --> 00:30:28,500
next incorporate Dei to corporate

731
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,000
culture because

732
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,279
at many organizations they try to edit

733
00:30:32,279 --> 00:30:33,720
like

734
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,640
add something like put something

735
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,200
temporary on top of your corporate

736
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,640
culture i

737
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,020
but ideally

738
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:42,539
this dni initiatives around no division

739
00:30:42,539 --> 00:30:45,299
should be applied organization wise let

740
00:30:45,299 --> 00:30:48,539
everyone feels welcome definitely

741
00:30:48,539 --> 00:30:51,059
next address the signal issues

742
00:30:51,059 --> 00:30:52,740
immediately because

743
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:55,020
despite all the gains of new diversity

744
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,000
it is still

745
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,340
lack of return it gets a bad rap people

746
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:00,659
are people

747
00:31:00,659 --> 00:31:04,260
immediately if as if they if people see

748
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:06,720
you as having like autism or ADHD you

749
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,539
get labeled and sometimes the most more

750
00:31:09,539 --> 00:31:11,760
times than not the label or like your

751
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,519
problem your quirky your strange and

752
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:18,480
it's it's almost always negative so when

753
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,519
this happens this negative stigma

754
00:31:20,519 --> 00:31:22,980
especially

755
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:25,039
you need to be able to like essentially

756
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:27,720
stomp it out and make people feel

757
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,220
welcome

758
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,200
so the burden of this especially on

759
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,760
managers like when you see stuff happen

760
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:35,340
speak up take action

761
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:38,279
and most important of all be an ally to

762
00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:40,799
your employee because a lot of people

763
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:42,779
are gonna be quiet they're gonna be

764
00:31:42,779 --> 00:31:44,519
quiet they just want to do their work

765
00:31:44,519 --> 00:31:47,580
don't wait for them to come to you

766
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:50,580
as a for manager specially reach out to

767
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:52,860
your employees ask them straight out how

768
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:53,899
are you doing

769
00:31:53,899 --> 00:31:57,360
what can I provide to you that can help

770
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,679
you to thrive

771
00:31:58,679 --> 00:32:01,380
and that one question crosses many

772
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:04,260
boundaries not just no diverse employees

773
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:05,279
but

774
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:09,179
men women people of color various races

775
00:32:09,179 --> 00:32:12,539
age lgbtq plus that one question takes

776
00:32:12,539 --> 00:32:14,519
care of all that just ask you know

777
00:32:14,519 --> 00:32:16,260

778
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:18,299

779
00:32:18,299 --> 00:32:21,179
and and is it is really needed building

780
00:32:21,179 --> 00:32:23,640

781
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:26,100

783

788
00:32:45,059 --> 00:32:48,120
right thinking about what exactly you

789
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:51,000

00:33:03,059 --> 00:33:05,399
don't currently find that job

796
00:33:05,399 --> 00:33:07,620

um you know to be able to do the job

800
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:19,799
and then work towards that

801
00:33:19,799 --> 00:33:22,140
how do you work best virtually in person

802
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:25,740
hybrid personally I work best at home

803
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:27,240
um I'm more productive at home I can

804
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,039
control my environment do what works for

805
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:31,320
you do you want to share

806
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:33,360
um about the you know about being your

807
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:36,240
Divergent do you want to keep that to

808
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,460
yourself how much would you share well

809
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:40,620
who do you share it with your manager HR

810
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:42,480
whoever is something that you need to

811
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,440
know

812
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,200
um if you need specific accommodations

813
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,880
write those down think about them do

814
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:50,159
some research so you know what to ask

815
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:53,039

able to support you to do your job

817

better who's on your team I think it's

818
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,620
very important for everyone to have a

819
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:01,740
mentor who can provide them with the

820
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:04,559
technical information about the job that

821
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:07,019
they're in a coach who will help you to

822
00:34:07,019 --> 00:34:10,020

824
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:14,040
performance and how you're doing and how

842
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:59,400
want the role that you want so

843
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,440
definitely continue to connect with them

844
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,839
for for guidance

845
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:06,900
find your fit there are some jobs that

846
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:10,380
will not be a good fit for you okay if a

847
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:12,960
role is you know back-to-back meetings

848
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,599
heavy client contact that may not be the

849
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:17,099
place for you it sure isn't the place

850
00:35:17,099 --> 00:35:19,980
for me so figure out what you want and

851
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:22,980
what you don't want have you reached out

852
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:25,980
to people that work for the company that

853
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:28,560
you may be interviewing for find them on

854
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,320
LinkedIn reach out to someone ask them

855
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,720
about the culture at that company look

856
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:36,780
up the person who is on the hiring panel

857
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:39,720

859
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,000
because all of this information is going

860
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,920
to be important for you to make a

861
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,780
decision if this is the right place for

862
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:51,300

863
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:54,540
through a difficult time what can you do

864
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:57,839
to ensure that you can successfully do

865
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:00,240
your job while getting the support that

866
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,700
you need be it mental health physical

867
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:06,060

in your life that can support you and

869
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:11,040
ensure that you keep them that you're

870
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,599
open with them about how you're doing

871
00:36:12,599 --> 00:36:14,339
and where you are

872
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:16,200
um I find for interviews something that

873
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,900
I do is uh research interview questions

874
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:21,180
for the specific role and then I do a

875
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:23,339
lot of practice I usually wrote my

876
00:36:23,339 --> 00:36:26,339
sisters into being my my interview panel

877
00:36:26,339 --> 00:36:29,040
and um the interview me ask me questions

878
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,560
that kind of thing it has helped over

879
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:34,140
time to reduce a lot of my anxiety when

880
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:36,660
it comes to interviewing highlight your

881
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:39,420
strengths it's not bragging if you know

882
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:42,180
that you are a great Problem Solver if

883
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:45,060
you're a strong writer if you are a

884
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:47,640
great pen tester speak up about what you

885
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,859
are good at it doesn't make you a

886
00:36:49,859 --> 00:36:51,540
bragging person it makes you someone

887
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:54,180
who's confident and knows what you are

888
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:56,400
good at

889
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,859
um sometimes you may get a no sometimes

890
00:36:58,859 --> 00:37:01,320
you may you know really do awesome in an

891
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,240
interview and then you get that you get

892
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:05,579
that email that they did not choose you

893
00:37:05,579 --> 00:37:07,800
yes it's extremely disappointing when

894
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:10,500
that happens but do know that every step

895
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:14,099
that you make towards your new role is

896
00:37:14,099 --> 00:37:16,619
building resilience you are gaining

897
00:37:16,619 --> 00:37:18,540
experience you're getting an

898
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:21,599
understanding of the industry and use

899
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:25,079
that for the next time and lastly find

900
00:37:25,079 --> 00:37:27,300
your support system how can the people

901
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:30,540
around you support you let them know

902
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,280
what you're going through let them know

903
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:36,540
what your goal is and actively ask them

904
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:40,200
to support you as you uh make your way

905
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,520
towards it

906
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,260
I'm going to go through these quickly

907
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:47,460
just six things that you can do

908
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:50,339
um to work towards where you want to go

909
00:37:50,339 --> 00:37:52,800
professionally and I think these apply

910
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,359
to everyone

911
00:37:54,359 --> 00:37:56,579
um neurodivergent or not you must have a

912
00:37:56,579 --> 00:37:59,400
plan gotta know where you're going

913
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,020
um and how you're going to get there if

914
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:02,460
you don't know where you're going it's

915
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:04,740
very difficult to come up with a plan

916
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,599
that's going to work

917
00:38:06,599 --> 00:38:08,940
take a look take a piece of paper or use

918
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:10,800
a spreadsheet write down all the

919
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:11,700
trainings you've been through

920
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:13,680
conferences like this one

921
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,480
um courses that you've taken on LinkedIn

922
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,820
or wherever your search keep them on a

923
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:19,859
piece of paper or keep them somewhere

924
00:38:19,859 --> 00:38:21,660
visible so you can see how you are

925
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:23,339
making progress

926
00:38:23,339 --> 00:38:25,560
um towards your goal it may seem like

927
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,420
getting to where you want to go is

928
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:30,300
taking forever but you've accomplished a

929
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:32,760
lot give yourself credit for that the

930
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:36,000
second thing is to prepare have a plan

931
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,820
and then prepare to put it in practice

932
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:42,119
if you don't have your support system

933
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:45,300
the resources you need an accountability

934
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:48,060
someone who's going to ask you how you

935
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:50,400
know your sir prep went

936
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,380
um and a system to succeed it's going to

937
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:54,240
be very difficult for you to see

938
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,700
progress and to push forward if you're

939
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:58,800
making small wins

940
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,079
and you were hitting your your small

941
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:03,119
goals is going to boost your confidence

942
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:06,240
and Propel you further towards um where

943
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,280
you want to end up

944
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,800
definitely protect yourself I think this

945
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,720
kind of goes along with

946
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:13,859
um the overall mental health

947
00:39:13,859 --> 00:39:16,320
conversation Nathan right

948
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,079
um create a plan to maintain work-life

949
00:39:19,079 --> 00:39:21,480
balance that's sustainable I think we

950
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:23,579
all have a tendency to take on a lot

951
00:39:23,579 --> 00:39:26,220
more on our plate than we are capable of

952
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:28,740
be aware if that's something that you

953
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:31,140
you tend to do be aware of that and

954
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:34,140
ensure that you have uh blockers in

955
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:36,960
place to to to know when to put up a

956
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,940
boundary and to say no that your plate

957
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:40,320
is full

958
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,180
um pay attention to your physical health

959

a work environment or ask for one that's

1016
00:41:50,099 --> 00:41:52,920
going to help you do your job better if

1017

um you know you really don't want to

1023
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:11,579
speak to that person reach out to HR see

1024
00:42:11,579 --> 00:42:14,220
what is available for you also leverage

1025
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:17,099
your Affinity Network so disability

1026
00:42:17,099 --> 00:42:18,359
groups

1027
00:42:18,359 --> 00:42:20,540
um you know there are a lot we have uh

1028
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:22,560
African-American groups

1029
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,480
um Latino groups whatever groups there

1030
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:27,300
are uh located at your job reach out to

1031
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:29,099
them and ask around find out what's

1032
00:42:29,099 --> 00:42:31,980
available that you could tap into

1033
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:33,660
um that you could pull into to support

1034
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:38,099
you and then lastly persevere I think

1035
00:42:38,099 --> 00:42:41,160
um a lot of us have gone through uh

1036
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:43,380
extreme hardship

1037
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:44,819
um especially if you were later

1038
00:42:44,819 --> 00:42:46,740
diagnosed right because you may have

1039
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:48,000
thought that there was something wrong

1040
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,380
with you

1041
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:51,180
um there wasn't anything wrong it's just

1042
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:53,640
that you do things differently remember

1043
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:56,819
that right you process and think

1044
00:42:56,819 --> 00:43:00,599
differently and that's it okay this

1045
00:43:00,599 --> 00:43:02,940
looks very different for lots of

1046
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:05,220
different people find find out what that

1047
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:07,079
means for you find out what your thing

1048
00:43:07,079 --> 00:43:10,980
is and know how to apply yourself in a

1049
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:13,260
situation in order to be productive and

1050
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:16,020
then keep it moving

1051
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:18,720
don't allow naysayers to get in your

1052
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:21,000
head or in your way I think sometimes we

1053
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,300
get caught up on labels and we focus too

1054
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:27,720
much on those hyper Focus Nathan and um

1055
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:29,760
you know it puts us in a very bad

1056
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:32,460
headspace so really you know write your

1057
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:34,440
goals down keep it in a place where you

1058
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:37,020
can see them keep studying you know

1059
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:38,700
connect with people who are positive

1060
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:41,940
reach out to folks who are either in

1061
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:43,680
your network outside your network in

1062
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:46,500
that job that you want to get ask them

1063
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:49,680
about themselves ask them to Mentor you

1064
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,540
um display your knowledge start a blog

1065
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:53,460
write on LinkedIn become a content

1066
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:55,680
creator talk about building a Virtual

1067
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,540
Lab there are plenty of people who want

1068
00:43:57,540 --> 00:44:00,960
to Pivot into cyber that can use the

1069
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:03,119
knowledge that you already have join

1070
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:05,460
them work on projects give back find

1071
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:07,500
someone to Mentor

1072
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:09,420
um it's about that time of year where

1073
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:10,859
people either going back to the school

1074
00:44:10,859 --> 00:44:13,280
or they just or they just recently

1075
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:15,960
graduated find someone who all has

1076
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:18,720
similar goals to you and Mentor them or

1077
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:22,079
volunteer and I've also found that the

1078
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:24,780
best way for me to integrate A New

1079
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:27,480
Concept or to comprehend exactly what it

1080
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:29,579
is I need to learn is to teach someone

1081
00:44:29,579 --> 00:44:31,500
else I do my studying and then I share

1082
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:33,900
that information if you can effectively

1083
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:36,240
teach someone a concept that means it's

1084
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,460
stuck in your head so definitely do that

1085
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:41,040
keep moving and if you get a no keep

1086
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:43,619
pushing forward because your yes is

1087
00:44:43,619 --> 00:44:46,980
