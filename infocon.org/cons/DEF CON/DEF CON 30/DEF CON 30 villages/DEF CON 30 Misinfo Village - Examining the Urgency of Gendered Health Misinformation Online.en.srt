1
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,740
okay I think this is working I really

2
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,500
hope it's working so I'm gonna go for it

3
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:17,240
um hi everyone my name is Jenna Sherman

4
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:20,279
I am very sorry that I can't be with all

5
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:23,580
of you in person I was so so pumped for

6
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:25,619
my first Defcon unfortunately at a

7
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:28,080
family emergency

8
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,320
um a brain surgery situation with my dad

9
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,020
he's doing okay

10
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,180
um anyway so I am sitting here and

11
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:39,120
coming to you guys from the interwebs

12
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,899
and I hope that you enjoy this talk

13
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:43,680
um

14
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,540
so I think I said it earlier but I'm

15
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,820
Jenna Sherman I'm a program manager at

16
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:51,059
the technology nonprofit Medan we do a

17
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:52,800
lot of things there but basically it

18
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,020
boils down to providing services and

19
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:58,800
tools to improve information online I

20
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,079
have a background in public health and

21
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:02,699
work on improving information online

22
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:04,860
specific to health I've also done some

23
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,600
tech ethics so that's kind of why I'm

24
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,520
where I am now

25
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,560
um and while I'm not a journalist or a

26
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,840
computer scientist I do a lot of science

27
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,880
writing and

28
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,939
um thinking about how and studying how

29
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:19,979
information about health is spread

30
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:21,840
online and we are going to be talking

31
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,479
about that today in the context of

32
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,920
gendered Health so let's get into it

33
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,740
this is the outline of the talk I always

34
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,979
like to have a little framing for talks

35
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:36,420
and pretty much everything in life so

36
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:37,380
first I'm going to go over some

37
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:40,259
background mostly research

38
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:43,020
um dive into the aims I'll overview the

39
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:46,020
methods and then get into the meat of it

40
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:49,740
which is really the the results of this

41
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,180
report that I've been working on I'll

42
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:53,579
touch on some for Kevin quad data and

43
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:56,280
and with implications which is what it's

44
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,600
really all about

45
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,200
so first is background

46
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,180
um I'm going to start with a definition

47
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:06,180
here because this probably isn't super

48
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,520
familiar to everybody at least in this

49
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,199
specific definition form and it's

50
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:12,360
probably not super specific really known

51
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,280
to everybody because

52
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,760
um I recently coined this term and also

53
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,480
in partnership with one of my colleagues

54
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,340
smriti Singh and

55
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:26,060
um the term is gendered misinformation

56
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:30,660
and gender misinformation as we think of

57
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:33,120
it is the unintentional spread of false

58
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,800
or substandard information that is about

59
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,060
women trans people and non-binary people

60
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:40,800
and the reason why we landed on this

61
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,420
definition is because we wanted it to be

62
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,739
inclusive of all folks who have

63
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:45,540
marginalized gender identities and we

64
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,519
wanted it to be broad enough where it

65
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:48,900
could Encompass other types of this

66
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,239
information even though we are focusing

67
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:53,400
mostly on health

68
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,080
um so what's the problem that we're

69
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,780
actually talking about here so women

70
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,480
trans people and non-binary people

71
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,459
experience the impacts of Health

72
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:05,819
misinformation in unique ways and in

73
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:08,400
disproportionate ways so with less

74
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,980
access to Quality Health Care in person

75
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:13,800
which is documented in research these

76
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,739
individuals are more likely to turn to

77
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:18,379
online information

78
00:03:18,379 --> 00:03:21,140
ecosystems for information

79
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:25,620
and that can often lead to risk outcomes

80
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:28,500
because of bad or substandard

81
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,659
information

82
00:03:29,659 --> 00:03:35,220
and again this is just due to not only a

83
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,840
lack of access in healthcare but also

84
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,180
marginalization and Health Care stigma

85
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:41,700
and an existing higher risk of adverse

86
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,560
Health outcomes

87
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,680
but how do we know this like like are we

88
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,700
sure

89
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:50,099
um so yeah we're we're pretty sure

90
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:52,260
um the the field is very much still

91
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,420
developing but there is a lot of x-stand

92
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:57,659
research that points to the high search

93
00:03:57,659 --> 00:04:01,739
rates among this demographic of folks so

94
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:03,239
I'm not going to go over all of these

95
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:04,500
studies

96
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,299
um I heard that this is a hacker

97
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:07,920
conference and not a public health

98
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,840
conference so I'm going to try and steer

99
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,000
away from going too too deep even though

100
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,799
I'm on the academic track which is fun

101
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:15,780
I'll keep it more high level um these

102
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:18,120
are just some headlines from a few

103
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:22,320
select Publications about high search

104
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,780
rates among women trans people and

105
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,580
non-binary people so you'll see one over

106
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:30,660
here about um birth club forums and that

107
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:33,900
study digs into the high rates of use of

108
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,360
birth forums online and the quality of

109
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,580
information there there's a another

110
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,740
study on the right about online

111
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,840
transgender health information seeking

112
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,759
which has been show shown to be high and

113
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:49,139
then another one about turning to the

114
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:52,860
internet for abortion access so there's

115
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,600
a bunch of these again I'm not going to

116
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,820
go into all of them but essentially we

117
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:59,419
have really well documented literature

118
00:04:59,419 --> 00:05:03,780
explaining the phenomenon of high search

119
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:07,680
rates among these demographics

120
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,479
um this is these are just some visuals

121
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:11,160
because I think it's very helpful to

122
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,680
have visuals so for instance on the left

123
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,560
this is from a survey of parent internet

124
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,139
use to access information about

125
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:21,479
Children's Healthcare and you can see

126
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:22,860
that

127
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:23,520
um

128
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,900
80 of the sites first used to access

129
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,820
health information were from public

130
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,500
search engines and I think this came

131
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,740
after I think something like 60 to 80

132
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,479
percent of participants were using the

133
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:37,919
internet in general

134
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,979
um and then 80 were primarily it's

135
00:05:40,979 --> 00:05:43,440
pretty big jump there primarily using

136
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,180
search engine so that just gives us a

137
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:48,479
sense of what folks are actually using

138
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:51,840
in online spaces to find health

139
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,460
information it's not particularly

140
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:56,160
promising but I also do it too I don't

141
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,020
know anybody that doesn't

142
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:01,199
um and then on the right is uh I'm a

143
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,979
histogram showing search Trends

144
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:06,199
um

145
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:10,320
among actually I'm trying to think I

146
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,699
remember who was among anyway yeah

147
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:14,100
someone's showing search Trends I'll

148
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,660
have to follow up the specific study to

149
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:19,080
get the population but about the three

150
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,639
different searches up on the right there

151
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:21,780
in different colors so that's home

152
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:24,479
abortion self-abortion and by abortion

153
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,580
pill online

154
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:30,000
um and you can see that the highest here

155
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,160
is home abortion

156
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,280
um which Peaks at

157
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,600
64.1 percent

158
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,860
um that's the average

159
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,960
um like rate of searching on the

160
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,539
platform and then the other two are

161
00:06:42,539 --> 00:06:43,860
around

162
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:44,479
um

163
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,699
9.6 on average and 7.8 on average but

164
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:51,419
Peak around like 32.8 and 33.4 so just

165
00:06:51,419 --> 00:06:55,440
more confirmation empirically of high

166
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,759
search rates

167
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:58,560
for helpless information for health

168
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,780
information rather than rather

169
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:01,440
um

170
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,139
okay but why is this a problem well

171
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:06,479
according to Buffy because it's wrong

172
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,819
not to search online but because

173
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:11,460
there's a lot of bad information online

174
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,199
um but we're gonna have to go beyond my

175
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,139
Buffy means today to get a little deeper

176
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:19,139
into the evidence so

177
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:21,960
it's wrong not just because Buffy says

178
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,000
so and I promise that's my last buff you

179
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,479
mean but because the quality is low

180
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,919
these are just a few examples from

181
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:31,500
literature again that I pulled to

182
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,599
demonstrate um

183
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,000
the challenge of low quality content

184
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,160
online so one study published in 2018

185
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,039
found the 50 of Google web pages contain

186
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:43,020
this info that actually hindered a

187
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:45,180
person's decision to get an abortion

188
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:47,039
that's pretty mind-boggling when you

189
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,780
think about it another study found that

190
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,699
out of the five top web page results

191
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:52,500
when searching abortion pill on Google

192
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,620
only one contained scientifically

193
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:58,800
accurate and usable information

194
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,740
a separate study found

195
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:05,340
um on Google that results from searches

196
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:07,199
about trans Health on the on the search

197
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:08,759
engine

198
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:10,440
um only brought up

199
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,479
sites in which forty percent of them

200
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:13,800
included accurate prescription

201
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:17,580
information for hormones and then one

202
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,639
2021 study analyze 29 mobile apps and

203
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,580
found the only

204
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:26,580
28 actually cited medical literature so

205
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:30,300
again this is just a handful of studies

206
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:30,960
um

207
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,000
I have to say I've been looking for a

208
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,719
long time at this literature and um this

209
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,339
is very much how excuse it very much

210
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:40,380
skews towards lower quality so this

211
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:42,240
isn't a challenge of like imbalance

212
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,919
right now or representation this is

213
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:44,760
really

214
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,800
um very much the picture

215
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,260
okay so with that background in mind

216
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,880
I'll head into the aims of what our

217
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,580
project was trying to do and is trying

218
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:55,560
to do

219
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,080
so this is a report that we're working

220
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,480
on it's not an academic publication it's

221
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,820
a report in the form of a set of case

222
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:06,000
studies on three different topics of

223
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,820
gendered Health misinformation one is

224
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:11,519
pregnancy and infant care the second is

225
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,920
gender affirming care and the third is

226
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,920
abortion so the first game is to

227
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,080
consolidate literature and examples on

228
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,700
specific topics of gendered Health

229
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,860
misinformation online

230
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:25,920
the second aim is to highlight the

231
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,360
urgency of gendered Health

232
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,399
misinformation online

233
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:31,260
and then the third aim that should say

234
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:33,120
three is to make clear the relevance of

235
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,279
gendered Health misinformation online to

236
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:38,760
a range of stakeholders including you so

237
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,920
I'm so happy that you're hearing me

238
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,080
speak

239
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,160
um now I'm going to turn to our

240
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,600
methodology to give you a better sense

241
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,140
of how we actually did this so we first

242
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:51,839
began with five topic areas that we

243
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:56,100
selected based on one severity of the

244
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,019
level of this information online based

245
00:09:58,019 --> 00:09:59,940
on our own expertise and the second was

246
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,860
the potential for health risks and the

247
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:05,220
third was cultural relevance

248
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,980
um next we searched for misinformation

249
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:10,800
related to those topics across Facebook

250
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,440
Instagram Reddit Tech talk and Twitter

251
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,899
using sets of live keyword lists that

252
00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:18,899
were updated over the research period

253
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:20,820
um and then based on preliminary

254
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,700
findings we narrowed the case study list

255
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:27,060
down to three

256
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:27,839
um

257
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,540
to sorry where am I yeah to three topics

258
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:32,220
as you can see in point three there that

259
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:34,019
captured a range of gendered Health

260
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:36,360
misinformation topics and had strong

261
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,060
scientific bases and this allowed us to

262
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:41,279
carry out deeper Dives which was the

263
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,800
goal number four step four after

264
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,260
solidifying the topics those three

265
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:48,779
topics we divided each case into three

266
00:10:48,779 --> 00:10:50,640
subtopics so it's a little bit of like

267
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,100
topic Inception

268
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,260
um and then we sourced four to eight

269
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,779
examples of misinformation on each of

270
00:10:57,779 --> 00:11:01,440
those subtopics finally we wrote first

271
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,079
the background for each topic including

272
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,000
information about online search patterns

273
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,519
about the topic common misinfo threads

274
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:10,500
in the health health impacts of this

275
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:14,220
information and then secondly we wrote

276
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:16,620
the scientific explanation of why the

277
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,540
examples presented are false and

278
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,160
misleading

279
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,000
Okay so you know maybe maybe the methods

280
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,320
weren't so simple in the end even though

281
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,640
I said we'd go through them quickly but

282
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,440
hopefully you followed along this is the

283
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,720
fun part findings

284
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,279
um so again just keep in mind this this

285
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:34,260
was not an academic study this is based

286
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,459
on

287
00:11:35,459 --> 00:11:37,440
um the goal of wanting to dive deeper

288
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,660
into these topics and to get a sense of

289
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,760
what kinds of Trends are searching using

290
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,160
mixed methods and also more of a

291
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,720
qualitative approach

292
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,399
so

293
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:51,240
first is pregnancy and infant care and

294
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,399
we divided

295
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:54,000
um

296
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,339
that topic as I mentioned into three

297
00:11:56,339 --> 00:11:58,980
subtopics which were one prenatal Health

298
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:01,260
two labor and delivery and three

299
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:04,320
postpartum and infant health

300
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,540
this is the tldr

301
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:09,360
um because I only have 25 minutes or so

302
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,700
and I'm already about halfway through it

303
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:15,120
I'm gonna try and keep it short

304
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,940
um but this is really the Crux of what

305
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:20,160
you should come away with for this topic

306
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,440
so the first is that most information

307
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,200
about pregnancy and infant care online

308
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,440
is low quality but most people consuming

309
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,320
the information don't realize this as

310
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,600
it's presented as objective so it's

311
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,399
deceiving sometimes intentionally

312
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:38,519
sometimes unintentionally the second is

313
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:40,440
that online users often receive the

314
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,540
majority of the blame for pregnancy and

315
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:44,519
infant care misinformation which we saw

316
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:47,399
online on search engine sorry on search

317
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:49,260
platforms and search engines themselves

318
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,800
in the media and also in the literature

319
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:55,500
however the problem as we understand it

320
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,839
really stems from the top with social

321
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:59,700
media companies who aren't moderating

322
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:00,980
gendered Health misinformation

323
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,540
effectively and with the help of public

324
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:05,820
health professionals girls who are not

325
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:08,880
communicating accessibly so that's a

326
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,779
call into my Public Health Community

327
00:13:12,779 --> 00:13:15,360
um the third is the advertisements that

328
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,519
show up on pregnancy apps search engines

329
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,560
and social media platforms can be really

330
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,120
difficult to differentiate from

331
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,820
objective information that's not being

332
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,920
presented for profit

333
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,980
and then lastly there is a difference

334
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:31,980
between misinformation and shaming but

335
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:35,220
the two can very much overlap so those

336
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:39,420
are the tldrs on pregnancy and infant

337
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,220
care and now we're going to go into some

338
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,260
of the common narratives so for prenatal

339
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:46,440
care we focused on supplements

340
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,360
um and specifically folic acid and these

341
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,279
were some of the common narratives that

342
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:54,240
I came across uh folic acid is toxic and

343
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,820
bad for you that was a big one folic

344
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:59,940
acid is bad for babies and causes asthma

345
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:03,000
another really common narrative

346
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,339
um also you need methylated folate for

347
00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:07,440
pregnancy instead of folic acid and if

348
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,660
you are listening to me going what the

349
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,880
hell are you talking about that's fine

350
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,920
because this is a very Niche topic and

351
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,180
that was one of the goals of this

352
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:18,240
exercise was to find these Health topics

353
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,800
that had a lot of misinformation

354
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,200
surrounding it in ways that people

355
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,760
aren't really registering and

356
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,040
researching at a high level to get a

357
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,660
better sense of what's out there and

358
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:29,760
what's actually pulling people into the

359
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,459
world of medical misinformation or

360
00:14:32,459 --> 00:14:35,459
hesitancy or misunderstanding

361
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:38,519
um for bettering content moderation and

362
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:40,279
also bettering research and intervention

363
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:43,560
efforts so now I will

364
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,360
um go through these other common

365
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,399
narratives and circle back to folic acid

366
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:50,160
to give a little more uh explanation so

367
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,660
these are the common narratives for our

368
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:55,019
labor and delivery section which I

369
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:57,540
focused on C-sections some of those

370
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:59,940
misinformation narratives included only

371
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:02,399
rich people have C-sections you can't

372
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,959
have a vaginal birth after a previous

373
00:15:03,959 --> 00:15:06,600
C-section false and C-sections are

374
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:10,019
necessary and shameful also false

375
00:15:10,019 --> 00:15:12,540
and then our postpartum and infant

376
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,579
health section was focused on

377
00:15:14,579 --> 00:15:16,680
breastfeeding and some of the common

378
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:19,800
narratives included it's better to make

379
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,320
your own formula very false formula

380
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,320
feeding is carcinogenic nope and baby

381
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,180
formula is not tested for instant

382
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:29,760
infants and isn't safe for infants also

383
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,620
not true I'm sure many of you were

384
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:33,000
formula fed I definitely had some

385
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,360
formula feeding too

386
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,779
so I'm going to gloss over those last

387
00:15:39,779 --> 00:15:41,699
two sections that I mentioned just

388
00:15:41,699 --> 00:15:43,620
because it's a lot of content and I want

389
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:45,540
to get through as much as possible and

390
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:48,000
I'm just going to narrow in on this

391
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,040
folic acid topic

392
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,660
um also because it was probably the most

393
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,880
confusing and you're like let's go back

394
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,160
to that and figure out what that is no

395
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,160
worries so Foley is a general term used

396
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,380
to describe many different forms of

397
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:04,620
vitamin B9 it's found naturally in foods

398
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:07,260
like leafy greens and like beans you're

399
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:09,420
probably eating it all the time and not

400
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:11,579
necessarily realizing it unless maybe

401
00:16:11,579 --> 00:16:14,040
you are a doctor or a public health

402
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:17,760
researcher folic acid is a synthetic

403
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,339
form of folate so it's not what you're

404
00:16:20,339 --> 00:16:23,579
going to find in Your Greens essentially

405
00:16:23,579 --> 00:16:25,680
um and folic acid intake during

406
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,260
pregnancy significantly decreases the

407
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:30,180
risk of having a baby with birth defects

408
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:32,820
of the brain the spine or the spinal

409
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:33,800
cord

410
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,540
and we took typically refer to these as

411
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:40,680
neural tube defects or nteds and folic

412
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,899
acid is actually the only type of folate

413
00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:44,459
that has been shown in studies to help

414
00:16:44,459 --> 00:16:46,740
prevent birth defects such as spin of

415
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:49,620
the spine of the Spina Bifida wow

416
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,839
haven't said that one out loud in a long

417
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:52,800
time

418
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,139
um so as you can see folic acid is

419
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:57,779
really important it's been fortified in

420
00:16:57,779 --> 00:16:59,519
our Foods our foods are fortified with

421
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,079
folic acid to make sure that folks get

422
00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:04,679
enough of it a lot of people are folic

423
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:07,439
acid deficient in the U.S including

424
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:09,839
people of reproductive age who are able

425
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,000
to get pregnant so this is a big issue

426
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,559
and yet

427
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:17,040
there is a ton of misinformation around

428
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:20,459
folic acid online which is so wild and

429
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:21,780
so mind-blowing

430
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:24,359
um and is a really pervasive problem

431
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:27,119
that is negatively or at least likely

432
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:29,640
negatively impacting folks who are

433
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,679
pregnant or looking to get pregnant so

434
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:33,720
these are just a few examples someone

435
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,059
asks are prenatal vitamins okay because

436
00:17:36,059 --> 00:17:40,140
there's folic in them in this uh Dr

437
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:43,679
Janine says not in my opinion

438
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,840
um

439
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:49,020
another example says

440
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,640
um

441
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,260
well you can't watch the video but

442
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:53,760
essentially she's saying folic acid is

443
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,080
not what you think you should avoid

444
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,580
folic acid and look for methylated

445
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:59,760
folate methyl folate or folenic acid

446
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,980
calcium folate

447
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:05,100
um also not good this is not good

448
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,539
um and then the one on the far right is

449
00:18:06,539 --> 00:18:08,400
very similar folic acid is bad for you

450
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,500
methylfolate is the way to go take a

451
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,580
listen

452
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:13,919
um so all of these maybe seem innocuous

453
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:16,919
but they're actually creating uh

454
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:19,200
a coordinated

455
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,140
and pervasive narrative about the harms

456
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:25,440
of folic acid online that have the

457
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,880
potential to actually lead to health

458
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,679
outcomes because behavioral research

459
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:32,520
shows that information online can impact

460
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,039
Behavior including when it comes to

461
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:38,160
health so this is one of the significant

462
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,840
narratives and significant challenges

463
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,880
that I found when conducting This

464
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,860
research and which I find extremely

465
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:46,860
concerning and if you are a parent out

466
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:49,559
there who gave birth then

467
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:51,720
hopefully you have an idea of how

468
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,660
potentially dangerous this is

469
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,700
okay so next we're going to go to gender

470
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,640
affirming care and our three subtopic

471
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,280
areas here were gender affirming hormone

472
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,919
therapy puberty blockers and gender

473
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:07,620
dysphoria let's get into it

474
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:10,080
so again tldr

475
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,299
gender affirming care has been shown to

476
00:19:12,299 --> 00:19:14,400
reduce the risk of depression

477
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,100
lower the risk of suicidal ideation and

478
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,799
suicide attempts lower rates of smoking

479
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:23,640
and improve overall mental health and as

480
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,100
background gender affirming care is a

481
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:29,820
type of care that individuals use to

482
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:31,620
align themselves align their physical

483
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:34,320
bodies with their gender identity this

484
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:38,039
could be in the way someone dresses this

485
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:40,140
could be through speech therapy this

486
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:42,419
could be through hormones or this could

487
00:19:42,419 --> 00:19:45,900
be through surgery among other a mother

488
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:48,360
among other care possibilities like talk

489
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,220
therapy

490
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:52,799
um mistreatment of trans and non-binary

491
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:55,080
people in the medical system deep-seated

492
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,480
Health disparities pervasive transphobia

493
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:00,000
cultural cisgenderism and the clear

494
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,220
benefits of gender affirming care all

495
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,000
make

496
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,100
searching the internet for information

497
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:08,039
about trans health and gender affirming

498
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:10,440
care in particular more common

499
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,600
and then also gender affirming care

500
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,000
misinformation can stem first from

501
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,440
malicious attempts to spread

502
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,000
disinformation

503
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,039
especially transphobic disinformation

504
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:22,799
which helps to normalize myths that then

505
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:24,960
circulate as misinformation

506
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,820
so we really noticed a strong connection

507
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:29,820
between the dis and this info here

508
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:33,480
are the common narratives for gender

509
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,880
forming home hormone therapy we focused

510
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:38,039
on masculinizing hormone therapy these

511
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:39,840
are some of the common narratives one is

512
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,520
that testosterone makes you aggressive

513
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,340
not true is a blanket statement another

514
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,900
is that all changes that come from

515
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,580
masculinizing hormone therapy are

516
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,740
permanent or will have permanent

517
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:51,419
negative changes like early onset

518
00:20:51,419 --> 00:20:54,380
menopause not true

519
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,520
um these are some common narratives

520
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,320
about puberty blockers which is our

521
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,760
second topic this is also going to be

522
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,500
the one I focus on so we'll come back to

523
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,960
this but first I'll just read these one

524
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,120
is that the health impacts of puberty

525
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:08,760
blockers are dangerous not true as a

526
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,919
blanket statement the changes brought on

527
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:13,679
by puberty blockers are irreversible not

528
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:16,380
true and children will likely grow out

529
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:18,480
of this phase making puberty blockers

530
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,500
irresponsible not backed by science

531
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,840
we'll come back to that but last I just

532
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,039
want to share the common narratives

533
00:21:26,039 --> 00:21:28,559
around gender dysphoria one is that

534
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:30,419
gender dysphoria is a part of puberty

535
00:21:30,419 --> 00:21:31,860
that kids will naturally move on from

536
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:34,260
very similar to the last one I read not

537
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,720
evidenced by science uh a second is that

538
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,340
gender dysphoria is linked to autism

539
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:40,380
spectrum disorder in girls who then go

540
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:42,600
on to detransition there's a lot in this

541
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,799
claim

542
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:46,020
um but essentially science does not back

543
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:48,120
up this link especially as it's worded

544
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,559
here and especially as it's spread

545
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:51,539
online and then the third is that gender

546
00:21:51,539 --> 00:21:53,760
dysphoria is really a different mental

547
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,260
health problem like for instance

548
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:57,780
borderline personality disorder bipolar

549
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:59,580
disorder that's all that comes up a lot

550
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:00,539
too

551
00:22:00,539 --> 00:22:02,520
so all of these are really really really

552
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:05,700
problematic and I have to say that this

553
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,919
topic gender affirming care was

554
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:11,280
absolutely the hardest one for me to

555
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,740
conduct research on I felt pretty good

556
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:16,020
about the other ones but I I felt a lot

557
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,880
of secondary trauma researching this

558
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,559
topic because

559
00:22:19,559 --> 00:22:22,679
on the one side I was seeing a bunch of

560
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:24,840
really angry mostly adults being

561
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:28,919
extraordinarily transphobic online and

562
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:31,260
then on the other hand I was seeing a

563
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:33,539
lot of trans teens

564
00:22:33,539 --> 00:22:35,520
also online

565
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,679
um really struggling and expressing a

566
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:39,960
lot of um challenges with their mental

567
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,940
health with their bodies with dysphoria

568
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:44,700
and it was extremely devastating and

569
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,919
gave me a glimpse into the kinds of

570
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:49,260
adverse Health outcomes both physical

571
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:53,159
and mental that are possibly stemming

572
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:56,460
from these misinformation Threads Online

573
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:57,960
so with that we're going to dive into

574
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:01,260
puberty blockers as our case example

575
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:03,299
um puberty blockers just by way of

576
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:05,220
background are a class of drugs that

577
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:07,440
suppress sex hormones like estrogen and

578
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,179
testosterone and stock changes from

579
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:11,640
puberty they also work to treat other

580
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,679
conditions like prostate cancer uterine

581
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:16,919
fibroids menopause this is very notable

582
00:23:16,919 --> 00:23:18,059
because

583
00:23:18,059 --> 00:23:20,039
hormone replacement therapy was actually

584
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:23,700
developed for CIS folks so something to

585
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:24,780
keep in mind

586
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,760
um puberty blockers have been used for a

587
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,559
range of conditions for a number of

588
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,480
decades so we have a very decent

589
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,039
Baseline understanding of safety and

590
00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:33,840
efficacy

591
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,820
um there are a few minor side effects of

592
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:37,620
puberty blockers like headache and

593
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:40,500
weight change as well as a few less

594
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,299
common more severe side effects that are

595
00:23:42,299 --> 00:23:44,220
still being researched but believed

596
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:45,900
right now to be short-term so the big

597
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,600
one here is bone density loss research

598
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,460
shows that puberty blockers can lead to

599
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:52,559
significant mental health benefits in

600
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:54,900
transgender Youth and all major medical

601
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,360
associations in the US oppose Banning

602
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,640
puberty blockers so that's what we need

603
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,039
to know about puberty blockers

604
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:04,200
essentially they're really good for

605
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:07,020
folks who are questioning their gender

606
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:09,720
identity as kids and aren't known to

607
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:13,080
have long-term Health farms and yet

608
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:16,140
there is an unbelievable amount of

609
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:18,240
puberty blocker misinformation online

610
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,600
across platforms here's a few of them

611
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,380
um

612
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:24,360
I won't read them all in depth partly

613
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,679
because they're very upsetting partly

614
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:27,240
because it would take me a long time but

615
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,940
for instance Marcy Bowers admitted most

616
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:33,059
blocked kids will never

617
00:24:33,059 --> 00:24:35,820
well never zero oh we'll never have any

618
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:37,980
sexual sensation at all some even lose

619
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:41,700
urinary sensation presumably if you

620
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,320
choose to change your gender find by me

621
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,059
but stop trying to groom kids stop

622
00:24:45,059 --> 00:24:46,919
saying it's okay to use puberty blockers

623
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:48,659
let a kid grow before they ruin their

624
00:24:48,659 --> 00:24:52,440
bodies permanently leave kids alone

625
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,539
this one says to stop using New Age

626
00:24:54,539 --> 00:24:57,120
gender studies which is absolutely not a

627
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,520
science to justify irreversible gender

628
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,400
transitions for teenagers

629
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,820
this is not normal science etc etc and

630
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:07,679
it really goes on from there and you can

631
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:08,880
start to see how they miss and

632
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,620
disinformation are are very much

633
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:12,600
overlapping here and informing one

634
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,380
another

635
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:16,380
um this is extremely upsetting because

636
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:20,100
not only is this type of rhetoric really

637
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:23,039
harmful for the cultural narrative in

638
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:24,539
general and societal narratives about

639
00:25:24,539 --> 00:25:27,080
puberty blockers as well as individual

640
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:30,000
youth who are considering using puberty

641
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,980
blockers are on puberty blockers have

642
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:33,960
friends on puberty blockers because it's

643
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:36,539
so stigmatizing and shaming to hear this

644
00:25:36,539 --> 00:25:38,240
type of language but it could also lead

645
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,940
to somebody not seeking this type of

646
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:44,460
care if it's needed which could yield

647
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,440
adverse Health outcomes and it's also

648
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,880
the same type of rhetoric that we're

649
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,380
seeing in a bunch of anti-trans

650
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:52,679
legislation especially around the US

651
00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:56,940
um so there's really really significant

652
00:25:56,940 --> 00:26:00,000
potential harms to health here

653
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,340
um but platforms need to be held viable

654
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:05,400
for and take very seriously

655
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:09,539
okay and then lastly is abortion

656
00:26:09,539 --> 00:26:11,159
um which I'm sure you've all been

657
00:26:11,159 --> 00:26:13,260
thinking about in some way or another

658
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:15,360
from the three subtopics we broke these

659
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:18,360
this topic into is abortion procedures

660
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:22,220
abortion risks and abortion stigma

661
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:26,100
so again you've probably caught on to my

662
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:28,620
my little flow here the tldr is first

663
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,900
when abortion is prohibited or

664
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,940
restricted research shows that

665
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:35,159
information searching online increases

666
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:37,919
so we've seen that a lot in the past

667
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:40,140
months with the leak first and then the

668
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,880
Dobbs decision itself and there's data

669
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,620
to back that up

670
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:45,299
um much of the content that individuals

671
00:26:45,299 --> 00:26:48,240
find online about abortion is actually

672
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,000
not reliable

673
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,279
um there is really good evidence that

674
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:54,299
shows

675
00:26:54,299 --> 00:26:56,760
um not only social media posts but also

676
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:59,220
ads and search engine results are really

677
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:02,820
Rife with abortion misinformation often

678
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:05,400
backed by anti-abortion groups who are

679
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,740
also funding anti-abortion political

680
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:09,960
figures

681
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,880
um a third finding is that getting

682
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,220
quality abortion and pro online is most

683
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,779
important for individuals already

684
00:27:15,779 --> 00:27:17,279
marginalized when it comes to their

685
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:19,679
reproduction this isn't necessarily a

686
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:22,440
new or surprising finding but was backed

687
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,659
up when we looked into the data that

688
00:27:24,659 --> 00:27:27,120
showed how folks from marginalized

689
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,100
states and countries are the ones who

690
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,380
are most likely to be searching for this

691
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:34,500
type of health information and who might

692
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,539
not have anywhere else to get it so by

693
00:27:36,539 --> 00:27:38,940
actually confirming who the folks were

694
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:40,559
who are most likely to be searching for

695
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,900
this information online

696
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:45,840
um as well as seeing all of the threads

697
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,720
of misinformation about abortion

698
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:51,299
circulating online it really highlighted

699
00:27:51,299 --> 00:27:53,520
for us how significant this need is for

700
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:56,520
folks who are already marginalized

701
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,500
um and then finally inaccurate

702
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,779
information narratives

703
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:03,059
um about abortion can actually affect

704
00:28:03,059 --> 00:28:04,559
someone's ability to make a decision

705
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:07,020
about abortion so if somebody for

706
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,580
instance is redirected to a Crisis

707
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:10,200
Pregnancy Center site and doesn't

708
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,419
realize it this has happened to me I

709
00:28:12,419 --> 00:28:16,740
spent a lot of my days like rummaging

710
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:18,720
around Crisis Pregnancy Center sites

711
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,159
checking out the narratives that they're

712
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:21,960
using seeing what tactics they're

713
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:25,140
they're employing and recently I was on

714
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,279
one that

715
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:28,620
was so well

716
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:31,380
um that was so well veiled as an

717
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:32,820
objective site but it took me about

718
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:34,440
three minutes three to five minutes to

719
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,240
realize that it was actually

720
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,980
um a biased and political Crisis

721
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:41,460
Pregnancy Center and uh if somebody came

722
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:43,200
across that if I was looking to seek an

723
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,640
abortion for instance I might have made

724
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,880
an appointment gone in and then you know

725
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,380
especially if I was in a state with a

726
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:50,940
restricted abortion access it would have

727
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:53,039
taken me maybe one week maybe two weeks

728
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:54,779
longer to get an abortion maybe I would

729
00:28:54,779 --> 00:28:56,400
have felt a lot of Shame and guilt after

730
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,620
going there and waited even longer to

731
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:00,360
get an abortion or not gotten one at all

732
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:03,659
and Andor had uh

733
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:05,820
um a negative outcome from childbirth if

734
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:07,620
I went on to go to terms so these are

735
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:11,220
very real Health outcomes

736
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,240
um

737
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,419
and for the common narratives

738
00:29:15,419 --> 00:29:17,100
um here's some common narratives about

739
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,020
medication abortion which we focused on

740
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:21,360
here this is the one that will also dive

741
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,220
deeper into so keep this in mind we'll

742
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:25,260
come back to it the first narrative is

743
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:27,659
that there's an abortion pill abortion

744
00:29:27,659 --> 00:29:29,720
reversal pill that is safe and effective

745
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,980
not true

746
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:35,039
um abortion pills are unsafe also not

747
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:36,779
true they're actually safer than

748
00:29:36,779 --> 00:29:39,240
surgical abortion which brings us to our

749
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,980
third one chemical abortion is riskier

750
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,840
than surgical abortion chemical abortion

751
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:45,240
is a really scary way of talking about

752
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,399
medication abortion that is intended to

753
00:29:47,399 --> 00:29:49,380
fear monger and then a fourth is that

754
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:50,940
taking herbs is a safe and effective

755
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:53,279
abortion method unfortunately also not

756
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:55,140
true

757
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:57,419
um and then abortion risks common

758
00:29:57,419 --> 00:29:59,399
narratives late term abortions are never

759
00:29:59,399 --> 00:30:01,380
safe that's not necessarily true they

760
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:03,059
can actually be incredibly life-saving

761
00:30:03,059 --> 00:30:06,720
abortion causes infertility nope not

762
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,299
evidence and abortion is never medically

763
00:30:09,299 --> 00:30:12,360
Justified also not true

764
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:16,100
um and then stigma this pertains to

765
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:19,140
misinformation about stigma so for

766
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:20,279
instance

767
00:30:20,279 --> 00:30:22,080
um like your partner will know that you

768
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,820
have an abortion or providers won't want

769
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:24,899
to care for you if you've had an

770
00:30:24,899 --> 00:30:27,480
abortion as well as misinformation that

771
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:31,559
is by nature stigmatizing so one is the

772
00:30:31,559 --> 00:30:33,419
unborn babies are aborted so that their

773
00:30:33,419 --> 00:30:35,820
organs and cells can be harvested this

774
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:37,380
is clearly intended to make somebody

775
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:39,899
feel like what they're doing is really

776
00:30:39,899 --> 00:30:42,600
wrong and evil and scary

777
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,159
um you will be suicidal if you've got an

778
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:45,899
abortion so that's both like making

779
00:30:45,899 --> 00:30:47,820
somebody already feel isolated as well

780
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:50,220
as scared and abortion causes fetal pain

781
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:52,679
which is also not true and is intended

782
00:30:52,679 --> 00:30:56,640
to induce guilt shame and stigma

783
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,320
um among those who are considering

784
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,539
abortion or have had abortion

785
00:31:00,539 --> 00:31:02,399
so now we're going to dive into abortion

786
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:04,860
procedures specifically

787
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:06,240
um the claim that there's an abortion

788
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,640
reversal pill so

789
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:12,419
abortion pill reversal is uh basically

790
00:31:12,419 --> 00:31:13,799
just a really large amount of

791
00:31:13,799 --> 00:31:15,600
progesterone taken by a pregnant person

792
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,940
after the first dose of medical medic

793
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:19,679
yeah medical abortion or medication

794
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:21,899
abortion which is called mifipristone

795
00:31:21,899 --> 00:31:24,600
and before the second set of medication

796
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:27,419
which is misoprostol so it's kind of

797
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:29,580
this progesterone is like sandwiched in

798
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:32,100
between if a person and misoprostol it's

799
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:32,940
like

800
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:35,220
right in the middle

801
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:36,059
um

802
00:31:36,059 --> 00:31:38,880
but turns out the safety of abortion

803
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,919
pill reversal is completely unproven and

804
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:43,320
with stops in clinical trials due to

805
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,840
dangerous hemorrhaging so among the 10

806
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,940
patients involved in the study before

807
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:50,220
the study was cut off three of the

808
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:52,440
patients experienced severe hemorrhaging

809
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,179
requiring ambulance support to a

810
00:31:54,179 --> 00:31:57,600
hospital and the trial was stopped

811
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,559
um so that's you know

812
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:03,179
very very concerning and it's especially

813
00:32:03,179 --> 00:32:06,720
concerning that there is a significant

814
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,720
amount of misinformation online about

815
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:12,960
abortion reversal pills this is one of

816
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,580
the most common narratives that we found

817
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:17,820
about abortion across platforms so you

818
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:19,500
can see a bunch of those narratives here

819
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,299
I won't read into all of them but

820
00:32:21,299 --> 00:32:22,919
they're essentially success stories

821
00:32:22,919 --> 00:32:24,679
about

822
00:32:24,679 --> 00:32:29,159
abortion reversal using progesterone

823
00:32:29,159 --> 00:32:31,399
um and are typically stemming from

824
00:32:31,399 --> 00:32:35,100
anti-abortion groups and websites the

825
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:36,779
other scary thing that goes back to the

826
00:32:36,779 --> 00:32:38,279
connection between

827
00:32:38,279 --> 00:32:41,279
U.S laws and bills and the rhetoric

828
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:43,080
that's spreading online is that six

829
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:45,659
states in the U.S actually require that

830
00:32:45,659 --> 00:32:47,220
you share with patients that abortion

831
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:49,020
reversal medication is an option after

832
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:50,700
the first set of pills have been taken

833
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,799
which is

834
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:55,620
really I can't emphasize how disturbing

835
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:56,760
that is

836
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:59,279
um because there is one study that

837
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:00,899
analyzed this

838
00:33:00,899 --> 00:33:02,279
um this

839
00:33:02,279 --> 00:33:04,740
abortion pill reversal and it was

840
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:06,720
stopped because of safety concerns so

841
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,240
the deprioritization of people's bodies

842
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:12,299
and reproductive autonomy here is really

843
00:33:12,299 --> 00:33:14,820
scary and it's very much being fueled by

844
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:17,100
the misinformation that's being allowed

845
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:19,200
to run rampant online and the platforms

846
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,059
are actually profiting off of I'm not

847
00:33:21,059 --> 00:33:22,919
going to get deep into it right now but

848
00:33:22,919 --> 00:33:26,940
essentially a lot of ads on search

849
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:29,940
engines and social media platforms are

850
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:32,700
about abortion pill reversal and

851
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:35,460
um are essentially funding these

852
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:38,220
internet companies so

853
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:40,740
it's a problem all right I'm not gonna

854
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:42,659
I'm way over time so I'm not going to

855
00:33:42,659 --> 00:33:44,159
dive into this too much but I just want

856
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:46,220
to note that we have some fourth family

857
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:49,260
supplementary Quant data I really wanted

858
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:51,240
to understand from a quantitative

859
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:54,860
perspective how a portion misinformation

860
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:58,559
changed after the leak and after the

861
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:00,600
decision we know that searches in

862
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:01,980
general increase we know that there's

863
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:03,779
been a lot of misinformation online but

864
00:34:03,779 --> 00:34:06,120
there really haven't been many attempts

865
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,219
to quantify what that looks like and

866
00:34:08,219 --> 00:34:11,219
what that means so we're pulling

867
00:34:11,219 --> 00:34:14,520
um we're retroactively pulling data from

868
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:18,780
the Twitter API and are analyzing

869
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:19,440
um

870
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,239
I'm sorry my computer just said

871
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:24,239
something weird and are analyzing the

872
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:27,060
um the tweets by random sampling to see

873
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:29,639
what volume of misinformation there was

874
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:31,260
about abortion before the leak and after

875
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:32,639
the leak and before the decision and

876
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:35,820
after the decision so stay tuned

877
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:38,879
um okay so in summary quality gendered

878
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:42,179
health information online matters deeply

879
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:43,800
people with marginalized gender

880
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,540
identities are at risk of encountering

881
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:47,879
substandard Health content online health

882
00:34:47,879 --> 00:34:49,800
information online can have impacts on

883
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:52,440
behavior and including health behavior

884
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,480
health information can shape narratives

885
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,639
and social norms so even if there isn't

886
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:58,920
even if one person isn't being directly

887
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:01,740
hurt in one moment by one post it's the

888
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:05,460
type of normalcy that's created around

889
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:08,640
specific falsities that we're allowing

890
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,440
to run ramp but online that ultimately

891
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:13,680
impact behavior and health

892
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:14,820
um and then finally health information

893
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:16,700
is most important for those most

894
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:18,839
marginalized and should be urgently

895
00:35:18,839 --> 00:35:21,300
prioritized by platforms without

896
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:22,920
Equitable and high quality health

897
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,599
information for those with marginalized

898
00:35:24,599 --> 00:35:26,820
gender identities we risk worsening our

899
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:28,980
crisis of Health inequity particularly

900
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:31,500
for those most at risk there's a lot of

901
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,839

human rights and so much more so I hope

906
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,619
that this gives you a little bit of a

907
00:35:46,619 --> 00:35:48,420
sense of the types of narratives that

908
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:50,579
are out there I know we really did like

909
00:35:50,579 --> 00:35:52,500
a Russian doll situation of unpacking

910
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,180
those topics

911
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:57,240
um but the full set of case studies the

912
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:00,119
full report will be published in about

913
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:02,040
two weeks so I do hope that you'll go

914
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,599
check it out and read it I have a whole

915
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:05,700
guideline in the intro for how different

916
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:09,720
stakeholders can use the report and I

917
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:12,240
deeply deeply hope and believe that this

918
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,980
will lead to more more sustainable

919
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:17,220
change on the platform ends for taking

920
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:19,079
accountability for gendered health

921
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:21,540
misinformation and that women trans

922
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:23,280
people and non-binary people will have

923
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,320
safer spaces to access health content

924
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,839
online moving forward thank you so much

925
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:31,040
and happy deathcon
