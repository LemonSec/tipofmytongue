1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:04,480
thanks so much for coming today i am dr

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:06,799
caroline or bueno i'm

3
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:10,960
a postdoctoral research associate at uh

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,040
the university of maryland's applied

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,280
research laboratory for intelligence and

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,680
security and i will be presenting today

7
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,240
along with my colleague reiner washburn

8
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,680
who is also at the university of

9
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,240
maryland in our start program

10
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,240
we're very excited to talk to you today

11
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,320
about a topic that has taken center

12
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,439
stage

13
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,238
since 2016 and particularly during the

14
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:34,320
coronavirus pandemic

15
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,239
and that topic is the information

16
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,120
environment and specifically the role of

17
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,920
supply and demand factors

18
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,079
first i'll start out by introducing the

19
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:46,719
concept of data deficits

20
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,600
which arise when the supply of credible

21
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,800
information

22
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,960
can't keep up with the demand for it

23
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,360
which creates an information environment

24
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,520
that can be easily exploited by bad

25
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,600
actors

26
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,920
as we've seen throughout the pandemic

27
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,920
crises are breeding grounds for missing

28
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,360
disinformation

29
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,040
and data deficits exploit that

30
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,640
vulnerability

31
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,119
however by studying data deficits we can

32
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:12,960
expose hidden patterns and reveal

33
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,799
insights to help us better understand

34
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:16,880
our information environment and address

35
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,200
the vulnerabilities that leave us open

36
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,680
to manipulation deception and other

37
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,080
forms of malign influence

38
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,560
in today's discussion we hope to present

39
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,320
a conceptualization

40
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,920
of our information environment that

41
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,320
encourages us all to consider new

42
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,000
approaches to addressing one of the

43
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,400
fundamental challenges of our era

44
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,600
the challenge of mitigating

45
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,360
information-based harms while

46
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,280
maintaining an open and free information

47
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,320
space

48
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,560
so thank you for joining us and here's

49
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,040
my colleague reiner washburn to walk us

50
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,200
through the agenda and then later to

51
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,040
speak to us about some of the research

52
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,280
he's done as part of an internal

53
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,840
research and development project at the

54
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,280
applied research laboratory for

55
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,960
intelligence and security at the

56
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,840
university of maryland

57
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,920
thank you carolyn hi this is render

58
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,240
washburn again thank you echoing what dr

59
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,959
orr said i appreciate here to be able to

60
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,280
present with you today and so for our

61
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,800
agenda

62
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,360
um what dr orr will be presenting on are

63
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,280
what are data deficits when do they

64
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,239
appear

65
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,560
how do we detect them

66
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,080
also along with examples of data

67
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,840
deficits including the coveted vaccine

68
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,680
misinformation such as narratives and

69
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,080
tactics and then wrapping up by looking

70
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,800
ahead past covet where i will go into my

71
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,040
part of the research uh which we look at

72
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,640
in central asia specifically kazakhstan

73
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,879
namely the media landscape how data

74
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,800
deficits and data voids are formed and

75
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,280
why the individuals and population whole

76
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,400
populations migrate towards areas that

77
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,120
form disinformation such as a telegram

78
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,640
ecosystem

79
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,080
we'll be looking at elements of

80
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,400
influence so the tactics and techniques

81
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,319
that we did observe

82
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,480
in the telegram ecosystem

83
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,879
and then we'll also provide a strategy a

84
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,959
strategic observational note

85
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:04,319
which i hope everyone will find

86
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:05,680
interesting along with the rest of her

87
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,040
presentation

88
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,959
so without further ado i'd like to turn

89
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,280
it back over to my colleague dr orr for

90
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,560
her part of the presentation

91
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,800
thank you

92
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,280
so a few weeks ago on twitter um a user

93
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,800
pointed out that

94
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,720
googling the search term

95
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,680
uh

96
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,519
desk ornament

97
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,200
returned some

98
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,040
unexpected results

99
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,680
specifically if you looked at the images

100
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,480
in in the google search results

101
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,959
you would have seen photo after photo of

102
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,760
nazi memorabilia

103
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,200
the incident mirrored a previous

104
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,560
controversy

105
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,720
when searching the phrase

106
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,360
jewish baby stroller on google returned

107
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,720
images

108
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:55,120
of portable ovens a clear example

109
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,040
of hate content

110
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,879
and what exactly is driving these

111
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,720
troubling search trends well they're the

112
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,040
result of something called a data void

113
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,200
which describes a situation in which

114
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,599
search engine queries return little or

115
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:10,080
no relevant information

116
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,159
we've seen these pop up around

117
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,319
disinformation narratives related to a

118
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:17,600
variety of topics ranging from extremism

119
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,079
to the coronavirus pandemic to russia's

120
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,320
war in ukraine and today we're going to

121
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,800
talk about one type of data void called

122
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,560
a data deficit

123
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,320
and explore how this phenomenon

124
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,919
interacts with other features of the

125
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:31,919
information environment to create

126
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:33,680
conditions that are conducive to

127
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,000
misinformation and vulnerable to

128
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,960
exploitation by bad actors

129
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,680
although data deficits are the product

130
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,080
of a lack of credible information they

131
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,759
can also be exacerbated by the

132
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,400
overabundance of irrelevant and low

133
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,639
credibility information

134
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,560
which can create the illusion that

135
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,840
there's a sufficient supply of

136
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,880
information when in fact that

137
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,960
information isn't meeting the needs of

138
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,120
those demanding it and that's what

139
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,800
creates this data deficit

140
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,120
moving along

141
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,360
and looking at why and when

142
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,440
data deficits emerge there are certain

143
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,080
conditions that are very conducive to

144
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,199
this phenomenon specifically when supply

145
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:19,600
fails to keep up with demand and when we

146
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,520
talk about supply here we're talking

147
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,360
about more than just the amount of

148
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,600
information available we're also talking

149
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,199
about whether that information is

150
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:28,720
discoverable

151
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,440
readable interpretable whether it's

152
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,160
relevant and whether it's credible

153
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,560
simply having information out there is

154
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,880
not enough if no one is seeing it or if

155
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,960
nobody can understand it or if nobody

156
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,919
finds it relevant

157
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,840
this often occurs

158
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,919
data deficits often occur when interest

159
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:51,199
in a topic is new and on the rise

160
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,280
so you often see it during periods of

161
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,800
movement

162
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,840
and changes in in interest and search

163
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,240
queries

164
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,800
these may be temporary they actually

165
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,120
often are temporary and transient but

166
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,280
they can also persist for long periods

167
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,160
of time the nature of data deficits is

168
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,639
such that they can often only be

169
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,280
discovered through searching for very

170
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,280
specific keywords so if you're not

171
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,520
searching for those keywords you're not

172
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,120
going to be aware that these data

173
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,039
deficits even exist

174
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,759
which makes them particularly pernicious

175
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,440
because they can exist out there in

176
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,840
darkness for a long time without anybody

177
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,520
even being aware that they're there

178
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,000
they often occur organically they arise

179
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,800
again often just as a product

180
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,400
of these um supply and demand features

181
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,319
but they can also be the result of

182
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,720
deliberate manipulation

183
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,680
and

184
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,560
that's often the case um looking at

185
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,319
disinformation narratives surrounding

186
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,120
extremism that they often are the result

187
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,840
of deliberate campaigns and deliberate

188
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,280
efforts to funnel people into

189
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,400
certain content often for

190
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,000
the purpose of radicalization

191
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,919
low supply specifically occurs when

192
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:13,520
credible information

193
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,479
either

194
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:16,639
isn't available or doesn't exist at all

195
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,880
so that's a condition where

196
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,880
people are showing interest in something

197
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,720
or or um

198
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,479
searching for something that simply

199
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,479
there isn't information about

200
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:27,360
um

201
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,160
when

202
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,639
when that information isn't discoverable

203
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:33,199
or isn't reaching people so it's out

204
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:34,960
there but it's just not getting to

205
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,599
people for some reason

206
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:40,000
or it's in progress or still unfolding

207
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,680
and this was a big thing during the

208
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,000
coronavirus pandemic because we were

209
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,400
still seeing studies underway evidence

210
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,440
was

211
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,120
was not certain yet

212
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,840
that's the nature of science but

213
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,039
in these conditions it creates a problem

214
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:57,759
uh when providers of disinformation are

215
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:00,319
producing uh content regularly and

216
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,879
presenting it is certain and uh on the

217
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,280
other end of things that information

218
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,039
just is is not available to um

219
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,280
to match that

220
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,840
moving along

221
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,919
again

222
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:18,560
these moments of vulnerability so we

223
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,520
looked last at sort of the features that

224
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,240
set the conditions for data deficits

225
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,039
and

226
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:26,160
there are certain moments of

227
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,479
vulnerability that make us particularly

228
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:29,919
susceptible make our information

229
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:32,640
environment particularly susceptible

230
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,519
um

231
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,279
one of those conditions is

232
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:38,320
crisis events again the coronavirus

233
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,559
pandemic is a perfect example of that

234
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,880
crisis events have a lot of features

235
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,959
about them that make our information

236
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,040
environment and the people operating in

237
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,480
it particularly susceptible

238
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,800
to uh all sorts of deception

239
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,360
manipulation disinformation

240
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,120
uh some of these features include things

241
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,720
like uncertainty

242
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,680
fear

243
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,040
um we're all having a shared experience

244
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,880
and and wanting

245
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,640
to understand it wanting to make sense

246
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,080
of what's going on we engage in

247
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,640
something called collective sense making

248
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,600
um and part of that process involves

249
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,839
information seeking

250
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:20,720
um but that sense making process can

251
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,560
also quickly become

252
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,360
conspiracy theorizing we saw that happen

253
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,320
over and over again during the pandemic

254
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,519
um and it can also just result in sort

255
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:32,800
of a

256
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,920
unscientific and unstructured

257
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,279
process of

258
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,680
people sharing ideas which is not

259
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,800
inherently bad but when those ideas clog

260
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,640
out the uh

261
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,320
scientific information that's needed to

262
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,399
protect yourself from a deadly pandemic

263
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,240
that's when it becomes a bad thing i

264
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,920
mean that's where the overabundance of

265
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,399
information becomes a problem in and of

266
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:57,440
itself when that information crowds out

267
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,519
um the potentially life-saving

268
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:00,959
information that people are trying to

269
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:02,959
find

270
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:05,519
another moment of vulnerability

271
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,320
uh are breaking news events so

272
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,440
these could be uh mass shootings are a

273
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,000
prime example of this because they're

274
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,839
often followed by a quite harmful data

275
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:19,920
deficits that can be exploited in

276
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,079
extremely harmful ways

277
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,680
um

278
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,200
and the reason this is a moment of

279
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,360
vulnerability is because of that rapid

280
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,120
surge in interest and information

281
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,160
seeking

282
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,680
and just the complete inability to match

283
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,120
that rapid increase in interest with a a

284
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,000
proper supply of credible information

285
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,720
um and another moment of vulnerability

286
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,920
is um

287
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,839
when when bad actors purposefully

288
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:48,880
manipulate search trends and um a good

289
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,360
place to see some examples of this would

290
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,760
be 4chan in the aftermath of a mass

291
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,160
shooting

292
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,279
moving right along

293
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,839
and how do we detect data deficits so

294
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:03,920
how do we find these how do we look for

295
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:04,959
them

296
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:07,120
um there are a variety of tools and

297
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,320
techniques there's no one way to do it

298
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,920
and there are actually some really cool

299
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:12,800
things

300
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,240
being developed and that have been

301
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,560
developed during the pandemic

302
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,480
to look at these to look at data

303
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,200
deficits and start to

304
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,079
have

305
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:25,200
reliable and and validated ways to

306
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,040
measure them

307
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,959
some of the tools and techniques that i

308
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:31,519
have personally used and i've done a

309
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:32,880
fair bit of

310
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,519
work in this area i haven't always

311
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,440
labeled uh

312
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,200
the this phenomenon as as a data deficit

313
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,000
that was a term that um a microsoft

314
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,040
researcher came up with in in 2018 and

315
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,200
um since then it's kind of been

316
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,760
reformulated by uh data and society

317
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,320
first draft news they've all contributed

318
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,360
to

319
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,200
the current conceptualization of what a

320
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,079
data deficit is

321
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:04,959
in my own research some of the the tools

322
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:07,440
and techniques that i have used um

323
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,720
include real-time monitoring of trends

324
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,279
that's one of the

325
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:14,880
big opportunities

326
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,279
uh in researching data deficits is it is

327
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,760
real time and it gives you the

328
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,079
opportunity to actually

329
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:24,560
detect and potentially prevent uh

330
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,480
information-based harms before they

331
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,360
before they harm anyone um and real-time

332
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,200
monitoring can include things like

333
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,360
monitoring google trends trending topics

334
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,160
and hashtags to look at the demand side

335
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,560
um looking at things like

336
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,880
the number of fact checks and and the

337
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,639
characteristics of fact checks that are

338
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,680
out there i'm looking at trends in

339
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,000
scientific publications

340
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,600
um

341
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,839
using media monitoring tools all of

342
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,440
those would be looking at the supply

343
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,120
side of things

344
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,760
um also the long-term studies of trends

345
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,279
in the information ecosystem so i'm i'm

346
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:03,120
a proponent here of mixed methods

347
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,240
research i think um there's some some

348
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,800
really cool ways here to track

349
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,279
narratives and to really look at

350
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,040
over time you know what does it look

351
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,200
like what do people uh what kinds of

352
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,360
search terms are people using you know

353
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,120
in the aftermath of a mass shooting or

354
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,800
what kinds of search terms do people use

355
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,040
when we have a terrorist attack or

356
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,000
um

357
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:24,800
when

358
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,079
there's a

359
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:28,800
new emerging infectious disease and

360
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,399
understanding these things and starting

361
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:33,440
to to be able to identify patterns can

362
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,760
help us then when it happens again to be

363
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,079
prepared for it and to know sort of what

364
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:40,639
it looks like when i when a data deficit

365
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:43,600
is forming and what it looks like

366
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,279
you know when conspiracy theories are

367
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:47,360
forming so it gives us sort of a

368
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,480
signal

369
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,120
that we can use in the future then to uh

370
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,639
to get ahead of it

371
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:56,399
um and then another technique that um

372
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,800
i know i'm not the the only researcher

373
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,920
in this area who does this but um sort

374
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,480
of targeted monitoring of common uh

375
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,279
disinformation origin sites again for 10

376
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,440
is a big one whenever there's a terror

377
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,440
attack or a mass shooting you go to

378
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,600
4chan there's a good chance you can

379
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,160
identify some uh disinformation

380
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,000
campaigns and likely data deficits

381
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,360
before they emerge

382
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,560
uh

383
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,480
moving along

384
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,519
looking specifically this time at social

385
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:29,360
media so um when we're talking about

386
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,760
data deficits they can arise on social

387
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,959
media they can arise on um on search

388
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:37,760
platforms they're not specific to any

389
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,079
any platform um but looking at how we

390
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,600
detect them on social media and what

391
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,120
kind of tools and techniques are

392
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,440
available and again there are tons more

393
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,440
than than what i'm getting into here

394
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,839
these are just some um some of the tools

395
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:52,480
and techniques that i personally find uh

396
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,320
most helpful and and promising

397
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,959
engagement metrics it sounds very simple

398
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:02,320
and it sort of is um but

399
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,360
sometimes credible information exists

400
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,279
but again no one's seeing it or engaging

401
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,600
with it and and that creates a data

402
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,360
deficit even if the information is out

403
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,760
there you know people have to see it and

404
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,079
if they're not seeing it then the demand

405
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:18,800
isn't being met by the supply

406
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,120
so when interest in a topic or keyword

407
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,240
is high

408
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,839
but engagement

409
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,600
in related

410
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,920
posts or tweets is low

411
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,680
this may may indicate a data deficit and

412
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,480
an example of that um

413
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,880
from a study i did a few years ago

414
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,519
looking at uh

415
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,759
posts about ebola on instagram and

416
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:44,399
twitter by um three leading health

417
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:45,600
organizations the world health

418
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,600
organization cdc and doctors without

419
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,720
borders

420
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,480
um and looking at how they addressed

421
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,079
uh ebola-related risks on on social

422
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:58,160
media

423
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,680
we found

424
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,560
um

425
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,720
basically number one that these major

426
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,519
health organizations were largely absent

427
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:07,600
in spaces where misinformation was

428
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,120
present they

429
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,639
it wasn't that they were ignoring the

430
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:12,320
issue of misinformation but they weren't

431
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,600
going to the places where the

432
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,079
misinformation was and of course that

433
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:17,839
means that the people who were in those

434
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:20,240
spaces weren't seeing the information

435
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,399
from the credible sources

436
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,000
um we found that these health

437
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,320
organizations weren't also weren't fully

438
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,560
utilizing image-based platforms and this

439
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,399
is an important finding because they're

440
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:33,839
still not fully utilizing a lot of what

441
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:36,160
i would sort of call alternative social

442
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,000
media platforms so you know reiner is

443
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,560
going to talk to us about telegram

444
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,920
that's one that a lot of health

445
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,839
organizations and scientific

446
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:45,360
organizations

447
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,399
are completely absent from there's no

448
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:50,639
presence whatsoever and it just creates

449
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:54,000
this very again a large vacuum that is

450
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,920
going to be filled by someone and

451
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,519
unfortunately we often see it filled by

452
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:59,680
bad actors as a result

453
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,839
all three of these health organizations

454
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:03,839
were posting fact checks and posting

455
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:06,559
relevant information but the engagement

456
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,439
with those posts was extremely low so

457
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:11,599
again that gets back to exactly what i i

458
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,119
just mentioned at the beginning of this

459
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:15,359
slide that's an indicator of the data

460
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:18,319
deficit when in the middle of the ebola

461
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:21,839
uh epidemic of 2014 to 2016 when

462
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:25,520
interest and fear were sky high people

463
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,359
wanted to read about it people wanted

464
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:28,960
information about it

465
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,200
they were putting it out there

466
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,200
but nobody was engaging with it so

467
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,919
something is off there and again

468
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:37,840
i interpret that as a sign of a data

469
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,000
deficit this information for some reason

470
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,799
was not reaching people and one of the

471
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:45,039
reasons was that content wasn't designed

472
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:47,679
to be shared um the content they were

473
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:49,760
putting out was sort of what

474
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,840
what these health organizations thought

475
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,720
was important but that's not necessarily

476
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,400
the same thing

477
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,840
that the public thinks is important

478
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,919
and this allowed for a data deficit to

479
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:03,760
form

480
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:07,919
uh looking next um

481
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:10,480
just another example of

482
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,960
a tool to detect data deficits and this

483
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,000
is a tool that um i again i have used

484
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,039
and think it's it's quite uh

485
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:20,880
quite a cool uh

486
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,880
development during the again this was

487
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,799
developed during the coronavirus

488
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:27,520
pandemic um

489
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,520
these uh researchers developed a

490
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,120
taxonomy

491
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,440
to look at global public conversations

492
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,919
related to carbon 19 they basically came

493
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:38,960
up with five categories of coronavirus

494
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,240
discussions and 35 subcategories

495
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,440
um and then they they used uh they used

496
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,080
these categories to aggregate data uh on

497
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,400
a weekly basis they looked at things

498
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,320
like volume and velocity and the

499
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,080
presence of questions

500
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,960
basically to detect signals of

501
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,840
information voids and data deficits uh

502
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,400
and areas with potential for confusion

503
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,240
or where mists and disinformation may

504
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,919
thrive

505
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:08,799
um and they use that as sort of an early

506
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:11,760
warning system

507
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,600
and created if

508
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,320
i

509
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,160
i would highly recommend checking this

510
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,440
out um

511
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,400
this

512
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,000
toolbox i put the link in this slide

513
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,160
and you can go you can create a

514
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,240
dashboard you can do your own tracking

515
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,600
you can look by country you can look um

516
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,400
by by date by volume and basically

517
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,200
create your own system to monitor this

518
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,240
little piece of the coronavirus uh

519
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,360
epidemic as they're calling it um and it

520
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,840
kind of gives you an idea

521
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,559
of how it can be done in other areas too

522
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,840
and that's

523
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,120
that's one of the things that um

524
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,600
i hope you'll take away from this today

525
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,280
is that you know a lot of this has been

526
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,679
developed in response to cobid

527
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:00,000
but there are applications of this to a

528
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,880
ton of other topics um and i think there

529
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,440
are some really promising avenues um

530
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,799
moving ahead

531
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:07,520
so

532
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:11,918
next moving to the next slide um

533
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,640
again specifically about covid

534
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,240
um

535
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,720
some of the again i have used some of

536
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,000
these tools to track

537
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,679
various narratives data deficits

538
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:28,240
exploited

539
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,799
exploited data deficits conspiracy

540
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,000
theories and some of the key

541
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,320
vaccine-related narratives where i was

542
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:38,640
able to find identifiable data deficits

543
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,280
included narratives around things like

544
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,240
the claim that natural immunity

545
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,440
is better

546
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,880
than

547
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,559
that natural immunity through diet and

548
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:49,679
exercise is better than getting

549
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:51,039
vaccinated

550
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:53,679
um and if you look i kind of put a

551
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:55,840
little note by the side of it

552
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,000
how the data deficit was created so in

553
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,480
this case the credible information

554
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,880
wasn't available or discoverable and

555
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,280
wasn't reaching people

556
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,840
in the case of of this claim that

557
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,679
vaccines would sort of be this golden

558
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:12,159
ticket out of the pandemic

559
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:15,280
that was created by supply problems from

560
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,280
still emerging evidence so the evidence

561
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,360
wasn't certain

562
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,440
the disinformation purveyors were

563
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,320
putting out tons and

564
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:28,240
the credible sources couldn't answer it

565
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,039
i did a small project on the fda's

566
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:32,000
approval

567
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,159
a disinformation narrative surrounding

568
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:36,880
the fda's approval of the pfizer vaccine

569
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,880
and a subsequent foia uh request that um

570
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,880
in in that case the problem was really

571
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,320
created by this huge lag time where this

572
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,960
disinformation narrative got set

573
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,360
and the credible information to answer

574
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,600
it didn't come out for

575
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,320
a full month and even then

576
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,200
the information was not in such a way

577
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,600
it was not presented in such a way that

578
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,679
it was interpretable or readable by most

579
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:05,520
of the general public

580
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,039
um and just

581
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:08,880
another example that's not vaccine

582
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,200
related but it's very much cobit related

583
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,159
is the lab leak versus zoonotic origins

584
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:15,360
theory

585
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,440
and the supply problems that created

586
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,400
this data deficit included flag time and

587
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,400
of course still emerging evidence which

588
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,720
we are still seeing issues with today

589
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:32,080
and moving to the next slide um

590
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,200
so related this is sort of the second

591
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,000
piece of this the last slide so the last

592
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,320
slide looked at the key narratives these

593
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,400
are the key tactics that were used to

594
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,960
exploit those data deficits

595
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,440
um in order to promote those misleading

596
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,559
narratives

597
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:51,840
um so these tactics included things

598
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:52,840
uh

599
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:56,320
like capitalizing on on keywords around

600
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,360
specific vaccines specific vaccine

601
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,720
ingredients

602
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,000
um

603
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,240
or alleged ingredients

604
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,640
side effects or alleged side effects and

605
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,480
other very specific

606
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,039
keyword sensitive topics and that's kind

607
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:13,280
of the the important piece here is the

608
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:16,640
various they're keyword sensitive topics

609
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,640
um laundering old and pre-existing

610
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,760
conspiratorial narratives so kind of

611
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,919
taking something that was already there

612
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:26,159
that people might be familiar with and

613
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:28,400
repackaging it in the context of the

614
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,240
cova vaccine

615
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,039
uh document dumps again going back to

616
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:36,559
that that fourier request um around the

617
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:37,600
pfizer

618
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,080
approval by the fda

619
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,360
um

620
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,600
often these conspiratorial narratives

621
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,679
will will involve the release of large

622
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:49,200
data sets or large numbers of documents

623
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,919
and these documents are often

624
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:54,400
disseminated very rapidly and in order

625
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,720
to properly analyze them and actually

626
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,039
present factual reliable information it

627
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:01,840
takes time and unfortunately

628
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,200
in the time

629
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,600
that uh credible sources are doing that

630
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,320
work uh the the

631
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,799
lower credibility sources are pumping

632
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:13,600
out information uh you know sometimes on

633
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,080
an hourly basis and so a lot of bad

634
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,640
information gets out there narrating

635
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,520
false misleading deceptive narratives uh

636
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,799
take hold

637
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:24,000
and

638
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,159
by the time the credible information

639
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,000
gets out there

640
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:28,960
uh

641
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,559
the other narratives have already taken

642
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:33,120
hold and it you know once once they have

643
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,840
taken hold it's very hard uh to disrupt

644
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,520
that

645
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,799
um

646
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:39,760
so that

647
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,919
document dumps um

648
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:43,919
using these deeply interconnected

649
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:47,360
networks the anti-vaxx community on

650
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,440
social media is extremely large and

651
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,679
extremely interconnected and they sort

652
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:53,919
of all play different roles working

653
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:56,720
together to co-create spread and amplify

654
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,760
launder and legitimize

655
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,440
conspiracy theories and other forms of

656
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,960
anti-vaccine myths and disinformation

657
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,039
the use of copycat websites and fake

658
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:09,360
scientific art articles to bolster the

659
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,279
legitimacy of content

660
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:13,760
and boost search result rankings

661
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,400
and the use of emotionally laden images

662
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,320
and videos which is always a favorite of

663
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:21,600
this information campaigns

664
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,840
and

665
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,799
uh closing this out looking beyond covid

666
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:28,799
so we've talked a lot about covid we've

667
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:31,679
talked a lot about the covet vaccine

668
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:33,840
but looking at where else we can apply

669
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,159
this data deficit model which again i

670
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:38,320
think it has some really promising uh

671
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,919
potential

672
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:42,960
and some of the the uh

673
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,919
the promise in this lies in

674
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,159
the way it it encourages sort of a

675
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:50,000
reconceptualization

676
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,679
of how we think of miss and

677
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:53,440
disinformation right now we tend to

678
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,000
think of it as a static concept as you

679
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,720
know identifying misinformation that is

680
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,360
just out there uh just sitting out there

681
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,440
waiting for us to find it

682
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,080
when in reality as i think you've seen

683
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,440
you know through these slides and

684
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,159
possibly through your own work

685
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:12,640
missing disinformation and online

686
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,200
manipulation and influence

687
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,760
are dynamic they're they're not static

688
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,039
they're not just sitting out there

689
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:20,799
waiting for us to find them they're

690
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:23,600
constantly changing they're personalized

691
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,159
they appeal to certain segments of the

692
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:28,960
population they may be there one day and

693
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,799
not the next or they may not be there

694
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:32,880
today and then they're there tomorrow so

695
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,080
it really does require um you know a

696
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,640
constant monitoring and i think if we if

697
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,559
we are still looking at missing

698
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:43,440
disinformation as static concepts

699
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,440
it's really going to be impossible for

700
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,520
us to properly address it

701
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,360
because they're not they're dynamic

702
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,360
they're changing and we need uh you know

703
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,520
we need the tools and techniques that

704
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,039
address that

705
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:57,279
um this data deficit model also

706
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:58,640
encourages us to take an

707
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,960
audience-centered approach so we're

708
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,440
talking about monitoring what people are

709
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,440
actually talking about and asking

710
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,120
questions about and expressing concerns

711
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,440
about not just what you know fact

712
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,279
checkers or reporters or researchers

713
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:13,440
think is important but what the public

714
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,200
thinks is important and that gets back

715
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,120
to that study that i talked about with

716
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,360
ebola you know it's not just what the

717
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,039
world health organization thinks you

718
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:23,600
should know but what is the public

719
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,039
you know what do they want to know what

720
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:26,960
do they think is important if we're not

721
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,960
addressing that somebody else is going

722
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,480
to

723
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,679
um and then also recognizing that menace

724
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:35,840
and disinformation are really inherent

725
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,360
properties of our information

726
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,200
environment they're not foreign

727
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,399
substances they're not being injected

728
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:43,440
and and

729
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,320
um

730
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,679
sneaking in there they are a product

731
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:51,360
of the platforms and the tools and and

732
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,039
the people

733
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:54,960
who are who exist in our information

734
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,799
environment they are native to our

735
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:59,440
information environment and we can't you

736
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,520
know we can't fact check them away we

737
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,559
can't

738
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:05,360
label them away and we can't use use

739
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,440
content moderation to make them

740
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,520
disappear we have to come up with

741
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,080
solutions that involve changing the

742
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,919
conditions of our information

743
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:16,880
environment that make it so conducive to

744
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,120
myths and disinformation

745
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,640
and so for the next piece of this

746
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,480
discussion i'm going to turn it back

747
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,120
over to my colleague reiner washburn

748
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,640
he's going to talk to us about how the

749
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,960
phenomenon of data deficits fits into

750
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,120
the bigger information landscape

751
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,799
alongside other tactics of

752
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:37,039
disinformation influence and deception

753
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:38,399
thank you caroline that was a great

754
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:41,039
intro and great presentation so carrying

755
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:42,720
on where she left off we're going to

756
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,240
look at it from an underground

757
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,240
perspective and in this case as it was

758
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,640
titled in our for our talk about uh

759
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,799
analysis in central asia we're going to

760
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:53,760
be looking specifically at kazakhstan

761
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,000
and just to keep some um

762
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:56,720
some

763
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,919
info points here uh we chose kazakhstan

764
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:01,760
mainly because it represents such a

765
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,760
large portion of the information

766
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,960
landscape generated in central asia

767
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,600
on top of which of its

768
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,600
unique position geopolitically

769
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:15,039
especially between two major players in

770
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:17,520
influence and information operations uh

771
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,200
the people's republic of china and the

772
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,760
russian federation

773
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,399
and so kazakhstan plays a central part

774
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:27,600
of this analysis and so when we look at

775
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,440
kazakhstan we first have to look at and

776
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,720
when we're trying to get into data

777
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,240
deficits and the landscape of

778
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,760
disinformation we have to look at the

779
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,919
media landscape

780
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:38,240
and so when we went into looking at

781
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,960
kazakhstan we compiled through using seo

782
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,039
tools like alexa global engagement uh

783
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:45,279
internet engagement ranking standard

784
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:48,240
which is defunct as of lat this may and

785
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,679
the seam rush

786
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:51,520
product tools we were able to look at

787
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,520
what were the top sites that

788
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,360
those in kazakhstan use but just in

789
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,880
general

790
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,720
from that we were able to winnow down

791
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,640
the news sites that were most frequented

792
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,440
and this included sites like near kz

793
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,799
sputnik which a lot of folks are

794
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:05,919
probably

795
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:08,799
familiar with um the information bureau

796
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:11,120
which is more popular in central asia

797
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,840
but also eastern europe uh kazan form

798
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:17,760
and uh very specific uh to uh southern

799
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,880
uh kazakhstan is tengri news um and of

800
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,279
these areas of these news sites we were

801
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,200
looking at what the concentration of

802
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,279
news was especially in the midst of the

803
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:29,679
pandemic and we were looking around

804
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:31,039
between

805
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:35,600
uh january of 2021 into december 2021

806
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,679
and from there we noticed a large

807
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:40,240
concentration on news regenerated around

808
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,760
covet 19

809
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,000
vaccine rollout within the country

810
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,960
and specifically also the concern of

811
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,840
missing disinformation that was being

812
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,120
generated um

813
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,799
and what was most fascinating is that a

814
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:55,120
lot of these sites were uh

815
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:58,240
not informing the public on

816
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,240
news with regards to vaccines outside

817
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,200
the united states outside of kazakhstan

818
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,640
but more about

819
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,720
what is just going on with covid within

820
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,399
the borders it wasn't necessarily

821
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:09,600
talking about global efforts and

822
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,080
anything so that presented a unique uh

823
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,159
find in my opinion on

824
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:15,279
you know

825
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:16,880
what information is actually being

826
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,880
presented in an official fashion on a

827
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,880
news site um

828
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,799
in this in the country and whatever

829
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:24,559
people are doing for more information if

830
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:26,080
the information they're seeking does not

831
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,440
exist

832
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:31,039
so um when we ran against sort of a wall

833
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:32,720
with regards to how much information we

834
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,919
were gleaning

835
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:36,880
from the news sites we moved towards uh

836
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:40,080
telegram which serves both as the number

837
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,880
one uh in a sense social media platform

838
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,080
but even though it's not technically

839
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,720
social media but it's also again is the

840
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,399
term most people are familiar with like

841
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:50,080
a town square

842
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,880
for many communities in central asia

843
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,640
it's a great way for them to

844
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,120
find news uh discussion points and

845
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,799
rallying around issues that are of

846
00:31:58,799 --> 00:31:59,760
concern

847
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,000
and and again on all these sites that we

848
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,240
saw all of them had official telegram

849
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,159
channels and we were able to link into

850
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:08,240
those channels and then we were to

851
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,080
develop a way to

852
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:13,039
insert the antivax vaccination lexicon

853
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:15,919
to see if any of their platforms

854
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:17,279
in telegram

855
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:19,440
um any of their channels in telegram

856
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,399
were

857
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:22,480
sharing content from

858
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,799
possible misinformation sites or so

859
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:26,159
forth

860
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:28,480
and so when we did that we did actually

861
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,640
were able to search and pivot and log

862
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,960
many channels telegram channels that

863
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,840
promoted anti-vax and covic skepticism

864
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,760
and of that we were able to identify and

865
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:41,600
monitor roughly 22 channels and groups

866
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,440
which i mean again if we had more time

867
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,840
we would love to have gone further but

868
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,080
that is a significant fine

869
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,679
considering the scope of our research

870
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:50,880
project

871
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,000
so

872
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,840
in the media landscape we were seeing a

873
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,840
dearth of information about the global

874
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,960
pandemic just what was mostly only local

875
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,720
and then furthermore we were able to

876
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,760
pivot into telegram which was sort of it

877
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,000
is this town square for information to

878
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,320
be for the public to consume on but it

879
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,120
also

880
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,360
moves people into areas of

881
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,760
disinformation into the fringe and where

882
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,679
and this is where telegram as a platform

883
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:17,760
thrives as a space for disinformation to

884
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,679
grow

885
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:21,519
so when we are looking at the telegram

886
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:23,519
ecosystem as you can see these are the

887
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:25,120
avatars that we pulled out and just

888
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,480
trying to give you an understanding of

889
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:29,039
like there are quite a few out there um

890
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:31,120
and these are our mix of both kazak

891
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,360
speaking and russian speaking channels

892
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:36,960
um that we have we're able to identify

893
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,679
and in particular through this um in the

894
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:42,000
telegram ecosystem we were able to

895
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,679
identify what we call elements of

896
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:45,760
influence or um another more

897
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:49,360
officialized for official firm term is

898
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,880
operations in the information

899
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:54,320
environment right so in particular how

900
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,919
we mapped it out from what we were

901
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:58,000
seeing uh there were two kind of core

902
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
tactics right uh from what we were

903
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
looking at at the operational at the

904
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,559
operator perspectives on the red side uh

905
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:06,799
the network development function our

906
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:09,839
tactic and the content creation

907
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:12,560
and so uh under network development

908
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,399
what we notice is that it is the

909
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:16,960
foundation for how they how information

910
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:20,320
operations or influence is established

911
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,239
and the core techniques covered

912
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:24,639
through this network development is

913
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:26,800
being able to stand up or link to a

914
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,480
narrative infrastructure so other

915
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,679
websites

916
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:32,000
again copycat websites as caroline

917
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,440
mentioned earlier

918
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,239
social media pages and so forth but also

919
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:39,040
cultivating and manufacturing smes as

920
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,960
subject matter experts stock puppet

921
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,520
accounts and so forth and influencers

922
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:47,119
into being witting and unwinding agents

923
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:48,480
and an additional technique which we

924
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,119
will not be able to cover in this uh

925
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:52,960
presentation was how operators

926
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,119
themselves obfuscated their

927
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:56,079
uh

928
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:58,400
ability uh obfuscated themselves from

929
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,640
being tracked further um

930
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,000
but if anyone would like to learn more

931
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,599
i'd be more than happy to discuss that

932
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:05,839
in greater detail offline

933
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:07,760
uh and content creation which is the

934
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,599
other tactic we observed this is mostly

935
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:11,680
about the implementation of uh

936
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,520
implementing concurrently or immediately

937
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,839
after network

938
00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:17,599
development and the true aim of it is to

939
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:20,320
target the population of the operation

940
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,200
uh with so they can um to get the target

941
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,280
population to generate their own content

942
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,599
you know to make it organic so that it's

943
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:29,280
self-sustaining of the narrative so that

944
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,440
way the operator doesn't necessarily

945
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,800
have to

946
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,880
constantly put up guardrails and guide

947
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,800
the target the target then is able to

948
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,359
self-sustain and and we have seen that

949
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:41,839
multiple in multiple instances both in

950
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:43,440
the united states in western europe and

951
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,599
elsewhere but and so this is not just

952
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:48,079
unique to kazakhstan um or in the

953
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:50,640
telegram space but it is a global

954
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,000
phenomenon

955
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,920
and so the core techniques covered here

956
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,560
are the amplification of the conspiracy

957
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,640
theories by their agents so winning and

958
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:01,440
unwinning agents and also providing or

959
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,839
dropping evidence

960
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:05,359
so but there's also an additional

961
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:06,960
technique which again we won't be able

962
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,720
to cover but it is where we saw the

963
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,560
distortion of reality through what we

964
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:14,240
call image images means emojis and gifs

965
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,000
and it's a very interesting piece again

966
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,200
if you would like to talk more about it

967
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:20,480
offline i'd be more than happy to

968
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,720
so under network development while we

969
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,480
were looking through telegram and

970
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,480
through this tactic the goal is to

971
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,119
attract and sustain target population

972
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:30,160
engagement

973
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,599
so this is through when you're creating

974
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:34,240
websites social media groups and pages

975
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,400
and but also connecting to the existing

976
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,560
infrastructure developed by unaffiliated

977
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,760
entities

978
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,359
so that it engages with the target

979
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:43,119
narrative

980
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:45,119
and so in this area

981
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:46,720
what we can see is that scope and

982
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,040
duration does greatly influence the

983
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,040
scale of the narrative infrastructure

984
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,680
managed by the operator so in many cases

985
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,920
uh we were noticing a few telegram

986
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,160
channels a lot of the media that they

987
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,000
were sharing that the operators the

988
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,040
admins themselves uh were posting were

989
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,880
actually from it seemed unaffiliated

990
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,040
websites outside of kazakhstan most

991
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,920
importantly in places like uh ukraine

992
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,480
azerbaijan poland

993
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,720
and a few other places in eastern europe

994
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,240
but also in central asia and the

995
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,879
caucuses

996
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:22,000
another important aspect to this uh to

997
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,520
this development and network development

998
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,880
is of the creating of the network

999
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,880
infrastructure is linkage to the other

1000
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,040
infrastructure so that again it can

1001
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,520
minimize resource commitments cost and

1002
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,440
preventing operational security breaches

1003
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,119
because this allows the operator to

1004
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:37,200
minimize how much exposure they have

1005
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,040
which then feeds into the tactic which

1006
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,720
we won't go over of you know office

1007
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,560
getting the operator

1008
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,599
so

1009
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:46,160
and then in doing so and through this uh

1010
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,160
research that we looked at on telegram

1011
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,760
we did discover a number of links to

1012
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:53,040
disinformation websites as i mentioned

1013
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,440
and so what was most telling is that of

1014
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,839
here we saw not just telegram as the hub

1015
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:00,160
but you know we had to look at it as

1016
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,400
there are many spokes involved so and

1017
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,160
ones that are most familiar to us are

1018
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:07,359
like instagram twitter uh youtube was in

1019
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:09,920
very particular uh involved but also

1020
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,760
medium so traditional blog posts and

1021
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,520
sites where people could do long form

1022
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,680
written essays and so forth and that was

1023
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:18,880
shared extensively

1024
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,880
so the other technique under network

1025
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,040
development oh sorry

1026
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,200
the other development here is this is an

1027
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,760
example of what we saw and this was a uh

1028
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,839
ukrainian website uh which was called

1029
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:32,480
 pandemic and you know unfortunately

1030
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,920
we're not able to give a full

1031
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,079
investigative look over for this but we

1032
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:38,560
did know some aspects that this site was

1033
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,800
not generated in ukraine but it was

1034
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,640
generated in russia

1035
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,800
and this was shared extensively across

1036
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,880
at least half a dozen

1037
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,480
um

1038
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,640
the pen of the telegram channels that we

1039
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,320
were monitoring

1040
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,079
so this is just one example of those

1041
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:56,400
fake sites of narrative infrastructure

1042
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,240
that either the operators developed or

1043
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:01,839
they latched on to for linkage

1044
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,839
so the other technique in network

1045
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:06,240
development is to create or co-op agents

1046
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,480
both winning and unwinding

1047
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,640
so here operators do set out to

1048
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,720
cultivate and recruit these agents being

1049
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,720
winning or unwinning and the three most

1050
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,240
common agents at least from what we

1051
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,160
noticed here were traditional

1052
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:21,119
celebrities so actors musicians athletes

1053
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:24,079
um social media influencers and then uh

1054
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:25,599
tried and true the subject matter

1055
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:28,960
experts so to speak now in the in the

1056
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,960
case of the first two agents so

1057
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,880
traditional celebrities and social media

1058
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,720
influencers

1059
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,240
these two types of agents were

1060
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,480
especially useful for boosterism you

1061
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:41,040
know having developing the repetition of

1062
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,880
the narrative and again they don't have

1063
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,720
to be an expert on it they just have to

1064
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,079
be able to

1065
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:48,160
help lend the credibility by promoting

1066
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,400
it themselves repeatedly and boosted and

1067
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,680
boosting it up that's why we call it

1068
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,560
boosterism whereas smees are most

1069
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,800
valuable for narrative laundering so

1070
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,800
they will publish articles they will

1071
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,359
appear in media both online infringe and

1072
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:03,520
in some cases

1073
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,760
they will move into more traditional

1074
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,800
media outlets more credible outlets

1075
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,560
and so that's what we noticed especially

1076
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:13,440
with the smes and narrative laundering

1077
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,319
where

1078
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:16,240
we saw a couple of them moving not from

1079
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:20,960
just a page media but to reputable um

1080
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:24,160
credible websites and news agencies in

1081
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,079
eastern europe

1082
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:26,800
so

1083
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,720
and this is not just a tactic we have

1084
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:31,280
seen here but elsewhere and again it's

1085
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,480
some people in the audience you're

1086
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,560
probably most familiar with in secondary

1087
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,599
infection

1088
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:37,920
which was presented by grafica a few

1089
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,839
years ago

1090
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:42,400
so in our case we found one instance of

1091
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,880
smee and this was a better bonner a

1092
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,520
german lawyer and a kovic skeptic

1093
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,160
her materials are widely circulated in

1094
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,720
the monitor telegram channels we saw but

1095
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,319
the most interesting aspect to it was

1096
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:57,280
that the administrators provided russian

1097
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,280
and cosmic translations to her videos

1098
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:02,640
posts and articles um it and this in

1099
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:05,200
most cases her book here translations of

1100
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,040
chapters were provided and they were

1101
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,720
getting in the tens of thousands of

1102
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:11,200
views and downloads

1103
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,800
so it is very interesting to see how it

1104
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,440
plays out in terms of smes and how these

1105
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:18,400
agents work in promoting the narrative

1106
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,040
and again as they kind of lend a certain

1107
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,200
legitimacy for the narrative that

1108
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,560
they're trying to promote so in this

1109
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:27,280
case it's you know the coronavirus maybe

1110
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,920
is not necessarily uh zeutonic it could

1111
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,400
be a bioweapon we don't know how

1112
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,480
infectious it is and so forth

1113
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,560
and in this case beta bonner was one of

1114
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,240
these smees that has been used

1115
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,920
extensively and

1116
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,440
shared throughout the channels that we

1117
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:44,000
monitored

1118
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:46,000
so the other technique that we observed

1119
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,760
was content creation

1120
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,599
and the technique here the first one is

1121
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:52,560
how we amplified those conspiracies by

1122
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:53,680
agents

1123
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:54,400
so

1124
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,160
when they narrativize when an operator

1125
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,160
and enterprise is an issue such as covet

1126
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:01,280
19 and vaccinations conspiracy theories

1127
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,359
latch on to a narrative you know there

1128
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:06,480
is the covet 19th theory of it you know

1129
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:09,040
that it's a bio weapon and so forth

1130
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:11,200
but conspiracy theories that are may not

1131
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,040
necessarily be

1132
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:15,599
uh related to it specifically we'll

1133
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:17,040
latch on to it and this is something

1134
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,960
that we're developing it's sort of as a

1135
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:21,119
term as uh nested narratives so these

1136
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:22,960
sub-narratives that are amplified or

1137
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:26,240
amplify the main narrative theme

1138
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:29,040
right so for instance if it's covet is a

1139
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,839
bioweapon then the bioweapon itself is

1140
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:34,720
developed for the united states military

1141
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,319
you know or the military can't be

1142
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:37,920
trusted so you get into these whole

1143
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:40,480
different aspects of an ideology of

1144
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:43,960
theory so from those that are um

1145
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,920
anti-medicine to those that are

1146
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,359
anti-government so you see the

1147
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:48,880
narratives and the sub-narratives or

1148
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,880
music on this narratives

1149
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:53,760
reinforcing each other

1150
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,760
so the conspiratorial nested narratives

1151
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:58,560
can be subsumed into the main narrative

1152
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,240
depending on a variety of factors but

1153
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:02,240
the most successful ones are when

1154
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:04,640
operators uh accept them without little

1155
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,960
resistance so it's uh in the case of

1156
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,160
like covid

1157
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,440
when

1158
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,359
it's introduced that covet is a bio

1159
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:13,520
weapon or so forth

1160
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:14,960
and those that are saying well this is

1161
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,160
developed by the government or the

1162
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:18,079
united states government

1163
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:20,400
that will be then run its course um

1164
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,640
operators will accept that as a part of

1165
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,319
the greater narrative and allow that to

1166
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:26,319
run its course within the ecosystem they

1167
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:28,400
are developing and that again helps with

1168
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,960
the sustainability of the organic

1169
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:33,119
nature of the ecosystem they're trying

1170
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:35,119
to build

1171
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:37,920
but in either case operators can achieve

1172
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:40,240
uh positive gains by amplifying these

1173
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:42,800
conspiracy theories especially when uh

1174
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:45,839
with impactful use of the smes

1175
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:46,720
and so

1176
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,560
what we see in both these cases in these

1177
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:50,800
cases like on this left post right here

1178
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,720
uh the western standard which is a

1179
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:54,480
libertarian-leaning canadian media

1180
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,640
organization that has an extensive

1181
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:59,200
history of propaganda pseudoscience and

1182
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:02,480
mystic information um they interviewed

1183
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:06,800
smee of some sort uh dr uh

1184
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,480
a former doctor practicing in british

1185
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:12,240
columbia on uh pfizer and in particular

1186
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:14,319
they brought out a recent pfizer report

1187
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:17,520
an authenticated fisa report

1188
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:20,480
that was released by the cdc

1189
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:23,200
and they go uh step by step through

1190
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:26,160
uh what the pfizer report says and then

1191
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:27,520
starts uh

1192
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:29,680
uh

1193
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:30,800
breaking down where there's

1194
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,480
inconsistency or vagueness and

1195
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:34,000
terminology

1196
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,480
and in doing so this creates a way of

1197
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:39,040
discrediting what pfizer is about if

1198
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:42,400
it's safe is it not safe um

1199
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,720
should you actually get it and if there

1200
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:46,960
are alternatives and then in this case

1201
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:50,000
uh what uh dr nagazi was saying is that

1202
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,319
he you should not take pfizer but

1203
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:54,319
instead use other remedies such as your

1204
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:56,240
vermectin which he actually was

1205
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:57,440
promoting

1206
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,839
um and so in this case in this post in

1207
00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:02,000
particular had around two twenty two

1208
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,319
thousand views by americans in a

1209
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:06,960
specific kazakhstan channel uh but it

1210
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:09,280
should be noted that uh outside of our

1211
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:11,359
telegram channel we did note uh dr

1212
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:14,000
nagasaki he was barred from practicing

1213
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,400
medicine uh prior to this interview

1214
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:19,680
because he was promoting irvinectin

1215
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:20,720
so

1216
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:22,720
but that was not covered at all during

1217
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:26,078
the actual interview itself

1218
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,319
so in the next content aspect to it on

1219
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:30,560
the right post this was a virtual

1220
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,880
roundtable discussion again this is

1221
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:36,160
um supported quote-unquote smes

1222
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:39,200
where he had a german virologist and or

1223
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,440
non-virologist uh stephan lanka who

1224
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:43,599
asserts that viruses don't exist

1225
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:46,560
daniel browse who's a podcaster and then

1226
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:49,119
he's also his moniker's podcaster oh or

1227
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:50,720
pals cancer zero

1228
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:53,200
and kate sugak uh who's the host of the

1229
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,599
program who's also a russian but she is

1230
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:58,160
actually extensively used in

1231
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:02,079
social media both on instagram twitter

1232
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:04,720
vconcata and telegram for hosting

1233
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:07,760
content disinformation content

1234
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,520
with regards to

1235
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:13,839
copen19 and vaccines specifically pfizer

1236
00:46:13,839 --> 00:46:15,920
and similar to the previous post

1237
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:18,560
uh this purported panel aimed to amplify

1238
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:21,839
why vaccines are government tools right

1239
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:23,760
um and how they restrict things like

1240
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:26,400
natural freedom and how the kova 19

1241
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,960
pandemic really isn't a pandemic so here

1242
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:30,960
we were actually we're noticing a number

1243
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:32,480
of actual

1244
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:34,319
conspiracy theories latching onto the

1245
00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:36,000
copen 19 theory that it's a fake

1246
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,560
pandemic that it was cooked up by the

1247
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:39,599
government

1248
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:41,040
and that it's actually

1249
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:43,839
a political tool to restrict uh

1250
00:46:43,839 --> 00:46:47,520
natural law or so on and so forth

1251
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:49,680
and so when we collected data at this

1252
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:51,520
time the video had been viewed around

1253
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:54,160
some 17 000 times in the course of

1254
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:57,520
roughly one month so um in considering

1255
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:00,319
it was just in a few several channels

1256
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:04,720
that's quite a high amount of um view

1257
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:07,440
and so then the other portion of uh

1258
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:09,760
content creation the other technique is

1259
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:12,720
providing or say dropping evidence

1260
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:14,960
so evidence drops

1261
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:16,960
amplify narratives as well as serve as

1262
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:18,880
sort of in a way a defensive role to

1263
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:21,200
buttress or strengthen support for those

1264
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:22,480
narratives

1265
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:25,440
so operators will drop or fabricate

1266
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:27,359
evidence and both have been proven

1267
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:29,599
effective in other campaigns such as the

1268
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:32,800
dnc email drops from 2016 uh by the

1269
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:35,440
guccifer 2.0 entity which it found out

1270
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:37,839
to be you know this was an overall

1271
00:47:37,839 --> 00:47:40,880
russian influence operation

1272
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:42,960
uh but in doing so these were real

1273
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:45,280
artifacts real evidence that were used

1274
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,040
to paint a certain narrative or to

1275
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:48,960
reinforce the narrative

1276
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:50,480
and this is new and this is not

1277
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:52,000
different from what we've witnessed in

1278
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,720
our in uh research in kazakhstan so in

1279
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:57,040
the ecosystem in particular from what we

1280
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:59,200
found is that admins or prominent

1281
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:00,880
members in those channels would often

1282
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:04,240
drop evidence in one or two ways so a

1283
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:07,359
sensational breaking news post so

1284
00:48:07,359 --> 00:48:09,280
uh the red alert here's that's just

1285
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:12,079
coming out and oftentimes it would be a

1286
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:15,280
fake news report or it would be uh from

1287
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:18,160
a credible source but then rewritten or

1288
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:20,319
stylized in a way that made it sound

1289
00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:22,720
differently so it'd be saying new york

1290
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:25,280
times says kyber uh

1291
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:27,440
pfizer vaccine causes blood clots like j

1292
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:29,920
and j right when in fact it's saying

1293
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:32,559
pfizer blood clots i mean blood clots in

1294
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:36,160
jnj vaccine are a concern for those that

1295
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:38,640
have taken other vaccines like pfizer so

1296
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:40,960
they would manipulate what the breaking

1297
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:42,559
news might actually be

1298
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:45,599
um and then make it so that it sounds

1299
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:48,000
more egregious or more damaging than

1300
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,680
what it is

1301
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:51,520
and then the other portion is posts with

1302
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:54,240
links to multiple uh to various websites

1303
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:57,040
so ranging from alternative medicine to

1304
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:59,520
science and general fringe to all tech

1305
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:00,960
platforms

1306
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:02,480
and as you can see in the example over

1307
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:05,119
here the posted links they are to

1308
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:06,960
alleged science alleged scientific

1309
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:08,480
journals that garnered

1310
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:10,559
significant discussion across all the

1311
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:13,280
channels and groups that we monitored

1312
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:15,119
and in particular there was one and

1313
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:17,680
again as you see from the first uh image

1314
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:19,839
this is one of those

1315
00:49:19,839 --> 00:49:22,559
data dumps or one of those uh drops of

1316
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:25,520
evidence where again the admin actually

1317
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:26,800
posted some

1318
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:28,880
50 different links to different articles

1319
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:30,640
and sites and so forth

1320
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:32,640
about um

1321
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:34,559
issues that they that need to be

1322
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:36,880
addressed with regards to is the vaccine

1323
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:38,640
safe or should we be concerned about

1324
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:41,359
covet and in this one this was through

1325
00:49:41,359 --> 00:49:43,440
the supposed international journal of

1326
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:45,839
vaccine theory practice and research

1327
00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:48,000
which uh upon our research and looking

1328
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,160
it over does not appear appear to be a

1329
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:51,359
legitimate

1330
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:53,680
scientific journal

1331
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:56,400
and so that is again of concern and this

1332
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:58,480
one again had a rate of roughly at least

1333
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:01,760
the the mass link post had around uh 12

1334
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:05,040
000 views or nearly 13 000 views

1335
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:07,279
um

1336
00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:09,440
and so wrapping up with what we have uh

1337
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:10,800
we wanted to know

1338
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:13,119
again within kazakhstan there is this

1339
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:17,119
also unique aspect to when you are

1340
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:20,240
viewing information from an ecosystem

1341
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:22,079
and one of the things that we noticed

1342
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:24,480
was there is this narrative mitigation

1343
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:28,400
so to speak on china's official vaccines

1344
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,800
throughout these

1345
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:32,480
throughout the ecosystem the channels we

1346
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:34,079
noticed that a lot of it was geared

1347
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:36,800
towards vaccine hesitancy vaccines are

1348
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:39,520
unsafe and i would say on par obviously

1349
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:40,960
very negative

1350
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:42,960
but chinese vaccines but mainly

1351
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:44,400
cyanobacks

1352
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,960
were rarely discussed or even mentioned

1353
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:49,040
even though it was the first approved

1354
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:51,040
foreign vaccine in kazakhstan that we

1355
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:54,000
know of alongside kazakhstan's own

1356
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,559
vaccine cosback

1357
00:50:56,559 --> 00:50:58,319
and yet it's very interesting to see

1358
00:50:58,319 --> 00:50:59,920
that

1359
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:02,079
the first foreign vaccine to be

1360
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:04,559
introduced there is not at all mentioned

1361
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:06,160
if if anything

1362
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:06,960
so

1363
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:09,520
we calculated through uh the reference

1364
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:12,960
counts of all the vaccines of prominence

1365
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:15,839
so around around just over 9 000

1366
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:18,480
references uh chinese developed vaccines

1367
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:20,160
compromised just

1368
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:21,200
roughly

1369
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:24,280
percent of total references so around

1370
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:27,200
246 and that's sino farm and center back

1371
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:29,839
collectively uh whereas russia's uh

1372
00:51:29,839 --> 00:51:32,160
sputnik v generated the moat the second

1373
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:35,359
most uh where and then the us takes the

1374
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:38,079
the most it's 69

1375
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:39,760
and in particular what we were looking

1376
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:42,240
at uh from a reference per month

1377
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:44,400
standpoint sign of acts just referenced

1378
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:47,280
a route got around 22 references per

1379
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:49,599
month compared to pfizer which had over

1380
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:51,359
451

1381
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:53,520
references and it's interesting because

1382
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:55,359
even though you had an instance of like

1383
00:51:55,359 --> 00:51:57,920
j day with the bloodcots issue that only

1384
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:00,640
averaged out to about 84 references per

1385
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:02,400
month but this was later in the year too

1386
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:05,520
when we were able to count these

1387
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:07,040
so when we look at the strategic

1388
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:10,240
observation continued uh the the vaccine

1389
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:14,000
reference in total we can see that

1390
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,280
china's

1391
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:16,960
uh

1392
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:19,200
sign vaccine farm incentive

1393
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:21,839
barely registered even against the

1394
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:24,559
the the sputnik v or even the uh the

1395
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:26,960
lowest of the uh the

1396
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:29,280
uh us based vaccines like johnson and

1397
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:30,480
johnson

1398
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,240
so it's very interesting to see that

1399
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:34,319
this led us more credence to possibly

1400
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:37,200
seeing that this was russian operators

1401
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:39,440
trying to mitigate any negative impact

1402
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:43,119
from the chinese given the amount of

1403
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:45,760
interest of chinese investment chinese

1404
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:49,440
influence in kazakhstan itself um so

1405
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:51,520
we don't know definitively this is

1406
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:53,280
something that we would love to go and

1407
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:55,200
further investigate

1408
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:57,200
uh but on the tail but on the whole is

1409
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:59,680
what we saw it it was very unique to see

1410
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:02,640
uh chinese vaccines not being

1411
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:05,200
um routinely um

1412
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:07,359
mentioned or even a negative or a

1413
00:53:07,359 --> 00:53:09,119
positive light

1414
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:11,280
and so this is just a tidbit of what we

1415
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:13,599
were trying to uh view within these

1416
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:15,520
telegrams within a lot of time for our

1417
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:17,200
research

1418
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:18,000
so

1419
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:22,160
and with that i'd like to wrap up our um

1420
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:23,839
our lightning talk which has gone quite

1421
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:25,280
long but i'm so thankful that we were

1422
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:26,640
able to do this

1423
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:28,720
i'd like to also thank my

1424
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:31,359
colleague dr carolyn or bueno and how

1425
00:53:31,359 --> 00:53:34,480
much uh i enjoyed working with this

1426
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:35,760
so if you have any questions and

1427
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:37,359
comments please direct it to either of

1428
00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:39,119
us or both of us we'd be more than happy

1429
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:40,960
to talk and see more about where we

1430
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:42,640
could possibly collaborate or if you had

1431
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:44,400
