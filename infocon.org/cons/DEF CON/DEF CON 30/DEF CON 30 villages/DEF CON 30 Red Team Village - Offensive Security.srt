00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,480
team village i'm wes and i'm joined with

00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:09,679
omar here and today we're going to talk

5
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:12,400
to tj null from offensive security

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,240
so off uh tj can you tell us a little

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,320
bit about what offensive security does

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,400
yeah absolutely so offense security is

9
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,880
an education provider um many of you

10
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,320
have probably known that we specialize

11
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,920
in providing a lot of educational

12
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,599
training courses and one of our big

13
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:27,599
missions is that with our training

14
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:29,439
courses we want to be able to empower

15
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:31,119
the world to help fight against cyber

16
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:32,880
threats and a lot of the material that

17
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,040
we have in our courses really explains

18
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,880
about those type of topics and hopefully

19
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,040
to help people who are interested in the

20
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,559
cyber security world can be able to

21
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:41,840
learn from our material and become an

22
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,559
actual cyber security professional

23
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:46,399
i know that that's great stuff

24
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:47,920
so tj what would you say is the best

25
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,840
part of offensive security sponsoring

26
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,680
the red team village

27
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,360
i think the big thing about sponsoring

28
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,360
the red team village is that we

29
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,039
appreciate the value from communities

30
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:58,960
and we've always tried to find ways to

31
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,640
give back and help support communities

32
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,359
that meet our core values or you know at

33
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,199
least try to innovate and help you know

34
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:06,640
people who want to get into this field

35
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,159
or learn more about some of the stuff

36
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:09,680
that you know

37
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,880
like such as the red team village you

38
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,240
know they like to teach things or be

39
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,680
able to share ideas so that we all be

40
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,439
able to come together as one and we can

41
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:18,000
foster new ideas together

42
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,600
awesome no and we definitely appreciate

43
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,040
the sponsorship

44
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,880
uh how else is offensive security

45
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,240
involved in like the local kind of

46
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,479
infosec communities

47
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:27,759
so we try

48
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:28,640
to be

49
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,360
very vocal and we try to spread out

50
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,720
where we are of supporting the

51
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,560
communities that are out there

52
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,920
we can either do

53
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,439
you know providing vouchers to help you

54
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,119
know support their efforts if they're

55
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:40,799
running ctfs or if they want to be able

56
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,399
to give out stuff

57
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:44,240
we also help contribute in a lot of open

58
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,759
source projects that we currently have

59
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,200
now and a lot of people from the

60
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,640
community will like to contribute some

61
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,960
back with either making tools either

62
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,200
reporting bugs or even reporting you

63
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,720
know exploits that they see and they've

64
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,399
created as well too so that we can be

65
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:57,439
able to

66
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:00,159
keep a huge we can accumulate

67
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:01,520
a variety of information for the

68
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,920
community be able to see

69
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,880
awesome

70
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,479
now a lot of people that are watching

71
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:07,759
this video

72
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:09,360
are either getting started in cyber

73
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,959
security or shifting their career to

74
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:13,760
cyber security can you give us the top

75
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,160
three recommendations of somebody that

76
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,280
is actually just getting started in

77
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,920
cyber security what should focus on

78
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,520
yeah i can be able to give some advice

79
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,599
about that from my perspective um so the

80
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,440
big three things i try to look at really

81
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,120
kind of revolve around the basics you

82
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:27,920
know

83
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,200
um

84
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,720
basics is meaning like you know getting

85
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,000
to actually put your hands on the

86
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,760
keyboards you know look at some of the

87
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,360
technical things that are out there

88
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,959
understanding what operating systems you

89
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,480
have to work with

90
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,480
knowing how you know systems can

91
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,920
communicate each other over the network

92
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:42,959
and then also getting to have a

93
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,400
programming language under your belt as

94
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,160
well too and just understand the

95
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,400
fundamentals of that but

96
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,480
moving on to something that's more of

97
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,239
you know technical side we also want to

98
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,000
find people who are very passionate in

99
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,319
the field that are very eager to learn

100
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,159
and also that are open-minded to be able

101
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,080
to share information that's out there

102
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,680
right so the community can grow together

103
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,519
or maybe even they can learn from other

104
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,040
people as well in the community what

105
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,680
stuff that they're working on

106
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,959
no thanks for those recommendations

107
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:10,720
those are great uh what are some of the

108
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,239
benefits your team receives

109
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,159
so the benefits that we receive from the

110
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:17,599
community is

111
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,200
what really we just get awareness back

112
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,879
we want to let people know that offset

113
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,280
is here um we are here to help you where

114
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,200
we can try to actually you know get you

115
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,480
to your career and get into the

116
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,400
cybersecurity world and that's really

117
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,560
the big thing that we try to do mostly

118
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,400
with the open source products we have

119
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,159
uh with our offset discord server as

120
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,159
well too where you can communicate with

121
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,560
actual offset employees real time

122
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,760
and also you know to be able to

123
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,040
collaborate and work with them on

124
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,640
projects or ideas that you have that's

125
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,319
really the big thing that

126
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:47,040
we try to look for in the end

127
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,959
now uh just question about you know some

128
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:49,840
of the employees that you mentioned

129
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,200
there at offset so like what kind of

130
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,400
types of roles do you have in your

131
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,920
organization

132
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,680
oh we have a variety of roles at opsec

133
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,760
actually um mostly our big one that we

134
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,200
have is our content team and our labs

135
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,360
team so the labs team will always build

136
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,879
out vulnerable boxes for the

137
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:05,280
environments that they build our content

138
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,879
team is actually pushing out new courses

139
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,040
in the pipeline and also updating some

140
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,159
of the current material that we

141
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:12,000
