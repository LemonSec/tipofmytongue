1
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:11,219
thanks for that great introduction

2
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:13,320
um yeah uh I'm a senior senior research

3
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,820
scientist at sandbox

4
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,079
so

5
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:18,420
um I'm in the quantum Security Group

6
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:21,060
so as a company we do lots and lots of

7
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:22,320
things quantum

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,619
uh simulation optimization

9
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:27,539
um but yeah I'm here today to talk to

10
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:31,099
you about the security aspect of things

11
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,600
um so yeah this whole talk is going to

12
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,820
be about post Quantum cryptography

13
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,399
so I'm just going to give you a like a a

14
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,680
rundown of what's what's happened in the

15
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,260
the landscape of post quantum and then

16
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,120
give you some uh

17
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,280
uh what's happening in the real world

18
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,620
um how people are experimenting with

19
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,620
post Quantum crypto

20
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:53,579
and some of the projects that have been

21
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:56,219
going on within standardizations with

22
00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:57,660
governments

23
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,820
um what tools we have that are post

24
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,539
Quantum secure

25
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,760
so yeah just a quick primer on the post

26
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,220
Quantum cryptography

27
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:10,799
um this is the only slide that has any

28
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,720
Quantum algorithms involved

29
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,460
um so this is like The Good The Bad and

30
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:15,659
The Ugly

31
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:17,939
so we have Shaw's algorithm we have

32
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:19,740
Grover's algorithm

33
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:22,740
both of these give us really cool

34
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:23,759
um

35
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,439
speed UPS

36
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,960
um in Quantum Hardware so we have an

37
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,400
exponential speed up of factoring

38
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,380
integers

39
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:34,140
um this obviously requires a large fault

40
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,000
tolerant quantum computer

41
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,579
and using this algorithm we actually

42
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:40,619
break almost all of our public key

43
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:43,920
crypto online that we use so this breaks

44
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,460
uh RSA this is the integer factorization

45
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,299
problem

46
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:50,460
this breaks uh elliptic curve

47
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,259
cryptography which requires the discrete

48
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:53,880
algorithm problem

49
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,500
Grover's algorithm is slightly different

50
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,159
it affects our asymmetric uh schemes so

51
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:03,119
this is something like AES or Cha-Cha

52
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,240
this doesn't affect uh cryptography as

53
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,160
much

54
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,538
basically it means we need to double the

55
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:12,120
size of our implementation so if we're

56
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,239
looking to get a 128 bits secure we need

57
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:18,540
to use AES 256 so that's how we that's

58
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,940
how we fix that issue

59
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,040
um but with shows algorithm we need a

60
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,500
whole revamp of the uh the asymmetrical

61
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,000
schemes that we use

62
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,940
um in our day-to-day lives

63
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:32,819
so what we want really is a new method

64
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,140
for

65
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:36,420
public key encryption or a way in which

66
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:39,840
we uh share a key and we need a way to

67
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,060
do authentication again so some sort of

68
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:45,080
signature scheme as well

69
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,160
so the main thing that has been going on

70
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,319
in this area is the nist post Quantum

71
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,060
standardization process

72
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:58,260
so this began in uh 2016. nisk had a

73
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:01,560
call for submissions in which they gave

74
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,140
a list of uh things that they would like

75
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:07,580
to see uh in this post Quantum effort

76
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:11,700
82 submissions were submitted and for

77
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,560
the first round 69 of these were

78
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,239
accepted so

79
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:17,280
in the beginning some of these were

80
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,040
either withdrawn or attacked so some

81
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,680
weaknesses were found but in the end uh

82
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,980
yeah 69 were accepted

83
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:28,620
and as the as as we see the progression

84
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:31,440
of the years going by we see like a

85
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,300
second round third round

86
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,200
um

87
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,360
basically this asks for more

88
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,599
scrutinization on specific things so in

89
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,220
the first round we might have seen more

90
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:44,099
scrutinization on the cryptanalysis the

91
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:46,799
hardness problems the maths but the

92
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,060
second and third rounds were more

93
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,819
focused on how these schemes perform in

94
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:56,700
the real world so the the code size the

95
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,739
how how many operations per second we're

96
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:01,860
getting how big are the keys

97
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:05,220
um how does it perform in TLS for

98
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:06,480
example

99
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:11,459
so recently uh in July this year they

100
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:14,519
gave us the results so we got the first

101
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:16,738
standards first set of standards

102
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:19,260
so we got

103
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:22,199
um a key encapsulation mechanism or a

104
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:26,340
chem and we got three signature schemes

105
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,840
so

106
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,800
um

107
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,080
four other schemes were put forward into

108
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,099
like a fourth round

109
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:36,780
um so they require a bit more scrutiny

110
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,880
on the the hardness problems that they

111
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,800
use

112
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,960
and in uh and next year in this that

113
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,780
we're also asking for more proposals for

114
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:48,060
Signature schemes so there'll be lots of

115
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:51,240
different types of other paradigms that

116
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:55,340
we might see uh next year as well

117
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,259
um

118
00:04:58,259 --> 00:05:01,259
yeah and as well as nist

119
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:03,900
um we have other standards bodies as

120
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,880
well that are sort of following or have

121
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,199
explicitly said they're going to follow

122
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,580
what must have said

123
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:11,340
so you're talking about the the German

124
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,960
BSI

125
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,080
um and see the French standards bodies

126
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,500
as well they recently said uh in French

127
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,720
we're happy with the selection of

128
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,720
candidates that nist have made

129
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,139
um and even some of them also supports

130
00:05:27,139 --> 00:05:29,699
Alternatives or

131
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:31,320
um those that weren't selected by nist

132
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,400
so there's

133
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,740
schemes called frodochem and classic

134
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:37,500
mcaleese which haven't been selected as

135
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,060
standards yet but

136
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,979
they like them because they're very very

137
00:05:40,979 --> 00:05:44,039
conservative they're just not performant

138
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:46,460
enough for nest

139
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:48,900
and it's also worth noting that China

140
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,060
have their own post Quantum standards so

141
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,160
they've been selected for about a year

142
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,479
or two now and

143
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,340
um so yeah we have we have some of those

144
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:58,758
as well

145
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,919
um so yeah you might be wondering like

146
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,320
why uh why we need to worry and I think

147
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,080
Mark had a had a slide on this as well a

148
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,479
while ago so this is what we call the

149
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:12,539
store now decrypt later problem so

150
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:15,060
if you transition to post Quantum

151
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:18,240
cryptography and you want your um

152
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,699
your data to be secure for a certain

153
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:22,199
period of time

154
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:24,539
if you're if a practical quantum

155
00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:26,699
computer comes along before those two

156
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:27,900
periods

157
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:30,600
um they added together then you're gonna

158
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,860
have

159
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:35,340
um a vulnerable data sensitive data that

160
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,139
might be

161
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:40,080
um readable by a bad actor or a

162
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,780
government or yeah anybody that has

163
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:45,780
access to a quantum computer

164
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,819
so this is really important for

165
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:50,160
companies that are trying to hide

166
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,060
um patents or ideas that they might have

167
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:57,080
that go into drugs or or financial

168
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,699
transactions and things like that

169
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:01,080
so

170
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,539
um yeah you need to you need to worry

171
00:07:03,539 --> 00:07:05,400
about this not because

172
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,199
we might see a quantum computer in 30

173
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,660
years but now we need to worry because

174
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:12,860
people might call encrypted traffic

175
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:17,039
wait for it to be readable by using

176
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,139
algorithms paired with a quantum

177
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:21,259
computer

178
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,620
so the standards that we have so

179
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:26,400
um

180
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,080
there were two main standards that we

181
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,120
got out of the four these were both

182
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:33,000
based on matters-based cryptography

183
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,819
so these were called crystals kyber and

184
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:38,099
Crystal's dilithium

185
00:07:38,099 --> 00:07:40,139
um and yes they are related to Star Wars

186
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:41,940
and Star Trek

187
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:45,240
um so Kaiba is the chem and dilithium is

188
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:49,080
the primary signature scheme

189
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,479
um so the latter space cryptography is

190
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:53,940
akin to a problem where

191
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,340
if I give you a matrix a and a vector B

192
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:59,160
where b equals a times S Plus Some Noise

193
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,660
vector

194
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:04,319
uh find S this is a very difficult

195
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,060
problem this is a problem that quantum

196
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:08,039
computers also find difficult as well as

197
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:09,660
classical computers

198
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,599
and it's equivalent to finding a short

199
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:13,800
Vector in a lattice

200
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,500
the good thing about these two schemes

201
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,900
is that they have their code bases

202
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,120
significantly overlap you can kind of

203
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,280
see them as brother and sisters of each

204
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,960
other

205
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,000
um so when it comes to implementations

206
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,400
and designing instruction sets and

207
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,860
things like that we might see

208
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:34,979
um a real push towards uh making these

209
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:37,679
much more uh performant and

210
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,179
um yeah on different platforms different

211
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:41,339
architectures

212
00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:43,520
Etc

213
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:46,680
yeah so kyber was selected and the

214
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,360
lithium was selected by nist this is a

215
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,560
quote from them

216
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,480
basically saying

217
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,519
we really like these because they've

218
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,620
been heavily studied uh over the last

219
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:58,320
few decades the hardness problems

220
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,360
um and they have really good performance

221
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,640
overall in software and Hardware

222
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,339
there's also been quite a lot um quite

223
00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:07,140
some look at this from side channels as

224
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:07,860
well

225
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:12,000
um another Kryptonite and analytic tools

226
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,060
um so yeah it's got a strong theoretical

227
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:18,180
security basis and also it's really

228
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:20,459
um good overall performance compared to

229
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:23,540
some of the other schemes

230
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:27,480
so there are two other signature schemes

231
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,500
as well

232
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,839
uh one of these is called Falcon and

233
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:32,339
it's also based on latter-space

234
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:34,740
cryptography uh it has a slightly

235
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,480
different performance profile

236
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,880
so it's

237
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,339
um it's very complex to implement so

238
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:43,500
that might be one of the reasons why it

239
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,720
wasn't selected as the primary uh

240
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,940
candidate

241
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:50,820
um but it has a lot of uh Pros as well

242
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:53,880
so the signature size is significantly

243
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,880
smaller so when it comes to use cases

244
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,500
where you have more constrained

245
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,920
bandwidth then this scheme could be your

246
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,899
preferred signature scheme and I think

247
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:06,300
this is why it was chosen with dilithium

248
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,580
because the lithium doesn't work for

249
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:11,839
every every use case

250
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,860
um and yeah it also has fast

251
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:16,860
verifications so in a use case like a

252
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,899
smart card for example we might see uh

253
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:21,839
Falcon a post Quantum uh implementation

254
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,360
on uh on Smart cards for example and

255
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,100
other use cases where you might see you

256
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:29,240
might need fast verification

257
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:30,959
um

258
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:33,480
yeah and also we have

259
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,459
um Sphinx plus so

260
00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:36,839
the other three schemes that were

261
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:39,000
selected are latter-spaced and nist

262
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,740
didn't want to put all their eggs in one

263
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:41,700
basket

264
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,740
so they wanted another another hardness

265
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,899
problem that was also post quantum

266
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:48,360
and sphinx plus gives us this it's based

267
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:51,360
on the hardness of uh cryptographic hash

268
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,399
functions

269
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:55,980
um it doesn't really fit all the use

270
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:58,920
cases like a bit like Falcon but it's

271
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:04,200
got a solid conservative security and

272
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,480
um yeah I think this also has quite a

273
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,519
lot of other use cases as well where we

274
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:12,620
might prefer Sphinx for example

275
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,500
so how do these schemes compare with

276
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,790
each other

277
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:18,420
[Music]

278
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:19,500
um

279
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,380
the the Sphinx signature scheme is the

280
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,600
is the biggest one there

281
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,620
no it's not it's uh it's delicium

282
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,899
um but yeah you can see Falcon there is

283
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:33,360
significantly smaller

284
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,480
um

285
00:11:36,019 --> 00:11:38,700
but yeah this is uh this is sort of the

286
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:39,959
size we're looking at

287
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:42,060
um the lithium is fast

288
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:44,040
but it's yeah as I said it might be a

289
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:47,100
bit too large for some applications

290
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,600
um

291
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,300
and yes Sphinx plus is very secure has

292
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,860
but has a large signature I don't know

293
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,480
why it's not there

294
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,100
um but yeah uh this is just the

295
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,779
comparison of uh some of the schemes

296
00:11:57,779 --> 00:12:00,680
that we have as candidates

297
00:12:02,579 --> 00:12:04,980
um so yeah the the schemes were that

298
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:07,560
were selected uh this year they're gonna

299
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,440
be about one to two years time uh we're

300
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,459
gonna have to wait until they're

301
00:12:11,459 --> 00:12:14,279
actually formally written the standards

302
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:17,160
um but we do have post Quantum uh

303
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,600
standards at the moment but these

304
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,820
weren't in the process

305
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,500
um because they slightly go out of the

306
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,760
bound of what this we're looking for

307
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,720
initially

308
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,760
but these are called stateful hash based

309
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,380
signatures

310
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,820
um these are some quite similar to

311
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,380
Sphinx

312
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:33,540
um but they have slightly more Nuance

313
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:35,279
involved in their implementation and

314
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:36,420
Design

315
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,160
so

316
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,740
these are yeah these are called xmss and

317
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:44,180
LMS so you can find these under ietf

318
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:48,240
rfcs and they also go into they've also

319
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,040
been adopted into uh this special

320
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,440
publication

321
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,420
um yeah some there's some nuances in

322
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:57,360
these uh designs so they require careful

323
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,560
State Management

324
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,019
uh and thus they can only sign like a

325
00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:02,700
limited number of messages

326
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,920
and so you really have to be uh careful

327
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,320
when you when you do the implementations

328
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,880
of these

329
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,139
um I believe there is in this document

330
00:13:10,139 --> 00:13:12,300
uh just describing how to do State

331
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,040
Management

332
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,720
they are they're quite relatively slow

333
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,540
compared to like the latter space games

334
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:22,019
but they are standards now so if you

335
00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:24,360
really wanted to you do Post Quantum

336
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:27,720
signatures now you can use these

337
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:31,019
um and be uh and use the the nist

338
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:34,019
standards

339
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,720
so as I said we might see more uh scheme

340
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,300
standardized in the future so Nest have

341
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:45,120
some chems that have gone into a fourth

342
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,519
round and they're also opening up more

343
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,740
signature schemes in the future

344
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:53,820
so what we have in the fourth round is

345
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,620
um we have four schemes yeah so one of

346
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:59,279
these is Psych which is a super singular

347
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:00,959
isogeny based

348
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:01,740
um

349
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:04,079
a key exchange mechanism

350
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:05,940
um

351
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:09,180
this was quite

352
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,920
um liked by the community I think

353
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:14,399
because it used some some similar Master

354
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,860
elliptic curve cryptography

355
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:18,959
um but very recently there have been

356
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,360
quite a few attacks on these

357
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,940
um and they've almost been

358
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:26,040
um not wiped out but it's going to be

359
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,360
hard to see if they actually come back

360
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,880
with fixes for the attacks I have a

361
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:32,940
slide on this later on

362
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,980
um the other three are based on code

363
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:37,320
based cryptography so that's using the

364
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:40,440
maths of error correcting codes

365
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:44,339
um these give quite nice uh key exchange

366
00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:46,079
um mechanisms

367
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,480
um so they're called bike cakes QC and

368
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,880
classic mcaleese

369
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,500
um I think this just really wants some

370
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,380
more scrutiny some more um

371
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:57,779
analysis on the performance of them and

372
00:14:57,779 --> 00:14:59,940
just to see you know if they need to

373
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:03,420
they have got these as a as a future uh

374
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:05,639
standards

375
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:08,459
um and we next year we're also going to

376
00:15:08,459 --> 00:15:11,339
see more standards uh more

377
00:15:11,339 --> 00:15:12,000
um

378
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,459
submissions for signatures

379
00:15:14,459 --> 00:15:16,260
um there's been quite a lot of research

380
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,120
on post Quantum signatures in the last

381
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,139
few years

382
00:15:19,139 --> 00:15:21,779
really kind of cool exciting

383
00:15:21,779 --> 00:15:25,260
ideas so one of these is using what we

384
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:27,300
call NPC in the head so this is using

385
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,279
multi-party computation

386
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,680
for example there was a scheme actually

387
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,740
in the competition called picnic

388
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:38,519
nist decided not to go with picnic into

389
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:41,339
like a fourth round

390
00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:43,620
um I think they saw some of the other

391
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:45,120
research that has happened recently and

392
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,040
thought they might have better

393
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,139
submissions that are similar to picnic

394
00:15:49,139 --> 00:15:51,839
so that's going to be really exciting

395
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:54,300
and also we get isogeny based signatures

396
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,199
as well

397
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:57,899
they can be quite slow but

398
00:15:57,899 --> 00:16:00,660
if we get some more orders of magnitude

399
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,820
sort of uh optimizations they could be

400
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:06,240
really interesting uh alternatives to to

401
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,240
lattices

402
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:15,660
so yeah the attack that was on psych so

403
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,760
um this was very recently I don't think

404
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,920
the community yet has really got its

405
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,019
head around this

406
00:16:22,019 --> 00:16:24,240
um like the nuances involved in the

407
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,680
attack

408
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,079
um but a lot of the

409
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:31,680
um uh experts in this like Niche field

410
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:35,100
have all said they sort of um believe

411
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:38,339
the attack Works they they

412
00:16:38,339 --> 00:16:39,000
um

413
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,980
yeah they sort of validate that the

414
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:41,940
attack

415
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:42,959
um

416
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:46,079
works there's some values here just to

417
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,600
give you an idea of how

418
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,240
um devastating the attack was so

419
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,040
the um

420
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:57,360
the the psych the p434 is like the 128

421
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,699
bit version that's sort of broken in

422
00:16:59,699 --> 00:17:02,160
about 10 minutes to an hour

423
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,339
um and then the higher security levels

424
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:08,459
originally like took maybe a weekend or

425
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:10,439
a day or two and then

426
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:12,299
um I think recently they've cut that

427
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:14,520
down using some more optimizations in

428
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,559
the attack so there's some really cool

429
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,359
results there

430
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:20,699
um I encourage you to look at that as

431
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:23,040
well there's some really nice ideas in

432
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,339
that attack

433
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:29,040
and also we had

434
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,419
um another signature scheme called

435
00:17:30,419 --> 00:17:33,000
rainbow which used multivariate

436
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:33,860
um

437
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:36,780
quadratic equations to as a hardness

438
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:37,559
problem

439
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:40,380
this was also recently solved recently

440
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:42,360
sort of attacked it wasn't as

441
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,000
devastating as the psych one but it did

442
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,160
shave off quite a lot of the bits of

443
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,620
security so

444
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:51,840
in particular the 128 bit secure

445
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,480
parameters were cut down significantly

446
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,140
um

447
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:58,260
I think the designers try to move the

448
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,660
parameter set up um to cover that attack

449
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:04,380
but it's still not uh it still wasn't

450
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:06,480
good enough and uh niss decided not to

451
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,360
select this and move it forward

452
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,419
um and yeah the the the title of the

453
00:18:12,419 --> 00:18:14,640
paper that breaks it um suggests you can

454
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,960
do it in a weekend on a laptop

455
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:23,039
so yeah these two attacks they were

456
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:24,900
recent they were in the last two or

457
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,780
three months uh both of them

458
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,940
um some people can see these two things

459
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:30,900
as

460
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,640
um you know not having trust in the post

461
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,919
Quantum crypto

462
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:38,100
um but I think it shows that what the

463
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,679
community are doing Works

464
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:43,140
um nist had so many calls where they

465
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,820
asked for more Crypt analysis and more

466
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:48,360
scrutiny and we finally have that so

467
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,059
it's good that we had that you know

468
00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:54,059
before it was made a standard

469
00:18:54,059 --> 00:18:56,880
um and you could kind of argue that

470
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,020
these candidates were put in where you

471
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,220
know they've made it to round three

472
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:04,679
which is like the last round before we

473
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:07,440
got these standards as uh finalists and

474
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,480
Alternatives and you could kind of argue

475
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:12,660
that they were there so that we would

476
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,340
scrutinize them more

477
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:17,580
so we could have yeah

478
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:18,480
um

479
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,940
so yeah I mean Nest have also said this

480
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,440
in Publications as well these problems

481
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,700
were understudied

482
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:26,460
so although the the psych attack was

483
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:29,940
quite a surprise having

484
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,860
um results on cryptanalysis for these

485
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,179
hardness problems is not a surprise

486
00:19:33,179 --> 00:19:34,620
because they're all relatively new

487
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:37,459
hardness problems

488
00:19:38,419 --> 00:19:42,480
so how do you begin to sort of plug and

489
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,340
play with these uh post Quantum

490
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:45,480
candidates

491
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,799
um

492
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:49,679
some people might be a bit skeptical

493
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:52,320
about using post Quantum they might not

494
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,960
believe in the quantum threat as much

495
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,400
um even with the stone out the crib

496
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,559
later attack

497
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,900
um some people yeah they might not feel

498
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,640
as secure using post Quantum when

499
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,799
they've used elliptic curves and RSA for

500
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:06,600
decades

501
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,200
um

502
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,860
and how do you deal with with trying to

503
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:12,179
convince people that they they need to

504
00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:14,340
do this so

505
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:16,860
um there is an approach that works for

506
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:19,260
everyone basically so there's what we

507
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,059
call hybrid algorithms

508
00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:23,580
or the hybrid approach so it's basically

509
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:27,120
where we have a U.S standard so RSA or

510
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,120
elliptic curve cryptography

511
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:33,179
and we generate a shared secret for that

512
00:20:33,179 --> 00:20:36,299
and we also use a shared secret from a

513
00:20:36,299 --> 00:20:38,640
post Quantum cam of your choice

514
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,860
um I'd obviously go with one of the the

515
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:42,240
standards that we have

516
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,440
uh that we've been given uh last month

517
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,179
so you generate both of these shared

518
00:20:48,179 --> 00:20:50,160
secrets and you concatenate these and

519
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,620
use that as the one Secret

520
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:55,679
so this this is uh good for two reasons

521
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,600
it's

522
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,299
um it complies with uh us standards it

523
00:21:00,299 --> 00:21:03,299
complies with fips it complies with uh

524
00:21:03,299 --> 00:21:06,780
yeah the nest uh standards so you're

525
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:09,179
still complying

526
00:21:09,179 --> 00:21:11,520
um and you're also

527
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,220
you also need to break both chems in

528
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:16,020
order to find that the entire shared

529
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:17,100
Secret

530
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:20,520
so you can be secure in a post Quantum

531
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:24,480
Wells and you can be secure even if your

532
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,460
chem has let's say a weakness in the

533
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:28,260
future you've still got RSA or elliptic

534
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:31,879
curves to sort of back you up there

535
00:21:33,299 --> 00:21:36,480
yeah this is basically what I just said

536
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,539
um

537
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:41,280
so yeah you need to break both of these

538
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,559
um shared secret mechanisms in order to

539
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:46,140
to find the overall shared Secret

540
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:47,580
and this is the technique that's

541
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:49,860
actually being adopted by most if not

542
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:54,299
all companies or protocols or

543
00:21:54,299 --> 00:21:56,940
um yeah using this in the real world

544
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,679
um I go on to talk about this a bit

545
00:21:58,679 --> 00:22:00,799
later

546
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:03,960
so yeah as I said most people are

547
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,419
looking at hybrid so there's

548
00:22:06,419 --> 00:22:07,260
um

549
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,700
uh

550
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:12,240
one example I can think of that is not

551
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,320
actually going to go with the hybrid

552
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,539
approach as far as I know

553
00:22:15,539 --> 00:22:17,880
um the NSA have uh said this a few times

554
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,919
that they're going to go with a strict

555
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:23,760
post Quantum solution approach which has

556
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,340
led to a bit of um disagreement in the

557
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:27,419
community

558
00:22:27,419 --> 00:22:29,460
um it'll be interesting to see if they

559
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:31,919
if they continue to sort of go with that

560
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:34,919
strategy

561
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:38,280
um and recently this year the the White

562
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,960
House have also said

563
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,360
everybody every Federal agency needs to

564
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,100
get ready for this transition to post

565
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:46,620
Quantum they've called uh all the

566
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:48,440
agencies to

567
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:51,179
uh find out where they use quantum

568
00:22:51,179 --> 00:22:53,940
vulnerable uh cryptography

569
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,679
um whether that's in data at rest or

570
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:57,179
data at Transit

571
00:22:57,179 --> 00:22:59,820
just so that they know what to

572
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:03,439
transition what to migrate

573
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:08,159
so yeah and that's everything on the on

574
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:10,700
the primer

575
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,820
so I think I've kind of tried to build

576
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:16,740
up a bit of a foundation there so you

577
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:18,720
can sort of see where post Quantum is

578
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,740
being used in the real world

579
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:23,220
um

580
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:25,679
but yeah um as you as I'm sure you know

581
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:27,000
public key cryptography is used

582
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,280
everywhere uh in our day-to-day lives on

583
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,919
the Internet or offline on our phones on

584
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:34,880
all of our devices so you're looking at

585
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,500
certificates

586
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:39,000
vpns TLS

587
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,059
secure emails SSH

588
00:23:42,059 --> 00:23:44,340
all of these

589
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,179
um

590
00:23:45,179 --> 00:23:47,580
use cases they need to be transitioned

591
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:49,980
to post quantum there's loads of others

592
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:52,860
as well uh end-to-end encryption Network

593
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:54,480
infrastructure

594
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,480
Big Data clouds

595
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,140
um

596
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:00,659
and yeah everything will need to be

597
00:24:00,659 --> 00:24:03,600
transitioned but the important thing to

598
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,820
realize is this is not a drop in you

599
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:07,559
can't just pull out elliptic curves and

600
00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:10,140
drop in post quantum everything needs to

601
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:12,659
have a holistic approach or

602
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:16,679
and ad hoc solution

603
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:19,679
and yeah there's lots of different ways

604
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,539
this is this are being addressed in the

605
00:24:21,539 --> 00:24:23,700
community

606
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,860
um so yeah

607
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:28,080
one thing that I perhaps didn't make

608
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:31,080
clear uh already is that post Quantum

609
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:33,480
has a performance drawback I think we

610
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,159
got really lucky with elliptic curve

611
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:37,260
cryptography we have really fast

612
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:39,720
implementations really small bandwidth

613
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,940
small keys and this is definitely not

614
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:44,039
going to be the case of post quantum

615
00:24:44,039 --> 00:24:47,640
so the way we deal with that in in uh

616
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,620
protocols such as TLS is going to be

617
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:51,480
really interesting

618
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,520
um the ATF especially are working on

619
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,860
lots of different working groups to try

620
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:57,440
and address specific

621
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,140
problems that come with post quantum

622
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:04,200
so yeah there's lots of work on TLS one

623
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,780
proposal is called chem TLS

624
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:10,260
which does TLS essentially without any

625
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:14,039
handshakes signatures just using the

626
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:15,740
chems themselves

627
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:17,400
and

628
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:20,940
um yeah things that kept that chems

629
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:23,940
require that we've got differently from

630
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:27,059
elliptic curves so the diffie-hellman

631
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:28,980
um Paradigm is something we have

632
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:31,340
essentially lost so this

633
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:33,120
non-interactivity that we get from

634
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,520
diffie-hellman key exchange

635
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,740
which was foundational in for example

636
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:40,080
the signal protocol

637
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,980
uh chems are interactive so these really

638
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:47,880
don't uh drop in in and replace uh

639
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,039
diffie-hellman so yeah there's been

640
00:25:50,039 --> 00:25:52,380
research that have looked into

641
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:53,039
um

642
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:56,720
post quantumizing the signal protocols

643
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,100
especially the double ratchet

644
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:01,559
um that's uh in the in the signal

645
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:04,279
protocol itself

646
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,200
um yeah a more secure like internet so

647
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,900
we have uh more more and more projects

648
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,700
that the ATF are doing so they're doing

649
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,320
some really cool work

650
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:16,200
so one thing that we will have to deal

651
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:19,320
with uh when we use post Quantum is more

652
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,460
fragments

653
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:22,080
um in TLS

654
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,200
or in uh yeah Ike so

655
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:25,799
um

656
00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:27,539
there's one core project that's looking

657
00:26:27,539 --> 00:26:29,760
to have like an intermediate exchange so

658
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,039
this will deal with uh this will help

659
00:26:32,039 --> 00:26:34,500
deal with more of the fragments and this

660
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:37,559
effectively borrows ideas that we're

661
00:26:37,559 --> 00:26:39,059
trying to

662
00:26:39,059 --> 00:26:41,299
uh thwart denial of service so

663
00:26:41,299 --> 00:26:43,200
effectively what we're doing with post

664
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,200
Quantum is doing a like a mini denial of

665
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,700
service so this is

666
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:50,100
trying to do uh to help by things at the

667
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,840
same time

668
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:55,400
yeah some more work on on SSH

669
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:58,320
and we also have like yeah the the open

670
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,059
SSH have also

671
00:27:00,059 --> 00:27:03,360
integrated post Quantum as standard as

672
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,720
by default they've gone with a scheme

673
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,539
called entry Prime which is not selected

674
00:27:09,539 --> 00:27:12,360
by nist as a standard

675
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,440
um

676
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,419
I don't know why they might go with

677
00:27:15,419 --> 00:27:18,840
kyber at some point in the future

678
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,419
um but yeah open SSH is postponed by

679
00:27:21,419 --> 00:27:23,760
standard Now using the hybrid approach

680
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,640
and yeah some more vpns

681
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,240
um

682
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:30,000
uh work as well so on wireguard and

683
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,679
openvpn

684
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:34,380
I looked into the schemes recently and

685
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:38,220
they were using rainbow and Psych

686
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:39,900
one was using rainbow one was using

687
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,580
psych but obviously it's in a hybrid

688
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,620
setting so it's kind of okay but

689
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,960
I hope they fix that at some point in

690
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,260
the future

691
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,140
um yeah more work on

692
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:56,340
um to call email openpgp

693
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:57,840
um

694
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,820
yeah I mean there's loads of loads of

695
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:01,440
stuff going on there's loads of other

696
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,000
standards bodies looking into this as

697
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:03,659
well

698
00:28:03,659 --> 00:28:06,059
the itu for example

699
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:07,440
um and we're integrating this into

700
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,760
things like Thunderbird as well so

701
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:11,159
that's kind of cool

702
00:28:11,159 --> 00:28:14,880
um x509 so yeah there's lots of stuff

703
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,340
going on here

704
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:19,860
and yeah as I said the stateful hash

705
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:21,659
based signatures are a standard so we

706
00:28:21,659 --> 00:28:23,279
can begin to use these and actually

707
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:25,140
although they're kind of tricky to

708
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:27,900
implement they have some really cool

709
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,520
um

710
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,200
use cases where they they're really

711
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,080
suited so software updates and secure

712
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:37,320
boot are really ideal for the for their

713
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:39,539
schemes actually

714
00:28:39,539 --> 00:28:42,240
um yeah mpkis Cas and Ras

715
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,100
um as well

716
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,840
so if you really wanted to you could

717
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,000
start using these in in uh in the real

718
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,020
world

719
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:51,679
um yeah

720
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:56,340
another use case that's uh kind of

721
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:58,020
um we're considering

722
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:01,080
um is vehicle to vehicle Communications

723
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,760
so one thing that's really key with them

724
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:06,659
is the the bandwidth of restriction so

725
00:29:06,659 --> 00:29:09,179
um they were

726
00:29:09,179 --> 00:29:12,179
as a lot of other products had been

727
00:29:12,179 --> 00:29:13,740
designed around

728
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:15,720
um this low bandwidth you get with

729
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,039
elliptic curves

730
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:18,600
so one thing we're going to have to deal

731
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,940
with in vehicle to vehicle is

732
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:22,740
the

733
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:25,620
the uh fragments basically so

734
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:27,840
we've had some work by one of our

735
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,820
colleagues that looking into how we deal

736
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:31,440
with fragments trying to get those down

737
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,620
by using some optimization techniques

738
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:36,000
so that

739
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,220
cars don't start crashing into each

740
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:42,020
other if if we use post quantum

741
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:46,080
so yeah

742
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,720
um that was kind of a lot of a quick

743
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,460
overview of how post Quantum is being

744
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:52,500
used in the real world

745
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,059
um there's some things as I said that we

746
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:55,860
haven't really got at the moment

747
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,539
um so I just thought I'd have a slide

748
00:29:57,539 --> 00:29:59,940
here going on like a wish list of what

749
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:00,840
we might

750
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:04,020
really want to see now that we have a

751
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:05,460
camera and a signature scheme that we

752
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:06,960
can use

753
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,020
so yeah the non-interactivity that we

754
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:12,299
got with uh ecth

755
00:30:12,299 --> 00:30:14,520
um gave us a lot of Simplicity but it

756
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,559
was really ingrained in a lot of our

757
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:19,080
protocols so if we can come up with a

758
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,460
way to have a non-interactive key

759
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:22,919
exchange using a post Quantum Paradigm

760
00:30:22,919 --> 00:30:25,559
that would be ideal I think

761
00:30:25,559 --> 00:30:27,960
the uh the scheme that was broken psych

762
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:32,580
kind of gave us that we had a sithh

763
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,699
um

764
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:37,740
but yeah that was attacked um so I don't

765
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:38,760
know if we can do this with other

766
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:41,700
schemes like lattices and codes but it

767
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,500
might be something to look into

768
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:46,440
we have other protocols such as noise

769
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,419
um which heavy heavily relied on Tiffy

770
00:30:48,419 --> 00:30:49,620
Hammond as well

771
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:51,779
there have been proposals for post

772
00:30:51,779 --> 00:30:54,899
Quantum noise I'm using chems but I

773
00:30:54,899 --> 00:30:55,919
think they take quite a hit on

774
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:58,980
performance so whether we can gain that

775
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:01,620
back somehow is another open problem

776
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:04,080
and similarly with the diffie-hellman we

777
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:07,620
have password authenticated key exchange

778
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:10,200
um and can we get a pet performance

779
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,779
um with that with that protocol as well

780
00:31:12,779 --> 00:31:15,779
uh DNS SEC has also a lot of

781
00:31:15,779 --> 00:31:17,940
restrictions thanks to elliptic curves

782
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:20,940
small signatures and fast verification

783
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:23,640
uh can we do this in a post Quantum way

784
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:26,220
or

785
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:28,020
um yeah can we change I don't think we

786
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:29,580
can change this but like

787
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:31,320
and the same thing for the the quick

788
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:34,520
Network protocol as well

789
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,179
um so yeah there's lots of open problems

790
00:31:36,179 --> 00:31:38,700
here as well as like uh you know using

791
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,500
post Quantum and blockchains

792
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,899
there's a recent study that said 25 of

793
00:31:42,899 --> 00:31:44,340
all Bitcoin are potentially vulnerable

794
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:45,779
to a Quantum attack

795
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:48,120
which is a lot of money

796
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,799
um so this needs to be addressed post

797
00:31:49,799 --> 00:31:52,260
Quantum needs to be integrated uh into

798
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:53,640
this

799
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,860
um and how you do this how you migrate

800
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:58,320
to an inherently distributed system is a

801
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,640
question that needs to be answered as

802
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,820
well

803
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:05,039
so

804
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:06,840
um yeah that was quite a heavy talk I

805
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:09,840
think I've gone a bit fast but I hope

806
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,880
what you take away from this talk is

807
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,140
that

808
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:15,480
um yeah keep cryptographic agility in

809
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:18,360
mind when you when you

810
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,440
um when you want to look to the

811
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,200
migration to post Quantum this will like

812
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,960
significantly ease the process

813
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,880
um especially when it comes to things

814
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:31,080
like cryptanalysis or

815
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:33,840
um yeah just using different

816
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,700
um different standards so we have four

817
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:38,039
standards now they all have their own

818
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:40,080
use cases where they can be used and if

819
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,120
you have crypto graphic agility you can

820
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:44,399
easily like plug and play and use

821
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:45,720
different schemes for different use

822
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,640
cases

823
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:50,460
and also beware of like you not using

824
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:53,159
their standards or missed candidates at

825
00:32:53,159 --> 00:32:53,880
least

826
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:57,320
so using other schemes that haven't been

827
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:00,179
scrutinized by the community I'd be very

828
00:33:00,179 --> 00:33:03,000
wary about doing that

829
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,059
and um yeah I mean we've had some

830
00:33:06,059 --> 00:33:07,140
attacks

831
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:08,940
um and don't be surprised if we see any

832
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:09,779
more

833
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:10,440
um

834
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,480
this does mean that things are working

835
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,340
where as a community we're working

836
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:17,760
towards making secure implementations of

837
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,919
post quantum

838
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:21,299
um there's some things that we still

839
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:23,460
haven't looked at as much as AES or

840
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:25,559
elliptic curves side channels for

841
00:33:25,559 --> 00:33:28,880
example secure implementations

842
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:32,159
how this affects performance is also a

843
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:34,380
problem needs to be solved

844
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:37,019
and yeah like I said Crypt analysis

845
00:33:37,019 --> 00:33:38,820
attacks are expected and positive I

846
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:42,080
think uh in my opinion

847
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:45,720
so yeah it will take time as well so I

848
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,460
think we're looking at getting standards

849
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:49,380
for these uh four schemes in the next

850
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:51,480
couple of years

851
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,940
um I'm sure we'll see some more scrutiny

852
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:54,960
um

853
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,840
by then especially when it comes to what

854
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:01,500
parameters we select for these schemes

855
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,840
um and integrating this into the real

856
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,340
world into every use case that we need

857
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:07,799
it for is going to be a long process

858
00:34:07,799 --> 00:34:10,918
five to ten years at least

859
00:34:10,918 --> 00:34:12,960
um yeah it's a long path

860
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,599
um but there's lots of really smart

861
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:17,159
people looking at this

862
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:20,099
um so yeah I wouldn't worry

863
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:22,139
um I think that's everything I wanted to

864
00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:23,879
say but I've got laser time for

865
00:34:23,879 --> 00:34:26,060
questions

866
00:34:30,909 --> 00:34:36,329
[Applause]

867
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:43,040
yep

868
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:50,339
the the just the whether they're using

869
00:34:50,339 --> 00:34:52,859
elliptic curves or the RSA is just going

870
00:34:52,859 --> 00:34:55,859
to be vulnerable to Quantum attacks so

871
00:34:55,859 --> 00:34:58,700
yeah

872
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:12,540
the only thing I mean I haven't read all

873
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:15,240
the uh literature on this um but I think

874
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:18,420
they just have faith in in the schemes

875
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:20,099
that they've selected by that nist have

876
00:35:20,099 --> 00:35:21,780
selected

877
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:22,500
um

878
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,960
I haven't I don't know why they're going

879
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,400
with that um

880
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,640
they're not the most uh open uh people

881
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:33,020
so yeah I don't know sorry

882
00:35:38,099 --> 00:35:40,140
how long until the quantum computer

883
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:40,980
um

884
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:43,980
I think there was a study recently that

885
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:47,520
I think 15 years maybe I think a lot of

886
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,280
researchers think that there'll be a

887
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,800
quantum computer by 30 years I think

888
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:56,099
there was a there's a survey on this

889
00:35:56,099 --> 00:35:56,760
um

890
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,560
I don't I can't I can't think of who did

891
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,660
it but um there is there is a research

892
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:03,240
on they basically are still physicists

893
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,460
when do you think they'll there will be

894
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:08,520
a quantum computer sorry

895
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:11,339
I'm not a Quantum physicist

896
00:36:11,339 --> 00:36:13,460
um

897
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:15,960
yeah I wouldn't be surprised 15 20 years

898
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:19,460
I'd say yeah

899
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:39,140
so schemes that aren't in the nests

900
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:43,578
process will not get recognition

901
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:48,920
I cut sorry I can't

902
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:04,760
and get one

903
00:37:08,099 --> 00:37:10,280
right

904
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:13,400
yeah yeah

905
00:37:14,099 --> 00:37:16,160
um

906
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:20,520
um I think it depends on what they're

907
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:23,160
proposing so if you're going with like a

908
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,839
key sharing or a signature scheme it's

909
00:37:24,839 --> 00:37:27,780
best to go through the the traditional

910
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:30,480
like route of going of being a nist

911
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,040
candidate

912
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:34,200
but when it comes to maybe a protocol

913
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,060
design

914
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:37,500
for example

915
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:38,940
um like you know you might want to

916
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:41,760
rework TLS to suit post Quantum for

917
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,040
example then you can go through like an

918
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:47,640
ietf RFC so you can you can propose a

919
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,500
protocol change and then have scrutiny

920
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,420
that way so there's there are different

921
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:56,339
ways to become like a standard but um

922
00:37:56,339 --> 00:37:58,320
yeah it depends yeah it depends on the

923
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,980
Paradigm I guess

924
00:38:06,839 --> 00:38:09,859
things yeah

925
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:20,780
um

926
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:23,220
oh

927
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:27,720
it does depend on the signatures or

928
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,640
um or chems but it could be like three

929
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,680
to four times

930
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,720
um you're looking at like

931
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:35,640
yeah

932
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:37,440
four or five fragments at least in like

933
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,119
a TLS or something

934
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:40,560
um

935
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:43,279
uh

936
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,540
uh but on the other side I mean the

937
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:47,400
computation time is quite fast for some

938
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,660
of the latter schemes so they kind of

939
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,700
make up for it that way

940
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:53,180
um but yeah

941
00:39:08,119 --> 00:39:11,960
I think I'll oh yeah okay

942
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:20,220
is

943
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:41,460
okay

944
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:49,859
um so yeah the the blockchain question

945
00:39:49,859 --> 00:39:52,260
I'm not 100 sure

946
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:54,359
um

947
00:39:54,359 --> 00:39:58,200
yeah sorry uh with the yeah with the so

948
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:01,140
why China are doing it differently

949
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:02,579
um

950
00:40:02,579 --> 00:40:05,400
also not 100 sure but I can give you my

951
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,540
two cents

952
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:08,820
um I think yeah they want a bit of

953
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:10,440
control they want to be in charge of

954
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,720
their own standards

955
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,560
um

956
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,359
and they're not the only ones to do this

957
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:16,260
so

958
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:18,180
um Russia have their own standards

959
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:20,160
um not pace Quantum but like they have

960
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,540
in general they have their own standards

961
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:23,940
Korea have their own standards

962
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:25,800
um

963
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:29,099
yeah um I'm not sure if China finished

964
00:40:29,099 --> 00:40:30,540
like

965
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:33,060
it really depends on

966
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:35,220
if you want to like sell stuff in the US

967
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:37,380
if you want to sell like security

968
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:39,480
products in the US you have to like use

969
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,760
them as standards so

970
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:42,599
um

971
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:44,760
I don't know if they'll all follow the

972
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:45,960
the China

973
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:50,119
um like if a chinese company wants to

974
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,980
um

975
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,540
just maybe they're just going against

976
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:04,740
the grain

977
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:06,180
um

978
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:09,660
sometimes they like some uh I can't

979
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:10,859
remember which country it was that

980
00:41:10,859 --> 00:41:13,440
proposed a block Cipher but it was very

981
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:17,280
very similar to AES so they might and

982
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:20,280
the the standards that China did end up

983
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,960
going with a very similar to dilithium

984
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:24,119
and kyber so

985
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:27,119
yeah

986
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:29,700
there's that so

987
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:31,700
yeah

988
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:54,900
so well we need post Quantum Hardware

989
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:56,280
acceleration

990
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,119
um

991
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:59,280
yes

992
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,440
um yeah I mean you see that for all the

993
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,300
standards we have now AES elliptic

994
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:04,140
curves

995
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:06,259
um

996
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:10,619
uh so we you can kind of see that at the

997
00:42:10,619 --> 00:42:12,660
moment so I mean with the hash function

998
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:14,339
for example so they all need hash

999
00:42:14,339 --> 00:42:17,160
functions in inside of them so

1000
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:19,740
um some even some implementations you

1001
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:21,960
can see that as as a bottleneck

1002
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:24,000
um in the implementation so

1003
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,579
having an instruction for that

1004
00:42:26,579 --> 00:42:29,700
um so they use a the shar3 for in the in

1005
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:32,040
the process so having some more having

1006
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:34,859
speed ups for that is going to be

1007
00:42:34,859 --> 00:42:37,680
um a good way to

1008
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:40,079
speed up the overall scheme

1009
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:42,180
um generating Randomness as well how

1010
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:44,760
they do that is going to be a key like

1011
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:49,140
way to speed things up or

1012
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:51,480
um a lot of the the candidates that were

1013
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:52,859
selected latter species NTT

1014
00:42:52,859 --> 00:42:54,960
multiplication it's a different way to

1015
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:57,540
multiply polynomials so if you can come

1016
00:42:57,540 --> 00:42:59,220
up with a like an instructions to do

1017
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:01,079
that for example that would be also

1018
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:03,560
another way

1019
00:43:22,619 --> 00:43:24,720
I think if you I think if you've got it

1020
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:26,220
you should you could you should use it

1021
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:27,540
but

1022
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:28,680
um

1023
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:32,160
you don't always have a GPU to use

1024
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,060
um

1025
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:34,740
but yeah it would be it'd be super cool

1026
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:36,599
to see like how how fast they could get

1027
00:43:36,599 --> 00:43:38,160
with like you know

1028
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:41,339
using a big percentage of the GPU or

1029
00:43:41,339 --> 00:43:44,420
something like that yeah

1030
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:44,160
so basically whether we should start

1031
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:46,859
experimenting with qkd and post Quantum

1032
00:44:46,859 --> 00:44:49,859
and yeah um

1033
00:44:49,859 --> 00:44:52,319
I think that could be a good sort of

1034
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:56,099
academic project or I I've seen quite a

1035
00:44:56,099 --> 00:44:58,680
lot of research on this as well

1036
00:44:58,680 --> 00:44:59,579
um

1037
00:44:59,579 --> 00:45:02,760
it's um yeah qkd is

1038
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:03,839
um

1039
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:06,720
I don't know if it will ever become

1040
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:10,200
sort of an industry standard or uh

1041
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:12,119
something the governments will like

1042
00:45:12,119 --> 00:45:15,680
allow or or encourage at least because

1043
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:20,339
NSA I know ncsc is not really interested

1044
00:45:20,339 --> 00:45:22,079
in qkd so

1045
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:25,440
whether yeah I don't know how that would

1046
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:26,280
work

1047
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:28,680
after that sort of

1048
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:30,960
um strategy or that sort of saying after

1049
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,000
they've said that so

1050
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,560
um but as like

1051
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:37,740
as a concept or it has its use cases I

1052
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:39,660
think like Finance for example or

1053
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:41,099
telecoms or

1054
00:45:41,099 --> 00:45:42,540
I see lots of telecommunications

1055
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:46,319
companies use experiments in with qkd so

1056
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:48,180
yeah I think they sort of naturally go

1057
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:51,900
hand in hand post Quantum and qkd so

1058
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:52,980
um

1059
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:54,780
yeah I think they could go quite well

1060
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:55,740
together

1061
00:45:55,740 --> 00:45:57,540
um especially for the authenticated

1062
00:45:57,540 --> 00:45:59,099
Channel

1063
00:45:59,099 --> 00:46:02,940
um so yeah I think it's definitely worth

1064
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:05,359
looking at

1065
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:21,180
I can't imagine someone else hasn't gone

1066
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:23,410
to elliptic Coast

1067
00:46:23,410 --> 00:46:24,060
[Music]

1068
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:25,500
um

1069
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:27,900
yeah that's probably

1070
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:29,760
a good yeah it's probably a good thing

1071
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:31,200
to do

1072
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,259
um

1073
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:37,200
I just struggle to understand what their

1074
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:39,960
infrastructure looks like without

1075
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:42,200
yeah

1076
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:53,940
so they still use our one

1077
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:55,680
foreign

1078
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:58,640
okay

1079
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:01,920
yeah I mean um

1080
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:04,140
yeah like cryptographic agility like

1081
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:05,819
gives us some really cool ways to to

1082
00:47:05,819 --> 00:47:08,040
migrate so

1083
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:09,780
like you can do

1084
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:11,579
like it can sort of be agnostic to place

1085
00:47:11,579 --> 00:47:13,740
Quantum as well like crypto agility on

1086
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:15,300
its by itself is like a really cool

1087
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:16,260
concept

1088
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:17,940
I think

1089
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:19,619
yeah it gives you a way to transition to

1090
00:47:19,619 --> 00:47:20,819
anything like even if you want to get

1091
00:47:20,819 --> 00:47:23,040
off shot one like you could use crypto

1092
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:24,960
Cafe agility as well so

1093
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:27,680
see ya

1094
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:36,060
I okay I'm gonna

1095
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:40,400
stop thanks thanks everyone
