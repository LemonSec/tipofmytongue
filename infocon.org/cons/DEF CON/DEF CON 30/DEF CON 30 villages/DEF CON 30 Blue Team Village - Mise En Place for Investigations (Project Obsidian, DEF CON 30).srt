00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:03,679
hello welcome to the incident response

2
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:05,759
station this is news in place for

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:07,279
investigations

4
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:09,200
basically if you don't record it if you

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,040
don't document it it doesn't actually

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,880
happen this is going to be a real world

7
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,200
approach to ir communications in all

8
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,840
forms

9
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,160
all right now in terms of where we are

10
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,400
in the instant response life cycle this

11
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,760
is primarily focused on preparation with

12
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,199
a

13
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,000
end goal of having what you need at the

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
post-incident activities

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,520
and then a little bit of

16
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,559
everything else in there

17
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,040
all right now knees in place what does

18
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,079
it even mean um this is a culinary

19
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:43,920
phrase which

20
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,559
basically summarizes getting all of the

21
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,239
ingredients getting all of your tools

22
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:49,920
getting everything that you need in

23
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,800
order to make the dish done and

24
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,480
right there so that you can just put it

25
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,800
all together without having to go and

26
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,039
pull out extra salt or more seasoning or

27
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:00,480
another vegetable

28
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,079
it's getting everything in place ahead

29
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:04,559
of time so that way the actual cooking

30
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,040
portion goes as smoothly and as quickly

31
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,600
as possible

32
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:13,119
now this is separate um from

33
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:15,119
what i would consider general project

34
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:16,720
management in general

35
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,680
restaurant management so this is

36
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,000
going to be focused on for the analyst

37
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,400
for you what does it mean to get

38
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,400
everything situated get everything laid

39
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,159
out ahead of time so that way an

40
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,720
investigation goes as smoothly and as

41
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,000
efficiently as possible

42
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:36,799
all right preparation hindsight but

43
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,040
before you can get everything set up you

44
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,240
actually have to know what you need to

45
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,680
get set up

46
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,759
what i recommend doing is

47
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:45,439
go through what you normally use on a

48
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,159
day-to-day basis start adding a list

49
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:50,399
compiling it over time

50
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,320
and then kind of go review it

51
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,840
group it by instant type group it by

52
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,759
the different tools you're gonna need

53
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,920
and hey i do a phishing email i'm gonna

54
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,159
use these four tools so i'm gonna make

55
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,000
sure they're all grouped together um i

56
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,759
need to make sure that

57
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,600
i have access to

58
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,199
active directory i need to make sure i

59
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,720
have access to

60
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,640
the email servers

61
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,560
getting those

62
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,040
checklists together will help you know

63
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,800
what you actually need

64
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,720
at the start of an incident so that way

65
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,400
you can just get going

66
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,760
all right

67
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,040
envisioning the end at the beginning

68
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,440
now the goal is to get everything that

69
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,160
you need to get that final dish complete

70
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:34,840
and

71
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,239
perfect but you have to know

72
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:40,160
what is required

73
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,000
at the beginning so you need to know

74
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,720
what your requirements are so what are

75
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,959
the information you need for reporting

76
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:48,560
what is the information you need for

77
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,200
lessons learned what are auditors going

78
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,360
to be going through and

79
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,360
and checking off that you included in

80
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,640
each individual ticket or incident case

81
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,319
do you already have templates if you

82
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:01,680
have playbooks

83
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,519
go through all of the documentation go

84
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,920
through all the requirements that you

85
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,319
already have access to and then compile

86
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,040
yourself what you need what you need to

87
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,599
focus on during an incident

88
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:16,319
now if none of this exists

89
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,360
well it looks like an opportunity um at

90
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,519
least write them for yourself

91
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:24,640
i recommend sharing this carry

92
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,640
you know make the documentation share it

93
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,440
with your team but at the very minimum

94
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,640
make it for yourself is absolutely worth

95
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,319
the time investment

96
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:35,840
now this

97
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,959
the goal

98
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,799
what do you need

99
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:41,360
as the incident is being worked how do

100
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,440
you need to prepare it how do you need

101
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,400
to

102
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,879
format it all of that kind of stuff is

103
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,239
what you need to be

104
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,000
thinking about before an incident is

105
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,040
actually happening before the fire is

106
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,000
you know on fire

107
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,920
all right some helpful tips and tricks

108
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,560
clean as you go we've all heard this

109
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,720
taking the extra 20 seconds a minute to

110
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,560
write something down or clarify it in

111
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,120
your own notes during the incident

112
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,040
is worth the time

113
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,280
um it's difficult when everything's on

114
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,720
fire to

115
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,040
take that deep breath and go hey

116
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,000
maybe i should add in a little tidbit

117
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,918
here next to this ip address maybe i

118
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:20,880
should

119
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,120
write out what i think about this

120
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,600
particular piece of log as i'm looking

121
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,199
at it um that saves you so much time

122
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,440
like as it's fresh in your mind write it

123
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,320
down

124
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,360
then

125
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,880
personal pet peeve

126
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,199
if you have a abbreviation or

127
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,120
non-standard or honestly any

128
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,639
abbreviations acronyms explain them

129
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:43,759
go through

130
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:44,960
and write them out at least the

131
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,280
beginning um if you don't want to put

132
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,199
them in each individual ticket make sure

133
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,040
you have a little mini dictionary so

134
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,000
that way

135
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,160
when audit time comes around

136
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,240
qa time comes around you just give them

137
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,320
a little cheat sheet to how you explain

138
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,759
things and then

139
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,160
be done um the auditor prefers it that

140
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,560
way and i'm sure you prefer it that way

141
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,680
all right now

142
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,320
biggest and most important thing

143
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,600
write your notes like you're going to

144
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,759
hit hit by a bus write your notes like

145
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,759
you're going to get amnesia and you're

146
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:16,240
not going to remember a single thing um

147
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,520
because

148
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,919
i know i'm not allowed in this um sleep

149
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,840
is like a little reset button

150
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,160
you know um once you go to sleep and

151
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,840
it's like hey i don't have this pressure

152
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,039
in my head anymore it's not all

153
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:32,240
laid out in my head and this nice cool

154
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,039
visual thing in the back of my mind

155
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:37,360
i've slept i've moved on i'm going on to

156
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,720
the next hair on fire incident

157
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,120
don't memorize what you can document

158
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,400
this is

159
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,360
one of my favorite things because

160
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,520
let's you know let the computers do the

161
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,320
work

162
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,520
their search

163
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,759
um if you are someone who memorizes

164
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,680
everything you get your hands on power

165
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,080
to you keep doing it this is for you

166
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:58,800
know

167
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,520
the rest of us

168
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,440
all right looks like you're trying to do

169
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,199
things the hard way can i help you out

170
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,479
there

171
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,199
short keys speaking of abbreviations and

172
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,759
acronyms um

173
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,800
make hotkeys go through hey i type in

174
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,360
you know ir it's going to

175
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,720
fill it out and write in incident

176
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,080
response

177
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,840
all of those things where you can keep

178
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,319
as efficient as you want to keep

179
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:28,000
but the end result is still the

180
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,680
nicer fuller

181
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,319
human readable version

182
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:34,240
um for sure keys there's tons of

183
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,840
different options i like auto hotkeys um

184
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,000
that's the first one that i came into

185
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,880
and

186
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,280
it just kind of stayed with me however

187
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,440
there are so many options out there i

188
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,639
mean so many um them your own personal

189
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,240
code and people who have their own

190
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,120
personal python code hotkeys it's crazy

191
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,240
now that gets into clipboard management

192
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,440
we do a ton of copy pasting um

193
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,960
it's kind of like when you see someone

194
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,880
right click and hit copy and then go to

195
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,960
the next page and then right click and

196
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,440
click paste again nothing wrong with it

197
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,160
but we know control c control v is just

198
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,599
faster over time especially if you're

199
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,759
doing things 100 times

200
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,319
it's faster now clipboard management is

201
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,000
the next step in that if you're not

202
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,919
already doing that i highly highly

203
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:21,120
recommend it

204
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,120
because it's typically searchable on top

205
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,520
of everything else and then you can also

206
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,160
store screenshots into it as well

207
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,000
the only thing here is you have to make

208
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,319
sure you're setting up securely you

209
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:33,919
don't want to be the reason there's an

210
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:35,520
incident you're going to be able to work

211
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,759
the incidents so make sure it's secure

212
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,759
make sure you get approval

213
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,360
make sure it's handling all of your

214
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,599
passwords and everything correctly i do

215
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:44,960
an auto clear

216
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,199
um that's what i prefer to do i like

217
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,879
using something like

218
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,639
a password manager like keepass it

219
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,639
actually goes into my clipboard manager

220
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,000
and deletes out the passwords and

221
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,479
usernames fantastic

222
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:58,400
other types of pans and password

223
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,960
managers might not necessarily do that

224
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,599
but get in there figure it out

225
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,919
see what works best for you because

226
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,879
again there's no

227
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,520
sure way to do anything here the goal is

228
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,919
to think about what you need during each

229
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,759
incident and the tools

230
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:20,000
that make you faster and better

231
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,039
now

232
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,039
getting into actual

233
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,720
instant response work

234
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,280
building a timeline framework

235
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,759
and i specifically say framework here

236
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:30,879
because

237
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:33,440
no two timelines are the same

238
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,599
um no two tools handled the same way

239
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,599
unfortunately um there's no two time

240
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,480
zones um or time stamps out there um if

241
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,839
you're one of those lucky people who

242
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:47,600
already have a centralized blogging tool

243
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,440
and everything's already standardized

244
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,440
pat yourself in the back

245
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,880
you'll get to grab a cup of coffee this

246
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,279
is not for you um

247
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:58,080
time zones if you can't already

248
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,560
insist as much as you can to stay with

249
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,120
utc

250
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,440
we've all run into problems

251
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,080
because you've been there a few years

252
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,800
with local time zone conflicts things

253
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,160
like

254
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,720
ingest versus actual all those types of

255
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,760
things knowing that your time is a

256
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,760
actual source of truth and making sure

257
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,360
it is one standard and you know what it

258
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,959
is that consistency saves you

259
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:27,839
so much time and headache

260
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:29,279
no pun intended

261
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:30,160
now

262
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,720
formatting all right it doesn't

263
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,560
really matter if your

264
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,240
org has a format that's preferred use it

265
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,320
um don't reinvent the wheel

266
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,320
but other than that pick something that

267
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,680
works for you

268
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,480
pick an ip geolocation

269
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,880
usernames hostnames goes on and on and

270
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,480
on and on and on

271
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,160
pick a way that you want to format

272
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,160
something and then stick with it at

273
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,040
least

274
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,640
stick with it through

275
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,080
same incident

276
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,160
you can you know experiment and mess

277
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,000
with stuff and see what works and what

278
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,640
doesn't work but don't change during an

279
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,040
actual incident pick something you want

280
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,800
to keep it through that one case and

281
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,959
then all right that didn't work or that

282
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:13,920
felt awkward let's try something else

283
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,600
now because

284
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,600
going through and cleaning this up at

285
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,040
the end

286
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,760
is such a headache um

287
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,680
we're not admins if we wanted to do

288
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,800
paperwork

289
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,839
we would have probably picked a

290
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:27,839
different field um

291
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:29,680
doing this as you go

292
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,399
cleaning as you go we'll make

293
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,240
that final report those final ticket

294
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,920
summaries

295
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,040
almost

296
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,360
can't promise completely painless but

297
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,560
as as close as as close as it can be

298
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,600
now

299
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,839
your timeline specifically your timeline

300
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:47,680
is there your ticket but your timeline

301
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,640
has two main audiences so typically

302
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,800
you're going to have two types of

303
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,200
timelines one is kind of for yourself

304
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,920
because the audiences appear

305
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,399
it's your security manager it's your

306
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,000
senior analyst

307
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,600
this is your

308
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,880
log data your detailed information csv

309
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,920
files case attachments um they're gonna

310
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,399
they want they want them

311
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,120
everyone else your managers

312
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,360
or non-technical managers i should say

313
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,600
stakeholders executives they want the

314
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,440
layman's terms they want to know what

315
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,680
happened when but in a very general

316
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,640
sense

317
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,560
so this is more of a

318
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,120
time stamp single line of data

319
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,519
what happened here then this happened so

320
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,519
on and so forth that way they can kind

321
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:36,240
of get an idea of what happened

322
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,160
without having to figure out microsoft's

323
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,440
because

324
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,839
that's never

325
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:44,079
fun all right i've said this before but

326
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:45,680
i'm going to say it again

327
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,360
let the computers do the work that's why

328
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,079
we created them that's why we love them

329
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:51,440
if you can think of a niche there's

330
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,399
going to be an ir an actual dfir tool

331
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,720
that does the work um i'm not going to

332
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,279
get into the whole giant list of

333
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,120
different tools that do timeline work

334
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,639
based on events based on different types

335
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,760
of vlogs csvs all kinds of cool stuff

336
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,279
there's a ton out there

337
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:09,440
bug our friends teams about them and

338
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,800
they'll be more than happy to give you

339
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,639
some pointers and some recommended ones

340
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,120
now for the incident handling side of

341
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,399
things

342
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,399
we're going to be talking more around

343
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,880
that previous slide

344
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,240
layman's term

345
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,399
timeline so you're trying to get a

346
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,399
general sense of what's going on as

347
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:27,839
you're doing it so this is kind of for

348
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:29,440
you so you can kind of keep that

349
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,279
timeline in your head as you're going

350
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:33,040
through and scoping as you're going

351
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,800
through and doing that analytics work

352
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,120
hey did this happen before this or after

353
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,279
this do i have the right timestamps make

354
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:41,440
sure which one happened when

355
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,560
now

356
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,079
there's nothing wrong with plain text

357
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:45,360
markdown

358
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,800
it works um can't really sort filter but

359
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,320
it works um if that's something you want

360
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,519
to do it's going to be a little bit

361
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:52,399
slower

362
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:53,440
but again

363
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,040
it just works

364
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,920
excel has its place but we all know

365
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,680
excel and time

366
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,920
are you know

367
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,639
they're friends they're not really close

368
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,880
you know they misinterpret each other

369
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,600
entirely too often

370
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,399
but

371
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:12,639
if you can get it to work it will work

372
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,959
for you um there's some more fancy

373
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:16,720
things like jupiter notebooks and

374
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,160
something like me too which is kind of

375
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,720
like an embedded excel spreadsheet into

376
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,880
jupyter notebooks super cool if you're

377
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,279
into that kind of templating then

378
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:27,040
living off the lens

379
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,639
here's what you got

380
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,720
if you have a central logging tool or

381
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,040
security software that does this type of

382
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,120
work figure out what's

383
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,079
there and utilize it so things like

384
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:40,399
this timeline and microsoft defender

385
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:41,680
they've got this cool new feature you

386
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,480
could flag individual events super neat

387
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,160
super hyped it's i've been wanting for a

388
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,279
while

389
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:49,279
um having a local instance of splunk

390
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:51,920
that you can just dump the relevant

391
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,560
files in and logs as you go and it'll

392
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,360
just

393
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,199
build it for you

394
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:59,120
the same thing with local version of

395
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,240
cabana

396
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,800
arcami has some really cool filtering um

397
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,560
there's some ways to do

398
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,360
custom tables and all kinds of fun stuff

399
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,839
once you get into it but

400
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:13,120
figure out what you've got and use it

401
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,600
all right now it's time

402
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,120
to take a look at what it actually looks

403
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,519
like when we put a timeline in place

404
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:22,639
based on our kill chain

405
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,360
all right and here we go

406
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,440
now the incident premise for kill chain

407
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,279
one is a

408
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:32,240
kickoff from a potential phishing issue

409
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,120
now

410
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,440
we've already had our forensic team go

411
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,839
in and pull all the information and then

412
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:39,920
provide that to us so we're actually

413
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,240
working from a already existing

414
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,399
technical timeline and forensic analysis

415
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,160
that's already been completed our

416
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,519
forensics team

417
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:48,880
and project obsidian has done an

418
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,800
absolutely amazing job and so this makes

419
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,440
this a whole lot simpler and that's what

420
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,639
we're focusing on simplicity

421
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,440
now in my

422
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,760
incident case template here

423
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,600
i'm going to the timeline outline

424
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,279
section and i'm actually just going to

425
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,680
include the markdown

426
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,560
from

427
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,120
our forensic team of the technical

428
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,440
timeline that's already been done now

429
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,760
you can see here this is what they've

430
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,720
completed already

431
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,079
we see our lovely utc we see very clear

432
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:27,120
language in terms of

433
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,199
what i would expect to see between two

434
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:31,680
teams being shared

435
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,440
and then we're gonna keep going and we

436
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,519
see you know

437
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,839
initial access all the way through

438
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:39,360
persistence

439
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,519
some lateral movements

440
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:44,480
and even you know coming in and getting

441
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,279
some

442
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,959
yummy password files

443
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:49,040
all right now on the executive timeline

444
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,399
we're going to frame this a little bit

445
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,480
differently we're going to make sure we

446
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,240
tell them up front what time zone we're

447
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:54,880
in

448
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,399
um in magnetism magnum tempest financial

449
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,880
um they are based in san diego so we

450
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,440
selected pacific time here and we're

451
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,120
also going to want to lay out the scope

452
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,360
up front now that this didn't happen

453
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,360
over multiple days this happened over a

454
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,920
fairly narrow time frame

455
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,160
i went and i converted those utc

456
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,839
timestamps to a readable format

457
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:19,920
in terms of

458
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,120
ease of

459
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,839
knowing what it is in terms of context

460
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:26,320
i broke out the activity section and two

461
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,480
two one being a little bit more of a

462
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,639
summary of the activity and the other

463
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,800
one being the more details based off of

464
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,240
that connectivity

465
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:38,639
um you also notice that i took off

466
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:41,040
i didn't take all of them

467
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,319
i took off most

468
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,639
of the seconds

469
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,240
um

470
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,959
and that is because

471
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:53,120
we didn't actually have anything

472
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,519
fall within the exact same minute so an

473
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:58,000
ease of reading there's no need to

474
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,759
include the seconds it's extraneous

475
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:02,880
information because every single

476
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,240
line of activity in terms of this

477
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,919
timeline did happen in a different

478
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:08,799
minute if i had any duplications i would

479
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:11,039
have actually kept all of the seconds

480
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:13,039
because then you have that consistency

481
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:15,520
through the timeline but since each one

482
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,439
happened in a different minute

483
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:19,760
we can go ahead and cut those out make

484
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,959
things a little bit cleaner

485
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,679
make sure that the format all looks

486
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:28,240
pretty consistent so all of the file

487
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,200
paths

488
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,520
are in quotes with a little bit of extra

489
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,080
information at the end

490
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,640
and use the same

491
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,960
summary type wording

492
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,039
in each section

493
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:42,799
and you see that there was an unknown

494
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:48,240
timestamp and i put a caveat here i can

495
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,240
based on my experience i can look at

496
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,960
this data analysis and know

497
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,360
when this when this occurred not you

498
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,640
know 100 granted but pretty dang close

499
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,440
um this is where in the timeline i would

500
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,559
presume this activity occurred so i put

501
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,480
it there i make a little caveat and i

502
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,720
put my little notes saying hey i didn't

503
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,440
have an exact time frame but based on my

504
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,679
experience this is where this was and

505
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,280
this is why

506
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,000
i think so

507
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,400
and that is about it

508
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,440
let's get back to the presentation

509
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,440
all right now gone through timeline you

510
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,600
kind of get some tips and tricks

511
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,760
so what do good notes look like

512
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,120
all right

513
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,600
it's it's receipts it's it's cya it's

514
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,360
making sure

515
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,039
that you know what you know

516
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:39,039
all right good notes

517
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:41,440
everybody sleeps better at night you

518
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,280
sleep better at night your legal team

519
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,520
sleeps better at night your manager your

520
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,880
cso your c-suite everybody just is

521
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,960
calmer and more chill when they know

522
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,039
that they can open up an incident and

523
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:56,000
actually understand what's going on

524
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,559
i like asking myself these questions if

525
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:00,640
i'm being grilled by me

526
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,720
can i answer my questions and sometimes

527
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,320
the answer is no and i need to be like

528
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,200
okay

529
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,960
i'm going to take a step back i'm going

530
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,400
to make sure that i'm writing these

531
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,520
notes out

532
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,280
because

533
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,440
i want to know the answers to these

534
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,440
questions two months from now when i'm

535
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,440
going back and looking through these for

536
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,880
whatever reason and then on top of that

537
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,640
why are you even asking

538
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,240
why are you even being asked these

539
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,000
questions um

540
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,880
why would this come up and if you can

541
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,520
figure out that root cause why

542
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,200
then you can

543
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,280
incorporate that as you go as you're

544
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,480
building out your notes as you're

545
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,559
working your investigation and it really

546
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,080
really helps

547
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,919
now during that investigation typically

548
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:43,039
you need

549
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:45,440
to pinpoint the root cause

550
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,039
sometimes that's an estimation sometimes

551
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:49,280
that's just hey this is as far back as

552
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,240
we got this is as much information as

553
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,919
the data allows

554
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:54,960
then

555
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,440
what data points um are you going to

556
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,360
actually need to

557
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,440
do something about it like are you going

558
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,080
to

559
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,080
tune are you going to rescue hey you

560
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,159
know what i searched this sender for a

561
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:08,960
fishing email and they just sent this

562
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,039
one spearfish they sent

563
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:12,960
all these spearfishes all different

564
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,520
kinds of urls all different source key

565
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,679
addresses all right we're gonna have to

566
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:18,640
do

567
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,440
some phishing ourselves

568
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,840
cast a big net pull out all those data

569
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,080
points and that's information that we

570
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,000
will then use to rescue the

571
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,840
investigation as it's being worked

572
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,360
that's the information you're going to

573
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,120
take and

574
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,200
you know bundle up and a nice

575
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,600
here's some opportunity for tuning hey

576
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,000
why did this happen what could we do to

577
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,679
prevent it

578
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:43,600
but we can't even do that if we don't

579
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,480
have that data and then

580
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,520
finally lessons learned um

581
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,960
it's kind of nice it's nice as you're

582
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,039
going through the investigation to be

583
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:55,440
like hey you know what i really wish we

584
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,600
had a way that someone could just

585
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,600
press a button and it just reports the

586
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,320
email as fishing because then that first

587
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,559
person who just deleted it would have

588
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:06,960
been able to just hit that button and

589
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,480
then no one else would have gotten

590
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,480
phished would have been amazing now

591
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,240
writing that out as you're going through

592
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,840
your lesson as you're going through the

593
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,760
investigation it doesn't have to be a

594
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,760
lot it can just be

595
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,640
hey

596
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,440
i see a user

597
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,080
touch this email before anyone else we

598
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,880
could have stopped it further upstream

599
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,080
by

600
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,520
putting some tools in the hands of our

601
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,840
users that's a way to lessons learned

602
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,360
you don't have to go

603
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,600
in crazy detail it can just be a simple

604
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,840
note to self so that when you uh when

605
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,039
you are going back through your

606
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:41,280
investigation notes you can have that

607
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,440
little ding of light bulb and go yeah

608
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,360
let's see what that entails and actually

609
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,200
flush out the questions learned and the

610
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,440
potential solutions to

611
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,919
help you not have to do all of this work

612
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:54,320
again now

613
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,960
basic core for good notes if they can't

614
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,440
explain why you did a thing you need to

615
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,120
include it you need your reasoning and

616
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,799
your proof

617
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:04,640
if you purge an email

618
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,440
why did you do it um hey it's a fish

619
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,440
okay well

620
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,039
i closed the ticket all right well why

621
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:12,480
did you close the tissue well spam not

622
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,880
fishing huh can you tell me why

623
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,280
tell me why you think that this is what

624
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,200
it is it doesn't have to be a lot it

625
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,320
doesn't have to be

626
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,799
going deep deep deep into the weeds but

627
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:25,360
it does have to have enough so that way

628
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:29,520
again you can answer these questions

629
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,840
all right because

630
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,840
notes are for your protection

631
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,320
i mentioned that this is cya before

632
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,159
if something is missed or you make a

633
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:40,320
mistake or your train of thought just

634
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,720
completely misses a loop which happens

635
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,640
it is perfectly normal and

636
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,200
sock land someone else should be able to

637
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,280
read through your notes and read through

638
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,360
your tickets and go oh yeah they just

639
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,200
didn't know they weren't aware of this

640
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,760
so this is something

641
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,080
lessons learned for the investigation

642
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,320
we'll give them that training we'll hey

643
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,320
make sure you check this next time and

644
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,080
it won't happen again but you're not

645
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,600
going to get

646
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,679
noah is going to be upset with you no

647
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:11,039
one's going to be cranky or

648
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:13,280
at all they're just going to go

649
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:16,880
oh hey yeah um i see exactly what you

650
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,960
did just next time when you get to this

651
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,080
stage

652
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,760
you know make sure you include this

653
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,880
that's it

654
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,240
they're like oh cool

655
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,080
learn something

656
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,280
you know that i'm not going to do this

657
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,320
again

658
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,840
everybody's happy

659
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,440
and then

660
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,120
bringing up audits again

661
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,799
if you're having to pull from memory to

662
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:37,919
answer questions or go through your

663
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:40,000
lovely lovely rough saved plain text

664
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,919
notes if you don't have them notes of

665
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:43,440
shame

666
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,640
you're not going to have a good time

667
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,080
it's going to take a long time the

668
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,400
auditor is going to be mad sad and sad

669
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,799
schmad and miserable you're gonna be sad

670
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:53,520
and miserable it's just not a good time

671
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,840
make sure your notes are there and

672
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,840
thorough so that way you're not having

673
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,080
to stop doing instant work to go and

674
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,600
talk to an auditor about an incident

675
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:05,039
that happened six months ago your notes

676
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:08,000
are your save button because

677
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,679
as you're going through the notes

678
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:12,720
especially those of us who work you know

679
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,520
very weird hours or have multiple shifts

680
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,080
or people who have weird off days or

681
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:22,080
that lovely 24 7 365 that's fun split

682
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,240
shifts um your notes are your save

683
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,039
button

684
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:27,520
if you are compiling all of this locally

685
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,279
and you're not adding in comments to

686
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:31,840
your ticket or into the actual incident

687
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,679
case

688
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:35,200
and something happens and you know an

689
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,960
emergency pops up and you're gonna have

690
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,799
to deal with your kid

691
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:41,279
or anything that could possibly happen

692
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,520
um someone else is gonna have to go and

693
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,600
reinvent the wheel and go through from

694
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,120
the last thing that happened that you

695
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,159
actually notated and

696
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:52,640
power through it themselves um if you

697
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,440
are

698
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,600
saving as you go um sometimes they even

699
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,240
set a timer on it just like hey every 10

700
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,480
minutes i need to go and write a

701
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,120
quick blip on what's going on

702
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,559
different time frames for different

703
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:05,760
severity

704
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,679
you can get pretty fun with it

705
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:10,559
but the biggest thing is

706
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:13,440
note it as it happens because

707
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,000
if you are like this example says six

708
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,320
hours into instant response

709
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,320
and you are trying to remember why did i

710
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,640
add this ip address

711
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,240
and it's fifth and you've been going

712
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,240
through hundreds of them

713
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,159
it's it's not going to be a good time

714
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:29,919
you're going to have to go back and try

715
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:30,720
and

716
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,520
retrace your own steps to figure it out

717
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,400
and

718
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,240
it's going to take a lot more time that

719
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,480
you could be doing spending

720
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:42,039
not doing this

721
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:46,400
right now it is time for our next demo

722
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,240
all right here is demo number two this

723
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,200
is the same kill chain same premise

724
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,559
we are just going to go through the

725
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:55,039
analysis reports and cover a little bit

726
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:56,960
of the details on

727
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,640
why the decisions were made that they

728
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,960
made and why the information is

729
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,720
formatted the way it is

730
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,919
um

731
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:06,080
here we are

732
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,640
now we have a

733
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,159
full

734
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:12,400
workstation analysis here now this is

735
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,960
what is hey i see a i have a known

736
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,440
indicator i'm now going to go through

737
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,200
this particular device with a fine tooth

738
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,360
comb and find anything related to that

739
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,880
or anything that stands out as

740
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,760
suspicious or suspect

741
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,600
we have a

742
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,880
one piece of many forensic analysis so

743
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,840
this is one of six i believe forensic

744
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,000
analysis and these all get pieced

745
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,039
together

746
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:39,360
because to be

747
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,400
one greater analysis on the whole kill

748
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,640
chain including all the persistence and

749
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,880
the multiple segways to different hosts

750
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,279
and different user accounts

751
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:51,120
and then we have

752
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,760
a quote it's just a blank template this

753
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,679
is where i put case notes this isn't the

754
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:57,200
actual

755
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,000
analysis but this is where i would be

756
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,919
putting information

757
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:03,440
as i'm actively running the

758
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,919
investigation as i'm getting asked

759
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:08,559
questions as i'm completing status

760
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:11,200
updates as i'm running queries

761
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,960
i'm going to be putting it in some place

762
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,679
that i know where each point is and

763
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:17,440
where it's organized

764
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,320
and

765
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,559
easy to access

766
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:24,399
like duper notebook because of the

767
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:27,200
modularity of it i would say um but

768
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,799
there's tons and tons of different

769
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:31,039
options out there um i think the most

770
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:32,480
that you see from

771
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,240
project obsidian is going to be a lot of

772
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,000
markdown

773
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,159
and i sparked on two just

774
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:41,120
jupiter notebook alongside code as well

775
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,159
let's go back to the analysis and

776
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:46,399
here we are so for this when you're just

777
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:50,480
going through and this is basically a

778
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,799
single workstation analysis you're gonna

779
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:55,120
have the timeline events based on that

780
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:58,080
one post and then the clues conclusion

781
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,679
on that host

782
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:02,960
and any findings that got discovered

783
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,360
through it

784
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:08,240
and so we see all of that in here oh i'm

785
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,600
not gonna scroll that's that's a lot

786
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,120
that's a whole lot

787
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,480
um

788
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,000
but it includes things like this like

789
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,200
the cyber stuff

790
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,600
cyber chef recipe he used in order to

791
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,960
decode that

792
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,720
that's something that i grab as well any

793
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,200
query anything that you do to transform

794
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,799
data you want to make sure you put a

795
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:28,480
record of that because again

796
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,159
it'll be six months later and then be

797
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:32,399
like hey yeah i saw you did this and how

798
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:34,000
do you get from point a to point b and

799
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,440
you're just like oh i've i have slept

800
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,279
since then i do not remember

801
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:39,520
that is why we write things down um we

802
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,000
write things down so that way

803
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,880
if our memories fail us we have

804
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,840
evidence and proof and records of what

805
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,080
we did at that particular time

806
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,679
then this

807
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:54,159
last analysis this is a really good

808
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:56,399
format i like this one a whole lot

809
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:59,760
this one establishes the scope of the

810
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,200
analysis first

811
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,360
um so the baseline of what you're trying

812
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,399
to do

813
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:07,600
the scope of the host and user

814
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,039
then pulls all the other users

815
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:10,799
associated with it

816
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:13,039
timeline that we're looking at

817
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:16,080
the artifact that triggered this

818
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:19,120
analysis in the first place

819
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,880
and then hey yeah what did i actually

820
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,279
search on this i pulled the logs i

821
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:25,520
looked and the windows event logs

822
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,760
i went and looked at the

823
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,880
windows system services as well

824
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,600
and i pulled memory forensics

825
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,240
so in terms of what happened here i know

826
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,960
all the places that i checked i know

827
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,559
anything that i found that was related

828
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:43,440
to this as well as my initial assessment

829
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,840
or even my final assessment

830
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,520
of what i believe that to be

831
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:52,000
in relation to the greater incident so

832
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
in this particular case this workstation

833
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,039
six yeah he got an email he forwarded

834
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:58,559
that along to have someone else do some

835
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:00,720
analysis on the email he didn't actually

836
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,399
open it or download it or trigger

837
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:05,600
anything suspicious on his actual device

838
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,440
however we did find something

839
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,399
interesting

840
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:10,799
through this process

841
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:12,320
as discovered

842
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:15,039
this user has a plain text passwords.txt

843
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:17,440
file so things that pop out at you while

844
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,000
you're going through you know

845
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,240
created or recently updated files which

846
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,159
is believe what this

847
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:26,960
triggered and got this into

848
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,279
the eye of our forensic

849
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:31,520
forensic

850
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,240
analyst here um which is this this

851
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,679
password file this is not something you

852
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:37,120
want to see

853
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,760
on somebody's somebody's desktop

854
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,360
especially being recently updated

855
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,679
especially being in upper level titles

856
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:46,320
this particular user is in leadership

857
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,679
and also is an

858
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,360
i.t leadership

859
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,799
so the likelihood of there's something

860
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:52,000
being

861
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,039
you know very sensitive in this file is

862
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:55,919
high

863
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:57,840
so this is something you want to kind of

864
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,679
either make a note of and then come back

865
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:02,559
to later or

866
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:04,640
you know if you have the time during the

867
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,240
incident you've already put out all the

868
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,600
other fires by fires um go in take a

869
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,919
look just like this pull the source pull

870
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:14,399
the extra information that way

871
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:16,320
when you're doing the report this can be

872
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,960
added on as a part of the lessons

873
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:22,399
learned or part of the

874
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:24,159
points of interest or solutions

875
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:26,799
recommendations provided to the client

876
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:29,760
or to the leadership

877
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,559
all right and that is about that let's

878
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:34,799
get back

879
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:38,559
color commentary and play by play now

880
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:41,120
are you sick of my analogies yet

881
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,200
i love them it's a way to translate

882
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,640
what's happening my brain to other

883
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,519
people

884
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:48,000
i try to use them i love this analogy

885
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,919
this is one of my favorite ones i feel

886
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:51,279
like this is one of the things that

887
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:53,200
sports does really well

888
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,919
i love lovely sports bay sports ball

889
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:57,519
go team

890
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:01,919
get the ball score a goal things

891
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:03,360
there's usually two announcers if you're

892
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,880
watching a game on tv or you're

893
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,720
listening to it on the radio you're

894
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,799
going to typically hear two voices with

895
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:11,039
whatever game there is sometimes there's

896
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:13,760
more there's always at least two

897
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,039
one of them is considered the

898
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:18,320
play-by-play announcer they are

899
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,240
describing it as it happens if you are

900
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,760
not watching the tv if you're just

901
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,039
listening to it

902
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:25,200
you can actually follow along with them

903
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,799
and know what's happening at any one

904
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:29,760
point in time it's that simple they're

905
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,640
just describing it as it happens

906
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,120
literally what it what's happening

907
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:35,919
now

908
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:38,080
your other person is our color

909
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:41,760
commentate color commentary i can speak

910
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,519
all right they're going to provide

911
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:45,120
additional information around the

912
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,440
players and the actions they're going to

913
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,399
be

914
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:50,320
doing things like hey what is that

915
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,559
coaching decision what what's the

916
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:54,720
context around

917
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,880
the actions that are actually happening

918
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:00,000
um this person missed a goal but

919
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,600
he had an injury

920
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,120
all those types of things before you're

921
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,320
adding

922
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,960
additional depth to the actual literal

923
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,960
things that are happening as it happens

924
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,640
now the reason why they do too is

925
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,880
because it works it's a really effective

926
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:15,519
combination where you have your

927
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:17,039
facts laid out

928
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:19,200
right alongside someone

929
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,240
giving you more detail and more personal

930
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:25,600
opinion or most the time expert opinion

931
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,720
call it that and then you kind of get

932
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,480
what you need out of it

933
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,760
um

934
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,080
you can be both you know a newcomer to

935
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,399
the game as well as you know a super

936
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:39,200
super intense fan and understand what's

937
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:42,159
happening and get as much or as little

938
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:45,120
from this type of commentary

939
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,440
as it's actually happening it's pretty

940
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,760
effective and there's a reason why

941
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,880
it's super super common

942
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,080
now

943
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,679
oh

944
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:58,559
now we apply that to notes

945
00:33:58,559 --> 00:33:59,360
you're going to have your color

946
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,640
commentary and you're going to have your

947
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,360
play by play your color commentary

948
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,559
typically you're going to want to

949
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:07,039
restrict this to just your team

950
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:08,480
you're not going to want to have this

951
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:11,280
visible outside of your security team or

952
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,440
your stock team or sock department

953
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,359
depends on what it is you know your

954
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:17,040
group best

955
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,280
make sure it is

956
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,079
a internal discussion but it is

957
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:24,239
important to have it because that color

958
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:26,960
commentary is

959
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,879
how we can

960
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:30,960
talk to these different ideas and

961
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,239
understand

962
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:35,040
the depth of oh okay this is this is the

963
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,800
why behind this but

964
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,520
it's kind of we're only like 80 sure so

965
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,800
we're not gonna like

966
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,480
bring those out to the whole public

967
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,918
we're gonna you're gonna keep this

968
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:45,760
internally but it's important for

969
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,079
especially newer members or people who

970
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:50,639
aren't um doing incidents as frequently

971
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:52,879
to have that extra information because

972
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:54,480
that way they can

973
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,079
learn from

974
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:57,920
everyone else's work it's really really

975
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,119
important

976
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:01,920
again be professional this isn't color

977
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:05,119
doesn't mean color in terms of you know

978
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:08,720
colorful language um but it you include

979
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,280
your honest professional opinion um some

980
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,960
tools out there include gifs all kinds

981
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,079
of fun stuff

982
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:17,119
but the idea is that you're adding depth

983
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:18,960
to the facts

984
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,960
background interesting pieces of

985
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,320
information

986
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,200
all right

987
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,359
enough on that then we get into

988
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:26,720
play-by-play

989
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,960
i want the facts and just the facts um

990
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,680
you're going to need a neutral tone we

991
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:34,560
do not want any extra drama we don't

992
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:37,040
want someone panicking about you know

993
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,200
some intel tidbit that you included in

994
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,599
it this is literally this is the order

995
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:42,880
of events this is the order of

996
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,640
operations of what happened

997
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,480
here we are now the different types of

998
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:49,359
this typically are status updates shift

999
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:51,839
reports um

1000
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:53,440
pause summaries

1001
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,920
and client updates now so you're not

1002
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,520
always going to be doing this depending

1003
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,200
on your role but these are the three

1004
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:03,040
most common types of external facing

1005
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,480
communicators

1006
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,440
now

1007
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,079
be very very very careful

1008
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:10,880
that you know who sees what

1009
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,520
make sure you test it be sure you know

1010
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,960
that

1011
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,400
there's two different types of ticket

1012
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,320
notes and one is internal one is

1013
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,640
external always double check before you

1014
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,960
post stuff in because you want to make

1015
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,160
sure

1016
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,160
the lines are clean and the people who

1017
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,000
get the information are getting the

1018
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,599
exact information that they need and

1019
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:32,320
nothing more

1020
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,240
all right speaking of

1021
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:37,040
uh vulcans here all right outward facing

1022
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:40,000
notes no opinions only facts

1023
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,680
we know that something's a breach we

1024
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,520
know that something's a compromise we

1025
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,440
can tell that someone from russia logged

1026
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,000
into this user account

1027
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,400
but we have to say that in a

1028
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,760
correct or proper wording

1029
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,599
a good old legal team

1030
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:58,079
not gonna be too pleased with you

1031
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:01,119
so unless it is literally your job to

1032
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:04,160
make that decision and use the actual

1033
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,200
words

1034
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:08,240
just don't do it um

1035
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:11,280
prefixes i've got some lovely peas down

1036
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:14,400
below possible potential puffs

1037
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,400
uh these are all fun things that some of

1038
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,800
you might have seen and understand quite

1039
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,839
why someone is using this why someone's

1040
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:24,640
qualifying um the term compromiser reach

1041
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,160
and that's because this type of soft

1042
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,720
wording describes what's happening

1043
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:31,599
so you understand what what the thing is

1044
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:33,920
but you're not using a word that

1045
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,839
actually has a regulatory or legal

1046
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:38,000
meaning the term breach the term

1047
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,640
incident those actually have

1048
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:44,160
meanings that can start sla timers and

1049
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,720
compliance timers and you don't want to

1050
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,480
be the one accidentally starting that

1051
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:51,920
timer and having everyone else rush to

1052
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,440
go complete

1053
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,119
in order to get it done in time so that

1054
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:58,720
way that org is not facing fines or

1055
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:01,359
more audits or whatever the case may be

1056
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:04,480
so things like security event

1057
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,320
unauthorized access

1058
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,160
you know we don't use the term incident

1059
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,000
we don't use the term reach don't use

1060
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,480
the term compromise not without saying

1061
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,320
possible or potential

1062
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:17,040
things like that um yes it's kind of

1063
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,599
silly yes it seems silly

1064
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:21,920
but if you go through it and you get

1065
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,040
used to it

1066
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,520
it makes everyone happy you add an extra

1067
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,760
word in the legal's happy because they

1068
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,320
can have a greater degree of control

1069
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,720
over when those timers start and when

1070
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,560
they have to deal with regulatory

1071
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,680
agencies and

1072
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:41,599
legal contractual obligations

1073
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:43,280
all right now

1074
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:46,640
time for our last demo

1075
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,640
all right last but not least here's demo

1076
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,000
number three we're just going to

1077
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,400
continue our look through those same

1078
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,720
analysis files we're going to

1079
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,760
talk about it a different way we're

1080
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,280
going to explain why

1081
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,599
they framed things the way they did and

1082
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:03,280
the word choices things like that

1083
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:06,240
all right now let's get back to where we

1084
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,839
were

1085
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:11,839
on workstation six analysis now

1086
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:12,720
the

1087
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,480
framing of this like i mentioned this is

1088
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,720
really nice but the reason why is be

1089
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,480
like hey what what this is what i'm

1090
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:21,359
trying to do i am trying to review it

1091
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:23,760
and identify indicators specifically for

1092
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:26,079
the compromise and then we're going to

1093
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:27,359
at first

1094
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:29,680
this is a baseline i i really love this

1095
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,359
like i think this is really good because

1096
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:32,640
you're setting your expectations up

1097
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,079
front like hey when you're reading

1098
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:36,560
through this this is what i am

1099
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,560
attempting to do through

1100
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,480
this document um it's very very

1101
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,680
important it's the reason why they've

1102
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:44,079
got the tldrs at the tops of things why

1103
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:46,000
you have summaries

1104
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,640
because it really helps set the tone for

1105
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:51,040
the rest of

1106
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,800
the document or the rest of whatever it

1107
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,800
is that you're trying to do

1108
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:58,400
now he clearly again states the scope um

1109
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,960
and then this is a little bit of color

1110
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,960
here so yes here's this

1111
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,240
um

1112
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,160
it's important to review the users this

1113
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,000
we know that this is the user and this

1114
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,839
is the workstation that we care about

1115
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:11,920
but we are going to pull

1116
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:14,560
the users associated with this

1117
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,480
time frame that we're aware of and this

1118
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,960
particular host and make sure that we're

1119
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:22,480
you know covering all our bases

1120
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:25,040
we have

1121
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,440
a good timeline i like

1122
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,440
the wording on this because this is very

1123
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,760
um

1124
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,960
i have to say i have to say warm um it's

1125
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,640
a way of

1126
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,560
summarizing the event

1127
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:41,040
without

1128
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,280
making it a little bit too clinical

1129
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,880
instead of being like

1130
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,200
log on cara mutants this is what they

1131
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,160
did

1132
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,400
here we are um

1133
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,680
the

1134
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,760
making things into sentences

1135
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,160
really helps people

1136
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,839
picture things in their heads

1137
00:40:57,839 --> 00:40:59,200
and that's what we're trying to do here

1138
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,920
um for a timeline especially a kind of a

1139
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,720
summary timeline like this one is

1140
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,240
you want to be able to read through it

1141
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:07,760
and kind of have a picture of your in

1142
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,319
your head of the point a to point b to

1143
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:11,599
point c

1144
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:13,680
and be able to have that visualization

1145
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,359
which is really important it's like

1146
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:16,640
emails

1147
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,599
hey

1148
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:20,079
what not to do um these are summaries

1149
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:22,000
and all of this information we have

1150
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,720
those email columns we have those logs

1151
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:27,359
and those are available to us

1152
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:30,400
but this is that nice summary then we go

1153
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,720
through each artifact and the properties

1154
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:35,040
of those um there's really nothing much

1155
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,880
to do in terms of

1156
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,640
color this is facts like this is the

1157
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,160
thing

1158
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,240
um but when we get into log review this

1159
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:43,359
is where we are doing some

1160
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:45,359
interpretation so hey we looked up the

1161
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:48,319
windows event logs if you're in security

1162
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:50,560
we see something odd

1163
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,319
but

1164
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:53,839
it's not

1165
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:55,760
that odd and if not

1166
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,520
we can't link it to the rest of the kill

1167
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:00,319
chain so here's the fact and the

1168
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:02,400
assessment of that fact is yeah it's

1169
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,160
it's not

1170
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,520
good

1171
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,920
but it's not necessarily malicious and

1172
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,560
this nothing substantial

1173
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:11,680
um

1174
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:14,240
makes makes that makes it exactly right

1175
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,319
i guess this is unusual enough to where

1176
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:18,400
i'm going to include this

1177
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,000
in my analysis

1178
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,720
but i make sure that yes

1179
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:26,079
i don't see that this is related to

1180
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:28,240
the greater kill chain events because

1181
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:29,760
that's the goal right because that's

1182
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:32,720
what we're trying to focus on

1183
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:35,760
continues the same same thing on with no

1184
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,800
systems hey yeah i'm seeing defender is

1185
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:39,920
running

1186
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,760
the assessment is

1187
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,520
unlikely malware is on there memory

1188
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:46,160
forensics i went through all the memory

1189
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:48,880
i didn't see anything suspicious

1190
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:51,200
this miscellaneous concern great wording

1191
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:54,160
by the way um

1192
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:56,160
it's not necessarily a

1193
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,599
security

1194
00:42:57,599 --> 00:42:59,520
incident itself um but this is

1195
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:02,000
definitely something we'd want to

1196
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,720
include in our notes and probably maybe

1197
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,960
like ask your manager like hey you know

1198
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:09,359
i was going through this uh i saw that

1199
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:11,920
brad has a um plain text passwords file

1200
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:14,480
on this desktop just was right there

1201
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:16,480
couldn't could not see it

1202
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:17,839
um

1203
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:19,760
can you mention something or

1204
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:22,640
starting that conversation so that way

1205
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,400
things that could be a potential risk to

1206
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:27,119
the organization like a plain text file

1207
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:30,960
or an it manager or director i believe

1208
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,000
you're going to want to get that

1209
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
addressed um because

1210
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,800
while we enjoy investigations um we also

1211
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,800
like sleep so

1212
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:41,040
god i gotta balance those

1213
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,760
gotta balance those two things out

1214
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:46,960
all right let's get back to it

1215
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,920
and it's all at once this is the tldr of

1216
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,520
everything that i just went over

1217
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,680
preparations and lessons learned are not

1218
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:55,359
just for

1219
00:43:55,359 --> 00:43:57,839
the organization as a whole

1220
00:43:57,839 --> 00:44:00,560
an individual analyst can get just as

1221
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:03,119
much out of those if not more and it

1222
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:05,839
will help your work quality and honestly

1223
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:06,960
just

1224
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:08,800
make you less stressed it'll make you

1225
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,200
more confident and you'll feel better

1226
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:13,359
overall handling tickets and handling

1227
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:14,960
incidents when they have it because

1228
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:17,920
you'll be prepared you'll feel like you

1229
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:19,119
actually someone know what you're doing

1230
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:21,760
when everything's on fire it's great

1231
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:22,960
these knees in place kind of

1232
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,440
self-checklists can help you identify

1233
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,760
all the stuff you need ahead of time so

1234
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:30,240
that way you can address those gaps

1235
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:32,640
before they become blockers during an

1236
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:34,079
actual incident

1237
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:34,960
and then

1238
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,400
utc is best time

1239
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:40,240
always best girl do dc it's the best

1240
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,160
write what you do and as

1241
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:45,119
and you think as you do it and think

1242
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:47,280
um you want to stream a consciousness

1243
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:48,720
your notes and then

1244
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,480
tidy them up a little bit

1245
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,319
put them in your ticket and smash that

1246
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:54,240
save button that's going to keep

1247
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:57,040
everything all nice and tight and then

1248
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:58,720
if you need to actually hand off an

1249
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:00,640
incident you're not spending an hour

1250
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:01,680
trying to

1251
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,680
summarize your notes or go through

1252
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:05,040
everything and

1253
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:07,359
hand it off to the next person it's

1254
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:08,880
already there you're like oh yeah no let

1255
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:11,119

1256
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:12,400
and hop that in

1257
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:14,079

1259
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:18,240
be nice back i promise they're not scary

1260
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,079
they're super chill people they just

1261
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:23,920
have an entirely different set of

1262
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:26,160
ah what's the term

1263
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:28,240
obligations there we are obligations

1264
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:30,960
then what we are focused on and if we

1265
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:32,560
can make them happy

1266
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,400
they will then have our backs

1267
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,240

1268
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,800
