1
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,639
hi everyone

2
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:13,200
first thank you of coming this is

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,240
incredible there's significantly more

4
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,340
people than I ever expected

5
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:19,800
um yeah Full House and overflowing

6
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,420
amazing

7
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:22,740
right

8
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,900
okay should I take my mask off to speak

9
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,240
if people are okay with that

10
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,980
okay

11
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:32,040
um yeah so meet Lucy Lucy is the name of

12
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,660
our quantum computer

13
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,239
and we're going to go through

14
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,239
how to build a Honda computer on the

15
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:43,260
hardware level so comparing uh the

16
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:44,940
classical Hardware stack and the quantum

17
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,879
stack at each stage and seeing how they

18
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:50,039
compare

19
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:52,200
so I am a software engineer Oxford

20
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,000
Quantum circuits just for a bit of

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,059
background on me I come from an academic

22
00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:00,059
quantum theory Theory background and

23
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:01,379
then did spent some time as a web

24
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:04,140
developer and now I'm a Oxford quantum

25
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,020
merging these two fields of My Life

26
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,299
um if people are interested in getting

27
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:12,000
involved just in the quantum World there

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,700
is no unique path as I'm sure many of

29
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,820
people in security know a long time

30
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,580
there was no you know fixed path into

31
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,560
security it's the same in Quantum it's

32
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,180
very nascent

33
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:26,340
if you're interested yeah you can get

34
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,680
involved

35
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,780
um yeah so who we are we're based in

36
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,000
Reading which

37
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,759
our taxi driver thinks that a 30-minute

38
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,040
train makes it a suburb of London it is

39
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,320
its own town in its own right

40
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,100
um

41
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,439
but yeah we're based in South reading we

42
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,119
build quantum computers from there on

43
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,820
site in Thames Valley Science Park

44
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,460
and our goal is to bring Quantum

45
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,680
Computing to as many people as possible

46
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,840
that's very important to us we don't

47
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,399
want to lock it away

48
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,040
behind excessive paywalling or exclusive

49
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,299
access we're trying to bring it to as

50
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:02,100
many people as we can

51
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,960
there's a lot of chat on the

52
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,820
democratization of quantum Computing we

53
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:08,038
want to bring it to as many as we can

54
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:10,318
uh so a quick run through of the

55
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,599
timeline of our company

56
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:16,319
uh Cucas so Quantum Computing as a

57
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,900
service we delivered this in July of

58
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,000
2021

59
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,780
um

60
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:25,680
from there we launched on AWS in

61
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,280
February of this year so you can at any

62
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,220
time if you have an AWS account log into

63
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,860
the bracket service and access our

64
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,200
computer through there

65
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,000
um and yeah we're the first not just

66
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,800
first we're first non-north American

67
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,060
company

68
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:45,239
and we were quite quite proud of that

69
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:48,120
and we've just just finished our series

70
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,480
a round of 38 million so we're going to

71
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,220
do some very exciting things now we've

72
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,980
got a big chunk of money under our belts

73
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:56,819
um

74
00:02:56,819 --> 00:03:00,420
with the University of Tokyo which if

75
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,940
anyone knows as VC goes

76
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:03,599
um

77
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,640
they do very strict diligence due

78
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,560
diligence so we've we've had our

79
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,400
credentials tested

80
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,180
cool

81
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:15,900
so here's a a quick system overview what

82
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,760
what does a

83
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,220
Hardware companies sorry before I get

84
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,319
going I must say any questions just

85
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,420
raise your hand I'll get to them this is

86
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:27,540
meant open discussion on Hardware any

87
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,060
questions throw them up uh if you're on

88
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,560
the quantum Village Discord as well

89
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,900
there is a Lucy Channel throw them in

90
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,220
there and there'll be someone keeping an

91
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,120
eye on

92
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,739
so if you don't want to speak out loud

93
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:39,659
you can throw it in our Discord and I'll

94
00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:42,239
answer those as well

95
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,900
cool so the hardware stack at the minute

96
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,780
this is this is Lucy a picture of Lucy

97
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,819
as you can see this you don't really get

98
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:53,220
a scale but that's a full server rack

99
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:56,599
and so this fridge

100
00:03:56,599 --> 00:03:59,459
that is the fridge it maybe sounds three

101
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:02,580
meters tall so we're you know in the old

102
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,440
IBM Mainframe days where you're taking

103
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,720
up an entire room for your computer

104
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,340
we maybe have

105
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:10,260
one or two server racks and a massive

106
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,720
fridge so not really something we can

107
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,700
put in people's homes yet

108
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:17,399
so Cloud access is

109
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:19,820
uh the main way there are a few places

110
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:23,580
very very that will put place a quantum

111
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,080
computer into

112
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,040
uh I saw some premises for direct access

113
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,960
but for us Cloud access brings it to as

114
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,419
many people as possible

115
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:33,960
um

116
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,419
that's access then we hit the uh the

117
00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:38,460
actual quantum computer

118
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:41,820
so you hit our compiler first that's why

119
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,580
I spend a lot of my time working on the

120
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:47,160
um Quantum compiler you take we'll take

121
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,800
a look at some Chasm uh Mark show this

122
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,600
earlier this is quantum Assembly

123
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,820
Language we are very much in the

124
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:57,000
assembly era of you declare a register

125
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,540
and you operate on bits and you declare

126
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,759
individual operations

127
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:05,580
um so we take that in our compiler we

128
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,500
perform many Transformations and

129
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,960
optimizations

130
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,900
uh and spit out some you know byte code

131
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:15,240
effectively

132
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,740
um

133
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,780
then we have the control stack so that's

134
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,639
what you can see here on the left side

135
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,280
this large server rack

136
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,979
this is what actually controls and

137
00:05:25,979 --> 00:05:27,780
manipulates the state of the quantum

138
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:32,880
computer so this is all uh FPA GA driven

139
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,479
or you know custom firmware and logic

140
00:05:35,479 --> 00:05:38,820
and then microwave control lines

141
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:42,720
and readout so our IO is you know very

142
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,520
simple we basically have an in and out

143
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,680
and that's your i o

144
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,520
uh and then finally the actual qpu so

145
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,680
with Quantum processor unit is the

146
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,900
analog analogous to the central

147
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,280
processors unit

148
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,100
and that sits

149
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,600
about there

150
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,080
uh and that's where the actual Quantum

151
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,820
magic happens so I shouldn't say magic

152
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,919
it's not magical woo it's very easily on

153
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:09,240
sandal

154
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,860
if I say magic someone tell me off

155
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:16,560
okay again right into

156
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,919
the very lowest layer the qpu

157
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:22,259
architecture and layout

158
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:24,479
so this is very much analogous to

159
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,240
classical transistor design and CPU

160
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,520
layout design

161
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,699
so at Oxford Quantum circuits we are a

162
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:35,000
superconducting qubit company

163
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,319
Continuum are also in the room unless we

164
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:40,380
can ask me they're an iron Trap Company

165
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,419
I've been British and BBC other Hardware

166
00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:44,819
providers are available

167
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:47,039
um but yeah we do superconducting I'll

168
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,259
go into that in a minute

169
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:51,360
um and this is the same level as the

170
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,360
transistor in your CPU so that's where

171
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,639
the we are designing

172
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:57,960
uh

173
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,360
what the effectively what the transistor

174
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,720
looks like

175
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,979
I'll go a bit later I'll go into so this

176
00:07:04,979 --> 00:07:08,639
is our core IP it's called the coaxman

177
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,660
so you notice our qubits there's the

178
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,400
blue transmon

179
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,440
our control port and a measurement Port

180
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,419
are coaxly connected so they come in

181
00:07:18,419 --> 00:07:20,160
from the top and the bottom

182
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,259
so instead of our microwave lines have

183
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:23,940
to come in like transversely and you

184
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,560
have to root microwave lines through one

185
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,460
another

186
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:27,840
we just connect straight through into

187
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,940
the top and that means that as we scale

188
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,199
out we're not having to redesign

189
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,479
microwave control lines every time we

190
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:35,880
build a new processor we just go

191
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,740
horizontally

192
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,360
so this is what I think of as Cloud

193
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,639
horizontal scaling

194
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:43,080
um

195
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,539
and then next we're going to see if you

196
00:07:45,539 --> 00:07:46,680
set up

197
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,900
but yeah so

198
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:51,240
what this gives us as well one issue

199
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,880
we'll go into these are microwave Drive

200
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:57,300
pulses that's quite hard to contain so

201
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,400
when you have Fields coming in sideways

202
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,860
you get leakage right there you drive

203
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:05,400
one qubit and another one is impacted

204
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,860
and so we have very very low crosstalk

205
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:10,620
which is a big source of noise from this

206
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:13,259
architecture and we get scaling

207
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:16,020
uh I said you have ion traps which

208
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:20,120
Continuum use uh there and you get

209
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:23,400
photonic based systems as well Diamond

210
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,220
based systems so Diamond you have a

211
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:28,560
nitrogen instead of a carbon and a gap

212
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,720
where some electrons stick out and then

213
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,360
you have that is a qubit as well so some

214
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,159
solid state devices are coming up as

215
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:37,338
well

216
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,940
so what is a qubit

217
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,680
um

218
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,080
it's a two level system

219
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,320
so you think of uh a binary bit you have

220
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,260
naught or one in a Quantum system in a

221
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,600
qubit system we also have naught or one

222
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,720
but we also have the superposition of

223
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,640
Norton one

224
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,140
which is

225
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,700
partly where the quantum power comes

226
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,980
from the main point you also have is the

227
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:13,200
entanglement between two qubits which is

228
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,660
where you have uh greater correlations

229
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,940
than is possible classically Continuum

230
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,320
will go much more into the algorithm

231
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,500
side of quantum computing

232
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,339
um

233
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:26,279
but what we do is we create a two level

234
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:28,380
system there's effectively what a trans1

235
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:31,080
is is an artificial atom

236
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,180
and atoms you have a ground state in an

237
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:35,220
atom and you can excite it into the

238
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,920
first excited state of the atom those

239
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,720
are our two levels in the ground system

240
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,720
and we're building fake atoms in order

241
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,920
to make these qubits

242
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:50,339
okay so the next step once we have

243
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:54,540
decided on our transistor or our qubit

244
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:57,720
architecture we have to connect them up

245
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:01,019
and this is very much the the analogy

246
00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:04,260
here is uh your CPU layout you know

247
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:06,120
there's a lot of cool images now of the

248
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,820
new M series atom processors and how you

249
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,080
arrange

250
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,820
you know the the the the different

251
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,560
chords you have

252
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:17,700
and it's something quite similar here uh

253
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:21,480
in in how you connect up your computer

254
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,180
so one thing that we don't get in

255
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,620
Quantum Computing that you get in Castle

256
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:28,560
Computing is Trivial no I don't sorry

257
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,320
not trivial but easy individual

258
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,300
addressability of bits

259
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,040
every bit

260
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,940
so this is one Cube

261
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:42,000
qubit zero one two three four five six

262
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,260
seven

263
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:45,600
so all these individual qubits need to

264
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,700
be addressed individually

265
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,620
and if you know we drive these things

266
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,839
with so we drive a bit flip from naught

267
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:54,360
to one with a microwave pulse in order

268
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,880
to maintain that when you drive a single

269
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,160
qubit it only drives that qubit they

270
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,540
need to be addressed on different

271
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,540
frequencies

272
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:05,220
and those frequencies are determined by

273
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:08,640
the properties of uh

274
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,140
of

275
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:12,420
of the transmon to different widths and

276
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,940
different fabrication processes change

277
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:17,160
the frequency with with which it's

278
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,699
addressed

279
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:23,279
and so we that there's a an interplay

280
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:24,680
here so continue will go into

281
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,180
entanglement so we have

282
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:29,060
a sense of two-bit operations

283
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:31,320
effectively if you want to interact two

284
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,660
bits if you do that on a class coin page

285
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,399
you don't think about this you want this

286
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:38,459
bit and that bit you just do that we can

287
00:11:38,459 --> 00:11:40,940
only do that between directly connected

288
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:44,640
qubits in super collecting architectures

289
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,500
and so we have to design quite carefully

290
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:52,200
there's a a trade-off between wanting

291
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,180
very high connectivity where you can

292
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,459
interact two bits

293
00:11:56,459 --> 00:11:58,860
freely but you also don't want to cause

294
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,420
collisions you don't want to

295
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,620
accidentally start addressing

296
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,420
surrounding bits when you're trying to

297
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:05,220
drive one

298
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,920
so there's different solutions to this

299
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:10,079
IBM have gone for this heavy hex

300
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:14,160
lattice uh Google in their advantage

301
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,240
paper

302
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:19,200
they went for this layout and at the

303
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,959
minute we have eight qubits live on AWS

304
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:24,779
and we have gone for a ring

305
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:27,240
and this is this is going to you'll see

306
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,279
a lot of change in this in the future

307
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:30,660
especially when it comes to Quantum

308
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:32,579
error correction which I'll touch on a

309
00:12:32,579 --> 00:12:34,860
bit later

310
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:37,260
um but this is still very active there

311
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:40,500
is no you know clean sense of control

312
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,839
unit register combination you get in a

313
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:44,100
CPU

314
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,440
uh we're still working that out and

315
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,660
every generation of quantum protesters

316
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:49,920
comes with a new connectivity

317
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,579
architecture

318
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,620
cool

319
00:12:55,620 --> 00:13:00,300
uh any questions yeah

320
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:08,459
sorry sorry I can't I can't hear

321
00:13:08,459 --> 00:13:10,019
would you like you can come and ask it

322
00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:11,700
so everyone else can hear as well

323
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,920
this is an open chat so you know you can

324
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:18,139
ask questions uh question here as well

325
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,079
so my question is

326
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:25,560
um each trans man has eight uh qubits

327
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:28,740
entangled I mean eight uh ions or

328
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:31,440
whatever entangled with each other and

329
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,380
you have an array of trans mans

330
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:37,760
so okay how many I guess qubits

331
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,019
simultaneously do you have

332
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:42,660
yeah cool thank you I thank you for that

333
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:45,360
I wasn't super clear on this so a

334
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,180
transmon they're both just rings so a

335
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:50,279
trans one is effectively a single bit

336
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:53,940
that is one qubit and on a single

337
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,079
computer

338
00:13:55,079 --> 00:13:57,839
we have eight of these right now so we

339
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,639
are at the you know eight bit stage

340
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:01,440
computing

341
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,820
uh

342
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:06,120
other IBM are pushing just above 100 at

343
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:09,839
the minute uh and yeah but we're much

344
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,100
younger company than them we're all out

345
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,380
scale them don't worry

346
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:16,380
um so this array that you see is the

347
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,060
future plans I should have been clear on

348
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,920
this this horizontal scaling is where we

349
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,279
all go

350
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:34,079
right now right now we don't have that

351
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:35,100
but

352
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:38,399
we we will be scaling out in you know

353
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,920
we'll be growing soon

354
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:44,040
and the

355
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,560
will it look like a soccer ball who

356
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,800
knows so this is this is something that

357
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,760
is

358
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:53,220
designing this what this connectivity

359
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:55,620
looks like it requires input from the

360
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,240
entire Hardware stack

361
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,519
because myself on the compiler team I

362
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,500
want the highest connectivity possible

363
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,839
and then the fabrication scream at me

364
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:06,600
when I ask for all to all connectivity

365
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,540
so it's finding that balance between the

366
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:13,579
optimal at every stage of the hardware

367
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:16,920
cool good question thank you

368
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,560
fabrication we have to make this now so

369
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,899
our OxiClean circuits we we do all of

370
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:23,880
this by the way do we fabricate as well

371
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,639
and this is in clean rooms it looks very

372
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:30,000
much like your fabrication for a

373
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,019
classical

374
00:15:31,019 --> 00:15:34,320
uh process it has lithography and

375
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,699
etching

376
00:15:35,699 --> 00:15:36,540
um

377
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:38,899
and this is

378
00:15:38,899 --> 00:15:42,240
really hard you know this is nanofab so

379
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,399
this is you these things are you're

380
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,699
fabricating on nanometer scales

381
00:15:47,699 --> 00:15:51,420
um you've seen how what I've I've CPUs

382
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:53,459
at five nanometers someone scream at me

383
00:15:53,459 --> 00:15:55,500
if they're much smaller than that now

384
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,360
the fact that they've got this process

385
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,480
so slick has taken a very very long time

386
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,240
and every time you introduce something

387
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,399
new into a Quantum process you're having

388
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:06,720
to redesign your entire fabrication

389
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,760
process as well

390
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,699
um yeah so this step looks quite similar

391
00:16:11,699 --> 00:16:13,699
the processes are slightly different to

392
00:16:13,699 --> 00:16:17,040
uh classical CPUs that's largely

393
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,220
economies of scale from what I gather

394
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:23,100
um yeah this this step looks similar

395
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,440
it's in a clean room lithography etching

396
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,360
very very difficult

397
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,279
huge respect for a fabrication Engineers

398
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:32,720
they do an incredible job

399
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,980
cool

400
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:39,079
that is the Quantum processor unit

401
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:48,240
yeah so the question is we are available

402
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,740
in AWS

403
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:52,079
uh is our computer with them or is is

404
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,959
with us so our computer is housed in our

405
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:58,380
offices in reading and uh they Cloud

406
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,600
access through us it's and one thing

407
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,759
that's it is all

408
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:04,679
uh I know what the uses it our entire

409
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:07,020
data pipe is based within England

410
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:10,079
so the the data containment and security

411
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,859
is very important

412
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:16,500
so that's the the CPU effectively before

413
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,299
we move on to the control stack which is

414
00:17:18,299 --> 00:17:19,859
something like the motherboard are there

415
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:23,178
any questions on that

416
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,640
no cool

417
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,839
so

418
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,360
controlling these things so we have bits

419
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,700
and we have bits that are connected and

420
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,679
that is something like a CPU where now

421
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:37,140
we want to change them if you can't

422
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:39,780
manipulate your bits uh useless you have

423
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:42,299
some static bits floating in The Ether

424
00:17:42,299 --> 00:17:46,559
uh so this is uh the what what we refer

425
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,360
to as classical control Hardware

426
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,640
this is this very large server rack that

427
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,400
has microwave lines going out and uh

428
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,460
read outlines coming back in

429
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:58,740
I say this is something like the the

430
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:01,799
motherboard because uh in terms of

431
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:03,840
Design This has to manage

432
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,179
you know the controlling of the CPU

433
00:18:06,179 --> 00:18:08,400
which is why it's it's

434
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,080
if you saw architectures they probably

435
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,340
looks nothing like a motherboard but

436
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:14,640
it's the closest analogy we have

437
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,059
so we have a lot of RF Engineers a lot

438
00:18:18,059 --> 00:18:19,140
of superconducting companies will

439
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,120
because as I said these are microwave

440
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,539
lines they are finished to control and

441
00:18:24,539 --> 00:18:26,460
managed very cleanly

442
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:28,140
uh

443
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,700
and

444
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,320
then it's all it's also through

445
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,600
classical control stack so waffling

446
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,220
let's get back

447
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,299
what are the challenges with the

448
00:18:36,299 --> 00:18:38,299
classical control set so this is all

449
00:18:38,299 --> 00:18:41,640
fpga based and it has to be quick

450
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,679
so let's say absolute

451
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:48,059
upper Bound for the industry for a

452
00:18:48,059 --> 00:18:49,980
single cubic gate so like a knot

453
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:53,220
operation is 100 nanoseconds

454
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:55,200
and let's say for a two cubic gate so

455
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,600
interacting two bits let's say 800

456
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,780
nanoseconds there's a varf industry

457
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:02,400
upper bounds

458
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,220
so that means if you want to do an if

459
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:07,620
statement a very core

460
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,720
component in Computing

461
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,960
you have to read out your bit process it

462
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,179
classically and then feedback a new

463
00:19:15,179 --> 00:19:18,360
instruction within 30 nanoseconds

464
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,520
that seems fine for classical compute

465
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,440
right you can you can do that sort of

466
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,100
thing

467
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,740
but everything takes time here when we

468
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:29,039
read out uh the state of a qubit that

469
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:31,620
takes time as well and whilst time is

470
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:33,120
happening everything else is being

471
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,860
affected by the environment

472
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,120
it's something we'll go into with

473
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,620
Quantum computing

474
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:41,400
is that it's very noisy it's very very

475
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,960
sensitive to noise

476
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,539
and so we're constantly battling to try

477
00:19:45,539 --> 00:19:47,940
to counteract the effects of noise

478
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:49,919
so the as you leave your system running

479
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:52,760
idling as you're doing some compute you

480
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:56,100
it's Deco hearing it's becoming less

481
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,179
useful

482
00:19:57,179 --> 00:20:00,559
lots of arrows are coming in

483
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:14,940
yeah so uh that's our control stack

484
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:18,660
uh right now the

485
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:19,559
um

486
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:21,600
control attacks are working very cleanly

487
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,919
very quickly

488
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:25,320
what we're seeing as the the future the

489
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:28,260
next step for a lot of things is uh

490
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:31,380
mitigating these errors in the in the

491
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:33,660
control level but also

492
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,340
after this I'll show a little video on

493
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:37,080
the sort of Dimensions that we're

494
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,960
looking at for things there's a limited

495
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,520
amount of bits you can fit into one of

496
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,980
these fridges right you maybe have

497
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:47,100
that much space to stick bits once you

498
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:49,440
scale you have to start networking these

499
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,880
fridges together

500
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,860
and that means you now have a highly

501
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,780
distributed system you have this

502
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:57,120
distributed fpga control system

503
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,760
that's a big challenge to write and

504
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,320
write that quickly and communicate

505
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:04,679
information across your system

506
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:07,760
so if I

507
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:13,440
we have a quick clip to show the

508
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,120
the size that we're operating on

509
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,760
so this is about you know just under two

510
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,660
centimeters squared

511
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:29,100
and there is a a qubit SAT within that

512
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,840
square

513
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:34,320
there's a transmon and the the

514
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,940
the measurement

515
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:37,200
side

516
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,520
control lines come in coaxially

517
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:48,299
and this is so this is the connection I

518
00:21:48,299 --> 00:21:50,580
was on about it's a physical capacitive

519
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:52,980
connection that has to be fabricated

520
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:56,820
into the CPU the qpu

521
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:59,820
's

522
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:04,140
so this is not what uh we have at the

523
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:07,020
minute this is how we that as much as we

524
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:10,020
can scale on a on a two centimeter

525
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:12,679
squared wafer

526
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:15,179
of

527
00:22:15,179 --> 00:22:19,020
reminders that goes into housing

528
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:21,000
and then so that's the sort of scale

529
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,480
size scale that we operate on and after

530
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,100
that you have to start Distributing your

531
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,539
system which has its own series of

532
00:22:27,539 --> 00:22:29,900
challenges

533
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,400
cool

534
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,980
so again any questions on the classical

535
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:36,960
control stack

536
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,900
yeah yeah

537
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:43,159
sorry I can't

538
00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:48,299
thank you

539
00:22:48,299 --> 00:22:50,100
yeah good question how long does it take

540
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,840
to read out the state of the qubit

541
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,940
it's

542
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:56,340
it's a good question because it it's one

543
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:58,320
of those things that depends how clean

544
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,360
you want it

545
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:04,980
it can vary so if you uh Continuum they

546
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:07,260
have uh

547
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,960
uh trapped irons so they can really

548
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,480
flood their system and really saturate

549
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,580
for microseconds

550
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:17,039
I'm not seeing any shakes from continuum

551
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:20,220
I I'd say around let's say up a bound

552
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:22,620
about a microsecond for an absolute Max

553
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:24,840
I've found generally speaking

554
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:27,840
um but it's one of those things that's

555
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,320
a big area of research in terms of how

556
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,940
to uh

557
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:35,100
measure your qubits cleanly and in the

558
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,840
shortest amount of time so it's going to

559
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:39,120
come down very rapidly very soon yeah it

560
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,979
will start to come down in the future

561
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:48,720
so the compiler

562
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,460
so this is why oh sorry yeah

563
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,000
ah yeah great question how long to keep

564
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,440
it stay in the state after you modify

565
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,900
them so we call this coherence time

566
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,659
so this is how long are your qubits

567
00:24:06,659 --> 00:24:07,919
useful for

568
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:10,860
and uh so for a superconducting

569
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:12,900
architecture

570
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:16,500
50 microseconds ish so that gives you a

571
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,940
rough ballpark of how many operations

572
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:21,240
you can put into a coherent window

573
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,640
but that varies from

574
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,740
within the industry that varies from 20

575
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:29,659
microseconds to 100 microseconds

576
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:38,159
yeah so formal operation upper bounds

577
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,500
for superconducting qubits injury let's

578
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:43,740
say like 80 to 99 seconds for a one

579
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:47,220
cubic gate an upper bound 800 nanosecond

580
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:50,419
for a two cubic gate

581
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:09,360
yeah so this is a so the question was

582
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,539
how does your gate time scale as you add

583
00:25:12,539 --> 00:25:16,380
more bits to the gate so in you know

584
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:18,299
classical logic you can do any on any

585
00:25:18,299 --> 00:25:20,640
number of bits and say and on many many

586
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,600
bits

587
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,080
for us to do a three bit operation uh

588
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:28,559
takes a lot longer than just scaling but

589
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:30,120
there are some very neat tricks where

590
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:33,419
you can actually get three gate three uh

591
00:25:33,419 --> 00:25:36,419
qubit gates to run really really fast

592
00:25:36,419 --> 00:25:38,520
uh there you have to play some clever

593
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,659
tricks with getting Gates drawn

594
00:25:39,659 --> 00:25:41,279
simultaneously and such

595
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:43,799
um but it doesn't scale pleasantly

596
00:25:43,799 --> 00:25:46,740
because you have to take like six two

597
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:48,600
cubic gates to do it so it's six times

598
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,199
the length

599
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,279
yeah so that that question was about

600
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:15,360
um

601
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,340
scheduling gate operations effectively

602
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:19,380
how how many gate operations can you do

603
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:21,000
simultaneously

604
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,419
so for a superconducting architecture as

605
00:26:24,419 --> 00:26:27,539
long as the uh we can do as many gate

606
00:26:27,539 --> 00:26:29,580
simultaneously as we like as long as

607
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:31,679
there's no overlapping bits

608
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:33,480
so I'll go in the compile in the

609
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,640
compiler there's a scheduler that shunts

610
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,620
as many things simultaneously as

611
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:38,640
possible

612
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,620
there are other architectures like iron

613
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:43,740
traps where they have gate regions and

614
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:45,539
Continuum can do five gate

615
00:26:45,539 --> 00:26:47,340
simultaneously at the minute so

616
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:49,260
different architectures have different

617
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:50,760
and

618
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,320
different amounts of simultaneous

619
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,220
operations they can perform

620
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:07,080
yeah so that was it was the number of

621
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,240
bits you have on a single wafer is the

622
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,039
number of times roughly how many you

623
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:14,059
could do simultaneously

624
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:15,659
cool

625
00:27:15,659 --> 00:27:17,700
so the compiler this is where I spend

626
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,380
most of my time

627
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:23,159
I'll check time cool 30 minutes so far

628
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:24,960
um yeah I could talk about this for a

629
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,039
long time and please ask me questions

630
00:27:26,039 --> 00:27:27,779
throughout the weekend on this this is

631
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:30,419
where I get most excited

632
00:27:30,419 --> 00:27:34,380
um this is open Chasm 2.0 this is the

633
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:37,799
current industry standard for

634
00:27:37,799 --> 00:27:41,820
uh an interoperable assembly language

635
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:44,640
so some headers over Chasm two include a

636
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,480
standard library of gates and then you

637
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,740
can see the level we're working on we

638
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:51,539
are declaring a q reg is a Quantum

639
00:27:51,539 --> 00:27:52,919
register

640
00:27:52,919 --> 00:27:55,380
and the Sea reg is a classical register

641
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:57,960
so you're saying give me four qubits and

642
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:00,000
four classical bits

643
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,220
because one thing to note is we can't

644
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:05,279
directly read Quantum information

645
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:08,179
you measure a Quantum bit and it

646
00:28:08,179 --> 00:28:12,299
collapses to zero or one

647
00:28:12,299 --> 00:28:14,640
and so that is a classical bit so we

648
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,260
convert this Quantum information to

649
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:18,419
classical information and output it into

650
00:28:18,419 --> 00:28:21,480
a classical register which is then read

651
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:27,000
so h q naught c x q naught q1 TX these

652
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,940
are bit level Quantum operations that

653
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:31,799
we're performing

654
00:28:31,799 --> 00:28:33,960
and then you measure the entire Quantum

655
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,360
register onto the classical register

656
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:39,659
so that's the this is human readable

657
00:28:39,659 --> 00:28:42,360
and we take this tune readable code

658
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,919
we do our compiler steps and you get

659
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:46,100
results

660
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,779
so what what's this result output look

661
00:28:48,779 --> 00:28:52,020
like is bit strings so when you measure

662
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:54,600
four qubits every bit collapses into

663
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,980
nautil one

664
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:59,340
so you have a four bit bit string output

665
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:02,600
for four qubits

666
00:29:03,059 --> 00:29:06,480
cool so what does our compiler look like

667
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,900
we it's cat Quantum assembly tool chain

668
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:13,559
uh V1 we called internally ragamuffin

669
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:14,940
because it was a bit of a ragamuffin to

670
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:16,260
get going

671
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:19,860
um yeah this is we are very much taken

672
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:22,260
inspiration from classical compiler tool

673
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,419
chains so this is

674
00:29:24,419 --> 00:29:27,600
why I go compiler the compiler if you

675
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,720
know about uh classical compilers

676
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,820
there's a lot of the same things going

677
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:34,799
on in Quantum compilers because we need

678
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:37,440
that for scalability and optimization

679
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,140
so we take chasm

680
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:42,840
shout out to Continuum we use ticket

681
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:45,840
which is their uh open source Library

682
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,120
whoa

683
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:51,000
um and that's routing optimization

684
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,860
and directionality I'll touch on that

685
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:55,200
again in a sec that's important

686
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:59,220
AST we have a generated AST generating a

687
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:00,899
tonal representation

688
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:03,299
code generation step for our

689
00:30:03,299 --> 00:30:05,340
you know firmware level this this gives

690
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:07,080
us Quantum instruction set

691
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:09,000
validate and then this is where we do

692
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,340
scheduling which mentioned before have

693
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:13,440
all the operations how many can you do

694
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,000
at the same time

695
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,860
and then that gives you a series of

696
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:17,880
pulses

697
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:20,039
give me a gaussian for three nanoseconds

698
00:30:20,039 --> 00:30:22,679
on this bit give me a square microwave

699
00:30:22,679 --> 00:30:27,140
pulse for 29 seconds on this bit

700
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:31,820
so let's go back to the first step

701
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:34,500
this is routing optimization and

702
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:37,220
directional Gates

703
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:40,020
who has cared about register allocation

704
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:42,600
when they're coding

705
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,640
there's a few

706
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,320
it's exciting

707
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,700
we don't really want people to care

708
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:50,820
about those things right or which bosses

709
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:52,799
are connected on your CPU you don't want

710
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:54,360
to care about any of the underlying

711
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,799
architecture

712
00:30:55,799 --> 00:30:58,919
so that's what this routing step does

713
00:30:58,919 --> 00:31:01,620
reflect that

714
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:03,480
so let's say I want to do a two-bit

715
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:06,419
operation between qubit 4 and qubit 2.

716
00:31:06,419 --> 00:31:08,940
there's no direct connection there I

717
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:10,220
can't do that

718
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:13,159
luckily there's a Quantum swap operation

719
00:31:13,159 --> 00:31:15,720
which you can literally swap the state

720
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,520
of three and two

721
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,260
so that's what this routing layer does

722
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:21,120
if you ask for an interaction between

723
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,080
two

724
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,480
uh two and four it will swap two and

725
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,399
three do the interaction and then top

726
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:27,330
them back

727
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:29,460
[Music]

728
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:31,500
and that's so that people can write

729
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,779
algorithms diagnostic of hardware

730
00:31:33,779 --> 00:31:35,520
there's one of the

731
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:38,100
the bad things like writing at assembly

732
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:40,380
level this isn't true assembly level

733
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:42,720
because it's quite interoperable

734
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,159
one of the worst thing about writing

735
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:45,840
assembly level if you want to Port it to

736
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,940
a different Hardware well good luck you

737
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:48,779
know

738
00:31:48,779 --> 00:31:51,120
so that we're trying to abstract that

739
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,899
step that Hardware step away

740
00:31:53,899 --> 00:31:58,080
optimization uh goes into squashing the

741
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,659
number of gates you have so this is the

742
00:32:00,659 --> 00:32:03,539
same as any you know llvm optimization

743
00:32:03,539 --> 00:32:06,000
pass that removes dead code we have very

744
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,360
very similar dead code removal

745
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,940
uh the directional Gates against are

746
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:14,520
actually strictly speaking

747
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,980
this diagram has a directionality on it

748
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:17,820
as well

749
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:21,720
you can only really uh do like zero to

750
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,580
one with one being the control and the

751
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:24,419
target

752
00:32:24,419 --> 00:32:26,880
for conditional flips we manage that

753
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,860
because that's a frustrating point to

754
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:32,360
deal with right that's quite hard

755
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:36,120
so one

756
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,320
I wanted to talk about it's quite

757
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,000
exciting in the community is the future

758
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,760
of quantum compilers

759
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,740
there's a very big I mentioned llvm

760
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:45,720
briefly and that's because there's a big

761
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:48,720
effort in the community to uh around

762
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,179
something called qir which if anyone has

763
00:32:51,179 --> 00:32:53,880
worked for the llvmir it's the quantum

764
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,200
version of that

765
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,080
so can we roll our Quantum operations

766
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:01,080
into llvmir and perform Opera

767
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:04,799
optimizations using the lrvm tool chain

768
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:07,440
and that's a big Community effort so

769
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,179
there's people from Oxford Quantum

770
00:33:09,179 --> 00:33:14,100
circuits and IBM and regetti Microsoft

771
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:16,940
are playing a big part Quantum machines

772
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:19,980
Continuum that it's a big Community

773
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:22,620
effort because we want everyone to use

774
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:24,720
it interoperably we don't want people

775
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,360
stuck writing code for one piece of

776
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,980
hardware and then never be able to use

777
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:31,080
their algorithm again

778
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:34,200
and also there's 30 plus years of

779
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,240
compiler expertise that we can lean in

780
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,039
on you know why are we going to write

781
00:33:38,039 --> 00:33:40,919
constant propagation when it's as good

782
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:43,200
as it gets in llvm so we're really

783
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,000
leading into the

784
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:45,980
um classical

785
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:49,019
compiler tool chains

786
00:33:49,019 --> 00:33:50,820
so we need a lot more of classical

787
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:53,399
compiler Engineers uh

788
00:33:53,399 --> 00:33:56,840
for optimization passes

789
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:00,659
I can't connect cool uh any compiler

790
00:34:00,659 --> 00:34:02,840
questions

791
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:10,239
[Music]

792
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:16,639
um

793
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:24,679
[Music]

794
00:34:25,099 --> 00:34:27,418
the question was

795
00:34:27,418 --> 00:34:29,099
um can we see the quantum instruction

796
00:34:29,099 --> 00:34:33,300
set no I'm sorry this is this so this is

797
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:35,639
where it becomes proprietary and quite

798
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:38,099
sensitive for us

799
00:34:38,099 --> 00:34:39,000
um

800
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
but it's it's a description of pulses I

801
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,739
can certainly say that it's a a

802
00:34:43,739 --> 00:34:46,619
description of microwave pulses

803
00:34:46,619 --> 00:34:47,300
um

804
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:51,300
if you would like to see uh

805
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:53,760
a description I'm not so I'm not Wi-Fi

806
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,679
connected but you can look up Quantum

807
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:58,080
intermediate representation which is the

808
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,640
current proposed Quantum instruction set

809
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:02,660
for something similar

810
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,500
cool

811
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:09,540
uh so now this is we've left the

812
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:10,680
hardware stack

813
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:14,220
and now this is software concerns for

814
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:16,020
the hardware

815
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:19,560
so this fridge uh this is the the fridge

816
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,240
that Lucy sits in

817
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:23,520
by the time you get to the lowest level

818
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,160
you're at near absolute zero

819
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,920
minus 273 degrees you know you're at

820
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,240
Milli Kelvin

821
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,400
so imagine

822
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,740
that that's a big engineering operation

823
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:37,079
to first get to that temperature and

824
00:35:37,079 --> 00:35:39,180
then maintain it 24 7.

825
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:41,160
and so there's a lot of

826
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:41,940
um

827
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:43,800
bespoke monitoring and alarms you have

828
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,839
to build into your Hardware that you

829
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:48,300
don't need to think about with your

830
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,920
classical Hardware the biggest

831
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,839
temperature concern is in Las Vegas and

832
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:53,460
your iPhone says please stop using me on

833
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:57,000
48 degrees you know that's we were the

834
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,760
very opposite end of the scale with that

835
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,220
um and we've got no accessibility in

836
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:04,759
bandwidth

837
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:08,220
cool

838
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:10,079
and then the final layer within the

839
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:12,599
hardware is the access layer which is

840
00:36:12,599 --> 00:36:14,579
qcas I'll call the computer as a service

841
00:36:14,579 --> 00:36:16,630
we're available in AWS

842
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:18,000
[Music]

843
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:18,560
um

844
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:23,820
and yeah it's super No Frills very small

845
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:27,300
keep it you know keep it clean keep it

846
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:29,900
very fast

847
00:36:30,619 --> 00:36:36,839
uh so that's the stack so what

848
00:36:36,839 --> 00:36:39,240
uh what have we done we've got a fridge

849
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,940
to near absolute zero we've designed a

850
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:44,640
qubit and it's connectivity we

851
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,560
fabricated the qubit

852
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:49,380
we've housed it in a dilution fridge

853
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:51,420
we've designed our micro setup our

854
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:54,240
control lines our fpgas we've compiled

855
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,619
the fpgas

856
00:36:55,619 --> 00:36:58,140
we've built the compiler and we set up

857
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:00,300
the cloud so people can use it

858
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:04,020
okay now what who who cares like what

859
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:06,119
what what's the now what do you do with

860
00:37:06,119 --> 00:37:08,099
it well there's one more step that we

861
00:37:08,099 --> 00:37:10,680
need to do which is calibrate these

862
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,060
things

863
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:14,280
so one of the big challenges that we

864
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,060
have

865
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:16,940
uh versus

866
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:18,900
classical compute from a like

867
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:22,140
calibration standpoint is the fact that

868
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:24,900
we have we have continuous values we're

869
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:27,540
no longer binary so you can Gap your

870
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:29,760
binary bits by 5 volts

871
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,320
ah then you're fine with calibration

872
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,180
your noise has got to be pretty bad you

873
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:35,820
know to start interfering

874
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:37,920
but we have continuous values so that

875
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:41,160
becomes a real calibration difficulty

876
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,180
um

877
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:45,180
so the frequency phrase amplitude pulse

878
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:47,880
width of all these microwave pulses are

879
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,680
something that we control and manipulate

880
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:52,140
in order to get very high fidelity so

881
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:54,060
that when you go naught to one you want

882
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:56,820
to actually get a bit flip you know just

883
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:59,220
calibrating a bit flip is a big

884
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:01,079
challenge in terms of shaping your

885
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:02,760
microwave pulses

886
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,240
correctly

887
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,060
[Music]

888
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:09,140
yeah and you'll see in very

889
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:11,940
sophisticated calibration routines these

890
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:13,500
microwave pulses are not just gaussian

891
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:16,440
they are they change on the nanosecond

892
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,680
scale

893
00:38:18,839 --> 00:38:21,480
great so now we can do these operations

894
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,760
cleanly

895
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,200
throw them through our stack and you get

896
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,919
your results back

897
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:33,780
so Note 4 missions I'll go on to

898
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:35,480
um

899
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:38,400
that's our stack and using it the next

900
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,900
section I'm going to talk about some

901
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,760
emissions and the future of quantum

902
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,339
Computing Hardware so any questions on

903
00:38:44,339 --> 00:38:47,900
the stack up to that point

904
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:49,200
no

905
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:53,578
cool we'll go on to emissions

906
00:39:00,859 --> 00:39:04,760
so I think the the biggest notes will

907
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:08,099
Omission is memory we have no Ram we

908
00:39:08,099 --> 00:39:09,960
have no cash we have no storage at least

909
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,940
in a Quantum sense

910
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:14,220
about the first one ram

911
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:17,099
this is going to be a huge thing in

912
00:39:17,099 --> 00:39:19,500
Quantum Computing at the minute this is

913
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,720
effectively a stack machine whatever you

914
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,520
want to call it you load up a buffer of

915
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,500
instructions and you hit play and they

916
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:28,020
run and you get an output

917
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:31,680
if we get Quantum Ram our ability to

918
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:34,260
speed up algorithms and run algorithms

919
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:37,920
better just explodes it's a real and

920
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,420
there's a huge number of efforts in

921
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:40,560
Quantum Ram

922
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,359
and if we unlock that it'll be

923
00:39:42,359 --> 00:39:45,420
incredible currently there is no Quantum

924
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:46,980
Hardware provider that also has Quantum

925
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:47,440
Ram

926
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:51,000
[Music]

927
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,400
yeah so we'll still have cash or Storage

928
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:56,760
storage is another one because

929
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,859
a fun fact about working with Quantum

930
00:39:58,859 --> 00:40:01,740
information you cannot copy it

931
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:04,079
you cannot do copy paste on a Quantum

932
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:06,180
piece of information

933
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:08,099
if you have many copies of it there are

934
00:40:08,099 --> 00:40:10,320
many scenarios where you can some like

935
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,599
sub cases but in general there is no

936
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:14,760
sense in copying so you cannot just copy

937
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:17,160
it to disk and then reload it later

938
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:20,040
you could have to you can store some

939
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:22,079
classical representation

940
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:24,960
as you see there's no GPU this is you

941
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,300
know bit string output

942
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,280
and IO

943
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:32,280
we don't have uh an operating system

944
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:35,339
where you play around and it's being run

945
00:40:35,339 --> 00:40:37,680
quantum computer you send us the

946
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:40,819
instruction sets and you give it back

947
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:45,060
oh cool so that that's where we are

948
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:47,820
today that's where Hardware is at today

949
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,940
um

950
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:53,700
so this is there's a lot of proof of

951
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:55,560
contact work going on in Quantum

952
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,900
Computing and the hardware

953
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:00,000
and moving beyond that this is just a

954
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,520
we're in the nisk era noisy intermediate

955
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:05,099
scale Quantum computing

956
00:41:05,099 --> 00:41:07,619
um so coherent times aren't as long as

957
00:41:07,619 --> 00:41:10,560
the question earlier times aren't as

958
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:13,020
long as we'd like

959
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:14,940
um error correction will come up next we

960
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:17,339
need more qubits for error correction

961
00:41:17,339 --> 00:41:18,839
uh

962
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:20,940
on the horror that was basically

963
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:22,859
the two ones who have are scaling and

964
00:41:22,859 --> 00:41:24,839
noise noise is something we cannot

965
00:41:24,839 --> 00:41:26,460
Escape so we'll look at how we can

966
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:30,420
mitigate it and scaling is a challenge

967
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:33,180
um that every Quantum company is looking

968
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:35,640
at adults Quantum circuits I showed you

969
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:37,859
are core AP is around the horizontal

970
00:41:37,859 --> 00:41:39,839
scaling of our qubit so we think we've

971
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:42,560
got that covered

972
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,119
future plans

973
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:46,859
so if I put this first because what I'm

974
00:41:46,859 --> 00:41:48,780
working on and excited about the next

975
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:51,359
generation of compiler infrastructure

976
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:54,060
better optimizations you know more

977
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:57,480
interoperability and data structures

978
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:59,880
there is no Quantum list you know there

979
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:02,400
is no Quantum hash map okay there are

980
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,200
some Works in this but

981
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,480
this is bit level we we need to think

982
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:09,240
about abstractions that let people just

983
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:12,240
start writing code and picking up

984
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,099
Quantum algorithms

985
00:42:14,099 --> 00:42:17,160
there's roughly speaking two approaches

986
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,720
on this there are

987
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:22,140
some projects that look at if anyone's

988
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:23,940
filling me with like Cuda writing Cuda

989
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:27,000
code you have separate Cuda functions

990
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,040
that say this is for GPU you know do

991
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,440
your GPU bit here which you can do on

992
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,540
Quantum Computing say this is all

993
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:35,579
classical compute this bit do it

994
00:42:35,579 --> 00:42:37,020
quantumly

995
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:40,560
or the dream world is the uh you just

996
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:43,859
write Python and it will split out any

997
00:42:43,859 --> 00:42:45,300
good Quantum bits and any good classical

998
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:46,500
bits

999
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:48,720
there's a company called Horizon Quantum

1000
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,880
uh developing compiler architectures

1001
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:53,579
looking at doing exactly this they're

1002
00:42:53,579 --> 00:42:56,220
taking octave and splitting it quantum

1003
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:58,520
and classical

1004
00:42:58,859 --> 00:43:01,859
Scout number of qubits next one we need

1005
00:43:01,859 --> 00:43:03,960
more bits we're at eight bits we'd like

1006
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:05,520
a lot more than that

1007
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:08,819
uh Quantum error mitigation

1008
00:43:08,819 --> 00:43:10,740
so this is

1009
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:14,880
preventing errors as they occur so one

1010
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,640
thing you can do is let's say you have

1011
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:20,880
high readout error where your zero state

1012
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:23,339
is highly biased in your readout error

1013
00:43:23,339 --> 00:43:25,500
you can randomize your compilation so

1014
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:27,480
you add these random angles in that

1015
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,640
randomizes your outputs and that's the

1016
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:31,740
way you can mitigate this zero one bias

1017
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:34,459
for example

1018
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:36,300
um

1019
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:38,520
Quantum error correction I've left till

1020
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:42,000
last because I think this is going to be

1021
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,880
sorry this is the biggest challenge for

1022
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:47,280
all Quantum Hardware providers

1023
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:50,280
there's this it's an incredible

1024
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:54,240
topic the an incredible idea that by

1025
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:57,359
entangling qubits you take one bit of

1026
00:43:57,359 --> 00:43:59,760
information and spread that in a highly

1027
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:02,040
entangled State you can hide your

1028
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:03,660
information from nature

1029
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:06,540
so if the environment comes in and

1030
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:09,119
starts impacting your information you

1031
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:10,800
haven't lost all your information in one

1032
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,960
go we are Distributing our information

1033
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:16,800
across many many bits simplest

1034
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:19,680
you know uh repetition Code Zero goes to

1035
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:22,859
zero zero zero one goes to one one one

1036
00:44:22,859 --> 00:44:25,260
this you know is still used in a lot of

1037
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:26,700
classical compute

1038
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:28,800
well there are quantum error correction

1039
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,420
codes that can correct for all the

1040
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:33,420
different Quantum errors that can occur

1041
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:35,099
and this can be a huge challenge to

1042
00:44:35,099 --> 00:44:36,359
scale

1043
00:44:36,359 --> 00:44:38,520
when we hit there's a figure going

1044
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:40,079
around a lot lately that when we hit a

1045
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:42,119
million qubits we're going to be

1046
00:44:42,119 --> 00:44:44,520
generating around a terabyte of data a

1047
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:48,420
second in terms of output testing it

1048
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:50,359
correcting it

1049
00:44:50,359 --> 00:44:53,160
that's a lot of information for a single

1050
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:55,140
computer to fit in one room

1051
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:56,819
so that's where a lot of the challenge

1052
00:44:56,819 --> 00:44:58,619
for classical control attack is going to

1053
00:44:58,619 --> 00:45:01,260
be just throughput hitting a terabyte

1054
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:03,660
per second through a bunch of fpgas is

1055
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:06,319
quite a challenge

1056
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:09,060
um yeah

1057
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:11,099
and we're in a bit of a Cambrian

1058
00:45:11,099 --> 00:45:12,599
explosion of quantum air correction at

1059
00:45:12,599 --> 00:45:14,700
the minute every day there's new results

1060
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:15,859
coming out

1061
00:45:15,859 --> 00:45:18,780
and people are reaching the point where

1062
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:21,180
we're actually extending the lifetime of

1063
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:24,900
a quantum computer with error correction

1064
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:27,480
and then more direct connects to Cloud

1065
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:30,240
providers bringing quantity computers to

1066
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:31,619
as many people as we can bringing it to

1067
00:45:31,619 --> 00:45:32,760
more people

1068
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:35,880
it's something very keen on

1069
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:38,099
and Oxford Quantum we're expanding into

1070
00:45:38,099 --> 00:45:40,260
the Asia Pacific region as well so we're

1071
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:42,420
just trying to bring it everywhere

1072
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:43,859
um

1073
00:45:43,859 --> 00:45:45,300
yeah

1074
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:47,760
Mark said no sales pitches I'm sorry my

1075
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:48,960
company sent me here and they paid for

1076
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:51,240
my trip to Defcon a sales pitch we are

1077
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:53,940
hiring come and join us

1078
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:54,900
um

1079
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:56,760
I love it come and speak to me I'll

1080
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:58,319
speak to you candidly because I love my

1081
00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:00,359
job it's incredible I get to build

1082
00:46:00,359 --> 00:46:02,400
quantum computers for a living it's kind

1083
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,200
of wild

1084
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:05,579
um

1085
00:46:05,579 --> 00:46:07,440
and thank you yeah

1086
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:09,300
we see a brighter future rule enabled by

1087
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:11,579
Quantum uh and am I talking any more

1088
00:46:11,579 --> 00:46:13,819
questions

1089
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:17,040
are my slides available I think this

1090
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:19,220
talk

1091
00:46:19,319 --> 00:46:21,720
yes is yeah we're all good recorded so

1092
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:23,500
yeah the recording will be available

1093
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:26,819
[Music]

1094
00:46:26,819 --> 00:46:30,420
cool yeah

1095
00:46:58,619 --> 00:47:00,619
um

1096
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:03,119
yeah

1097
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:06,420
yeah so the question was about uh an

1098
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:09,000
issue with old Ram where operations on

1099
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,700
one bit were being affected other bits

1100
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:13,859
next to it and this is exactly the sort

1101
00:47:13,859 --> 00:47:15,900
of errors that people seeing on the

1102
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:17,819
Computing and exactly the kind of errors

1103
00:47:17,819 --> 00:47:19,859
that uh Quantum error correction will

1104
00:47:19,859 --> 00:47:21,359
correct for

1105
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:23,640
there is a big challenge with highly

1106
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:25,619
correlated errors like that

1107
00:47:25,619 --> 00:47:28,619
so if multiple qubits get an error in a

1108
00:47:28,619 --> 00:47:30,119
highly correlated way that's a real

1109
00:47:30,119 --> 00:47:32,700
challenge that's big uncorrelated errors

1110
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:34,160
we sort of know how to deal with

1111
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:36,180
challenges like that will be very very

1112
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:37,710
difficult

1113
00:47:37,710 --> 00:47:38,960
[Music]

1114
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:40,920
so

1115
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:43,220
yeah

1116
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:56,960
I mean this is how many miles

1117
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:00,119
yeah so the the the question was around

1118
00:48:00,119 --> 00:48:02,940
where uh Millie Kelvin

1119
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:06,000
can we push it further to improve our

1120
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,220
coherence times

1121
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:10,440
yes but Dimension returns exactly you

1122
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:15,060
say and I think it's what

1123
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:18,060
we're better spent right now on

1124
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:19,859
improving our calibrations and our

1125
00:48:19,859 --> 00:48:21,180
operational stability and that sort of

1126
00:48:21,180 --> 00:48:23,339
thing but yes that is

1127
00:48:23,339 --> 00:48:25,740
we'd be at zero if I you know if we

1128
00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:27,859
could

1129
00:48:30,359 --> 00:48:33,839
cool well I'm I'll be around the corner

1130
00:48:33,839 --> 00:48:35,160
Village so to ask me questions anytime

1131
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:36,960
if you have any uh thank you all for

1132
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:40,619
listening to your questions cheers

1133
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:45,440
thank you
