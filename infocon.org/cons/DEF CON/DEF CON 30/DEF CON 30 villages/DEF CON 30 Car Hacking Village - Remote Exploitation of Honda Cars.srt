1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,199
hello everyone uh welcome to the talk

2
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:04,640
today i'll be talking about an

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,279
interesting finding that i found in one

4
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:08,400
of the connect

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,000
connected car

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,480
and i could able to hack into the car

7
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,679
and i could do whatever i could

8
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:17,600
so uh the title of the presentation is

9
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,000
remote exploitation of honda cars i know

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,560
most of the speakers uh in hacking

11
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,039
village is going to talk about the honda

12
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,480
cars so uh like it was an accidental

13
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,880
vulnerability that i found and during my

14
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,880
uh research

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,200
okay so before going to the uh

16
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,280
presentation let me introduce myself my

17
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,520
name is muhammad shine i'm a knapsack

18
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,399
engineer i'm from india

19
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:45,760
i'm also a uh occasional bug bounty

20
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,079
hunter i have uh hall of fames in top

21
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,199
companies like uh google apple

22
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:52,719
etc

23
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,399
so i'm also

24
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,280
uh the chapter lead of asrg kerala a srg

25
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,840
is a group that deals with automotive

26
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,280
cybersecurity so i leave the chapter

27
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,959
in kerala

28
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:07,040
and we have been uh like

29
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,680
conducting webinars talks uh in

30
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,240
conferences like cocoon for the past one

31
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,119
year

32
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:14,960
i'm also a volunteer at def con

33
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,720
trivandrum uh

34
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,200
then i'm also an automotive photographer

35
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,080
so uh you could see my photographs

36
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,159
in my instagram handle i have

37
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,720
mentioned it here

38
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:28,560
so

39
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,640
today uh i will be talking about a

40
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,960
vulnerability that i found in one of

41
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,439
honda's cars and the vulnerability was

42
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:36,799
in its

43
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,640
api with uh with which um

44
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,720
which was uh but connecting to the uh

45
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,320
telematics controller on it of the car

46
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,159
and i could hack into the uh the api and

47
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:50,240
gradually into the car

48
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,439
so the car is honda city fifth gen

49
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:54,640
then

50
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,520
okay before moving to the uh

51
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,360
uh talk like let's talk about the

52
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,920
attacks of a server like um like i'm not

53
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,719
a car hacker but uh it's my like i love

54
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:06,320
uh what researching about automotive

55
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,959
cyber security so most of the time i

56
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,120
work on the web application android

57
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,000
application or ios vulnerabilities

58
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,200
so uh

59
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,840
considering a car we could um

60
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,920
briefly

61
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,080
break down it in the attack services

62
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,640
into the bifir related attacks you know

63
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,959
telematics attacks the mobile mobile

64
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:29,200
application attacks the ob2 attacks so

65
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,920
today uh we'll be talking about uh the

66
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,800
app vulnerability that i found and i

67
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,239
could able to hack into the car

68
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,400
so uh

69
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,239
what are the advantages of mobile apps

70
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,760
uh in automotive industry the uh the

71
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,480
best answer is like it is easy to use

72
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,800
and it has a great interface so

73
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,080
anyone who knows to um

74
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,160
operate a mobile phone can

75
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,599
use the um

76
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,280
dashboard or the interface in the

77
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,480
application so uh he he or she could

78
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,119
what um

79
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,360
that's why most of the car manufacturers

80
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,400
are now

81
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,000
moving to the mobile applications for

82
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,360
controlling the cars

83
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,599
so uh

84
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:16,000
so what is a connected car a connected

85
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,879
car is one and it has its own connection

86
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,760
to the internet and uh that's like an

87
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,920
iot device so when you connect your car

88
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,360
to the internet it

89
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,840
gradually becomes an iot device so we

90
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,480
know that there are multiple devices

91
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,159
that are connected to the internet right

92
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:37,120
now like uh the refrigerators even

93
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,319
everything everything uh is connected to

94
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,360
internet so uh the uh cars car industry

95
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,280
is also moving to the iot

96
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,840
category

97
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,360
so uh there's a funny story uh

98
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,879
like i started uh what before starting

99
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,480
um

100
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,799
focusing on the honda car or the

101
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:00,879
automotive hacking stuff i

102
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:03,680
this was an article by um or this was a

103
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,519
research by josh carlos and he claims

104
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,680
that he could uh hack into internet

105
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,560
connected trucks so i was like i was

106
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,040
very much excited about this and i read

107
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,200
the article and it was like uh he he

108
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,120
used uh shorten the

109
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,880
uh the internet connected um

110
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,400
devices like that

111
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,160
the brow the

112
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,919
search engine that can be used to uh

113
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,960
track internet connected uh devices the

114
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,560
shorthand site he used it to find

115
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,040
the trucks or the telematics gateway

116
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,680
units of the trucks and uh the it was

117
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,919
using available protocol and not so

118
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:43,120
secure protocol and it was a telnet and

119
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,000
he used those telnet protocol to uh

120
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,720
to hack into the um

121
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,840
the trucks

122
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,040
so uh

123
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,280
i was pretty much amazed by reading this

124
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,360
and after that i started researching

125
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,080
about telematics control unit so uh

126
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,320
before that uh telematics gateway unit

127
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,560
was the one uh that the researcher used

128
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,479
to hack a telematics gateway unit has

129
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:06,960
high uh what performance than a

130
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,560
telematics control unit the kinematics

131
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,360
control unit is a embedded hardware that

132
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,560
is used to connect your car to the

133
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,479
internet

134
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,560
so after that i uh my most of the

135
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,000
research was on

136
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,479
the telematics control unit and i found

137
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,960
that a car can be connected to another

138
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,720
car or they can communicate each other

139
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,160
or a car can be connected to the

140
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,039
internet uh to the mobile phones or et

141
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,160
cetera so uh telematics control uh unit

142
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:34,960
was

143
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,759
the main thing that what uh it trust me

144
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:40,240
but i i have also like started

145
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,280
researching about the um the word

146
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,120
bluetooth related attacks wi-fi related

147
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,120
attacks but you know i i think in india

148
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,440
we don't have much hardware or

149
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,400
uh

150
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,440
there are

151
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,199
problems while purchasing

152
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,520
the stuffs that can be used to car hacks

153
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,240
so

154
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,800
uh my research what uh

155
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,600
stickers gone with us with the

156
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,919
mobile applications

157
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,720
so uh i recreated that those attacks

158
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,919
like it was simple i use uh short and to

159
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,880
uh search the vulnerable um telematics

160
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,600
gateway units and i got some and i was

161
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,960
like i was

162
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,000
i researched about it or i played it

163
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,120
with

164
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,560
played with sorry then i was like yeah

165
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,440
it's cool so uh then

166
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,720
there's an interesting thing that

167
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,800
happened to me the next day when i

168
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,400
opened my laptop there was an

169
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,840
interesting uh

170
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,680
google uh

171
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,280
advertisement

172
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,639

today i'll be talking about a

187
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,919
vulnerability that i found in one of the

188
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:49,120
connected cars

189
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,520
and uh the title of my presentation is

190
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,720
remote exploitation of contacts so uh

191
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,199
this would be a research about me

192
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,639
that was conducted a few months before

193
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:01,520
i

194
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,800
i was able to hack into a honda car

195
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,680
and

196
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,520
buy its uh

197
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,479
vulnerable apis that was controlling the

198
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:13,440
telematics control unit so

199
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,919
let's begin

200
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,240

mohammad shain i'm an application

203
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,199
security engineer and i'm from india

204
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,599
i'm also an occasional but bounty hunter

205
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,160
i have hall of fames in uh companies

206
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,799
like uh google apple etc so uh yeah from

207
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,080
this uh you could understand that i

208
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,640
don't work in the automotive industry so

209
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,599
this is my uh first talk in

210
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,919
uh automotive uh

211
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,279
something like something that that is

212
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:47,360
related to uh automotive

213
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,600
so uh i'm also uh the chapter lead of

214
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,640
asrg kerala um asrj's automotive

215
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,080
security research group it's a group

216
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,720
that deals with automotive uh security

217
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,800
research uh automotive uh

218
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,720
vulnerabilities etc

219
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,640
so i i uh like started uh this group um

220

i'll be talking about uh remote

233
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,640
exploitation of honda cars

234
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,839
this was a recent vulnerability uh in

235
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:20,480
honda car that was found by me a few

236
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,480
months before

237
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,000
i um

238
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
i was able to hack into a car through

239
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,399
its vulnerable apis

240
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,240
so uh before

241
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,320

that i'm not a um

248
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,640

mostly work with uh work on um

250
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:50,320

kerala and a srj's automotive security

260
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,399
research group

261
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,800
b deals with automotive security uh

262
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,800
research and uh

263
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,079
the vulnerabilities that affects

264
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,959
automotive components etc i'm also the

265
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:26,000
volunteer at uh def con trivandrum

266

you uh love like car photos or

268
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,880
motorcycle photos you could uh you

269
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,959
should visit my instagram profile i have

270
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:37,200
uh mentioned it there

271
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,079
okay let's see

272
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,200
so uh the vehicle that uh that i have

273
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,680
used for testing is a honda city fifth

274
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,920
channel it is a 2020

275
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,600
uh 2020 model and uh the vulnerability

276
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,399
uh

277
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:53,440
was

278
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,920
found three months before and now the

279
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,839
vulnerability is completely fixed

280
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:59,839
so um

281
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:02,720
this vulnerability uh was like it's not

282
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,880
a vulnerability that affects in

283
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,600
the

284
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,200
hardware component it was a software

285
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,800
related software in issue so it was very

286
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,000
uh it was a feedback so

287
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,480
let's move

288
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,440
okay uh

289
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,880
before uh talking about the

290
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,720
vulnerability uh like

291
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,200
as a security or a knapsack engineer

292
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,800
like we have multiple vulnerabilities

293
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,880
like cross-site scripting uh sql

294
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,680
injections etc so but when i moved to

295
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,760
the automotive side it was not like that

296
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,440
you know different cars have different

297
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,040
components and

298
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,399
previously we had

299
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,720
what we didn't have much technology that

300
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,600
were that was in um automotives but now

301
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,320
like there are connected cars there are

302
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,680
self-driving cars there are adas etc so

303
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,480
uh

304
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,600
breaking down the attacking surface uh

305
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,480
the thing that uh highlight mostly is

306
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,279
the telematics control unit and the uh

307
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,360
mobile applications there's a funny

308
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,040
story behind that i will be explaining

309
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,760
it later but uh these are the common

310
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,800
entry points or the attack points in a

311
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,040
car

312
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:12,800
so

313
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,079
mobile applications from those um

314
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:17,279
attack

315
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,519
entry points we'll be like i'll be

316
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,360
talking about the mobile applications

317
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,600
both ios and android so and uh

318
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,560
why why um the car owners or the

319
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,000
companies are adapting mobile

320
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,160
applications to control their cars the

321
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,000
reason is pretty much simple it's

322
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,160
because uh it's easy to use so uh

323
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,079
everyone uses a mobile phone or a mobile

324
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:41,600
application everyone knows how to

325
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,120
operate a mobile phone so it's very easy

326
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,920
to handle a mobile application that has

327
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,560
been uh connected to a car so this is

328
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,639
the main reason why the mobile that

329
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,720
there's a drastic increase in the mobile

330
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,240
applications or connected mobile

331
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,199
applications to your car

332
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:58,959
then uh what is the connected car

333
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:01,519
connected cars one or it has on a which

334
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:03,760
has its own uh connected to the internet

335
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,079
so you could remotely control the car or

336
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:10,239
you could remotely track your car etc

337
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,519
so uh

338
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,399
this is a story behind my uh finding my

339
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,560
finding is pretty much very easy to find

340
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,279
but

341
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:22,320
this is where it all begins i uh read uh

342
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,199
an interesting blog by uh jose carlos

343
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,760
notte and he claims that

344
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,320
uh he was able to hack into multiple

345
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,880
trucks uh the trucks through its

346
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,959
vulnerable telematics gateway unit of

347
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:36,240
the tgus

348
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,279
the uh reason uh or the vulnerability

349
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:40,720
was in its

350
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,040
the protocol that is telnet and it was

351
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,279
an un uh authenticated telnet so he

352
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:46,639
could uh

353
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:49,040
grab all the eyepiece and he could

354
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,440
simply uh use the telnet protocol to

355
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,600
hack into the um truck

356
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,240
so i was like uh wow this is super and

357
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,920
it's super cool because you know it's

358
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,160
very easy to hack into a truck

359
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,360
so i

360
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,360
from that day on which i started

361
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,279
researching about the uh

362
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,600
the telematics control units or the

363
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,680
mobile applications or the apis that are

364
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,680
interacting with the telematics uh or

365
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:15,839
the tcu etc so uh then

366
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:18,399
okay uh the thematics gateway unit is

367
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:20,639
something that is uh similar to tcu but

368
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:23,519
it is what it handles much more uh

369
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:24,560
throttle

370
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,800
and uh so uh i uh what

371
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,600
mostly i used the google or the social

372
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,399
google to search about uh telematics and

373
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,199
the

374
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:38,160
all the stuffs and uh the reason why i'm

375
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,079
telling about google is because there's

376
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:42,160
a there's a thing behind it i'll show

377
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,720
you so uh after that i recreated the

378
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,600
attack uh from the blog i used shardon

379
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,279
to uh find the open um ports in those

380
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:53,440
telematics gateway units and

381
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,480
and i got able to work track those drugs

382
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,560
like him so i was like wow this is super

383
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,279
cool it's very easy to do a hack because

384
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,199
you know i have seen research and

385
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:04,560
automotive research that is very

386
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,720
complicated you know it's way

387
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,480
automotive security is something that

388
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,279
it's not like web applications or

389
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,600
the apps industry it's it's

390
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,519
it's a little complicated due to the

391
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:17,920
hardware level stuff so i was i was like

392
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,160
oh it's super cool and i

393
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,720
i i was planning to do uh similar

394
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,519
research on um mobile applications the

395
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:26,880
vulnerabilities that uh that affects the

396
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,079
mobile applications then uh yeah google

397
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:32,079
ad the next day i got a google ad

398
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:34,240
regarding a car that is found in my

399
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,440
country and uh this is honda city 5th

400
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,639
gen

401
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:41,279
and this is the this is the first uh

402
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,600
connected card in india so i was like

403
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,160
well this is cool and i could see a

404
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,399
mobile app that has been

405
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:50,320
found in the app store as well as the

406
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,519
play store then i uh started uh what

407
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,759
reading about the uh

408
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:59,199
the car application uh it contains uh

409
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:02,639
more than 30 uh features so um

410
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:05,039
basically the mobile application can be

411
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:07,039
used to do anything to the car that

412
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:08,559
means like you could start the engine

413
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:11,439
you could open the doors you could uh

414
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:12,240
what

415
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,559
could uh open the boot everything so i

416
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:17,039
was like wow what if i hack the mobile

417
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:18,319
application if i had the mobile

418
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:21,280
application yeah i could uh hack into

419
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,319
the car

420
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,559
so that was my um that was the thing

421
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:27,839
that was crashing my mind so i started

422
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,120
researching on the

423
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,120
mobile application completely and these

424
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,280
were the features of honda connector you

425
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,240
could uh see like there there's a tire

426
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,799
deflation alert that means it contains a

427
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:40,720
tpms and

428
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,919
it contains um almost um what

429
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:45,520
everything that can be

430
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,360
performed in the car and the interesting

431
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,880
features were like uh we could uh

432
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,960
like we could uh start the you know

433
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,000
start the car

434
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,919
the reason is like it is only possible

435
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:00,160
in the uh the automatic variant yeah and

436
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,240
you could unlock the dolls you could uh

437
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,440
even

438
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,000
open the boot you could of tracked the

439
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,520
car etcetera so

440
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,200
these were the four things that

441
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,280
that that i was interested in

442
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,520
then i went to uh

443
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,559
about uh like i read about uh how the uh

444
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:18,480
application controls the car it was like

445
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,520
uh it's uh there's a cloud server and

446
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,320
that has been um controlling the car and

447
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,120
the uh request has been uh what going

448
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,799
through the phone like so for example if

449
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:31,200
you need to open the uh

450
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,880
open the door of the car you could press

451
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,400
the button in the mobile phone it sends

452
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,960
an api request to the server and it in

453
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:37,760
it

454
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,919
what connects all the it

455
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:41,760
interacts with the telematics control

456
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,160
unit

457
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:48,240
so the first thing that i did was i

458
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,480
downloaded the application and the

459
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,559
mobile application and

460
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:56,080
i reversed it and i would recompel it

461
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,720
completely and i i could see some api

462
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,760
endpoints

463
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,720
so after the static analysis i couldn't

464
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,880
find anything interesting there were

465
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,840
some api keys that was not useful so

466
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,400
uh i what i

467
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,120
free uh like i i have sat for two days

468
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,799
for finding some parts and i didn't get

469
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:16,080
anything

470
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,480
the static analysis part

471
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,440
and

472
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,440
then i moved to the dynamic analysis and

473
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,000
i personally love dynamic analysis uh

474
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,919
dynamic analysis is where when uh we uh

475
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:30,320
we run the application and find the

476
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,320
vulnerability

477
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,039
uh the application had some

478
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,880
security controls like

479
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,320
road detection and ssl pinning so uh

480
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,039
it's like you can't run this mobile

481
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:45,360
application on a rooted or a jailbroken

482
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,400
device uh it's a security control by the

483
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,840
honda team but

484
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,679
it is easily bypassed

485
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:55,039
so the reason why they uh did this was

486
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:57,360
like uh you know most of the security

487
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,360
researchers or the attackers use router

488
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,280
devices for testing the these

489
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,640
applications so

490
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,240
uh they

491
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,400
yeah they by default uh place this as a

492
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,200
security control so then ssl billing is

493
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,520
uh is a client-side security control

494
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,760
that that is used to pin certificates

495
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,400
and while running the application

496
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,919
uh the certificates were checked with

497
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:19,919
the uh certificates that are placed in

498
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:23,200
the server so uh this doesn't allow uh

499
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,960
what man in the middle attack so you

500
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:25,760
can't

501
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,840
intercept the traffic of the application

502
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,600
so these were the only security controls

503
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,880
that were placed in this mobile

504
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,000
application

505
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,039
and

506
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:35,280
uh tools for the trade for bypassing

507
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,919
this you uh you can uh use a router

508
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:40,320
device or right or emulators like jenny

509
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,280
motion

510
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,799
or uh and tools uh frida uh for

511
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:46,240
bypassing those controls like row

512
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,280
detection and ssl pinning

513
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,919
and bulb suite or http toolkit can be

514
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:53,039
used to

515
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:54,880
analyze the traffic

516
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,240
so uh

517
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,960
then i uh what

518
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,120
i opened the application

519
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,120
a friday like i injected a script that

520
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,960
can be used to bypass the ssn spinning

521
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,440
as well as the uh road detection so

522
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,480
now the application is all uh ready to

523
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,559
to be performed vulnerability

524
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:13,679
so i

525
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:15,840
like this is the front page of the honda

526
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,679
connector application and

527
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:18,640
uh

528
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,640
then there were there was a feel for

529
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,960
mobile number so this is how the mobile

530
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,520
application work first your the user

531
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,280
gives this phone number

532
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,320
and he will get an otp it's a one-time

533
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:33,280
password and he should enter it here she

534
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,880
should enter it and

535
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,200
then it moves to the m-pin m-pin has a

536
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,760
second layer of protection that can that

537
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,240
uses the biometrics of the phone or a

538
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,000
four-digit number that is created by the

539
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,039
user so this is how the app app

540
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,240
functions

541
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,440
so i

542
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,159
uh yeah then i uh

543
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:54,799
i gave my number and i didn't get the

544
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:56,799
word in the otp or something so i was

545
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:59,919
like why then i uh contacted the honda

546
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:01,280
showroom

547
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:04,480
so i asked uh them about the application

548
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,000
like uh actually i i i didn't uh tell uh

549
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,240
or i didn't tell them that i'm a

550
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,880
security researcher i uh i call like a

551
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,960
regular customer and i asked them and i

552
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,120
understood about the application so this

553
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,679
this how the application forms uh when

554
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:22,080
you purchase the car they will set all

555
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,440
the uh

556
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,840
they will would configure all the number

557
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,919
in the car everything and they'll give

558
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:29,919
you so only thing the user need to know

559
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:32,559
is like to uh log in with the otp or the

560
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:35,200
m pin sorry not there tp the m pin and

561
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,480
you could uh use it to control the car

562
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,520
so the next thing like uh i did was i

563
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:45,039
contacted um any of my friends who owns

564
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:48,200
honda cars but most of them had a

565
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,080
non-corrected car that means it's not

566
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,240
connected so can't perform any attacks

567
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,280
there

568
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,480
uh after that i got a friend who uh who

569
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,679
gave me his car to test so uh that was a

570
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:01,840
connected car so i was like i was happy

571
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,640
and i he gave him his number and i

572
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,840
uh i used uh what

573
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:10,720
i uh bypassed uh the otp thing this was

574
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,559
the first thing i done i used freda to

575
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,080
bypass it then

576
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,440
i analyzed the traffic so i

577
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,480
was

578
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,080
analyzing the traffic you could see the

579
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,919
uh proud api honda apis so this is the

580
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:25,600
uh response

581
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,520
the response contains a generated otp so

582
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,919
that is a vulnerability that is uh i

583
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:33,760
think that's an easy vulnerability by

584
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,559
the way so when you give the number

585
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:37,280
the

586
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,840
uh otp is uh

587
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,960
otp is that to be sent in the mobile

588
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,320
phone but

589
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,720
here the otp was uh reflected in the

590
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,960
response so it was very easy

591
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,799
vulnerability so this was really easy i

592
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:53,760
have what i did was like i uh used five

593
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,559
six one three the otp that's seen here

594
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:58,960
and i uh entered that

595
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,600
the next thing was the m pin and uh

596
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,760
since i used an emulator it doesn't pop

597
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,320
out the biometrics option it asks me for

598
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,000
the uh number

599
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,120
so uh there was an option for forgotten

600
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,279
when you give the forgotten pin option

601
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:15,440
it will ask for the phone number

602
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,360
and i give the phone number

603
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,919
like again the otp was leaking into the

604
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:21,520
response

605
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,000
so i could use this

606
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,240
to reset the amp and i gave a symbol or

607
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,080
i gave a number like one two three four

608
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,679
to reset it then

609
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:36,240
i could get into the car so this is how

610
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,799
uh this was very this was pretty much

611
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:40,799
simple exploit and i could hack into the

612
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:43,840
car easily so the next thing uh was like

613
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,000
i was like wow this is super cool and i

614
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,799
created some python scripts and uh i

615
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:51,120
don't even need what complicated the

616
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,440
gene motion stuff or iphone i created

617
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,559
those scripts and i gave the phone

618
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:57,360
number and i could just click enter and

619
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,919
i could start the car i could unlock the

620
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:01,919
boot and i could i could unlock the

621
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:03,919
doors for everything

622
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,760
it was really easy for me

623
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,880
and uh i was like wow super cool hi from

624
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,279
an app second today i mostly i was like

625
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:13,840
automotive like kind of stuff

626
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:16,320
and it was nice uh during the research i

627
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,440
could uh

628
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,480
i could understand many uh things that

629
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,480
is going behind the car how the car

630
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,640
controls or sorry how the app controls

631
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,840
the car or how it uh

632
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,640
communicates

633
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,880
it was a funny process

634
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,640
learning process

635
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:36,320
then disclosure uh i reported this bug

636
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:39,200
to uh auto isaac first when i checked

637
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,279
the autoimpact it was the honda was

638
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:43,120
listed in their

639
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,520
partner partnership so i reported to

640
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,279
auto inside but i didn't get any uh

641
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:48,400
response

642
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,200
uh for two days so i contacted honda

643
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,320
engineering after contacting them

644
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,440
they

645
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,600
they called me and they called me and

646
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,080
they asked me about the vulnerability or

647
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,640
how i found already i took a call i

648
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,159
scheduled a call with them and i

649
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:06,240
demonstrated it and

650
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,720
i basically i i

651
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,960
i showed everything that i found and

652
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,640
they were happy so

653
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,320
now they

654
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,240
they are they thanked me and the

655
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,400
vulnerability was fixed within

656
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,200
two or three hours i guess

657
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,480
so uh

658
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,400
and uh i i could i should also speak

659
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,159
about the uh the disclosure process you

660
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:30,720
know most of the uh automotive companies

661
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,520
uh doesn't have a responsible disclosure

662
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,000
process or in india that's a that's the

663
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:36,960
main pro

664
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,039
that's the main problem that is faced by

665
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:40,960
security researchers here so when we

666
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,720
find the vulnerability they don't know

667
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,679
where to report it and how to report so

668
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:47,600
but honda team doesn't have a responsive

669
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,840
disclosure program but they uh what they

670
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,200
were very

671
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,480
cooperative cooperative

672
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,720
with me they

673
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,480
they sat with me for

674
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,880
hours to fix this vulnerability and now

675
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,559
the car is totally safe

676
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:05,559
and

677
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,960
thank you this is the uh

678
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,320
