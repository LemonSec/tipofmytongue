1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,439
hi my name is david rogers and uh really

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:05,680
great to be at the cat hocking village

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,240
to give this talk uh talking about our

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,440
hacking rig and um yeah let's let's get

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:12,639
going so

6
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:14,559
um my name is

7
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:16,480
david rogers i own a company called

8
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,760
copperhorse uh we're based in the uk

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,720
my background is in in semiconductors

10
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,400
originally and then in the mobile

11
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,400
industry for the past 20 years

12
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,599
uh i'm heavily involved in a lot of

13
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:31,519
security related topics on the offer of

14
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:33,280
the uk's code of practice on iot

15
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,559
security

16
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:35,360
um

17
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,160
i chair the mobile industries fraud and

18
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,719
security group globally i'm actually

19
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:42,239
communicating to you from google today

20
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,640
actually from a gsma meeting

21
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,200
and uh of course i like cars uh and i

22
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,719
like cats as well

23
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,879
and i sometimes drive cars

24
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,039
that are named after cats

25
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,960
so yeah um

26
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,199
really really great to to talk to you

27
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:00,399
and um so how do we end up with with the

28
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:01,600
stuff that we're going to talk about

29
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,080
here well uh so my company got involved

30
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,280
in a consortium called secure cav

31
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,600
which was looking at future connected

32
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,720
and autonomous vehicle security and with

33
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,040
a consortium together with siemens and a

34
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,200
couple of universities

35
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,240
looking at how we could

36
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,240
at a hardware level

37
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,080
detect security issues and also then

38
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,479
actually prevent them in some way or

39
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:30,960
report them and to explore what we could

40
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,680
do around machine learning as well

41
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,640
um

42
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,960
so extremely interesting project

43
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,439
it's led to a lot of work with

44
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,040
an organization called which which is

45
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,840
kind of like consumer reports

46
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,119
in the uk

47
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:46,159
um

48
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,880
and also we we

49
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,119
through the high community we've we've

50
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,439
done some good work um as a result of

51
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:55,439
besides cumbrie and wales

52
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,920
and we now uh have a partnership with uh

53
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,840
california university we've actually uh

54
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,079
sold uh one of these rigs to them when

55
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:05,119
we're doing continued research on this

56
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:06,880
so um

57
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,758
our our project was right in the middle

58
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:12,959
of the pandemic and um

59
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:14,640
our university partners were due to

60
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,200
create some demonstrators and we were um

61
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,160
due to do all of our security work uh on

62
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,319
those demonstrators and of course the

63
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:23,680
universities couldn't get into their

64
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,560
facilities um so we wanted to do some

65
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,239
cool things around some of the tools

66
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,560
that i'll show you later in the talk

67
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,000
um but we couldn't do it and we

68
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,160
basically had to to build something up

69
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,480
ourselves and so we went down this road

70
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,160
we looked at what was out there and

71
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,480
there are some great things uh using

72
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,120
arduinos and using canvas hacks

73
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,440
canvas hats and

74
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,319
existing uh vehicle components

75
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,400
so that's the road that we went down and

76
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,440
um

77
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,080
a couple of really cool projects where

78
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,959
um they're using data from simulators

79
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,040
uh from essentially from games

80
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,840
and so we we started to

81
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,720
build this up and we decided well

82
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,560
actually this is really good

83
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,560
and actually wouldn't it be fantastic if

84
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,200
we can build this into a wheel a real

85
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,159
car basically so we're taking um

86
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,000
telemetry from multiple different

87
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,360
simulators multiple different games

88
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,519
now there are

89
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,680
academic simulators out there so

90
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,440
probably people will have heard of the

91
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,400
carla simulator but the community of

92
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,879
people who are supporting

93
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:32,959
these kinds of simulators is actually

94
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,879
quite small but the gaming community in

95
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,400
the esports community is absolutely

96
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,440
massive

97
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,360
and the amount of cool stuff that's

98
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,959
being created from hardware

99
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:42,799
manufacturers through to

100
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:44,480
sort of individual software developers

101
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,640
is is absolutely amazing

102
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,080
and so

103
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,080
uh so one of the things that we we

104
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,640
decided to build in was uh was a motion

105
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,280
uh rig which um we got from uh doth

106
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,120
reality in ukraine

107
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,760
um and has been absolutely amazing and

108
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,080
really gives this is a real realism of

109
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,560
actually how to experience a vehicle

110
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,000
being hacked

111
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,040
um

112
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,360
so we have this um

113
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,720
three dot

114
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,640
motion simulator

115
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,400
which gives us a traction loss at the

116
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,238
back there so we see that motor number

117
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:18,320
three there uh so you know if you're

118
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,399
slipping especially if you're racing um

119
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,079
it gives you that real immersive

120
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,120
immersion uh and of course if you crash

121
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,600
into a wall uh without any breaks and

122
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,680
you really feel it

123
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,720
uh so um we've been gradually sort of

124
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,479
building this up alongside all of our

125
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:35,840
security work

126
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,720
um

127
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,960
with this with this car network but then

128
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,199
with with all of this telemetry going to

129
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,720
these different components that are

130
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,479
doing different things

131
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,080
and we're gradually

132
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,080
sort of building that up

133
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,680
um so

134
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,160
we we have a you know very

135
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,240
straightforward canvas with with some

136
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,520
components on it and so what else can we

137
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,960
do well obviously we could put things

138
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:59,840
like

139
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,919
sensors on there

140
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,720
we can connect up um other in-vehicle

141
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,919
components um at the time

142
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:09,840
so it was we we were loaned some

143
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,280
vehicles

144
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,120
uh to have a look at

145
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,240
um

146
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,120
and we also um we because we were in the

147
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,440
middle of a pandemic and we couldn't

148
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,680
really access for example scrap yards

149
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,320
they were all completely closed so we

150
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,919
started to go around down the road of

151
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,000
looking at uh other sort of third-party

152
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,840
components and we actually ended up with

153
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,199
looking at some of the

154
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,440
the eos ped units that were quite cheap

155
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,759
on on amazon and ebay

156
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,320
and found some some horror stories in

157
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,840
those things um but um we we

158
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,960
were able to get them working um

159
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,120
when we were building up the um the

160
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,919
network itself um obviously we needed to

161
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,080
be able to take that as i say the

162
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,320
telemetry from the simulators and then

163
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,240
transmit that

164
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,440
into into the canvas and we we found a

165
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,440
good way of doing that and there's a

166
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,680
really cool tool called sim hub

167
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,280
that allows us to

168
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,800
do that more easily because some of the

169
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,360
telemetry's set over udp or some of it's

170
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,440
done by memory scraping and of course

171
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,120
the games community have done a lot of

172
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,520
the hard work so we took that into

173
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,479
their motion rig and other components

174
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:22,479
but um when we were looking at uh

175
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,880
the the head units what we what we were

176
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,560
really interested in was head units that

177
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,120
were connected to the can bus itself

178
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,600
and um there's a lot of research to be

179
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,120
done here i don't think there's been a

180
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,680
huge amount done so far as you can see

181
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,759
here that this is directly connected to

182
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,479
our canvas and to our simulator

183
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,639
uh and this little red box that you can

184
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:45,759
see on the right hand side there

185
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,120
is this kind of can bus converter box uh

186
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,160
a lot of these uh chinese android open

187
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,440
source head units actually um use

188
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,160
use these boxes and it seems there's a

189
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,479
source uh proprietary serial protocol

190
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:03,680
going to these things and then they

191
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,919
have the sort of pre-selected can

192
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:08,880
dictionaries that are selected by

193
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,000
choosing

194
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,680
individual apps that are pre-installed

195
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,599
on these units

196
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,840
and these companies clearly all talk to

197
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,039
each other

198
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:18,960
because they all sort of co-support the

199
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,800
different as the different manufacturers

200
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,639
of these little boxes

201
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:25,199
and these these can bus adapter units

202
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,000
and and these these devices these head

203
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,919
units are designed to be put into legacy

204
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:32,000
vehicles so you can imagine the security

205
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,800
risk and we're looking at you know

206
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,199
what is on here what versions of android

207
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,160
are on there uh you know

208
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,520
we can see that they've actually managed

209
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,319
to hack in the play store onto there um

210
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,960
they've got google maps they've got um

211
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,960
chrome browser so the question is like

212
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,520
you know does does a chrome browser auto

213
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,240
update on a device like this and to what

214
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,400
extent is the user exposed to existing

215
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,240
vulnerability and

216
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,520
you know

217
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,520
what's the the differential

218
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,479
between

219
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:05,759
what's what's going to be patched and

220
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,800
what's not and really is it possible to

221
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,840
to

222
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,720
cross into that canvas from a malicious

223
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,400
android app that's on one of these

224
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,919
legacy head units it's something that

225
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:17,599
we're exploring

226
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:20,080
with cardiff university as well at the

227
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,280
moment

228
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,520
a very very interesting area of research

229
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,360
i think

230
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,400
um

231
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,639
what we also decided to do was uh to

232
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,159
build in some functions to um at least

233
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,479
demonstrate to people what would happen

234
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,640
if we disabled certain functions in the

235
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,719
vehicle

236
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,039
so for example um we thought it'd be

237
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,880
quite cool just to be able to cut off

238
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,279
the brakes or to remove the clutch

239
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:46,320
function

240
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,120
uh or the accelerator um so pretty

241
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,760
straightforward just a hardware hack and

242
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,279
uh you can see my sort of heath heath

243
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,279
robinson wooden button with some nails

244
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:56,880
in it at the top left there just to kind

245
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,320
of prove it out

246
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,360
um

247
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,000
and we built this um we built this box

248
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,040
um

249
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,000
uh

250
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
which

251
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,880
allows somebody who's next to the rig so

252
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,600
this this is actually a b size london um

253
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,760
to be able to disrupt the driving

254
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,360
experience of

255
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,399
of uh of the person in the car uh

256
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,720
whether that's distracting them by

257
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,120
turning on the wipers or

258
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,440
or causing disruption to other drivers

259
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,760
by um turning on hazards you know this

260
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,680
sort of low level functionality in

261
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,399
vehicles um can sometimes have a very

262
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,640
big effect

263
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,160
we have um evolved that somewhat um so

264
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,360
we've added in uh new functions and uh

265
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,360
so as i learn

266
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,800
you know what works and what doesn't

267
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,640
work i'm sort of building that into the

268
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,040
rig so um

269
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,959
we have some at the moment we started

270
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:53,920
out with logic g29 uh pedals logitech

271
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,519
g29 pedals

272
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:58,160
and um essentially wired all that in

273
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,120
um so that we can turn them off at will

274
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,000
and then turn on other functionality

275
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,440
if it's supported in the simulator of

276
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,519
course because it depends you know what

277
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:08,959
game you're playing or what simulator

278
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:10,480
you're using

279
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,320
but it's but it's a really really useful

280
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,120
tool

281
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,560
uh to actually see how drivers react and

282
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,959
to really cause a lot of trouble to them

283
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,360
so there's a sort of

284
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,959
there's what you can actually do in a

285
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:26,160
car says obviously you know it's not

286
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,160
possible to reach some certain functions

287
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,160
because of certain security that exists

288
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,560
or some electromechanical thing so we

289
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,320
need to kind of ground it in reality a

290
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,600
little bit but it's still fun to explore

291
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,640
the kind of what if scenarios um

292
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,959
around these things

293
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,640
but to come back to like the core reason

294
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,000
that we built this stuff in the first

295
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,160
place was was actually to look at some

296
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,720
of the the types of hacks that are out

297
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,720
there all that could happen and i always

298
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,399
like to look at stuff that is actually

299
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,160
going on right now and what what

300
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,000
criminals are actually doing uh

301
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,279
something that we've done in a mobile

302
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:00,399
phone world

303
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,600
and uh so so one of the the kind of

304
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,360
criminal mods out there

305
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,560
uh is is around mileage correction uh so

306
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,320
you can kind of get these essentially

307
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,959
man in the middle devices

308
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,120
uh that you can buy through

309
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,240
um on online sites uh we could get these

310
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,320
for about 300 euros for specific

311
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,839
vehicles

312
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,800
and we wanted to explore how they worked

313
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,640
what they're doing on the canvas um and

314
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,000
and

315
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,760
how they operate without obviously

316
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,680
having to put it in a real vehicle

317
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,720
because in most countries um if these

318
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,880
things are not outright illegal

319
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,160
uh for example in the uk

320
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,040
you would have to uh

321
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,480
declare

322
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,839
that that you had this thing in a

323
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:46,959
vehicle

324
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:48,560
uh and obviously that's going to affect

325
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,079
the resale value um so it's it's not

326
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,000
illegal to buy one

327
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,320
but it would be illegal to essentially

328
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,240
use one and not tell the new owner that

329
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,880
you'd use one um but of course

330
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,560
uh you know people are using these

331
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,160
things there is obviously a market for

332
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,200
them

333
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,839
so the way that they work is um that you

334
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:11,839
install this thing and then you flash

335
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:13,360
the headlights four times and it

336
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,959
switches the mode

337
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:18,560
of the mileage corrector uh and gives

338
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,320
feedback to the user because it's behind

339
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,079
the dashboard

340
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:25,279
and it flashes the hazard lights uh

341
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:26,959
the number of times depending on what

342
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:28,639
mode it is so you know you might get

343
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:31,519
four flashes for a particular mode

344
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,920
and what what you see is that it's not

345
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,639
actually stopping the odometer

346
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,480
it's slowing it down but it's slowing it

347
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,560
down because it's kind of manipulating

348
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,279
the

349
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:45,600
um the speedo uh and essentially so um

350
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,440
it is clocking up the mileage more

351
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,639
slowly so it's very subtle because

352
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:53,279
there are databases out there that um

353
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,120
you know log your mileage when you take

354
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,440
your car to the garage and so on uh and

355
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,560
of course if

356
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,800
if that thing is static and it's gonna

357
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,120
be very very obvious very quickly that

358
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,360
you've been tampering with a mileage um

359
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,440
so and particularly for

360
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,079
sort of more modern classics that people

361
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:10,880
want

362
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,360
um you know people

363
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,880
want to have a look at these these

364
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,320
databases and actually check that

365
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,760
they've got the vehicle that they have

366
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,399
got and it's not unusual to see this

367
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,800
sort of slow down in the curve of

368
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,800
mileage anyway because obviously for

369
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,920
something like i say a 993 911

370
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,360
it's a modern classic people don't want

371
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,279
to put a lot of miles on them

372
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:32,240
um

373
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,880
and it might be very difficult to

374
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,639
to see the usage of it

375
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,920
and the reason that people are putting

376
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,760
these things in is is obviously to

377
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,440
increase the resale value primarily um

378
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,600
because if you can i don't know take the

379
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,800
911 example if you can keep that thing

380
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,920
under you know 100 000 miles that's

381
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,199
that's uh

382
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:54,800
is going to get you a premium on the

383
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,560
resale

384
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,120
so um so we're able to install this

385
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,880
thing in our network we and it's

386
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,480
actually on our rig now

387
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,760
and we can actually operate that um

388
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,360
using the rig and actually while we're

389
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,040
driving along in the simulator which is

390
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,279
really really cool and it actually is

391
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:12,959
just an example of stuff that not only

392
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:14,959
can we demonstrate how it operates we

393
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:17,040
can actually monitor the cam bus

394
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,160
and see

395
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,399
what the cam traffic is obviously we can

396
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,959
reverse engineer the hardware as well

397
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:24,959
but it's a very nice way of doing that

398
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,480
and we could potentially do that with

399
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,240
other components

400
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,279
for particular vehicle types

401
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:33,360
uh and of course there are a lot of

402
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,040
tools that are out there

403
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,120
um so

404
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,120
if you just take obd2 dongles for

405
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,519
example now some of them are completely

406
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:43,680
legitimate

407
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,480
but there's others more nefarious

408
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,079
tracking devices

409
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:50,959
and so on um usually they're accessing

410
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:53,600
the same data and then adding a bit so

411
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,680
they might add some gps information and

412
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,639
then send that over to mobile network

413
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:01,519
but there's other more interesting uh

414
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,560
obd2 dongles um one example that i was

415
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,600
told about um is for essentially uh

416
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,519
spoofing um the ad blue check

417
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,360
for for lorry drivers

418
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,040
uh so that

419
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,600
um the the vehicle is fooled into

420
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,279
thinking that it's that it's full of ad

421
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:22,720
blue um and obviously adblue is is

422
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,760
extremely expensive um and

423
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,839
particularly for trucks so

424
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:30,720
you can see how that market is created

425
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,000
uh for those sorts of tools that exist

426
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,920
so um

427
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,480
we can use our rig to explore these kind

428
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,720
of devices and what they do

429
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,519
to to to a limited extent

430
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,759
um so yeah uh

431
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:48,880
there's a lot of a lot of potential um

432
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,040
in this in this platform

433
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,800
for exploring uh different tools that

434
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,399
are out there

435
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,160
but in in the project that we were

436
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,160
looking at of course we were actually so

437
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,920
siemens were actually looking at well

438
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,800
how can we detect uh this kind of

439
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,560
malicious traffic if you will or

440
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,040
anomalous traffic on the network and

441
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,519
then how can they secure it and and they

442
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,040
were looking at this a chip level and

443
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,079
there were some really really

444
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:15,199
interesting things um done um

445
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:18,399
but uh we we were then going to actually

446
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:20,800
look at how to

447
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,120
how how we could actually break their

448
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,440
system if possible or their proposed

449
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,680
system and and that's what we went about

450
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,079
doing so so in the process of doing all

451
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:30,959
of this

452
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:33,120
um because again we were in the middle

453
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,920
of the pandemic and we had to

454
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,079
work out how to do all of this remotely

455
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:40,320
on multiple sites basically in people's

456
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,519
houses

457
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,199
and um so

458
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:45,040
we we ended up being forced into

459
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,720
creating a system where you could

460
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,759
remotely test from anywhere in the world

461
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:50,720
um

462
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,160
uh the the rig or the or the car

463
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,040
um of a setup uh where wherever it was

464
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,160
placed

465
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,959
and so i think that's kind of a a useful

466
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:04,400
thing and um so we had a sort of camera

467
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,319
setups we had a few switchbots for

468
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,799
switching on the hardware remotely where

469
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:10,720
there were physical switches

470
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,599
um

471
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:14,079
and we had a bunch of vms that were

472
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:17,199
doing things like fuzzing and so on and

473
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:20,160
um in in the cases where multiple tools

474
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,760
were running um we were able to

475
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,079
set up some tools to to

476
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,599
essentially

477
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:30,080
do ocr on what was on the screen and

478
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,440
then auto type as to the next step so

479
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,280
that we were eliminating

480
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,559
uh

481
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:38,400
sort of issues where we might catch

482
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,480
something during fuzzing or some kind of

483
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,760
crash or something in the middle of the

484
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,640
night

485
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,280
and then have to wait before we continue

486
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,440
to the fuzzing we could actually

487
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,840
automate that capture the crash and then

488
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,440
do something about it

489
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,160
so so really really cool and uh i think

490
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,320
there's some real potential in kind of

491
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,799
working on that stuff in the future

492
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:00,960
for karma manufacturers and

493
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,080
and for for anyone else uh really

494
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,799
um so so yeah so this is the this is the

495
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:09,440
rig as um as it stands and it was just

496
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,840
kind of con continuing to be developed

497
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,720
there

498
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,880
um i've got some nice little bezel

499
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,799
removers it looks a lot better actually

500
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,720
when you're racing you know your brain

501
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,880
actually completely removes the the

502
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,160
bezels there

503
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,240
of course we could have gone for vr

504
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,520
but we've got real

505
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,039
real components on there so we want to

506
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,520
see their real data and how how those

507
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,760
needles work and so on and and to be

508
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,679
honest i'm a bigger fan of triple

509
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:36,240
screens uh from an esports perspective

510
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,080
as well and obviously from an audience

511
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,760
perspective it's nicer to kind of see

512
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,559
this so so we get this sort of full

513
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,520
full visual experience and um it really

514
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,679
really is quite immersive

515
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,360
uh you can see we've also got a stream

516
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,280
deck on there as well

517
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,600
which is used for for button control and

518
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,760
so on

519
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,080
as as we've um as we've developed the

520
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:58,880
rig

521
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,360
um we've we've you know i mentioned that

522
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,720
we had the logitech g29 pedals and

523
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,799
steering wheel which is pretty much a

524
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:09,120
sort of gaming a gaming device it's not

525
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,760
that expensive really

526
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,880
but i've modified the pedals um to allow

527
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,880
for the switching off

528
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,760
but

529
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,200
you know there's lots of things you can

530
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,880
do and there's a lot of community

531
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,520
hardware modifications as i said so

532
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,919
actually the way that these work

533
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:27,679
essentially they're um their

534
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:30,080
potentiometers inside them and they're

535
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,720
travel based they're not pressure based

536
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,320
uh but there are some modifications out

537
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,640
there that kind of uh

538
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,280
create a more realistic field so almost

539
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,240
to emulate like a load cell break

540
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,840
now if i want to buy load cell breaks

541
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,840
from say fanatec or something like that

542
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,240
that sort of real racing breaks they're

543
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,760
really really expensive but you can

544
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,320
actually buy some quite cool mods that

545
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:56,480
turn your stock g29 pedals um

546
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,200
they put a linear potentiometer into

547
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,559
into the pedal

548
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:02,880
and and then um

549
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:07,600
have a much stiffer um load cell

550
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,880
style

551
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,120
spring mechanism everything

552
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,360
and it just just adds an extra layer of

553
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,080
realism to it i think ultimately we will

554
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,400
actually swap out those for real load

555
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,080
cell breaks but for now it just just

556
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,080
definitely enhances the

557
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:22,960
things

558
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,480
um the same

559
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,799
for we've now kind of moved on from the

560
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:29,039
g29 wheel itself

561
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:31,360
um and put in a

562
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:35,679
direct drive dd pro fanatic um bass

563
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:38,000
and full size rim and you can see

564
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,600
there's the size different there

565
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,520
difference there and it really really

566
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,159
again enhances that realism

567
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,640
and immersion especially and you know

568
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,039
what you want is for the person on that

569
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,559
rig to actually believe that they're in

570
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,480
a car because when things go wrong and

571
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,159
when we start to do some other sort of

572
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:56,080
quasi cyber attacks on them or real

573
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,360
cyber attacks

574
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,240
um we want it to like be really really

575
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,640
realistic and so that that's that's

576
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,360
really cool and um works really well

577
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,200
uh something else we did with the the

578
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,880
pedals as well um

579
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,080
there's uh something called the leo

580
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,960
bodner uh cable so leo bodner a company

581
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,520
based in near to silverstone in the uk

582
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,960
work with some motorsport companies and

583
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,240
they can

584
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,240
the cable essentially

585
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,000
gives you a much better resolution so it

586
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,880
takes it from 256 bits

587
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,880
of resolution or eight bits of

588
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,559
resolution to 10 bits which gives you

589
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,000
essentially

590
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,840
1024

591
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:38,799
bit smoothness to the original 256 bits

592
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,240
we've put things like seat belts on

593
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,559
there one of the recent mods i did was

594
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:44,400
to put working lights because we had all

595
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,240
that data from the telemetry um and so

596
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,120
i put um a set of 12 volt relays in our

597
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,039
hacking box and

598
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:56,960
and and put some just some motor bike

599
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,480
lights that you i think i got them for

600
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,960
20 quid on their amazon and just mounted

601
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,720
them on the back so when you put the

602
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,480
indicators on or the running lights

603
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,559
whatever it actually is on the rig and

604
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,720
we can just keep adding that stuff uh

605
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,280
really it's just what i kind of whatever

606
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,240
wherever our imagination goes

607
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,600
the one on the right that you can see

608
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,039
there is um i see a rear view camera so

609
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:21,039
i mounted that over

610
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,200
the rear view mirror the virtual mirror

611
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,960
in and this is a set of corsa

612
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,240
competition so in modern gt3 cars they

613
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,000
actually have these screens

614
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,240
in their in their cars so i just kind of

615
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,640
repurposed this dodgy head unit to to

616
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,039
put that in there

617
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:38,240
and the whole thing's actually

618
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,480
transportable so i can put it in a full

619
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,640
transit van and i don't have to kind of

620
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,200
take it apart or anything and uh you can

621
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,440
see the boss there uh pumpkin uh

622
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,919
inspecting it as it's just about to go

623
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:50,640
to

624
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,640
to visit someone

625
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,159
okay so um here here we have the the rig

626
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:58,480
as you've seen in the presentation

627
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,400
uh we'll maybe see a little bit of the

628
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,080
motion you can see the lights here where

629
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,919
we're kind of braked at the moment and

630
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:06,840
waiting uh for for me to drive

631
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:10,240
um we um

632
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,159
on on the rig itself actually we've

633
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:14,080
we've kind of expanded this with more

634
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,919
expensive equipment so we started out

635
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:19,120
with logic logitech equipment so the g29

636
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,280
wheel and pedals

637
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,600
we still have the logitech pedals there

638
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,320
although these are heavily modified now

639
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,080
so we've

640
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,400
put a what's called the leo bodner

641
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,679
modification on there to increase the

642
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:36,640
the resolution of the pedals

643
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,919
and we've also put a load cell

644
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:39,600
modification in there to make it more

645
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,679
realistic of course we could spend a lot

646
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:43,919
of money and put a load cell pedals

647
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:46,400
set load cell pedals in there

648
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,840
but remember that we've actually

649
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,440
modified the

650
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,520
pedals so that we can actually remove

651
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,919
brakes and clutch and accelerator but we

652
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:56,400
probably will expand that in the future

653
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,320
so we've got our head unit here which is

654
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,840
connected over to the canvas which i'll

655
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,080
show you in a minute and then this is um

656
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,919
our new um wheel which is a phantom tech

657
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:08,720
wheel and this is the dd pro and the

658
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,400
reason that i put this on here as well

659
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,760
is it gives you a really really

660
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:15,200
realistic driving feel so the feedback

661
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,360
and the force that you get

662
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,440
probably on the logitech wheel is

663
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,679
probably up to maybe less than two

664
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:23,679
newton meters

665
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:25,120
of

666
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,080
force um in this you get an over eight

667
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,559
newton meters and you definitely feel it

668
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:32,480
i do a lot of sim racing as well you the

669
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,960
the feel that you get of of the road is

670
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,679
much greater so this gives um people uh

671
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:40,799
a more realistic driving experience

672
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:42,880
um i've got a th

673
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,520
8a shifter on there it's a master it's

674
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,480
actually quite a nice shifter i like it

675
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,320
we just put a custom gear knob on there

676
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,799
and all of this is connected uh to

677
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:57,279
different software in the rig

678
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:58,400
so

679
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,840
we have something called sim racing

680
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:02,640
studio which comes with the motion

681
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,120
uh platform and that's a really

682
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,520
excellent piece of software uh we also

683
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,600
use simhub for translating some of the

684
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,440
telemetry and we've got some nice

685
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,840
scripts and uh and software to go with

686
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,279
that

687
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:16,400
um

688
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,799
i i use a bunch of other tools as well

689
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:21,840
uh some tools that we've written as well

690
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,240
and yeah so we also have a handbrake

691
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,559
here as well the emergency stop button

692
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:28,720
is for the motion rig because it can get

693
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,440
a bit crazy if you ever ever use beam ng

694
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,279
driving the car off the cliff is uh

695
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:35,440
somewhat of an experience

696
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,440
this is the stream deck here

697
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,240
so

698
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,840
you can see here that we've got the

699
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,000
different controls this is for the chuck

700
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,240
um this is a shortcut button i have here

701
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,919
for for doing a mileage correction

702
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:47,200
that's just going to flash the lights

703
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,600
four times um but we can cycle through

704
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,760
we've got loads loads different uh

705
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,159
different sim functions on here and it's

706
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:56,640
um really nice to be able to um

707
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,520
to to use that's very nice feature

708
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,120
this other tool here is something called

709
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,720
sim dashboard

710
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,600
this allows me to send the telemetry

711
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:09,520
data into another kind of visual tool

712
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,360
which is very very cheap is an android

713
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,760
client for it's really really nice and

714
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,440
you can build your own dashboards you

715
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,840
can build other information as well uh

716
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:18,640
again

717
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,240
just touching the surface of that but we

718
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,840
can probably do

719
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,400
a hell of a lot of things in the future

720
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,480
so okay so let's have a look

721
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,760
at some of the equipment that we've got

722
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,320
here so i'll start off um with the

723
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,559
mileage corrector um so that's that's

724
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:34,480
the device that you get sent when you

725
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,720
buy it and this is actually plugged into

726
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,400
the back of the of the instrument

727
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,480
cluster here you can see that we have

728
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,919
another one here

729
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:44,799
um and um so that would be hidden behind

730
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:46,880
your dashboard and obviously if somebody

731
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,400
was buying the car they might not know

732
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,840
about it but you might want to take it

733
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:53,120
out before you sold it as well um

734
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:57,200
we um built uh alongside the custom uh

735
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,200
hacking box for um removing the the

736
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,960
accelerator and the brakes and so on

737
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:05,679
we

738
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:08,480
also um have this uh sort of custom box

739
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,039
here um so this is the arduino i was

740
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:13,200
talking about with the canvas hat

741
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,240
we've also

742
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,480
got an obd2 connector here which is uh

743
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,960
useful for us for monitoring the can

744
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,480
data

745
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,960
if you want to

746
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,039
use any of the sort of tools and that

747
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:27,520
you can buy out there for car stuff and

748
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,080
we also have this is just a relay board

749
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:30,880
here

750
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,240
so we're just using the 12 volt relays i

751
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,200
did originally look at using mosfets um

752
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,960
but the the lights that i've gotten here

753
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,039
are just basically sort of third-party

754
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:43,360
motorcycle lights that i've repurposed

755
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,520
for the rig what they're expecting is

756
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,600
actually an output from a relay not from

757
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,240
a mosfet would be rewired differently

758
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,679
these boards are really really cheap and

759
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:54,559
it's really straightforward to integrate

760
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:56,000
um so you can see we've got a selection

761
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,360
of head units and things that we've

762
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,640
bought we've been

763
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,399
looking at reverse engineering these

764
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:02,000
things

765
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,159
that this is one that blew up on me blew

766
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:06,720
a power supply as well so what a lot of

767
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,799
these come with when when they have a

768
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:11,360
canvas connection is a canvas decoder

769
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,159
and it appears to us that um there's

770
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:16,480
some sort of proprietary uh serial

771
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:20,480
protocol going to these and then um

772
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,159
through software through the sort of

773
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:23,760
pre-installed apps that they've put on

774
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,880
these things

775
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:25,840
um

776
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:26,880
they

777
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,799
you will select

778
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:31,200
a decoder for a particular vehicle

779
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,840
platform um and that will essentially

780
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,440
have a sort of pre-programmed can

781
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,600
dictionary to enable it to talk to the

782
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,640
canvas

783
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,880
um and so somebody would just plug that

784
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,200
into their car and and and of course

785
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,799
i've seen lots of complaints about these

786
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:46,080
things because of course they're not

787
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,679
perfect

788
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:49,679
um what we're more interested is things

789
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:52,799
like pre-installed malware um what type

790
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:54,559
of state these things are in whether

791
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:56,000
they're going to get software updates

792
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,559
and so on um so you can see this is one

793
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:01,120
here uh it's just uh

794
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,559
one of these head units and they often

795
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:04,559
come with this kind of car menu

796
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:05,679
um

797
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:09,279
and uh different car settings and so on

798
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:12,399
um so in this case we can see some of

799
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:13,919
the data so

800
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,360
this is actually will change it's

801
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,520
connected to our cameras here

802
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,000
um at the moment we just paused

803
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,240
so yeah very very interesting we've

804
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,000
again only touched the surface of some

805
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,480
of this stuff but it allows us to play

806
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,960
around with that and and see what kind

807
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,880
of things we can do

808
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,799
so um the last thing i'll show you here

809
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:35,440
is actually um some of the extra

810
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,760
components so i told you about the the

811
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,080
rear facing camera

812
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:40,880
but

813
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,520
uh interestingly we've got a tpms here

814
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,919
so tire pressure monitoring so one of my

815
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:47,600
sort of little future challenges will be

816
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,480
to add the tpms into the rig as well

817
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,399
and see how good or how bad these

818
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:54,720
third-party devices are these are just

819
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,039
the the pressure caps

820
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:58,960
okay so uh let's get on to the

821
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,399
interesting part so i would love to

822
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:02,880
bring this rig to las vegas and but it's

823
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,440
probably not going to be possible

824
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,559
so

825
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:10,559
i'm going to show you some driving um

826
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:14,000
i also do some drive alongs and stuff

827
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,679
so let's uh let's get going

828
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,799
so this um this simulator here is uh

829
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:26,880
euro truck simulator 2.

830
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,159
um i'm actually in the middle of a

831
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:29,840
delivery at the moment

832
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:30,880
um

833
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,399
you'll see that um

834
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:34,720
i do a lot of sim racing and uh stream

835
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,600
that online and that's with exactly the

836
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,279
same rig

837
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:41,600
and with the motion and everything

838
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,799
um

839
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,000
and

840
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,480
i'm just going to uh

841
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,799
drive along here i'm just gonna i've got

842
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:50,320
the motion turned off right now but i'm

843
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,480
just going to show you very quickly

844
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,000
um

845
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,919
how the myelin correction works so you

846
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:57,760
see that i've got the full beam light on

847
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,279
here

848
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:01,679
driving along into the early morning

849
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:03,279
what i'm going to do i'm just going to

850
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:04,399
do the

851
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:06,559
the four flashes right and what you'll

852
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:09,039
see is the response back from the hazard

853
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:11,760
lights as it switches modes and you'll

854
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,720
see

855
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,399
you see the uh

856
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:16,320
speedo do something as well and these

857
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,720
things can be a bit flaky as well so so

858
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,640
it takes maybe a couple of times to

859
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,279
actually activate

860
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:26,960
um and get it to go

861
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:28,799
this would be the one time that we can't

862
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:31,440
get it to go

863
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:32,480
so

864
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,279
why call david drew all the demos

865
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:37,679
the demos never work there we go

866
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:38,559
so

867
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:40,720
um you can see it switch modes there and

868
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,399
you can see also the speedo's dropped

869
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:44,159
down because what it's actually doing is

870
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:47,039
causing the speedo to misreport i'm just

871
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:48,320
going to

872
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,720
move outwards there you can see the

873
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,720
indicators

874
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,080
so hopefully it's going to switch modes

875
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:57,439
again get it to change

876
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:00,640
there we go so it's flashed twice it's

877
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,200
moving into a different mode

878
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,799
and you can see there that it's flashing

879
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:05,760
again

880
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,000
so um that's how that works if we move

881
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,840
back um

882
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,840
i'll just show you if you just show the

883
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,720
lights

884
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,799
so on the rear of the vehicle if i just

885
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:19,039
show you how that that's uh so i'll put

886
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:22,399
the hazard lights on now

887
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:26,399
and uh obviously i can

888
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:29,840
put the indicators on as well

889
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,519
so

890
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:39,600
um so there we go and um

891
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:43,039
what we can do now is

892
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:45,519
perhaps

893
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:49,840
just pause for a second

894
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,200
so

895
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,600
that's really um you know what the rig's

896
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,320
about um but i just want to talk about

897
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,840
this whole thing about the future

898
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,840
security in cars

899
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:06,320
so obviously we're demonstrating uh

900
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:09,360
using older vehicle equipment

901
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,440
and canvas hacks that of course we all

902
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,840
know about we all know that the canvas

903
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,600
is not integrity protected and there's

904
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,159
no authentication so on but it's quite

905
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:20,240
nice i mean it functions as a thing

906
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,640
um but obviously

907
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,960
there's a lot of work going on uh in the

908
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,640
standard space

909
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,799
uh but also in the hardware security

910
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:29,679
space

911
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:30,799
to actually

912
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:33,600
uh ensure future security incomes but

913
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,440
that's not going to

914
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:38,240
make uh threats go away threats are

915
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:41,840
evolving and um some really unusual

916
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,360
things are happening and just really

917
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,039
like the mobile phone space where we've

918
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:46,480
gone from just having

919
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,399
uh kind of

920
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:52,720
mobile phone calling and sms capability

921
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:53,919
um

922
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:55,840
you know all this extra functionality

923
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,080
that you never expected to be in a car

924
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,799
is in there so you all of the functions

925
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:01,600
for

926
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,279
communicating outwards and there are

927
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:04,840
multiple sims and

928
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:07,600
cars need to be secured and they're all

929
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,839
coming from all these different vendors

930
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:10,560
so

931
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,599
um

932
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:13,760
it's impossible for the oems to to

933
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,760
understand everything that they've got

934
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,560
uh and even for them they're not really

935
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,320
of

936
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,320
about things like hardware security and

937
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,280
how to implement tes and and and trusted

938
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,520
execution environment uh type technology

939
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,359
and how to how to properly implement

940
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:31,440
secure boom build all of this together

941
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,679
into such a current whole

942
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:36,239
but the technology is moving so quickly

943
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:39,760
um that you know they're jumping into

944
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,079
launching automotive ethernet

945
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:44,639
on top of legacy technologies

946
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:48,639
they're launching uh v2x type stuff so

947
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:51,359
but multiple new interfaces coming into

948
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:55,440
vehicles and and it's going at pace so

949
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,040
while we can bring

950
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,040
a lot of our knowledge

951
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,520
into into that domain and there is a lot

952
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,040
of transference

953
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:06,560
of knowledge um everything from

954
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:09,040
uh the stuff on s-bomb

955
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,880
through to like as i say hardware

956
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,480
security

957
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,880
through to mobile security

958
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,520
improvements and to protocol security so

959
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,599
that is all coming together and and they

960
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:21,119
can kind of stand

961
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,960
on the shoulders of all of that work and

962
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,640
benefit from it

963
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,320
i still don't think there's a level of

964
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:29,760
maturity in the automotive industry

965
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,640
that is commensurate with the threat

966
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:35,359
and of course you know this is a

967
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:38,560
these are vehicles that are essentially

968
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:42,079
uh weapons and and can kill people and

969
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:44,640
um it's a very very unusual

970
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:48,400
uh sort of moving iot device

971
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,720
so i still have a lot of concerns

972
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:53,280
um and i i

973
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,040
think that

974
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,200
you know the security research community

975
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,079
has to has to really help these guys to

976
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:02,320
understand um they're still coming to

977
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,119
terms with you know what what cvd is

978
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:06,880
what vulnerability disclosure is and how

979
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,920
to handle vulnerabilities um

980
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,599
in multiple places

981
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:14,000
and there are some sensitive ones so of

982
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,720
the obvious one being a lot of the the

983
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:19,839
khaki hacks but ultimately they

984
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:21,359
they need the security research

985
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:23,280
community and they will benefit from our

986
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,640
input

987
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,720
and i think it's just a case of

988
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,640
kind of waiting for them to get to that

989
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,560
state and they are getting there

990
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:33,280
uh and helping to point out to them

991
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,359
uh the stuff that we see

992
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:36,880
um that

993
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,240
maybe they're not going to see in a

994
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,079
development center and they're not going

995
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:42,240
to think well or they may think you know

996
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,920
why would you ever

997
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,920
try this particular attack no one would

998
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,839
ever do that when actually we know that

999
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:50,400
of course somebody would do that so we

1000
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,720
bring a kind of hugely different skill

1001
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,960
set um to to what they have in

1002
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,280
engineering um but both were equally

1003
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,880
valid

1004
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,280
so um yeah i mean i'm a little bit

1005
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,920
skeptical as to like how

1006
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:04,720
uh

1007
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,760
um

1008
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:08,000
sort of attacks can be really detected

1009
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,119
in future vehicles on board um

1010
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:14,240
because as an attacker i probably i'm

1011
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,680
going to want to disrupt that and i'm

1012
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,480
probably going to know that that there's

1013
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,079
going to be some detection mechanism in

1014
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:22,640
there so you we really need to think

1015
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,839
like well one step or two steps ahead so

1016
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:27,599
how does the attacker react to a

1017
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:30,480
particular defense mechanism and so in

1018
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,440
the case of the mileage correction there

1019
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:36,000
we were able to actually kind of attack

1020
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,240
the defense mechanism

1021
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,640
and really really screw around with it

1022
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:41,680
and

1023
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,079
you know that for the defender they have

1024
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:46,320
to make sure that everything's right but

1025
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,400
as an attacker i can just make sure that

1026
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,440
everything just dies and they're still

1027
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:55,280
you know reach my objectives

1028
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:58,640
so um i mentioned sim racing so uh i've

1029
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,640
really really got engaged with sim

1030
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,720
racing during the pandemic and

1031
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,480
and actually utilizing this rig and it's

1032
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,720
been a really good way of actually um

1033
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,480
talking to people who are in the car

1034
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,880
industry as well about um the sort of

1035
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,040
threats and so on and um

1036
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,680
competing apex online racing i said of

1037
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,839
course the competition only gt3 leagues

1038
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:20,400
and and other leagues and

1039
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,920
they're really they're really really

1040
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,320
fantastic and um

1041
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,000
i think the more people in the hacking

1042
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,760
community that get into sim racing and

1043
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,560
be absolutely fantastic um but

1044
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,800
in a kind of another vein here so i'm

1045
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,960
racing with the rig but it's absolutely

1046
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,960
incredible to see that sort of

1047
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:40,480
line between uh real world racing and

1048
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:43,440
sim sports uh being crossed

1049
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:46,480
so there's a sort of real mixed reality

1050
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,400
that's going on and that's what we'll

1051
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,560
see in the future it's really a gateway

1052
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,720
into the future all of these circuits

1053
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:55,200
are laser mapped uh the equipment the

1054
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,200
fanatec wheels for example they're in

1055
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,040
the actual cars

1056
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:02,160
so this is a real real mix and of course

1057
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,200
um

1058
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,760
even these esports communities uh suffer

1059
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,920
cyber security issues and um there's

1060
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,960
been a lot of ddosing uh of of servers

1061
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:11,599
and

1062
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:13,200
the suspicion is it's actually yeah

1063
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,599
gambling syndicates um

1064
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:17,280
sort of um

1065
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,359
betting on races and disrupting them so

1066
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:21,599
uh really really interesting in itself

1067
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:23,359
um if you want to find out a little bit

1068
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:26,240
more um well of course um

1069
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,880
so you can go to my twitch and uh i've

1070
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,960
got a few uh live streams where we do

1071
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,560
drive alongs in in the trucks that's

1072
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:35,280
euro truck simulator 2 there um and we

1073
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,000
do

1074
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,599
different things in the simulator and we

1075
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:39,200
go around the rig and explain what we're

1076
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,440
doing so so have a look on there and

1077
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,280
there's quite a few more videos for

1078
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,760
defcon here for this event

1079
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,960
um and that's really it so uh thank you

1080
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,920
um very much for listening um i'm gonna

1081
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,720
be in the room uh so for those of you

1082
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,119
who are in the car hiking village

1083
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:58,640
listening to this

1084
00:39:58,640 --> 00:39:59,839
have a look around for me because i'll

1085
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:01,520
be standing there somewhere

1086
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:04,759
thank you

1087
