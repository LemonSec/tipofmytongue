1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,240
welcome to the project obsidian incident

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,879
response module today the title of our

3
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:10,320
talk is it all starts here scoping an

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,719
incident where i will be going into

5
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:15,519
detail about how to scope an incident

6
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:18,480
and triage before you actually jump into

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,640
the real me of the analysis

8
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,720
so with that i'm going to be going into

9
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,359
a little bit of background about

10
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,679
the kind of resources and different

11
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,279
portions of this

12
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:32,880
talk so that everybody's kind of on the

13
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,040
same page as i get into the actual

14
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,719
scoping and triage conversations a

15
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,440
little bit later on

16
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,879
the first one is really around the

17
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:42,719
investigator mindset

18
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,680
this is not anything new i think most of

19
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,600
us kind of naturally do this but this is

20
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,520
really just putting words to that

21
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,879
thought process

22
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:52,160
so the first thing is really

23
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,840
understanding that whenever you're going

24
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,600
into an investigation that you should be

25
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,640
creating some kind of hypothesis

26
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,120
it's not always very obvious it's not

27
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,800
always very clear on what you should

28
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,239
questions you should be asking but the

29
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,560
more you do this i think you kind of get

30
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,840
that feeling of oh this looks like x

31
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,680
because of this

32
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,920
or this looks like

33
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,560
initial access through rdp or this looks

34
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,400
like ransomware

35
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,840
as you do more and more investigations

36
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,000
you kind of get that understanding of

37
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,840
what something may be and you can create

38
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,320
good hypothesis which then leads to a

39
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,439
more structured and strategic analysis

40
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:31,520
versus just jumping into something and

41
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,200
not really having an idea of where to

42
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,360
start looking

43
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,439
so of course step number one creating a

44
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:38,640
hypothesis

45
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,640
moving on past that is really

46
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,320
understanding what evidence you're going

47
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,079
to need to prove it

48
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,000
so of course you can have any hypothesis

49
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,320
in the world but if you want to prove

50
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,079
anything in

51
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:53,040
ir you need the evidence to back it up

52
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,880
so as you're going through this you also

53
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,799
need to understand what type of evidence

54
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,880
you are going to be able to prove that

55
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,200
rdp took place or that this phishing

56
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,360
email is malicious how do you prove that

57
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,079
this is actually

58
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:08,560
something that is malicious versus just

59
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,760
stating that as your opinion

60
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,920
and then uh step number three which is

61
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,080
almost more important is determining if

62
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,480
that evidence is even attainable are

63
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,560
there logs in place to be able to prove

64
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,800
that this happened can you prove that

65
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,959
that domain was malicious

66
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:26,959
can you prove that these emails were

67
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:29,280
sent externally whatever it may be you

68
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,920
need to be able to prove what actually

69
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,760
happened with the evidence that you have

70
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,080
in hand and in some cases you may just

71
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,599
may not have any evidence at all

72
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,360
so then you move into step four which i

73
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,280
think where most people tend to jump

74
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,599
right in is just reviewing and analyzing

75
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,680
the actual evidence itself

76
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,599
this is something that i think a lot of

77
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,440
people enjoy doing this is what we talk

78
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,360
about when we're talking about technical

79
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,640
investigation

80
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,319
but a lot of times when you're doing

81
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,159
this you are missing out on a lot of

82
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,480
good detail that could be gathered if

83
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,920
you just took the time to step back and

84
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,920
understand what type of evidence would

85
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,519
even be helpful to understand the

86
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,760
situation

87
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,599
and then step number five last thing you

88
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,760
do once you have a hypothesis is proving

89
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,560
it whether it is correct it is incorrect

90
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,159
or the last one that i think a lot of

91
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,640
people forget about is it unable to be

92
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,319
determined

93
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:23,040
that's portion comes up a lot more in ir

94
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,200
than you would think a lot of times we

95
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,360
have to create some kind of conclusion

96
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,440
that we can't really determine what

97
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,480
happened

98
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,319
the key to this is being able to

99
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:34,640
determine why you can't determine what

100
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,959
happened is it because you don't know

101
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,080
the evidence that you would need to

102
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,400
prove it or maybe the evidence you do

103
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,799
know but it is just unattainable at the

104
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:44,799
time that's why step two and three years

105
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,200
so important to this because oftentimes

106
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,680
if you can't do step two or three it

107
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,840
jumps right into unable to be determined

108
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,599
and nobody likes that answer but if you

109
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,120
can give the answer of we can't

110
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,040
determine the evidence but if we had

111
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,040
this evidence source we would be able to

112
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,519
find it it still gives some kind of

113
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,200
action that can be taken place versus

114
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,120
just saying i don't know and throwing

115
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,680
your hands up

116
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,159
beyond that i want to talk a little bit

117
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:12,560
about the different life cycles that are

118
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,200
common in ir of course the incident

119
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,199
response life cycle is

120
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:18,798
bread and butter is what you're going to

121
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:20,639
need to know no matter what's going on

122
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,880
which is preparation detection analysis

123
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,280
containment eradication recovery and

124
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,759
then post incident activities

125
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,360
i won't jump too much into each one of

126
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,199
these quite yet but some of the other

127
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,800
talks will be going into a little bit

128
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,560
more detail of what each of these truly

129
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,440
mean

130
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,040
what i'm going to be focused on is

131
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,440
actually how you move from preparation

132
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,360
which is anytime you're not in an

133
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,800
incident you should be preparing for an

134
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,759
incident

135
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,240
two detection analysis is it just a

136
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,720
matter of starting what do you do how do

137
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,400
i start

138
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,520
that's the question i'm here to answer

139
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,040
and then mitre

140
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,560
if you're not familiar with mitre i

141
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,639
would highly highly highly recommend you

142
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,120
go get familiar with mitre it is quickly

143
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,520
becoming kind of the industry standard

144
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,800
in a way

145
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,400
it's a collection of different adversary

146
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,080
tactics techniques and procedures if

147
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,160
you've heard the turn tgps before this

148
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,120
is kind of

149
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,919
where that originates from

150
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,320
um the tactics techniques of procedures

151
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,960
at a high level tactic is the goal of

152
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,320
the adversary what they're trying to

153
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,360
achieve

154
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,479
technique is the actual

155
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,360
uh process they're using to obtain that

156
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,600
goal and then the procedure is the very

157
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,919
specifics of what exactly they're doing

158
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:33,360
and potentially the differences and

159
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,759
procedures you may see depending on

160
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,680
which thread actors involved or which

161
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,680
type of

162
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,280
technique is utilized

163
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,039
so like i mentioned before my main goal

164
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:50,000
here is how do you move from preparation

165
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,560
to detection analysis because it's easy

166
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,600
to say

167
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,440
you just start looking but what does

168
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,199
that truly mean

169
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:58,639
well that's where these two things come

170
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,720
in scoping and triage

171
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,280
scoping is understanding all the known

172
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,400
facts

173
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,800
and what the impact is at the current

174
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,840
state

175
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,120
you aren't going to necessarily know

176
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,560
everything at the beginning of an

177
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,199
incident but you can take the time to

178
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,080
understand all the known facts currently

179
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,680
because a lot of times you are going to

180
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,199
miss things when you're jumping into an

181
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:20,479
incident and going straight into

182
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,720
analysis because yes that is definitely

183
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,039
the fun portion but it is not the most

184
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:27,199
important portion depending on what your

185
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,440
objective is

186
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,280
then the next portion we go into is

187
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,639
triage

188
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,120
and triage really isn't necessarily

189
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,240
analysis it's pre-analysis in a way it's

190
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,479
the initial analysis you do to gather

191
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,720
the appropriate leads so that you can

192
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,280
create a proper investigation plan and

193
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,199
give people clear objectives on what

194
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,120
they should be looking for

195
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,880
nobody likes going into an investigation

196
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,720
where they know nothing because you end

197
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,400
up just looking and looking and looking

198
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,400
until maybe something hits

199
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,319
and then once you get that hit you kind

200
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,160
of pivot and pivot until you can answer

201
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,759
the question

202
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,759
this is very similar in process but what

203
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:06,479
we're doing is once we find that lead we

204
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,560
note it down as something to investigate

205
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,400
and then look for additional leads and

206
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,599
then once we've gotten everything

207
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,319
together we start doing a much broader

208
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,880
and stronger analysis and we can compare

209
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,160
notes and see

210
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,360
what actually took place here

211
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,880
so

212
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,120
with that i'm going to jump right into

213
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,599
scoping

214
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,319
so incident scoping for death quick

215
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,560
definition is really understanding what

216
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,960
happened at the current state

217
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,280
this isn't necessarily always something

218
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,080
you have to do but i always urge that

219
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,599
it's something you do no matter the type

220
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,360
of incident you're dealing with you

221
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,199
should always gather as much information

222
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,520
as possible early on because it is

223
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,879
likely that those

224
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,199
sources of evidence or those sources of

225
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:52,960
information for the incident are going

226
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,960
to go away the further and further you

227
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:59,120
delve into the incident as time goes on

228
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,479
so one of the first things you should

229
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,879
obviously always try to figure out is

230
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,120
determine if that incident should even

231
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,000
be considered an incident is it just a

232
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,879
security event or is it a full-blown

233
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:13,599
incident and one of the questions that i

234
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:16,160
like to ask with this is have you seen

235
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,520
this before

236
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,599
because if you've seen this before

237
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,440
it could still definitely be an incident

238
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,440
but a lot of times it is likely

239
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,599
something that is common maybe in this

240
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,280
configuration maybe something that just

241
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,039
needs to be fixed that hasn't been fixed

242
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:30,720
yet but

243
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,039
make sure you ask the question because

244
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,399
i've been a part of a lot of

245
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,559
investigations where we just start and

246
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,080
we consider it an incident from the

247
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,719
get-go and as soon as we do we find out

248
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,200
about you know a day and a half later

249
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,519
that oh this was actually

250
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,360
just a misconfiguration that was not

251
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,800
fixed in time

252
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,560
so you want to make sure that you take

253
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,880
the time to ask this question and really

254
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,959
consider is this an incident

255
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,399
if you don't have classifications that

256
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,800
exist today to properly say whether

257
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,200
something is an incident or it is a

258
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,519
security event or assigning some level

259
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:04,959
of severity to it

260
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:06,160
that is something you should definitely

261
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,000
look into because if you can do that it

262
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,760
makes it even better that way you could

263
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,120
say if it's a

264
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,920
medium or high level threat then we will

265
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,839
say is incident if it is a low level

266
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,240
threat then we will say it will proceed

267
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,000
as a normal security event

268
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,760
then moving on from there is really

269
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,680
understanding the incident and what

270
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,120
needs to be done

271
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,240
so figure out what exactly is going on

272
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,320
and what is the end goal

273
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,480
a lot of times we jump into these things

274
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,480
and we don't have a goal in mind we

275
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,279
don't know what it is that we want done

276
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,640
as a result of finding all this

277
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,760
information

278
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,560
but

279
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,080
if you talk to people they kind of

280
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,839
already have that in their head but it

281
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:47,680
really does depend on your role

282
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,519
an analyst may want to figure out how

283
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,760
does this malware work they want to see

284
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,440
the intricacies of what it does and

285
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,720
seeing if they can create proper

286
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,399
detections around it

287
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:59,120
the cso may say hey i want to figure out

288
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,720
if there's any reason that we should be

289
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,399
considering some kind of compliance

290
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,800
notification is there any reason that

291
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,839
legal should be involved

292
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:10,959
well the manager may say hey i want to

293
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:12,880
know how long are these systems going to

294
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,920
be down when am i going to be back up

295
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,079
and what is it going to take to prevent

296
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:19,760
this from happening again

297
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,880
everyone is going to have different

298
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,640
types of questions and different types

299
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,800
of objectives to based on their role so

300
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,720
making sure that you can clearly note

301
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,880
those down of what people expect is

302
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,200
really really important so make sure you

303
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,279
understand that and don't assume

304
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:36,160
someone's expectations ask them get it

305
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,160
on writing make sure it's noted down so

306
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:42,079
people understand what their end goal is

307
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,440
and then using templates which i will

308
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,040
thankfully show you a couple examples

309
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,000
here today

310
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,240
using templates is going to save you a

311
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,320
lot a lot of time

312
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,160
trying to jump into this with a blank

313
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,200
piece of paper is scary when you just

314
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,720
open up an empty word document and

315
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,079
there's nothing on the page and you know

316
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:02,160
you have to create a report

317
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,279
is very tough because you're going to

318
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,200
miss a lot of details you're not going

319
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,480
to ask some of the right questions that

320
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,320
you should be asking so make sure you

321
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,560
can note all these things down have all

322
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,399
these questions pre-prepared for things

323
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:15,839
that you commonly ask in these

324
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,120
situations

325
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,120
that way when you're going into an

326
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,880
incident you have them in front of you

327
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,640
you can walk up to the person ask them

328
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,399
the questions write down the answers and

329
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,399
fill in everything you need to do

330
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:27,600
and we'll kind of talk about that in a

331
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,079
little second

332
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,680
beyond that once you've kind of gathered

333
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,040
all the information that you need and

334
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,959
you go through this scoping document

335
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:39,040
which i'll show you in a second

336
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,440
um then you're going to be talking about

337
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,560
how

338
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,040
this investigation needs to proceed with

339
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,800
your team members

340
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,399
and remember your team members aren't

341
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,000
necessarily just

342
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,839
the security team it isn't necessarily

343
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:53,440
just the network team it is the

344
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,920
combination of whoever can help and

345
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,040
provide value to that investigation

346
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,440
so make sure you gather everyone's notes

347
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,200
i personally like to have everybody kind

348
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,279
of put their notes into one document or

349
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,600
one location so everything can be looked

350
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,200
through very easily because people are

351
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,800
going to have different perspectives so

352
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,160
making sure that you get all those

353
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,320
different perspectives put it into a

354
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,680
single place that people can look

355
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,360
through it and potentially get inspired

356
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,200
on how the investigation should proceed

357
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,440
the next one is evidence sources

358
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,360
evidence sources should be discussed

359
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,440
early i know it doesn't always seem like

360
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,040
that i know sometimes

361
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,519
you kind of just go with it until you

362
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,360
determine something and then you find

363
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,200
the evidence source for it but if you

364
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,040
can do that in advance

365
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,399
create that hypothesis

366
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,240
determine what evidence sources you need

367
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,160
for that hypothesis you're going to be

368
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,399
ahead of the game you don't have to wait

369
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,680
to tell the networking team to pull

370
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,079
netflow data for three days because that

371
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:52,720
isn't something you can do very easily

372
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,480
you need to be able to pre-plan in your

373
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,880
head and have an idea of what to expect

374
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,560
what you would need and again a lot of

375
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,200
this just comes with experience but you

376
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,519
can also use things like mitre miter

377
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:05,440
actually is a great source for evidence

378
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,440
sources where they will detail out

379
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,600
something like initial access

380
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,519
rdp and they'll give you a couple

381
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,279
evidence sources of what you can look

382
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:15,200
for to potentially

383
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,519
be ahead of the game so look through

384
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,440
those types of things use the resources

385
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,720
available

386
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,880
and try to document as much as you can

387
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,040
early on that way you're not looking

388
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,480
back and trying to remember what

389
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,240
evidence sources you wanted from the

390
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,880
very beginning

391
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:32,480
and then confirming those objectives

392
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,000
that we talked about we're going to have

393
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,200
different roles people are going to have

394
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,639
different objectives

395
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,560
be very clear in what those objectives

396
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,880
are going to be you can have multiple

397
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,639
that's fine but making sure everyone

398
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,560
understands them and they can understand

399
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,000
the goals that they need to try to go

400
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
after if the goal of the investigation

401
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,839
is to determine data exfiltration you

402
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,079
may not need to spend as much time on

403
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:55,440
the deep malware analysis

404
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,199
you know if it is a ransomware

405
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:58,800
executable you're not going to spend

406
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,399
nearly as much time looking for the

407
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:03,120
decrypter if the goal is to see if data

408
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,639
exfiltration took place in the first

409
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,880
place

410
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,360
and then giving next steps for each irt

411
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,519
member these next two are kind of for

412
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:13,360
whoever the incident commander is

413
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,600
whoever's kind of running the show

414
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,240
make sure you give a clear task to each

415
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,680
individual

416
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,279
anyone on that team should be able to

417
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:22,959
leave that room knowing exactly what

418
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:25,680
they need to do not just go look tell

419
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,720
them to go look at windows event logs go

420
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,399
look at the

421
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,000
network alerts that have came up in the

422
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,839
last 30 days give very clear

423
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,120
instructions on what you would expect

424
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,120
from them sometimes you may not have

425
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,279
exactly what you need them to do but

426
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,040
take the time to try to get as much

427
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,800
information and give as clear as

428
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,959
instructions as you can otherwise people

429
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:47,279
are just going to endlessly pivot until

430
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,600
they get tired not have any answers and

431
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,680
kind of burn out before you can actually

432
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,120
get any real analysis done

433
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,639
and the last step here is really

434
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,440
establishing a communication cadence so

435
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,279
once you've said hey go out and do these

436
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:02,160
tests

437
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,920
give them a time frame in which they

438
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,160
should come back to you with something

439
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,839
they don't have to have answers by that

440
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:09,120
point they're not going to have their

441
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,440
analysis completed by that point give a

442
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,839
touch face so that you know how to go

443
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:15,279
through these things get the proper

444
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:16,800
notes that you need put them all down

445
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,040
the way that looks beneficial

446
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,199
and then finally you can use that

447
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:23,120
information in these kind of either

448
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,120
daily calls every four hours every eight

449
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,199
hours whatever your cadence may be

450
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:28,959
and you have a kind of set time frame in

451
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:30,959
your mind of when you should start to

452
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,959
wrap up your investigation collect your

453
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:35,040
notes and then maybe move to something

454
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,279
else

455
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,040
so with that i'm going to jump into my

456
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,279
sample for these scoping notes so with

457
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:44,880
this keep in mind we're going to be

458
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,279
going through kill chain one

459
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,040
uh we'll go into a lot more detail some

460
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,440
of these other kill chains in different

461
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,880
presentations and some of these

462
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,279
specifics but all you need to know from

463
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,759
my example is that a phishing email has

464
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:58,959
taken place

465
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:01,600
and it looks to be impersonating the

466
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,320
legal department

467
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,199
jump over to here

468
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,600
so you can see this is my template for

469
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,480
scoping it's not a detailed document

470
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,800
it's nothing super fancy i'm not putting

471
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,199
in special logos or graphics or anything

472
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:19,199
like that it's really just a way to

473
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,880
organize my thoughts as i'm going

474
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,800
through this and i try to put a lot of

475
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,800
these questions in order that makes

476
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,880
sense as if you're interviewing someone

477
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,560
so the initial questions are really all

478
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,880
based around uh what are the types of

479
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,480
questions that you're going to be asking

480
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,519
someone or you want from them before you

481
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:40,639
really you know start

482
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:43,440
the interview process

483
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,040
so the first one of course is you know

484
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,360
who which organizations evolved were the

485
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,440
key members when was this reported who

486
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,680
is assigned who's kind of aware of the

487
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,519
incidents going on is there any special

488
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:54,959
legal privileges that we need to be

489
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:57,279
aware of and the last question which is

490
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:58,880
probably the most important

491
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,680
what are the objectives what do you need

492
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,800
to know

493
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,119
and keep in mind this is based on your

494
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,520
first time talking or hearing about an

495
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,359
incident so you're not going to have all

496
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,599
the answers right away but having these

497
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,599
pre-prepared gives you something to look

498
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,679
at so when you're at the end of the

499
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:17,839
point of talking about whatever it is

500
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:20,160
you need to with them you can refer back

501
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,079
to this document and say okay

502
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,839
actually have a couple more questions

503
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:26,799
and run through these

504
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,600
then we get into the detection portion

505
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,280
of things which is where a lot of the

506
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,200
meat of this comes from because pretty

507
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,120
much detection is why you're there

508
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,559
somebody's detected something now

509
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:37,600
they're bringing you in to help

510
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,280
investigate it

511
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,720
the first question here is when was the

512
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,120
incident detected and this is a general

513
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,600
statement um you know you want the time

514
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,480
frame

515
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,200
but

516
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,200
oftentimes i find when you ask this

517
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,120
question or something similar people

518
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,120
will just start to talk it will really

519
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,120
just really go into all these details

520
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,480
about things

521
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,320
and describing the incident as much as

522
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,039
they can from their head which is fine

523
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,720
don't interrupt them don't necessarily

524
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,880
stop them and you know say hey i have

525
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,400
very specific questions you need to go

526
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,720
through allow them to talk document as

527
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,720
much as possible and you might be able

528
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,919
to answer a lot of these questions

529
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:15,280
before you get to them so take the time

530
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,720
use this first bullet point that i would

531
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,320
suggest as a

532
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,880
incident summary bullet almost so that

533
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,320
when you're getting all this information

534
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,600
you can write everything down and you

535
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,720
can kind of move it throughout the

536
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,320
document later if you really need to

537
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,520
so you can see all the questions here

538
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,360
are dependent on detection we really

539
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,799
want to emphasize

540
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:35,520
how are you how was this detected you

541
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,679
know was this a manual process

542
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:39,440
uh what kind of information was a part

543
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,360
of the detection i've noticed a lot of

544
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,520
times that when you're working on a case

545
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,200
somebody may say well we had a lurch

546
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,600
trigger for a specific system

547
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,000
problem is nobody actually looks at the

548
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,360
actual alert until maybe you know

549
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,000
a day or two into the investigation

550
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,760
make sure you gather what's initially

551
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,360
part of that detection in most cases

552
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,960
so in this case we see there is an email

553
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,280
message and it's detailing a violation

554
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,200
of an id policy

555
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,039
requiring additional action

556
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:11,120
then i actually took a screenshot of

557
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,080
that actual email itself which is to

558
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,360
summarize since it's a little bit hard

559
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,799
to read

560
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,440
that a specific individual violated my t

561
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,840
policy this is coming from the

562
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,480
quote-unquote legal department

563
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,080
and there's an attachment that needs to

564
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,799
be reviewed as a secondary action as a

565
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:31,200
result of this

566
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,200
so looks pretty suspect we want that

567
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,799
information there so that way if we ever

568
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,559
need to refer to it or find the original

569
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:37,600
email

570
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,120
we actually have some information here

571
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,679
that we could work from

572
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:43,360
and then the impact in this case there's

573
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,880
not really too much impact right now we

574
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,200
just know the one email recipient but

575
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,360
obviously we want to expand that scope

576
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,840
because it could be

577
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,520
more and you can see i put tbd here in

578
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,440
terms of who else is impacted as far as

579
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,520
the host or whatever systems

580
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,799
the goal of this document isn't

581
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,480
necessarily to answer every single

582
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,080
question it's just to have those

583
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,840
questions there so that you aren't

584
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,360
missing things that otherwise could be

585
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,840
useful

586
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,600
and then is there a unique identifier

587
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,600
for the effective resources

588
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,960
the only thing we have right now is the

589
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,200
specific email phishing was from

590
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,760
this domain which was magnum

591
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,720
tempest.financial which is

592
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,840
potentially a little suspect

593
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,840
then we go into the actions basically

594
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,679
determining you know what has been done

595
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:27,840
since this detection took place in any

596
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,520
remediation been done

597
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,679
and then the environment itself whether

598
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:33,520
it's a specific department if you're

599
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,200
working from a consulting standpoint or

600
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,480
you're working for

601
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,720
another organization understanding all

602
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,960
these key details about their tool sets

603
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,760
users endpoints capabilities

604
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,280
so that you have other things to

605
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,039
potentially lean on if you run out of

606
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:49,200
ideas

607
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,799
then the last two here are really about

608
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:53,360
the kind of iocs the network and malware

609
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,919
iocs if they see enough

610
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:57,840
alerts or something else already this is

611
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,440
kind of gathering additional information

612
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,840
from that

613
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,440
then the last thing is the next steps

614
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,280
this is essentially confirming those

615
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,039
objectives making sure you understand

616
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:08,640
the objectives from

617
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,400
whoever you are serving

618
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,039
whoever is kind of your boss and what

619
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:14,880
are your personal objectives there

620
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,080
should be kind of different angles

621
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,840
you're taking objectives so get them all

622
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,520
noted down determine the priority of

623
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,760
them and then you can move into the

624
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,480
investigation

625
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,080
so

626
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,639
back into here

627
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,400
all right

628
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,720
so now we are going to jump into triage

629
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,400
speed up a little bit so the first

630
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,640
portion of triage of course is evidence

631
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,080
collection you know you have your

632
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,760
scoping notes understood you have all

633
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,919
the information that you can obtain at

634
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:51,919
this point now it starts to move into

635
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:54,080
let's try to get some triage done

636
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,640
analysis to establish some leads

637
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,520
so the first firstly uh collection of

638
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,960
evidence has changed quite a bit these

639
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,039
days i mean obviously before

640
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:05,679
uh imaging and forensics was kind of the

641
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:08,000
key with dead box forensics but now

642
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,360
things have changed quite a bit you have

643
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,880
imaging software you have different

644
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,559
types of triage scripts you have

645
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:14,000
security consoles to look through to

646
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,159
gather information log files and

647
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:19,200
hugeland virtual system files

648
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,480
one of the things i've noticed that is

649
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,000
actually pretty important in this from

650
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,159
the console standard point is

651
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:27,360
obtaining and providing access to these

652
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,720
different consoles

653
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,880
you should have a process to provide

654
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,280
access to individuals such as an

655
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,960
external firm that's helping with

656
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,120
forensics or potentially a different

657
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,480
department that may be kind of

658
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,960
supplementing to help out

659
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,280
provide them access in a secure way so

660
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,720
that you're not getting in the way of

661
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,200
investigation just because of a strange

662
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,120
audit policy make sure you have these

663
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,440
contingencies in place because this is

664
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,280
often what causes a lot of

665
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,280
investigations is they don't have access

666
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,080
to the things that they need

667
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,360
and then clear instructions on how to

668
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,880
preserve and prepare this is more

669
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,039
intended for the security teams if you

670
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:05,039
have a way you would like to prepare

671
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:06,960
evidence that you have all the data you

672
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,919
need collecting specific artifacts

673
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:13,760
performing the triage script or the

674
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,159
imaging software in a very specific

675
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:17,600
set of ways

676
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,039
make sure you note those down and

677
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:21,120
provide that to whoever may be doing it

678
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,440
because maybe in some cases the it team

679
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,600
may be gathering the system so when you

680
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,840
say hey take that system offline let

681
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,360
them know what you mean when you say

682
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,600
take that system offline do you mean

683
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,760
pulling the cord on the whole system do

684
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,640
you mean just taking off wi-fi

685
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,440
pulling the network cable attached to it

686
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,520
or potentially running some type of

687
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,679
software on it to prevent it from

688
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:45,440
communicating with anything else make

689
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,799
sure you're very clear about what your

690
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:49,120
intentions are

691
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:52,240
then pre-planning for analysis um

692
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,840
the scope and time frame of

693
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,640
investigations has changed quite a bit

694
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,440
uh

695
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,360
i think it was back in around 2018 the

696
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,320
time frame was around at least 180 days

697
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,440
before

698
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,039
malware was actually detected in the

699
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:06,400
environment

700
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,679
and that was 2018 was a while ago but i

701
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:11,679
think most of us can say that that isn't

702
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:12,480
too

703
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,080
different than it is today we'll cut

704
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,760
that in half and say today it's 90 days

705
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,600
even so you want to make sure when

706
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,159
you're gathering evidence you do that in

707
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:23,120
mind

708
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,400
that if you're seeing something like

709
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,159
ransomware taking place that's not an

710
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:27,919
indication that ransomware took place

711
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:28,960
today

712
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,960
that's indication that somebody may have

713
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,120
been in your environment for multiple

714
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,919
days if not months if that maybe a whole

715
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:37,919
year before getting to this point where

716
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:40,159
they're executing malware

717
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:42,320
so make sure you understand the full

718
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,960
scope of what you should be collecting

719
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,360
the idea that your current time frame of

720
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:51,840
when this first started may expand

721
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,080
the triage analysis so when you're going

722
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,000
into triage make sure you organize and

723
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,200
document everything that you're

724
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,640
collecting

725
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,640
this can be tedious this can be really

726
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,799
annoying sometimes but it's very very

727
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,480
important especially when you're talking

728
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,720
about investigation that is

729
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,039
crucial to the legal or forensic side of

730
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:12,080
the house

731
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,840
making sure you document everything that

732
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,600
you are collecting and why you are

733
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,480
investigating it not only gives you

734
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,559
coverage in terms of how you investigate

735
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:22,159
it but also gives you coverage in terms

736
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:24,400
of what needs to be done

737
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,919
don't rush into an investigation without

738
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:28,320
a plan a lot of people like to just get

739
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,799
into investigation and pivot until they

740
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:32,400
get too tired to understand what's going

741
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,200
on

742
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,840
so make sure you have a very clear

743
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,000
idea of what you need to be looking at

744
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,279
what evidence sources you should be

745
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:41,039
looking at take a little time to do

746
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,880
research and see like hey if this type

747
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,720
of ransomware executed

748
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,640
uh what type of evidence should i be

749
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,880
looking for taking those few moments to

750
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,720
look for those evidence sources versus

751
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:51,520
just

752
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,600
jumping in and analyzing something that

753
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,559
may be

754
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:56,240
you know not very valuable in the long

755
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,000
run is just going to waste your time and

756
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,679
make you more and more tired and trying

757
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:02,640
to figure out what's going on

758
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:06,320
and then last portion here is really

759
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,679
just writing it down

760
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:09,360
summarize what you are seeing not just

761
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,480
the bad stuff

762
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,320
if you're seeing commonalities if you're

763
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,200
seeing

764
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,840
a lot of activity around google drive

765
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,360
that you know doesn't necessarily look

766
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,919
malicious but is unusual

767
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:22,159
make sure you note those things down and

768
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:23,520
more importantly you just want to note

769
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,360
things down that stand out you have

770
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,120
something that you would consider a

771
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,480
finding

772
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,559
it's tough to kind of

773
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:31,360
uh

774
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:34,559
verbalize what a finding is but really

775
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,640
it's something that stands out to you

776
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,640
and i'll give you some ideas of how you

777
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,679
should be documenting that

778
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,400
so how do you find evil you know triage

779
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,559
like we said it's not necessarily the

780
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:48,559
the true analysis that's going to take

781
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:50,000
place but you still need to understand

782
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,720
where to look to find commonalities

783
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,880
these are just a couple things that i've

784
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,640
noted down with these common indicators

785
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,720
but the key idea here is

786
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,240
malicious behavior is not going to

787
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,480
always be identified when incident

788
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,720
response is engaged a lot of times

789
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,039
people may say that there's been a ton

790
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:09,120
of unusual network activity where my

791
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,840
system is extremely slow and that may be

792
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,760
enough to kick off an incident so make

793
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,520
sure you have a plan so that you can do

794
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,200
your own version of a kind of threat

795
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,960
hunt because a lot of times it's going

796
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,840
to be extremely necessary

797
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,039
and the best thing you can do for any

798
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:26,880
type of incident is understanding a

799
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,399
baseline

800
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:30,240
if you know

801
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,799
what the common things that are run on a

802
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:34,559
system is then it's going to be much

803
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:36,559
easier to find the things that stand out

804
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:37,919
because that's what's going to take

805
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:39,840
place now you're going to see strange

806
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,440
connections are you going to see unusual

807
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,600
processes weird services

808
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,760
rogue accounts and usual files that have

809
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,840
strange naming conventions or even some

810
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,840
of the auto start locations that aren't

811
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,120
commonly used

812
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,480
knowing these things is what's going to

813
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:56,080
help you figure out where the bad exists

814
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,760
because if they're just operating the

815
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,000
same way as a typical user would it

816
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,440
wouldn't seem very malicious in the

817
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,360
first place

818
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,360
and again use your hypothesis approach

819
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,440
look at these different paths and

820
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,200
sometimes you're going to find points to

821
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,679
pivot on very quickly but make sure you

822
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:13,360
finish your hypothesis

823
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,720
note something down as something to

824
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,399
follow up on then once you've finished

825
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:18,399
your hypothesis move on to the next

826
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:20,559
thing you don't want to leave a bunch of

827
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:22,399
thoughts just

828
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:24,000
incomplete because at the end of that

829
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,440
you're not going to have much to report

830
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,039
you're just going to have a bunch of

831
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:29,120
incomplete hypotheses that were never

832
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,840
fully realized

833
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,200
so finding so what determines the

834
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,279
finding again changes it's something

835
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:39,840
that stands out to you and it's okay

836
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,520
sometimes you are going to come across

837
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,760
findings that end up not being your

838
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,240
findings it's fine but make sure you go

839
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,000
through the proper process so that you

840
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
can get better and better at it

841
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,520
these are the kind of six things i

842
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,200
typically would say need to be included

843
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,559
with a finding

844
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:56,799
one is the time stamp

845
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:59,520
one is the investigate or event

846
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,679
description so describing what exactly

847
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:03,120
you think you're seeing

848
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,039
three the data source where are you

849
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:06,559
getting this from

850
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:08,000
and with the data source you also want

851
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,919
to make sure you include the query or

852
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:12,000
procedure on how you got to this point

853
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
because you know just saying

854
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,320
the splunk console is not very much

855
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,080
include the actual search in there or

856
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,039
include

857
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:21,520
whatever data source you needed to get

858
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,520
to that point

859
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,840
and then the context who what where when

860
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,600
and why and if you can't answer all

861
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,559
those

862
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:29,600
maybe you need to do a little bit of

863
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,760
research to see if this is something

864
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,600
that is truly a finding

865
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,600
and then finally the code whether it's

866
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,919
the file path registrant sheet copy of

867
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:40,240
the command whatever it may be i always

868
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,399
recommend having that in your actual

869
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:44,720
notes which will actually be a report

870
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,360
which i'll talk about in a second

871
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,520
to get all that information in one place

872
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,200
you don't want to have to say well this

873
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,159
is in the splunk query if you query this

874
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:56,080
this and this then you can actually see

875
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,399
it have a copy of it available so people

876
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:01,439
can easily reference it

877
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,600
and then writing your findings when

878
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,120
you're writing down your findings make

879
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:10,399
sure you write them in a report format

880
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:12,000
this isn't necessarily just to make

881
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,399
things difficult for you this is to ease

882
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:16,159
it for you so that eventually when you

883
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:18,240
get to the end of this investigation you

884
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,000
have to write your report

885
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,679
there's not much you have to do if you

886
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:24,240
write your notes in this format you are

887
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,080
going to have it

888
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,640
already ready as if you are

889
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,360
having a report

890
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,279
so this does two things for you one is

891
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:34,960
the process of the report and it also

892
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:38,080
eases the ability for you to speak on

893
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,799
the findings as if it's a conversation

894
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:42,799
so write your notes as if you're trying

895
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,960
to explain to somebody what you are

896
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,880
seeing that will might make things much

897
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,559
easier and i'll kind of find gaps of

898
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:50,720
like oh i don't actually know this piece

899
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,039
of information as far as what user ran

900
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:56,799
this so i need to figure that out

901
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,120
and then understanding your timestamps

902
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,880
of your data source and you always try

903
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,559
to convert you to the impossible if

904
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:04,640
you're new to forensics if you're new to

905
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,399
incentive response i think everybody

906
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:08,240
knows utc is king

907
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,880
convert everything to the utc zone to

908
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,960
time zone as much as possible because it

909
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,080
will make

910
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,360
timelining and creating all these

911
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:19,559
different things so much easier

912
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:24,159
now i'm going to go through

913
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:26,559
my investigation notes

914
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:28,240
so again similar type of thing

915
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,080
investigation notes are not anything

916
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,519
overly complex

917
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:34,159
it's just a simple document to gather

918
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:36,000
all the different areas i personally

919
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,480
like organizing it by the different

920
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,240
consoles and logs you can go through and

921
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,679
then going into the hosts and then

922
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:44,320
having a small section for indicators

923
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,840
i do it this way that way you can kind

924
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,919
of separate things out based on specific

925
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:49,600
hosts but you know if you're looking at

926
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,120
a wide scale investigation where you

927
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:51,919
have

928
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:53,279
you know 300 hosts that you're

929
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:54,640
officially looking at then you can maybe

930
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,880
do it by a specific indicator or

931
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,279
something similar

932
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:00,720
so in this case we're looking at kill

933
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,399
chain one again we are looking at email

934
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:05,519
at this point we don't have too many

935
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:06,799
notes right we just looked at the

936
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,399
scoping and we have a couple of beats in

937
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:10,080
the data to add in here

938
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,240
and you can see i'm writing this in a

939
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,000
very

940
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
explanatory way i want someone to be

941
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,480
able to read this and be able to

942
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:22,880
basically state what my investigation is

943
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:26,320
so at this time frame 20 22 0 2 12

944
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,120
g21 1006

945
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:32,480
which is utc because it's in that format

946
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,559
the team identified a suspicious email

947
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:37,039
with the subject line action required

948
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:39,840
organization i.t policy violation

949
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:42,559
the email originated from the legal team

950
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:44,399
legal internal at magnus tempest

951
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:46,559
unfortunate financial which the team

952
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:48,159
validated was not a legitimate

953
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:50,640
organization domain the email received

954
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,320
by

955
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,960
amanda newen nuances

956
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,399
um and the team

957
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:57,679
is violin

958
00:32:57,679 --> 00:32:59,679
validating whether any similar emails

959
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:01,919
were sent to other users the contents of

960
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:04,159
the email are noted below

961
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:05,760
then quick confusion the contents of the

962
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,080
email appear to attempt

963
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,640
peer to attempt to coerce the employee

964
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,640
into reviewing a fake it policy

965
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,039
violation by reviewing an attachment to

966
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:16,559
the email

967
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:18,480
that is written in that format these are

968
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,159
my notes this is not a report this is

969
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:21,440
essentially what i want to include in my

970
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,679
notes that way when i go through here i

971
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:24,960
have a lot of information i could

972
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,399
already look through

973
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:28,159
subject line action required

974
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:30,080
organization i.t policy that gives me

975
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,640
something to search on i've listed out

976
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,399
the important domain here which the peer

977
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:36,320
suspect i've listed out the username

978
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,080
that was affected and all this

979
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,000
information is put into a nice little

980
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,519
paragraph format so if someone said to

981
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,360
me hey can you give me a quick write up

982
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,559
on what happened

983
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:46,720
copy paste we're done there's nothing

984
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,919
else to do

985
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:49,200
you do this with each one of your

986
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,960
findings you're going to have a

987
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,360
exceptional well-written report at the

988
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:56,080
end of all this

989
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,919
beyond that you can see the hosts i

990
00:33:57,919 --> 00:33:59,279
organized some of the information in a

991
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:01,360
similar way the only difference here is

992
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,799
that you have the host some information

993
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:04,880
about it and i specify everything by the

994
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,880
artifact so for example the windows

995
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,560
event logs and then i'll have a section

996
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,960
on which is event logs or the mft and i

997
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:14,000
have that section on mft

998
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,599
then at the very bottom i like to

999
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:17,918
include the indicators

1000
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:19,839
so this is including all the different

1001
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:21,599
types of information indicators are

1002
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:24,000
organized by network file and the

1003
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,879
affected users or associated users would

1004
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:27,918
say

1005
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:30,960
so the ip address or dns we know about

1006
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,839
right now the domain magnus tempest

1007
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:34,800
tempest.financial and i give a quick

1008
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,159
description basically saying hey it's a

1009
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:38,159
donate name associated with the sender

1010
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,560
of a fake i.t policy violation efficient

1011
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:43,280
email it's all we know at this point

1012
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,960
file nothing associated currently at

1013
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,399
this point we know that there was an

1014
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:47,679
attachment that's something that needs

1015
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:49,040
to be reviewed

1016
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,960
and then the users so we know that there

1017
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,280
was a legal internal for magnus tempest

1018
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,119
financial which was the sender and then

1019
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:57,760
the amanda nunes account which was the

1020
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,119
receiver

1021
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:01,440
so this the reason i do it this way is

1022
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,280
if someone needed information to search

1023
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,520
on or you wanted to do some intelligence

1024
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,839
work you can utilize this section to

1025
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:10,000
quickly kind of dissect that information

1026
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,440
and look to see

1027
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,040
is there anything else that we should be

1028
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,599
searching on

1029
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:16,800
and that's it

1030
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,760
it's nothing overly complex it's nothing

1031
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,079
incredible or you know it's not the most

1032
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:23,680
you know detailed report in the world

1033
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,280
that goes into all these specifics you

1034
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,800
can definitely be even more detailed

1035
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,800
than i am here it just gives you a

1036
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,480
starting point on where

1037
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:33,520
you should be looking from

1038
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:34,960
so with that

1039
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,880
my final piece of advice i hope you kind

1040
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,160
of learned a little bit you got some

1041
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,839
information that you can

1042
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:42,000
utilize in your investigations i mean

1043
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,599
obviously this topic is something i

1044
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:46,800
could go on for days if not years about

1045
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,599
so please if you have any questions uh

1046
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:51,599
please let um any other team members

1047
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:52,800
know and they can give you my

1048
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,160
information in a way that you can

1049
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:57,040
contact me and we can talk through this

1050
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,880
but my final piece of advice here uh

1051
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,160
take a breath

1052
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,280
pat yourself on the back these

1053
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,200
investigations are tough and can take a

1054
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,280
lot out of you these steps i described

1055
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,359
are not necessarily easy to do it's

1056
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:09,119
something that takes time as you go over

1057
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:10,880
it over and over and over again where

1058
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,800
you get into a flow state of how to do

1059
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,359
this time and time again

1060
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:17,760
next thing is really step away from

1061
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,880
things

1062
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,960
i can't tell you how many investigations

1063
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,280
i've been on thinking i'm so close to

1064
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,520
figuring something out and i take a

1065
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:28,000
quick 20 minute walk come back to my

1066
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,320
system open it up and i'm like oh

1067
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,079
there's the answer right there

1068
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:33,599
sometimes you just need to give your

1069
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:35,440
brain a little bit of time to recharge

1070
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,359
get back to that point that you need to

1071
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:40,320
and then you will be good to go knowing

1072
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,800
your limits this one's tough um

1073
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,720
understanding where

1074
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:48,960
you exceed and where you may need help

1075
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,599
for example for myself i'm not the best

1076
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:54,960
at a deep malware analysis so i know if

1077
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,880
i'm getting into a situation where i

1078
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,400
find some malware i can do a little bit

1079
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,640
of analysis but ultimately i may say hey

1080
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,240
i need to bring in someone else that can

1081
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,640
do stronger analysis that is what's

1082
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,560
going to make your team stronger

1083
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,839
you want to be able to do as much as

1084
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:09,359
possible but you don't need to do

1085
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:10,800
everything

1086
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,440
you have limits everyone has limits try

1087
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,960
to divvy it up as much as possible in a

1088
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,280
way that everybody can succeed and get

1089
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,040
the answers that we need

1090
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,720
and again the last thing here is ask for

1091
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:23,839
help whether it's about

1092
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:25,440
this presentation itself and

1093
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,440
understanding the steps to it whether

1094
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,760
it's figuring out details on how to do

1095
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,160
investigations better whether it's you

1096
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,680
just don't have the time and you don't

1097
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:34,880
know if you're looking at the right

1098
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,920
things ask for help it's fine all of us

1099
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,079
go through this this isn't new the more

1100
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:41,440
you can ask these types of things it

1101
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,359
just makes you better at what you do so

1102
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:44,720
the next time it comes up you know

1103
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,160
exactly what to do and you're going to

1104
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,880
be the person helping others

1105
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,640
so with that i appreciate everyone's

1106
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,720
time um if you again if you have any

1107
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,079
questions for me please let one of the

1108
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:55,839
team members know and i'm sure they can

1109
00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:57,200
get you my information if you really

1110
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,359
