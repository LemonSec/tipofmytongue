1
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:07,799
perfect

2
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:12,540
hi ladies and gentlemen welcome to the

3
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:16,260
first uh the second quantum Village uh

4
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:19,080
um uh Oxford Union style debate

5
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,080
now why are we having an Oxford Union

6
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,480
style debate Oxford Union implies a lot

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,580
of formality and we need this formality

8
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:28,260
because I'm going to give you a motion

9
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,180
that you are going to vote for in a

10
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:31,980
little bit and in order to vote you need

11
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:34,440
to be informed on both sides of this

12
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,380
argument I think Oxford Union style

13
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,660
debates Force us all to open our minds

14
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,579
and make sure that we're examining every

15
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:44,280
aspect of this I'll give you the um the

16
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,260
motion in just a second and I'll tell

17
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:47,520
you that although there's a lot of rules

18
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,020
and formality there should also be a

19
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,180
bunch of fun and levity you guys should

20
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:55,020
feel free to argue your side of this any

21
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:58,020
way you can use any facts use humor as

22
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:59,760
long as you call each other my honorable

23
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,079
opponent you can say anything you want

24
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:02,280
to about the other

25
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,359
um and as long as you call me Mr

26
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:04,440
chairman you can say anything you want

27
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,000
to about me but let me give you the

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,200
motion that we're going to vote on I'll

29
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,520
tell you the three ways that you can

30
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,299
interact with these guys number one

31
00:01:11,299 --> 00:01:14,220
interact by listening because you're

32
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,380
going to vote at the end but also

33
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:17,460
there's going to be questions and

34
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:18,900
answers at the end of this we're going

35
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,939
to ask both of them to argue their side

36
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:22,979
of the motion for five minutes and then

37
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:25,020
there will be rebuttals between them I

38
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:26,520
will be a time keeper to make sure they

39
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,799
don't go too long let me give you the

40
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,520
motion the motion is this Village the

41
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,759
quantum Village believes that due to the

42
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,640
power of quantum computers post Quantum

43
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,680
cryptography and preparing for this

44
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,280
world of quantum Computing requires more

45
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,340
emphasis today in the Enterprise we're

46
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,439
going to argue for and against that now

47
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,540
four will be David Joseph

48
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:54,299
against Mark Carney and the four

49
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:56,360
argument we'll start with five minutes

50
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:59,040
and then five minutes for the

51
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,659
um against and again I'll be time keeper

52
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:03,140
so thanks

53
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,598
okay uh I feel as though Marcus had a

54
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,220
slight disadvantage because I've had uh

55
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:14,160
about an hour on my on top of my five

56
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,400
minutes

57
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,319
let us forget

58
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:21,959
the post Quantum part of it cryptography

59
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:25,200
is about enforcing policies on our data

60
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,640
those policies should work under any

61
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,280
scenario that we that we subject them to

62
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,980
right that is the fundamental guarantee

63
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,660
and that is fundamentally what

64
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:39,420
cryptography strives to deliver

65
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:40,739
don't think of these as Quantum

66
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:43,739
resistance systems they are resistance

67
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:45,959
systems that is what we are striving to

68
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:47,879
find right

69
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:50,459
psych and rainbow failed because they

70
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:52,080
were not resistant to quantum computers

71
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,420
they weren't resistant to laptops with

72
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:57,200
single cores

73
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:01,920
meanwhile classical mcaleese right that

74
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,440
is around that has been around since

75
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,840
1978 you know it is as old as you know

76
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,420
public key crypto itself and it has you

77
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:10,620
know and it has weathered the storm

78
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:13,500
right this is a good crypto system it is

79
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:17,040
not it is it does it just you know you

80
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,900
know an unjustice

81
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,819
to call it a post-quantum crypto system

82
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:23,340
it is a very very sound crypto system

83
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,800
that has withstood crypto analysis for

84
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,560
40 years the only reason why it is now

85
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,200
coming to light is because it had you

86
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,879
know there was another system which

87
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,260
actually performed a little bit better

88
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,760
and so there was never a compelling

89
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,340
reason to use that one

90
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:40,920
the first and foremost cryptography is

91
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,680
about enforcing the policies second and

92
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,200
second most it is about the performance

93
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,080
nist has stated as much number one comes

94
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,420
security number two comes performance

95
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:52,739
and number three come other

96
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:54,959
considerations like you know is the

97
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,340
implementation so difficult that it's

98
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,260
just going to be botched for isogenes

99
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:01,080
they're very very complicated so I would

100
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,080
say that is cryptography ready you know

101
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,000
is post Quantum cryptography ready for

102
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,519
Enterprises and the answer is almost

103
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:12,180
trivially yes Enterprises face new

104
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:15,060
threats year on Year everybody who wants

105
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:16,500
to use cryptography and look after their

106
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:20,279
data faces new threats year upon year

107
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:21,959
and what they have to think about is

108
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:24,300
adapting to those threats it is not like

109
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:27,840
cryptography is a static field right as

110
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,280
we had you know the question that we had

111
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,960
earlier from the gentleman in the in the

112
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,940
front row

113
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,280
the parameters for RSA have increased

114
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,680
over time right you know from 512 to

115
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,900
2048 and you know maybe soon it'll be

116
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:42,300
1496 that is uh you know that is widely

117
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,479
used

118
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:48,000
every time a new threat evolves we must

119
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,340
find an answer to that in the

120
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:53,100
cryptographic realm and so our

121
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,139
organizations ready to move towards uh

122
00:04:55,139 --> 00:04:57,180
towards post Quantum cryptography yes

123
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,220
because the threats move and whether it

124
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,919
is quantum or whether it is

125
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:03,540
um you know whether it is new classical

126
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,580
algorithms or maybe whether it's even

127
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,740
you know new threat models outside of

128
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:10,560
computation you know physical access the

129
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,080
whole cyber security landscape

130
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,520
cryptography is about

131
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,380
making your systems and your information

132
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:19,219
secure

133
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:22,020
and adopting the latest and the most

134
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:25,199
secure systems is what that is about and

135
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,000
the post Quantum moniker

136
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,220
is a buzzword to get you all interested

137
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,130
okay yeah

138
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:38,039
[Applause]

139
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:40,620
my learned friend is indeed very learned

140
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,660
and has had many moments in the last

141
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,880
hour to prepare but I'm going to bring

142
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,500
some very cogent arguments I hope

143
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,840
against this motion of the village even

144
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,539
though I might have written it so we do

145
00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:55,020
indeed have a way of encrypting things

146
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:58,199
and that way is potentially under threat

147
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:00,900
However the fact of this threat is some

148
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,419
time off does not necessarily mean that

149
00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:05,280
we should be doing much about it now my

150
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,259
learned friend said that threats have

151
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:10,620
been moving let's move all the time more

152
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,780
important more immediate threats move

153
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:15,000
there is also the matter of the

154
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,160
difficulty of this particular Endeavor

155
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,460
how are we going to enable these post

156
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,620
Quantum cryptography we're going to do

157
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,900
it piecemeal we're going to do it badly

158
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,360
we're going to mess it up and then we're

159
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,100
going to come back and hopefully get it

160
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,440
right at the end why because generally

161
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,180
how we've done things for a very long

162
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,280
time but does that mean that we have to

163
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,020
put more effort into post-quantum

164
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:39,120
cryptography when regular cryptography

165
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,580
is possibly more broken

166
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:44,880
we have limited and finite resources in

167
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,460
every Enterprise in every system where

168
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,259
we wish to make it secure and we wish to

169
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:51,240
have better configurations we have many

170
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,819
many limitations on the time and effort

171
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:55,199
that we can put into it remember

172
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,380
security is not a zero-sum game

173
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:01,319
okay security is invisible when it's

174
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:02,340
done well

175
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:03,840
it only goes wrong when you're the

176
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,819
headline On The Wall Street Journal or

177
00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:07,380
New York Times

178
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,780
the issues that we have facing are in

179
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:12,479
some ways total and in other ways highly

180
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:15,240
localized my threat model is indeed not

181
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,860
your threat model it's not the threat

182
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:19,500
model of my organization not any of the

183
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,840
individual users that I manage we are

184
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,120
always dealing in many ways with the

185
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,160
average and unfortunately I do not think

186
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,620
that the motion for

187
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:32,160
can be fully be said to be valid at this

188
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,800
point in time and the reason for that is

189
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,139
that we do not yet have cryptography

190
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:39,840
working properly let alone post Quantum

191
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,240
cryptography working properly so maybe

192
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,800
we should maybe stop chasing these

193
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,840
dreams stop chasing these potential

194
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,680
ghosts in the qubit and maybe we should

195
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,199
be focusing instead on the way in which

196
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:54,539
we can improve the overall Frameworks

197
00:07:54,539 --> 00:07:56,340
around cryptography post Quantum

198
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:58,319
cryptography is not I'm going to claim

199
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,539
against the motion of this Village which

200
00:08:00,539 --> 00:08:01,680
I helped run

201
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,259
um is not yet ready

202
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:07,560
and actually it's being ready is not a

203
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,020
priority the regular CSO the regular

204
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,639
security manager doesn't have the time

205
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:13,620
to learn it and what we have seen that's

206
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,900
you sir and what we have seen is that

207
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,060
these ciphers are so experimental they

208
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:20,160
can be broken in a weekend to an hour on

209
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,139
a basic laptop

210
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:24,840
maybe we should focus more on building

211
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,699
those things over time

212
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:30,660
not rushing into these great races with

213
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:33,360
four stages of only five years RSA had

214
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,120
40. the security grew over time as we

215
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,440
understood more and more about the

216
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,120
number Theory a thing that we have been

217
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,820
resurging for many many years

218
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:44,339
and so I make the motion possibly

219
00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:46,500
finishing a little early I hope but I

220
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,880
make the motion that post Quantum

221
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,519
cryptography is not necessary what is

222
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:53,160
necessary is better cryptographic

223
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,660
thinking

224
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:57,319
thank you

225
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,700
great ladies and gentlemen now what we

226
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,380
do is rebuttals you heard the argument

227
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:02,700
for the motion you heard the argument

228
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,200
against the motion now two minute

229
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,279
rebuttals each

230
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:10,620
ladies and gentlemen my learned friend

231
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:14,459
here is a cryptographic exhibitionist

232
00:09:14,459 --> 00:09:17,359
hahaha

233
00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:19,260
he does not care

234
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,899
what happens to his data

235
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:23,940
he is quite happy for it to you know

236
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:26,100
he's the kind of person that waitress

237
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,480
car to break down on the side of the

238
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,480
motorway before bringing up for an Mot

239
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,640
does not mean that it is the right

240
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,180
solution for the honest hard-working man

241
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:39,420
and woman and child in this country and

242
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:40,860
around the world

243
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:43,500
who feels entitled to a basic level of

244
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,240
privacy

245
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,880
now for those people like my learned

246
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,860
friend who are not fussed about these

247
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,660
you know these fundamental concepts that

248
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:54,540
that some people quite enjoy that is

249
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:56,399
fine

250
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,440
but don't use cryptography right you

251
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,779
know unless you are aiming for the

252
00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:03,000
highest standards you should not be

253
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,480
considering waiting now the the argument

254
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,820
that you know there are more important

255
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,560
things going on in front of your nose

256
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,459
nobody is nobody is arguing against that

257
00:10:14,459 --> 00:10:16,740
the reason that standardization should

258
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:20,220
occur is so that when the time comes

259
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:24,120
the world is ready to act right any

260
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,820
smooth transition process that has ever

261
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:29,580
ever happened has had people thinking

262
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:32,040
about it doing other things but thinking

263
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,980
about it in the interim between

264
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:38,519
going full throttle and beginning

265
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:40,440
who here has been asked to complete a

266
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,839
task with absolutely zero background or

267
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:45,300
Preparation and given a remarkably short

268
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,800
deadline

269
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,360
how's it gone

270
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,399
has it been has it been an overwhelming

271
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,320
success tell me about these stories

272
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,060
afterwards

273
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:56,040
my friend my learned friend here appears

274
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,420
to have many of them

275
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:00,920
and I would like to hear more about them

276
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:07,019
I'm glad that my learned friend has

277
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:09,420
recognized the power of being prepared

278
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,339
I'm sure my lettered friend brought a

279
00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:13,140
snorkel to Defcon not anticipating a

280
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,180
flood it does not necessarily mean that

281
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:17,279
having the snorkel was going to be a

282
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,380
good idea or a bad idea

283
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:22,200
the flood came and the flood went

284
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,720
there is no guarantee that Quantum is

285
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,459
going to happen there is only

286
00:11:26,459 --> 00:11:29,040
probabilities there is a very educated

287
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,380
guesswork I think that the lack of

288
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:33,120
definitiveness the lack of knowledge

289
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,740
about things like scalable Quantum

290
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:37,079
Computing works against the case when

291
00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:40,980
making pqc Universal my friend made the

292
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,959
my learning friend sorry made the

293
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,600
analogy with a car breaking down

294
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,459
but actually a bit of analogy would be

295
00:11:47,459 --> 00:11:49,620
that everyone's cars just crash into a

296
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:52,380
wall I don't think it will happen we

297
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:54,959
know for a fact that even if we did take

298
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,660
all of the data and store it and then

299
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:00,000
decrypt it later as is one of the threat

300
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,700
models that we are analyzing to make the

301
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,579
case for post Quantum cryptography there

302
00:12:05,579 --> 00:12:07,200
is no guarantee that that data problem

303
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,640
you then have because you've got

304
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,860
everything it's still the same size it's

305
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:13,560
just not encrypted anymore okay now

306
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,480
there's this is an intractable data

307
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,160
problem it's not going to be something

308
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,720
that is going to be immediately

309
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,760
available and indexable by an attacker

310
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,560
so even though things could be

311
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,820
decryptable

312
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:26,339
might be decrypted indeed might no

313
00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:28,140
longer have security it is not

314
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:30,000
necessarily the case that post Quantum

315
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,920
is going to help if anything as we have

316
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,279
seen with psych as we have seen with uh

317
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,800
what was the other one rainbow thank you

318
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,959
thank you uh for helping me make my own

319
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:40,860
case

320
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,019
um with rainbow you know this these

321
00:12:43,019 --> 00:12:45,480
things are not ready right it's just not

322
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,000
a car breaking down right it is you know

323
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,180
a bicycle made of cheese and balloons

324
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:53,899
thank you

325
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,060
[Applause]

326
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:59,160
I can only admire the indefatigable

327
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:02,519
optimism of my learned friend

328
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:04,320
not only is the a cryptographic

329
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,360
exhibitionists he doesn't wear safety

330
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,160
belts Because he believes his cars will

331
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,719
not crash into walls

332
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:16,519
he doesn't even bring snorkels to Defcon

333
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:21,620
where does it end

334
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,980
the worst case scenario

335
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,959
from dedicating ourselves to post

336
00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:30,240
Quantum cryptography at this moment in

337
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,420
time

338
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:35,579
is that we started too early right if

339
00:13:35,579 --> 00:13:37,860
quantum computers never arrive the whole

340
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,480
point of post Quantum cryptography is

341
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,560
that it's still resistant against

342
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,519
classical

343
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,639
that it performs well that it's secure

344
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,800
that we're able to enjoy the the

345
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,399
freedoms that cryptography affords Us in

346
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,740
the modern day and age all of these

347
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:55,139
things are not separated

348
00:13:55,139 --> 00:13:57,600
you know or you know there are not other

349
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,160
things that we could be working on that

350
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,360
are better

351
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,940
building secure systems

352
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:05,279
every everybody is pulling in the same

353
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,920
direction my learned friend is drawing

354
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,660
false dichotomies

355
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,579
between post Quantum cryptography and

356
00:14:11,579 --> 00:14:14,339
classical cryptography and all I can say

357
00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:16,500
is

358
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,019
I won't be driving with uh with Mark

359
00:14:19,019 --> 00:14:22,040
Carney anytime soon

360
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:29,639
I do congratulate my loaded friend on a

361
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:31,320
number of things for example he has

362
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,480
Exquisite taste in hair length

363
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,700
even if he does have the man bun of a

364
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,740
hipster who believes in academic dreams

365
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:40,079
and fancy that is post Quantum

366
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:43,019
cryptography the inflated egos that we

367
00:14:43,019 --> 00:14:45,920
see before us

368
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:52,760
from indulging in this fancy are indeed

369
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:56,220
are indeed found to be misplaced I think

370
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:58,260
there is a lot of time and effort being

371
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,940
put into this when maybe we would be

372
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,199
better off putting better time and

373
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:04,980
effort into not having problems down the

374
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:07,500
line that are as easy as it's broken on

375
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,019
a laptop within an hour

376
00:15:10,019 --> 00:15:13,100
what what do you want

377
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,079
what is history

378
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:18,120
wins or be quiet can I get those 10

379
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,980
seconds back

380
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:22,019
I have I have the 15 seconds back thank

381
00:15:22,019 --> 00:15:24,600
you so uh

382
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,060
there is also many many other matters my

383
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,160
friend my landed friend wishes us to

384
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,740
carry not just snorkels and safety belts

385
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:33,839
but the kitchen sink Swiss Army knives

386
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:36,480
and also you know a subscription to the

387
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,420
New York New York weekly we want to have

388
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:42,240
everything I get it it is not feasible

389
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,480
it is not defensible to say that post

390
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,880
Quantum must be implemented now where we

391
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,260
can barely get certificate management

392
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:51,360
right as it is

393
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,000
why would we want to add more complexity

394
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,540
to this matter

395
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,980
around every bottles here and then we'll

396
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:02,180
ask for your points of information

397
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:06,980
I've run out of things to say

398
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,459
yeah how many times can I uh right yeah

399
00:16:11,459 --> 00:16:14,040
let's hear for the gentleman in the back

400
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,139
I I'd like to devote the rest the

401
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:18,240
remaining 50 seconds of my minute to

402
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,800
Applause for the gentleman in the back

403
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:27,480
that gentleman doesn't need it

404
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,760
I will make a very quick I'll show you

405
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,040
the closing statements and then q a Okay

406
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,399
so

407
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,660
closing statements from the opposition

408
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,339
first then

409
00:16:38,339 --> 00:16:40,740
post Quantum cryptography does indeed

410
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:43,740
offer Solutions and does indeed make us

411
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:46,019
face problems in the light of a

412
00:16:46,019 --> 00:16:48,720
verifiable threat

413
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,480
however that does not mean that the fact

414
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,459
that this threat is indeed many years

415
00:16:53,459 --> 00:16:56,100
away should distract us on the current

416
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,320
day problems that we face on Enterprise

417
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,660
systems right now

418
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:03,360
post Quantum cryptography is very nice

419
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,480
the mathematics is lovely I say that as

420
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,240
a mathematician the practicalities are

421
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:12,059
uncertain the security is difficult if

422
00:17:12,059 --> 00:17:14,280
not impossible to prove and there are no

423
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,559
guarantees that can be made to win an

424
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,059
Enterprise moving forward with this

425
00:17:18,059 --> 00:17:21,959
technology that are going to last and

426
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:24,660
give the test of time

427
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:27,179
my motion against my argument against

428
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:29,760
this particular motion simply stems from

429
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,500
the fact that our lives are very

430
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,799
difficult already privacy is hard

431
00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:36,900
managing data is hard collecting it is

432
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,340
very easy

433
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:41,039
and we do not necessarily threat model

434
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:43,919
well enough to know the appropriateness

435
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:46,380
of these new solutions they are too new

436
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:49,080
and they need much more testing and for

437
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,179
that reason I make the motion against

438
00:17:51,179 --> 00:17:53,840
the village

439
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:58,790
[Applause]

440
00:18:00,299 --> 00:18:03,120
in summary I believe that my learned

441
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,620
friend makes

442
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:07,020
extremely important points there are

443
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:10,080
many problems in the modern world more

444
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,760
than we can possibly deal with right uh

445
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,260
you know for the in the daily life of a

446
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:18,840
ciso it is one problem after another it

447
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,299
is one fire drill after another

448
00:18:21,299 --> 00:18:25,020
what we are asking this house to to

449
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,580
consider is not that we should be

450
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:29,520
distracting and and putting a new fire

451
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,740
drill in the works and trying to

452
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,840
re-prioritize

453
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,940
all of the incredibly important issues

454
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:38,039
that already exist

455
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:40,500
what I am suggesting

456
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,960
what this house believes

457
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,760
is that we should keep an eye on the

458
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:45,539
future

459
00:18:45,539 --> 00:18:48,059
because we know the threat exists

460
00:18:48,059 --> 00:18:50,280
theoretically

461
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,900
we know that there are enormous

462
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,640
technological challenges before this

463
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,860
threat materializes

464
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:58,440
but unfortunately while the timelines

465
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:01,140
for standardization of pqc

466
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:04,440
exist and are somewhat predictable the

467
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,240
timelines for

468
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,179
leaps in Quantum Computing development

469
00:19:09,179 --> 00:19:11,340
are not foreseeable

470
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:13,919
if this you know if this comes about in

471
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,919
I don't know the next five years we will

472
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:19,559
all be in a very very difficult position

473
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:22,020
the argument that this house puts forth

474
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:24,419
is that we should prepare

475
00:19:24,419 --> 00:19:26,940
we should not distract ourselves but we

476
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:30,080
should keep one eye

477
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,940
I don't know looking somewhere else

478
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,559
um we should keep one eye looking on

479
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:37,320
looking at threats in the future that we

480
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,880
do not have any guarantee will not

481
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,620
materialize

482
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:44,460
too soon for us to be able to act on it

483
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:47,580
what we have presented today is the case

484
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:50,220
that there are high level things to do

485
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:54,059
ways to conceptualize what's going on

486
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:56,640
papers to read that only take a matter

487
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,039
of hours to understand incredible

488
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:01,080
amounts about the landscape and think

489
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:04,919
about how one might act as

490
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:06,660
the development of post Quantum

491
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:08,460
cryptography and the development of

492
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:11,400
quantum Computing progresses right

493
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:15,240
and so it seems obvious that for a group

494
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:18,660
of people that believe extremely

495
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:21,780
strongly about the you know the the

496
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:24,419
rights and freedoms of individuals on

497
00:20:24,419 --> 00:20:26,580
the internet to privacy to

498
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:29,520
authentication to encryption and to all

499
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,140
of the other

500
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:33,360
um policies and and things that that

501
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,419
cryptography can bring to us

502
00:20:36,419 --> 00:20:39,480
the next and most existential threat is

503
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,799
that of quantum

504
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:43,620
and by being prepared for quantum

505
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:45,360
we are prepared

506
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,400
for classical as well

507
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,860
there will be Road bumps along the way

508
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:52,980
psych and the rainbow breaks demonstrate

509
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:54,960
that adequately

510
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,380
and this is an argument for why we need

511
00:20:58,380 --> 00:20:59,940
to start thinking about these problems

512
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,740
just think about it as going through

513
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:04,260
this entire process in a contracted

514
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:07,320
amount of time in two to three years

515
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,840
when our you know our friends from

516
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,900
Oxford Quantum circuits or whatever

517
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:14,160
outperform you know even even the

518
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,140
wildest predictions of their their event

519
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:18,120
investors even

520
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,919
and just think about the the absolute

521
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:21,840
Mayhem that we could be putting

522
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:25,020
ourselves in by refusing to devote a

523
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:27,179
small fraction of our time

524
00:21:27,179 --> 00:21:29,400
to this grave

525
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,299
grave Danger

526
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,100
thanks to both of you now it's your turn

527
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,960
before we can vote before we can ask you

528
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:40,919
to vote

529
00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:43,020
um you get to ask questions now the

530
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:45,299
Oxford Union manual says these are

531
00:21:45,299 --> 00:21:46,980
points of information but we call them

532
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,900
questions and answers uh tell us if you

533
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:51,000
uh who you direct it to uh or if you

534
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,500
have comments and let's give win the

535
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,260
honor the first question here when

536
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:58,460
and if you can

537
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,940
[Laughter]

538
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:33,740
requirements

539
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,640
we know the golden rule of Defcon is

540
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,320
indeed to not it up

541
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,200
but I hold that we have more of a risk

542
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:49,559
of it up if we pursue these

543
00:22:49,559 --> 00:22:52,020
dreams and fancies too far without the

544
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:54,780
critical analysis and the time taken to

545
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:57,000
really understand what is going on

546
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,940
underneath the hood I think that these

547
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:02,100
ideas are wonderful they are lovely the

548
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,539
mathematics behind super singular

549
00:23:03,539 --> 00:23:05,940
isogenes has kept me happy for many

550
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:08,100
hours reading through it but ultimately

551
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,440
thank you but ultimately

552
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:13,640
it's for naught

553
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:22,380
all right question please

554
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:24,419
expect easier for others to hear so

555
00:23:24,419 --> 00:23:26,280
actually directing it more towards the

556
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,200
moderator of all things my learned

557
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,840
friend about a necessary Mr chairman

558
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:34,100
perhaps a necessary but insufficient

559
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:36,659
proposal here before us all because we

560
00:23:36,659 --> 00:23:38,340
haven't really looked at the Dynamics

561
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:40,860
and the depth of it and that is a c so I

562
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:42,659
have to struggle for funding every year

563
00:23:42,659 --> 00:23:45,480
and it's uncertain perhaps whether this

564
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,400
would occupy one tenth of a percent of

565
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,740
our time and money or 20 or 30 percent

566
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:52,020
for example if you have a child at home

567
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:53,400
you're probably thinking about what to

568
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,020
get them for the next birthday but not

569
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:57,179
right now you tend to wait a little bit

570
00:23:57,179 --> 00:23:59,940
later and so as a result perhaps our

571
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:02,640
motion may be better coached in terms of

572
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,980
a quantification so that we could decide

573
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,780
whether in fact it's worth our time to

574
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:09,600
go forward not simply a binary is it not

575
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,000
zero

576
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,820
yeah I think I think he's setting us up

577
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,500
for the next debate and we will take

578
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,299
that up at the next debate right we can

579
00:24:18,299 --> 00:24:20,400
say that but now we have a motion here

580
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,440
that we want more input questions and

581
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,760
comments on

582
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,860
um unless we it would take too long for

583
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:27,539
us to redefine that motion unfortunately

584
00:24:27,539 --> 00:24:30,179
I would say uh speaking of time the

585
00:24:30,179 --> 00:24:32,039
quantum Village operates on something

586
00:24:32,039 --> 00:24:36,179
called plank time really fast uh so

587
00:24:36,179 --> 00:24:38,220
please give us your questions point of

588
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:40,320
order input

589
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:44,059
really fast any others

590
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:46,919
one question here please come up to the

591
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:50,000
mic please come to the microphone

592
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:53,100
and this is directed to both loaded

593
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:55,440
gentlemen uh

594
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:59,159
do you believe that the engineering

595
00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:01,940
advantage that the engineering advances

596
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:05,940
necessary to improve fidelity

597
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:10,140
in quantum computers we'll also

598
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:14,460
lead to dramatically increased uh

599
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:16,740
classical computer power

600
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:23,419
to allow for much larger classical keys

601
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:31,279
do I believe that the

602
00:25:33,659 --> 00:25:35,880
the requirements to improve Fidelity in

603
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:38,340
Quantum Computing will lead directly to

604
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:41,340
improvements in classical computing

605
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:43,020
that can be then used to improve

606
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:45,799
cryptanalysis

607
00:25:48,419 --> 00:25:49,980
to improve key sizes for classical

608
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:52,260
algorithms

609
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:54,659
I believe that the necessary

610
00:25:54,659 --> 00:25:58,919
developments for improving uh the

611
00:25:58,919 --> 00:26:00,600
performance of quantum computers among

612
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,900
coherence time fidelities circuit depth

613
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,880
all the rest of everything I think they

614
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:08,279
will bestow upon those unfathomable

615
00:26:08,279 --> 00:26:09,480
benefits

616
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:12,240
in Quantum Technologies how that

617
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,700
translates to you know the the

618
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,620
silicon-based architectures of classical

619
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:18,120
computation

620
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:21,299
I don't see that there will be a direct

621
00:26:21,299 --> 00:26:24,020
link but I think there will be other

622
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:26,960
incredible benefits that potentially

623
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,559
this house believes or I believe

624
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:33,000
that I believe

625
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,740
could actually outweigh the benefits of

626
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:36,480
quantum Computing in the same way that

627
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,100
you know the fellow who invented the

628
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,500
laser at Bell Labs you know all of his

629
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,179
uh panels around him were you know were

630
00:26:42,179 --> 00:26:43,380
laughing at him and there was you know

631
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:44,700
what are you going to do with your your

632
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,860
beam of coherent light and Look Who's

633
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:49,679
laughing now so that's why I that is the

634
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:50,880
potential that I believe on the

635
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,640
Computing has for the you know for for

636
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,860
the things that we need to improve on I

637
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:57,360
don't necessarily believe it will

638
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,279
directly lead to improvements in you

639
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:01,740
know key sizes and and so on and so

640
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:04,039
forth

641
00:27:05,299 --> 00:27:08,700
my particular response in line with my

642
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,559
position on the motion of this

643
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:12,600
particular debate

644
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:16,020
would be that such developments would be

645
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:18,179
an expensive waste of time when compute

646
00:27:18,179 --> 00:27:20,100
is already so very cheap

647
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,919
the theory that supports many of modern

648
00:27:22,919 --> 00:27:26,220
keys and key lengths is very solid we've

649
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:27,960
had a lot of time to really mull over

650
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,760
things to really get to grips with

651
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,500
things and I think that actually we

652
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,480
would be better off spending our time

653
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:36,659
really debating How We Do cryptography

654
00:27:36,659 --> 00:27:39,240
better and how we unify our approaches

655
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,340
towards cryptographic configuration and

656
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:43,980
the agility they're in

657
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:45,659
I think that that is a better use at

658
00:27:45,659 --> 00:27:48,380
that particular time

659
00:27:49,559 --> 00:27:51,000
well ladies and gentlemen I think we

660
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,480
should call it

661
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:58,559
you believe the motion if it will carry

662
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:00,659
I'm sorry if if the motion carries I'll

663
00:28:00,659 --> 00:28:02,880
reread it to you uh you'll vote for it

664
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,799
and the village will adopt this position

665
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:08,220
if you vote uh uh in favor of Mark's

666
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:10,500
point of view then it will not carry I'm

667
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,419
going to reread the motion now and then

668
00:28:12,419 --> 00:28:14,760
ask for your votes for and then I'll ask

669
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:17,279
for your votes against the motion is

670
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:20,220
that this Village believes that post

671
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:22,860
Quantum Computing should be prioritized

672
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:28,039
for Enterprise Readiness all in favor
