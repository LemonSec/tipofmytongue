1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,800
uh welcome to my talk uh i'll be talking

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,040
about

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:05,839
a

4
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:08,160
framework that i've just recently open

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,200
source

6
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,160
it's called can talk um and the title of

7
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,599
my talk will be

8
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:14,639
canton

9
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,800
the can bus hacking framework to compile

10
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,720
fun hacks and vulnerabilities

11
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,359
so what's the agenda for the stock um of

12
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:25,680
course self-promotion which is who am i

13
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,240
and then backstory and background about

14
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,480
why i started this

15
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,960
um framework and project and then a

16
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,160
quick start

17
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,399
and basic usage of cansot and of course

18
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,920
simple demo onto how you can get started

19
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,280
with cansot and then if you have

20
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,760
i have a slide for q a but you know you

21
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,640
can just ping me at twitter at ship code

22
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,320
if you have any questions

23
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,079
regarding cansot especially with

24
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,000
installing some of the

25
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,359
dependencies of cansot and if

26
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,280
you want a

27
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,559
a real demo about canson so let's start

28
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,640
with walmart

29
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,799
so my name is jay turla

30
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,000
slash ship code that's my twitter handle

31
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,720
and i currently work right now as a

32
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,960
principal security consultant at biking

33
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:17,920
cloud

34
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,600
i do netband web application pen tests

35
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,320
and a couple of iot

36
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,439
hacking as well and then i'm also a root

37
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:28,720
gun gun

38
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,159
and cfp review board

39
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,040
so despite my family name um

40
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,360
some people will dm me if i'm the author

41
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,240
of trilla malware so i'm not the author

42
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,759
of thriller malware i'm filipino uh that

43
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:46,240
turtle malware originated from russia

44
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,119
so

45
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:49,759
yeah definitely innocent about that

46
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,479
and then i've also contributed to some

47
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,799
auxiliary and export modules

48
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:57,040
to metasploit including hardware bridge

49
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,479
so that's why

50
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:01,119
this framework is also one of the things

51
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:02,799
that i want to develop

52
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:05,280
and then i also organize

53
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,520
the car hacking village at root con for

54
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,679
the karjakin village nph

55
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,000
i would like to thank robert and the

56
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,319
rest of the guard hacking village

57
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:17,040
team in the u.s for allowing me to

58
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,440
you know organize such event here in the

59
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,440
philippines

60
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,239
so

61
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,319
uh aside from that i also love hacking

62
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:29,200
botnets so i've written a couple of

63
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,840
um modules or exploits regarding hacking

64
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,480
blockchains as well

65
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,160
so the background story of canton is

66
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,959
it's actually inspired upon the idea of

67
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:42,959
metasploit's hardware bridge

68
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,720
and the post modules related to

69
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,560
automotive so

70
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,680
maybe

71
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,440
you're familiar with metasploit hardware

72
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,599
bridge it allows you to

73
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:54,400
interact with the canvas network using

74
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,599
metasploit

75
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:58,640
and craig smith and some other

76
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,040
metasploit contributors contributed some

77
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,519
modules that can be used for

78
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,560
hand testing your cars

79
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,400
also fuzzing

80
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,040
um passing the canvas network and also

81
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,200
there's even a one module that i really

82
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:18,159
like from that one which they call as

83
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:20,400
automotive bdt

84
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,879
which allows you to you know pop the

85
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,440
airbags on your car so it's really cool

86
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,440
i mean that module is one of the coolest

87
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,040
that i've seen from

88
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,159
metasploit

89
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,519
so

90
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,319
it is like metasploit

91
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,959
canthat is pretty much like metasploit

92
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,440
and it is a framework in python

93
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,239
it's not coded at ruby it's actually

94
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,480
coded in python and

95
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,959
it's based on the exploit kit

96
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,560
development kit

97
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,519
so instead of writing from scratch my

98
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:54,319
own framework i've used the

99
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:57,840
split kit development kit for you know

100
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,120
for interfacing with you know automating

101
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,400
some of the

102
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,239
vulnerabilities or

103
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:08,000
fun car hacking vulnerabilities

104
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,840
so next

105
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,400
so this is the inspiration if you use

106
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,880
metasploit if you type

107
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,000
or

108
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,759
type in the console once you launch

109
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,240
metasploit if you search automotive you

110
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,880
can see a lot of uh you can see some of

111
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,320
these modules

112
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,639
um you've got the can slot and this is

113
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,639
the one that i'm talking about uh the

114
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:31,840
pdt

115
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,000
which is which allows you to check for

116
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,160
prep and pyrotechnic devices like the

117
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,280
airbags

118
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,080
uh battery clamps and then there's also

119
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,759
some of the modules that i've actually

120
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,880
contributed just like the ecu hard reset

121
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,800
and the diagnostic state using

122
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,000
metasploit

123
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,960
so

124
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,080
um

125
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,080
the realization and development with

126
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,919
can.s

127
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,440
the last metasploit module for

128
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,440
automotive related to can bus hacking

129
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,720
was last october 2021 which was the

130
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,880
module that i contributed

131
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,120
and i was the one

132
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,880
uh who created the previous meta split

133
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,639
modules we did the car hacking

134
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,840
diagnostic state modules ecu hard reset

135
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,240
and the master ii instrument cluster

136
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,720
accelerometer mover which allows you to

137
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,919
you know fuzz

138
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:19,280
um

139
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,199
the instrument cluster for master 2 as

140
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,039
long as you're connected to

141
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,680
the bus so

142
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,400
i tried push pushing some modules

143
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,440
related to the g packs by charlie miller

144
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,120
and chris velasque but we're close

145
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,840
by the metasploit team

146
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:40,000
so um this was the one that i actually

147
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,600
tried contributing

148
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,440
uh a year ago

149
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,520
and um

150
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,840
the module will bleed

151
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,880
all the uh air brakes on the 2000 i mean

152
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,039
the break sorry that they are rakes but

153
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:56,880
on the 2014 uh jeep cherokee we all know

154
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,600
that's very old right but i just want to

155
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,759
you know put it in metasploit to have it

156
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:04,000
as a reference and you know for people

157
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,560
to try it on

158
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,520
but sad to say it was close

159
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,880
and you can see the uh

160
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,639
the comments in there

161
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:15,600
that

162
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,120
even with the defunct mode option

163
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,280
provided i am in favor of not accepting

164
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,479
this module

165
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,880
into the main branch as i can see this

166
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,720
module being reused by other community

167
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,360
members or fantastic now i'm not hurt on

168
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,880
this one um

169
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,560
i do understand their decision so

170
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,479
from there

171
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,720
uh this was actually the unreleased

172
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,759
module

173
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:38,560
or

174
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,720
you know for the cherokee kill breaks

175
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,280
related to charlie miller

176
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,240
and um you can still see the code

177
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,800
even though it's closed but you know it

178
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,039
was not um

179
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:53,280
added to the metasploit module

180
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,880
which is understandable because they

181
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,520
don't want to you know build with

182
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,520
the hardware bridge anymore so

183
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:04,400
um another thing that i've

184
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,039
that i've known since then is

185
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:09,440
there are a lot of open source can

186
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,479
fuzzers

187
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:13,199
and analyzers already out there we have

188
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,120
can tools which is

189
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,440
uh really good and then carrying caribou

190
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,919
which is one of my favorites for

191
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,720
buzzing uds diagnostic services

192
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,199
and then um

193
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,840
the savvy can which is a good a good

194
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,400
tool as well and then the c map which

195
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,440
was

196
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,039
presented by

197
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,280
uh robert

198
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,360
which is a good tool as well and then

199
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,280
the canalizator

200
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,599
and then kayak and other open source

201
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,440
tools out there which i

202
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,400
i didn't

203
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,560
just you know put it on the slide

204
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,039
because there there are really a lot but

205
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:51,599
these are some of the awesome and good

206
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:55,599
tools that i've actually tested

207
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:58,160
so so why not create my own framework

208
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,560
that contains known can bus hacks and

209
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,599
attacks

210
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:04,160
uh similar to metasploit so i think

211
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,360
about it and okay why not why not try

212
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,759
uh doing so because it's a good learning

213
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,520
experience and also to

214
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,120
improve uh

215
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,360
my skill in python and also

216
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,440
because i want to create you know a

217
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,080
couple of contributors that could

218
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,479
develop their python for car hacking

219
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,960
so kanthot was born

220
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,080
and

221
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,160
um i believe

222
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,958
uh it is a fun canvas hacking framework

223
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:35,279
that you can try and maybe you can also

224
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:36,958
help contribute

225
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,440
so it's a quick and dirty can best

226
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,440
hacking framework i mean

227
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,679
their needs uh there needs to be

228
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,640
a lot of things that needs to be done

229
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,000
and um i was hoping that the reason why

230
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,839
i presented this is

231
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,000
to compile other vulnerabilities and

232
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,360
maybe

233
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,360
open up other car hackers to contribute

234
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,640
to the sprinter

235
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,640
so i want to start something

236
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,880
out of the things that i'm doing with my

237
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,440
car hacking research

238
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,320
so

239
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,839
this is the screenshot that's what you

240
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:08,880
can see

241
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,560
uh i've

242
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,399
if you try to

243
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:15,040
launch can thought and then search tesla

244
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,720
there are two modules

245
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,680
there uh one is the tesla disable esp

246
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,120
abs

247
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,680
this module will inject uds data frames

248
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,760
through gateway and disable

249
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,880
esp or abs ecu at low speed on a tesla

250
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,279
model s and then we have the tesla

251
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,680
opentron which uh which will open a

252
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,360
truck or a tesla model s 85 um this was

253
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,920
patch because this was discovered in

254
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,519
2016.

255
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,560
but hey the idea of cantalk is to have

256
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,040
um you know known vulnerabilities and

257
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,560
also to compile

258
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,959
known vulnerabilities in automotive

259
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:53,360
security

260
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,800
so the basic usage of can thought is

261
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,120
there are three commands that are you

262
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,920
know easy to be familiar with uh you

263
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,279
you've got help

264
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:06,160
which gives you a couple of

265
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,200
commands

266
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,640
in working with

267
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,440
cansot and then you also have use just

268
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,160
like when you try to call a metasploit

269
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,120
module

270
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,240
so when you try to

271
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,240
use a module or call a module you just

272
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,200
need to use and then the module name so

273
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,519
take for example you scan down

274
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,079
and then if you want to run the module

275
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,800
you can just type the command run

276
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,600
but

277
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,360
there are also options which i'll be

278
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,320
showing

279
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,720
later on

280
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,000
so this is a sample module execution

281
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,120
and um this module is what you call as

282
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,360
reset mileage

283
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,120
so this module

284
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,800
clears

285
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,120
diagnostic trouble codes and resets the

286
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,040
method

287
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,399
and that's what you can see here from

288
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,079
the screenshot

289
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,600
you just need to call use and then space

290
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,519
reset underscore mileage which is the

291
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,200
module name because that's the module

292
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,279
name and then

293
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,440
just like metasploit you also have the

294
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,519
show options so if you

295
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:12,720
try to

296
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,640
show options you can see the options

297
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,320
that you can set

298
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,560
so for example you have the arp id as

299
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,880
the option one and then the option two

300
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,160
is interface so if you want to edit

301
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,800
those options you can just use set

302
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,279
arb id asset space

303
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:32,000
r by d and then space the value

304
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,160
of the arbitration id because this is

305
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,839
the arbitration id

306
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:37,360
and then if you want to set your

307
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,600
interface you can do it like this in the

308
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,519
command set

309
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:42,720
interface

310
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,040
a set space interface

311
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,480
space and then the can interface so for

312
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,639
example if you have can zero

313
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:54,959
so set space interface space can zero

314
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,360
and then from there after all of the

315
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,720
options are set

316
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,639
you can run the module directly and if

317
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,079
you try to

318
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:02,959
view

319
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:03,920
the

320
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,639
can dump you can see the dom

321
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:09,279
from there so as what you can see here

322
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:10,399
on the

323
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:11,600
there's a small

324
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,639
image

325
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:13,760
at the bottom

326
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,000
wherein it says clear ddc

327
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,720
dtc because i was using a an ecu

328
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,800
simulator from craig smith when i tried

329
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,160
to test this

330
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:22,959
so

331
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,040
next up

332
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,680
there's this is the code snippet of the

333
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,279
sample module

334
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:32,560
and that's what you can see uh

335
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,560
this is the

336
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,040
the snippet of

337
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,959
the diagnostic module

338
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,639
and

339
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,079
you can see here

340
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:45,040
that this is how the option is coded and

341
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,200
then this is the main function of the

342
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,560
module

343
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,440
so

344
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,040
the frame data you can see the frame

345
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,440
data from that

346
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,639
and then

347
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,800
let's check one sample module

348
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,200
code again so this is one

349
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,600
module code that i've added so this is

350
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,839
the cherokee kill breaks

351
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:05,120
and

352
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,600
of course i want to give credits

353
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,160
where the credits are due so this is

354
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,399
from the research of charlie miller

355
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,320
and chris velasque

356
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,120
and i gave a reference as well from

357
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,720
illinois.com

358
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,399
and this is the whole

359
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,480
uh

360
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,600
module

361
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,920
the one module from the cherokee kill

362
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:26,959
break so

363
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:29,519
if you use this module um

364
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:32,160
it will bleed all the brakes on the 2014

365
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,920
jeep cherokee while the car is moving so

366
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,680
that's the fun stuff

367
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,160
that i've added in canton so there are a

368
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,399
lot of modules aside from that

369
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:43,839
so i'm gonna show

370
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:45,600
a

371
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,279
demo regarding the tool so let me just

372
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:50,639
um

373
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:54,000
point you to my vm so this is my vm

374
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,680
and um

375
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,160
i'm running

376
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:02,399
cancel on my calendar linux so

377
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:06,000
i'm just gonna try to zoom this one zoom

378
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,720
in

379
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,040
and um

380
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,680
you can just if i'll give the link on

381
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,920
how you can clone this one so

382
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,880
once you install cant uh

383
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,560
this is the main

384
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,680
files that you can see and the

385
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,160
directories and then you can just

386
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,600
run python3 main.e1 so there's an error

387
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,839
i'll try to

388
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,440
fix on that one because i haven't had

389
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,199
this error before so

390
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:32,480
i'll try to

391
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,839
fix on this one

392
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,360
and then

393
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,000
i tried to run show modules

394
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,639
and you can see that there are 20 29

395
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,560
modules as of now which are

396
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,399
uncategorized which

397
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,560
i'll be fixing in the uh

398
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,639
uh in the

399
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,120
in the long run or after a few weeks

400
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,440
so you have

401
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,680
show modules and then you've got some of

402
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,360
the modules that are here you have

403
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,639
gandom

404
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,320
campus sids

405
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,959
um cherokee kill engine

406
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:04,880
ecu hard reset

407
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,880
and then a couple of things like kill

408
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,720
bus which

409
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,360
will perform unknown can bus

410
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,519
denial of service attack

411
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,360
called the firehouse attack and then we

412
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,279
have the malibu overheat

413
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,839
uh this module will flood tempeh on a

414
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:22,720
2006 malibu and then you you have a

415
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,800
couple of

416
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,639
tesla openshraw

417
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,320
uds fuzzer

418
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,639
uh udsac access fuzzer

419
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,160
and then

420
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,360
uh video input output controller

421
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,560
so yeah

422
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,959
you can actually try to install a clone

423
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:40,959
the repository and try out some of these

424
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:42,000
modules

425
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,279
so

426
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:45,519
if you want to you know

427
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:47,839
search for example a cup um a certain

428
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:50,480
module take for example master

429
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,079
so you can see that there are three

430
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:53,600
matches

431
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,839
and if i want to actually

432
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:00,560
try the

433
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,160
try one of the modules take for example

434
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,079
the uh

435
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:09,759
let's just say i'm gonna try on

436
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:12,000
the

437
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,959
previous spark kill engine so i'm just

438
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:16,959
gonna copy this one

439
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:18,079
and then

440
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:19,279
use

441
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:23,040
the previous spark kill engine

442
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,360
so use and then the module name on the

443
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,880
module name

444
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,480
and then show options

445
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,160
okay um

446
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,720
for the for demo process purposes we're

447
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,560
gonna just

448
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,639
gonna perform this one on a virtual cam

449
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:41,040
device that i set up

450
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,600
so we can zero that's the can device

451
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,959
that i have

452
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:47,600
uh the virtual cam device and that's the

453
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,680
only option that i have because that's

454
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,959
the most important thing that you're

455
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:53,440
going to set if you want to

456
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,680
use the previous spark kill engine so

457
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,839
we're just going to try to

458
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:59,680
run that one

459
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,199
i don't need to

460
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:03,680
shut up set up the options for interface

461
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,520
so if we try to run

462
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,640
it will

463
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,760
do this

464
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,760
sending a packet that will kill fuel to

465
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,679
all cylinders to the eyes

466
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,359
and then if we try to do a dump can dump

467
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:20,000
so i've already run a um the canned up

468
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,559
module so let me just try to zoom that

469
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,720
one

470
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,679
so yeah

471
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,799
i did try to run this one and then this

472
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:33,840
is the uh

473
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,799
the message that will be sent to the

474
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:40,240
canvas and in my case the virtual cam

475
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,280
so

476
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,760
um here are some of the uh

477
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,960
snippets of the code

478
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,160
so i'm using actually a can

479
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,480
on some of the modules and then i'm also

480
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,400
using

481
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,160
pybit for some of the modules

482
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,799
and here you can see some snippets for

483
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:00,400
michael

484
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,160
like i said you can just clone in order

485
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,559
for you to view all of the modules that

486
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,559
are actually written

487
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:07,520
on

488
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,480
this framework so you have the pg

489
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,840
rx e8 which allows you to

490
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,960
send or spoof

491
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,520
the instrument cluster for massdot rx8

492
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,520
so there's the rx-8

493
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,080
rpm fuzzer so there's a lot of things

494
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,039
that i've

495
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:26,080
included as well and then a uds buzzer

496
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,880
uh tesla open trunk and then of course

497
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,160
um

498
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,799
some of this uh were discovered already

499
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:34,799
so there are credits to it and also the

500
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:37,600
reference from the modules

501
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,240
and then kill bus this is the typical

502
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,600
powerhouse attack

503
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,160
wherein you'll be sending arbitration id

504
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,240
0 and then

505
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,760
frame data

506
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,640
with

507
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,240
8 bytes for zero so yeah and then if you

508
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,919
want to stop the attack you can just

509
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:55,760
press ctrl c

510
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:59,120
so yeah that's it and here's a sample a

511
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,160
video

512
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,240
of an actual instrument cluster that

513
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,240
i've tried with candot

514
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,760
so

515
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,160
there it goes

516
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,400
so this is uh me on the canton and i'm

517
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,080
actually using

518
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,400
the

519
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:22,840
pg207 instrument cluster so and also

520
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:27,520
um this uh can device slk device

521
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,600
which is scan dock pro

522
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,600
so i've run

523
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,720
i run the pg207 ic mover there's also a

524
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,880
buzzer for it so that's why it's set to

525
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,960
the maximum value so

526
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,360
it moves the speedometer and excel

527
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,240
accelerometer for a pg207

528
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,799
instrument cluster and if we try to

529
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:49,039
start that one again you can see the

530
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:50,559
output

531
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:54,080
and we know that uh such a successful

532
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,120
message

533
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,799
was sent to

534
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,480
the instrument cluster and that's why it

535
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,400
reacted that way

536
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,880
so yeah um i'm planning to really you

537
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,679
know

538
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:05,600
put some fun

539
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,679
things that you could try when you use

540
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:10,159
uh kansa so that there are

541
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:11,679
some instrument clusters that you could

542
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:14,640
try as well

543
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,440
so i guess that's it for the demo

544
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,320
and um

545
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,760
where's the download link for

546
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,400
uh kansa so

547
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,320
this is the github repo of cansot

548
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,360
it's under github.com

549
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,520
ship code which is my handle

550
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:41,280
and slash canton so it starts with uh

551
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,480
letter uh after can uh it's big letter t

552
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,080
it's capital letter t

553
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,640
it cancels out and from there you can

554
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,960
see the modules so

555
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,760
um

556
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,600
this is the one

557
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,639
this is the uh

558
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,840
the github ripple

559
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,640
github link and

560
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,559
there are some installation

561
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:07,520
so you just need to clone it and then

562
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,240
go to the directory and then just

563
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,520
install the

564
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,280
requirements the text for the

565
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,520
dependencies of this

566
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,440
framework and

567
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,720
based on my

568
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,640
test uh it works better with cali and

569
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,000
ubuntu

570
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,679
with debian

571
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:25,200
i have a friend who is actually trying

572
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,360
to test that one and

573
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,799
we're still trying to fix the

574
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:30,480
dependencies

575
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,559
and then after you've installed the

576
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:34,880
requirements uh you just need to run

577
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,679
python 3 main.buy and then you already

578
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:40,320
have hands-on so

579
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,559
yeah

580
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,280
if you want to try just clone it install

581
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,679
the requirements and then you have your

582
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:48,640
own

583
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,600
um

584
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,200
known

585
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:55,440
uh can bus hacks and vulnerabilities

586
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,480
so

587
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,200
let's proceed

588
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:04,720
so what is the

589
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,440
uh the road map for canton um the

590
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,760
general plan is to compile node can bus

591
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:13,280
accident vulnerabilities i wanted to be

592
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,360
a vulnerability database for can bus

593
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,640
hacks as well

594
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,919
and

595
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,760
spread the word about cantor so that i

596
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,320
could invite other car hackers and

597
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,320
automotive security into shas to

598
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,960
collaborate and create modules um i

599
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,559
already have one friend who wants to

600
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:32,320
contribute and he said that he will be

601
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,480
adding some of his buzzers

602
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,720
from the car that he is actually testing

603
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,760
so

604
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,520
i guess he will try so shout out to

605
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,440
pirat i think he will

606
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,919
he will ping with me with some of his

607
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:45,360
scripts and then

608
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,960
he will try to port some of his scripts

609
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,159
to canva

610
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:49,440
and then

611
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,840
yeah i've said this before canada canton

612
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,480
as a vulnerable database for canvas

613
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,120
hacks known canvas hacks

614
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,200
what are my future dev plan

615
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,760
uh improve other options and add info

616
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,679
about the modules so i'm trying to add

617
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:04,400
the

618
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,520
option info so if you try to just

619
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,640
you know

620
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,600
use the module and then say info

621
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,760
you can see what the module will try to

622
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,320
do and also more information and then

623
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,159
add more commands

624
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:21,039
uh from the directory commands of split

625
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:24,960
yet and then i want to add more fuzzers

626
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,919
and also ecu unlock modules

627
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:30,880
and then some can analyzer module

628
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,960
and then of course i want to improve

629
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,360
some exceptions to some errors because

630
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,120
maybe you will have errors when you try

631
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,720
to send a command uh

632
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,559
some can messages on the canvas network

633
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:43,840
so i want to try to add more exceptions

634
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:44,960
to that

635
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,440
and then other plan maybe port some

636
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,080
carrying cardboard modules i mean

637
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,000
current carbo is great i love it and

638
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,159
maybe i want to board some of the

639
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:56,000
modules that i really like

640
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,880
to carry to ken dot

641
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,200
and then the other plan that i have is

642
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,760
reach out to the author of cantonese

643
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,919
which is aka

644
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:08,799
aka yak which is yet another car hacking

645
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:10,000
tool um

646
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,440
i tried to

647
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,320
test on that

648
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,039
on that python

649
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:20,000
um toolkit as well and it's really good

650
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,360
i've seen some

651
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,760
good work from cancun so i want to

652
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,120
reach out and

653
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,439
you know

654
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,440
add something

655
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,919
similar to canton so i want to improve

656
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:33,760
can thought in the long run

657
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:37,120
and i'm inviting all car hackers

658
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,720
to somehow

659
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,640
um to somehow

660
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,039
help me

661
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,279
you know improve can't thought

662
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:46,720
so

663
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,679
i do not claim to be a an expert in

664
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:51,360
automotive security

665
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,880
but i plan on you know

666
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,600
improving my skills and car hacking and

667
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,520
canvas happening

668
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,640
so yeah this is uh this is my start

669
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,400
in compiling known canvas hacks

670
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,200
so

671
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,440
i would like to give some

672
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,600
credits to

673
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:16,279
nikhil bogam for cbe 2022-2629

674
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,320
and allowing me to support his findings

675
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,960
uh his finding is actually part of khan

676
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,919
thought right now i asked his permission

677
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:25,919
and then we have charlie miller and

678
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:27,840
chris velasquez for their research and

679
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,480
papers so some of their

680
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,120
canvas hacks are added to kanthot and

681
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,760
then of course to ian tabor um internet

682
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,559
for his advices and mentorship

683
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:40,159
and then

684
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:41,919
the car hacking village for being an

685
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:44,159
inspiration to me

uh

695
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,039
python modules which i've integrated

696
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:04,240
with gandalf

697
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,760

um i've

701
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,360
written a similar

702
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:18,400
module to the kanpa sids that i found on

703
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,760
wilcarona's repository called

704
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:22,880

707
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:27,279
from there

708
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:29,360
i learned that it was

709
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,760
part of robert wheels or car fucker's

710
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,880
code so i also gave credits to that one

711
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,720
from that module

712
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,880
