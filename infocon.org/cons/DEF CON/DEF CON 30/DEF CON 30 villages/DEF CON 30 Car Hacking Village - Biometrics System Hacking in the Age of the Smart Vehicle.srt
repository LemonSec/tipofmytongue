1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,879
hi guys thanks for attending our talk

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:05,520
we're going to talk about uh biometric

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,120
system hacking in the age of smart

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,720
vehicle

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,840
so who are we um i'm kevin 2600 and this

6
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,719
is my teammate wesley say hi

7
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:17,279
okay so um we are secure researchers

8
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,279
from a star we lab and we have

9
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:21,760
researched and found many interesting uh

10
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,720
vehicle-related bugs and presented and

11
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,359
some of them are defcon in the last few

12
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:28,080
in

13
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,840
past few years uh and if anyone wonder

14
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,480
what car hackers lab looks like and here

15
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,640
are some pictures for you okay um just

16
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,879
like any other labs we got lots of

17
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:40,879
interesting equipment and most

18
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:43,920
importantly we got actual cars to play

19
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,120
with

20
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,399
so

21
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:48,160
okay so here are the contents for

22
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,440
today's talk

23
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,239
we are going to talk about uh biometric

24
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:54,399
authentication and then facial

25
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,719
recognition spoofing and then

26
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,520
speaking a speaker recognition spoofing

27
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,359
for the vehicles

28
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,359
okay so biometric

29
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,119
uh authentication

30
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:07,600
and this is a definition of multi-factor

31
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,080
authentication basically uh you will

32
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,439
need to

33
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,920
you will need two or more factors like

34
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,400
something you are and something you have

35
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,640
and something you know to achieve the

36
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,280
authentication

37
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,240
so something you have usually this means

38
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,040
our key fob for the cars the key fob is

39
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,200
a very common device we have for the

40
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,240
vehicle and in the recent time some car

41
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,439
company

42
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,520
start to replace the physical key fob

43
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,079
with a nfc car

44
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:42,560
or just a mobile phone to access the car

45
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,479
for example this is a key file system

46
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,799
for tesla in the beginning tesla only

47
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,600
provides the nfc card and mobile app to

48
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,439
access the wic

49
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,920
but later tesla has provided the

50
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,240
physical key fob but still it based on

51
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,200
ble and nfc

52
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,799
okay something you know now

53
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,439
interestingly some car company like four

54
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:04,240
they

55
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,399
provided a feature that we can unlock

56
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,038
the door with the pin code so we need to

57
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:11,599
something to always remember this

58
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:12,879
right

59
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:15,200
and something you are again some model

60
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,360
for not only

61
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,440
using pin codes to unlock the door it

62
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,280
has also provided a fingerprint reader

63
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,160
that means we can point our finger at it

64
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,800
and to unlock our car right

65
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,920
and some company uses face id for access

66
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,519
the vehicle has become a new trend too

67
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,040
and also the car companies like bmw and

68
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,680
hong kong prefer to use our human voice

69
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,480
print and integrate with a smart speaker

70
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,920
to control the cars like honda here and

71
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,840
with the

72
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,280
okay

73
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,760
now let's move from how do we do a

74
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,560
speaker recognitions movie

75
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,360
so

76
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,239
the definition of speaker

77
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,800
recognition is the identification of

78
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,239
person from characteristics of voice it

79
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,400
can be used to authenticate or verify

80
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,280
identity of a speaker as part of

81
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,760
security process and this

82
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,120
definition i took from the wikipedia

83
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,000
and the development history of speaker

84
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,840
recognition can be traced all the way

85
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,360
back to 60s

86
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,280
the speaker recognition

87
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,760
algorithm has started with a template

88
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,120
margin and then moved on to probability

89
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,560
model like gnm and gnmupn

90
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,280
and a feature classification like defect

91
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,879
d-vector and x-factors and so on

92
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,879
so the speaker recognition system

93
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,599
generally consists two categories like

94
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:50,640
feature extraction and feature matching

95
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,040
in reality

96
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,159
the

97
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,879
extracted features are matched

98
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,200
with features of people registered in

99
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,680
the database and then the identity is

100
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,760
determined based on

101
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,280
similarity

102
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,840
of these two features

103
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,799
so for the content to be recognized the

104
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,879
speaker recognition system is generally

105
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,920
divided into three categories

106
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,040
the first one is a fixed vocabulary

107
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,120
recognition it means

108
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,520
voice print recognition through fixed

109
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,800
vocabulary strategy has hey siri

110
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,919
and second one is fixed voice plus

111
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:32,880
random content recognition it means the

112
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,000
fixed con the fixed the random contents

113
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,320
combined together such as hey bob to 600

114
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,000
and to 2600 is generated randomly by

115
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,759
their system

116
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,080
and finally the random content

117
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,520
recognition its entire trade phrase is

118
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,600
generated randomly by the system

119
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,199
now

120
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,919
as you can see the speaker recognition

121
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:02,880
system are already everywhere

122
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,280
from exact control system in a voice

123
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,239
assistant in the car

124
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,479
but what could the possibility go wrong

125
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,080
then

126
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,039
here we list lately the some of the most

127
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:23,759
common smoothie methods for spherical

128
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,440
recognition

129
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,600
yes the one is called either an

130
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,680
impersonation attack

131
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,080
the attacker tries to

132
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,600
impersonate the

133
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,120
victim's

134
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,039
speaking turn

135
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,080
to disable the target system but this

136
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,600
attack can be easily detected by the

137
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,479
speaker vaccination system

138
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:50,720
and there are more effective and

139
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,639
let's say the attacks

140
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,800
causing the replay attack

141
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,080
speech

142
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:00,400
sentences wise commercial conversing

143
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,360
and

144
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,800
the adversarial is the example of attack

145
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,000
we are going to talk about those attacks

146
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
in more due to

147
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,120
the later leader

148
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:13,919
now

149
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:17,919
let's target duke replay attack is mini

150
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,720
in the either system of

151
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,720
fixed sentence

152
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,000
verification we can use the recording

153
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,240
device to record

154
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,240
the fixed sentence

155
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,240
of the victims

156
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,199
and

157
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,440
replace the recording the sentence

158
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,039
during verification to deceive the

159
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:41,919
spherical recognition system

160
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,520
as we can see

161
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,840
from male spectrogram

162
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,199
the uh similarity

163
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,759
from replay the wise

164
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,199
compared to

165
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:57,280
a genuine voice is high this is why the

166
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,240
replay type is very simple

167
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,520
yes

168
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,759
very type effective attack however this

169
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:10,160
simple method may not pass the speaker

170
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,960
authentication system with the yc

171
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,960
anticipation

172
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,840
now let's see some demos there are

173
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,639
already plenty of

174
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,880
third-party apps

175
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,560
can control smart cars like tesla using

176
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,240
siri this is a video demo for the

177
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,360
reflect attack on siri and

178
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,840
because some of the

179
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:42,000
magazines like uh unlocked blue is

180
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,199
authentication like pin codes for the

181
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:46,639
for this app

182
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:50,960
we can only open the chat port

183
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,520
with it

184
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:02,000
yeah the door currently is is locked

185
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,759
yeah and then

186
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:13,840
yeah the port is open

187
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,199
however we have found at least one app

188
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,120
that doesn't need to

189
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,280
extra

190
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,680
casing and we can

191
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,919
unlock the tesla very easily

192
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:33,679
not

193
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:37,079
oh sorry

194
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,720
yeah it works

195
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,320
okay

196
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,360
now let's take a look at the speech

197
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,720
sentences

198
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,880
text to speech

199
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,240
aggressor

200
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,760
let's take

201
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:20,000
google's ass way to tts as an example

202
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,600
the entire switch sentences can be

203
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,880
divided into three parts the speaker

204
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,320
encoder

205
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,399
module is responsible for

206
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,240
extracting

207
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,200
attracting speaker features from short

208
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,720
sentence

209
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,480
the synthesizer module is responsible

210
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,839
for

211
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,720
combining the speaker feature

212
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,560
with text to

213
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:53,200
generate a male spectrogram

214
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,399
that integrates the

215
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,720
specif by the speaker features into

216
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,320
the speech

217
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,560
corresponding to

218
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,519
the

219
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,240
specified text the

220
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,360
recorder measure is responsible for

221
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,360
generating wise they died

222
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,680
with male specular gram

223
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,640
which is the audio

224
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:28,319
data we use for tts type

225
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,640
and the

226
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,040
further

227
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:48,640
as with foreign tti's which open sourced

228
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,000
by google

229
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,040
in a

230
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,240
perfect

231
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,920
situation

232
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,360
it concludes wise in just five sec

233
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,320
seconds

234
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,519
to

235
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,040
generate the

236
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:05,519
rc speech in real time

237
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,920
and

238
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,040
this is a demo for the speech synthesis

239
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,640
attack

240
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,839
the first demo is to attack the battle

241
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,240
smarter speaker

242
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,360
the battle smarter speaker has ideal

243
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,880
antisprouting enabled

244
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,160
but we can use ttis to spool it and

245
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,680
impersonate as other people

246
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,839
and the second demo is to attack the

247
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:08,959
t-mode speaker well it can also be

248
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:13,920
spoofed by tdi's attack we can't go even

249
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:19,040
further by impersonator someone else to

250
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:23,560
purchase something online

251
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:32,519
nice

252
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,480
so this is a fixed

253
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:47,240
vocabulary plus random content

254
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,839
so without modification we cannot

255
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:58,560
bypass the system

256
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,160
so now we're using monkey bird to

257
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,639
generate

258
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,800
this random content number

259
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:11,599
and replay to the team mode speaker

260
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,480
and we try to find the right angle to

261
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,720
the speaker

262
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,720
as you can see we may try a couple times

263
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,519
in order to get a work

264
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,839
yeah we start the purchase step so we

265
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:43,279
actually successfully attacked

266
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:49,519
adversarial example attack means

267
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:50,399
a

268
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:53,920
attacker has intentionally designed to

269
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,800
cut the machine learning model to make a

270
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,680
mistake from speaker recognition's

271
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,279
roofing attack the minko has to attack

272
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:07,199
the speaker recognition algorithm

273
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:09,440
or

274
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,600
by adding some

275
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,160
perturbation that has been

276
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,000
calculated

277
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,600
to the switch

278
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,720
data

279
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,240
to make the speech be

280
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,480
recognized as a genuine victim

281
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:32,240
to dissave the acidic syndication system

282
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,279
this is a whiteboard

283
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:40,880
impairment

284
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,680
for switch vaccinations

285
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,720
attack

286
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,040
on

287
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,519
on our

288
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:52,000
open source the project called decoding

289
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,480
the deep speech

290
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,240
we first play a

291
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,440
genuine recording

292
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:11,839
and

293
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:13,199
it can't be

294
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:17,479
recognized successfully

295
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,560
then we play the

296
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,518
crafter recording

297
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,440
under a deep speech translated

298
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,000
differently that means our attack

299
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,800
exercise

300
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:50,959
so let's

301
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:54,160
summaries our smoothing methods about

302
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,680
speakers recognition as we can see the

303
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,720
fixed

304
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,040
vocabulary is the

305
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,240
easiest

306
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,440
one to attack a simple replay will work

307
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,639
just fine and further

308
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:11,440
vendor contents we still can't use

309
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,839
speech sentences or adversarial example

310
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:19,399
to the type

311
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:23,600
okay

312
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,199
so

313
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:27,199
um okay time to move on the facial

314
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:29,680
recognition spoofing

315
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,079
the facial recognition is a technology

316
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:34,880
capable to matching a human face from a

317
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,440
ditch to image or radio frame against

318
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,120
the database offices

319
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,120
usually it can be used for a syndicate

320
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,800
user through id verification servers

321
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,519
and the facial recognition technology is

322
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:50,320
constantly evolving it was based on low

323
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,959
dimension characterisation

324
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:54,720
and then nowadays it has involved the

325
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,720
three three dimension phase recognition

326
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,959
and there are already many applications

327
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:04,000
implemented the face recognition for for

328
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,640
example the face id to unlock our mobile

329
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,079
phone and iphone

330
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:11,919
and boarding the plan in the airport

331
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:14,160
and operationally the car company has

332
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,640
started to use face recognition

333
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,119
technology for driver monitoring system

334
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:22,480
and also use face id for driver profile

335
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,520
to improve the driving experience

336
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,880
and of course

337
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,200
use the human face to authenticate the

338
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,600
owner of vehicle is indeed a very

339
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,480
convenient way

340
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,120
and here are the four stages of face

341
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,320
recognition

342
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,880
procedure the first one is phase

343
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,200
detection so basically the system need

344
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,679
to know if there's a human face or cat

345
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:46,559
face

346
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:49,520
and second is a life needs detection aka

347
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,160
face auntie spoofing only

348
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,720
this stage played a very important role

349
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,960
in the face recognition procedure and

350
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,640
third and fourth is a feature

351
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,960
instruction and a feature matching

352
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,280
and at this stage the system will try to

353
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,960
match the face features from the

354
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,520
database

355
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:09,520
and let's take close look at the phase

356
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,600
recognition procedure

357
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,120
but this time without anti phase

358
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,480
spoofing

359
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,200
first the input in the input data is the

360
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,240
image

361
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,080
the system need to determine

362
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,280
whether it's a human face

363
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,280
once the system is about a human face it

364
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,360
will try to extract the features from

365
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,400
this particular

366
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,600
human face

367
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,919
and in the final step the system will

368
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,160
match the phase features to see if it's

369
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,960
in the database

370
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,720
and next let's talk about more about

371
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,559
phase on this movie

372
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:43,200
as we mentioned this stage plays a very

373
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,200
important role in the face recognition

374
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,280
procedure usually we need to do some

375
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,480
action like open our mouths or shake our

376
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,440
head

377
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,200
for a system to determine whether the

378
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,280
human face is presented is a real human

379
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,760
being or just piece of paper

380
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,400
in addition the system can do a silent

381
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,120
face anti-spoofing which means no

382
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,760
human action required it will determine

383
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,320
based on things like human skin texture

384
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,400
or different frequency of motion and so

385
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,640
on

386
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:14,799
and this is a phase recognition

387
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:17,600
structure from the diagram that we can

388
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,559
see

389
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:20,559
there are many other entry points to

390
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,559
attack for example later in the talk

391
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:24,240
we're going to share more real life

392
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,360
cases such as trash hold value and

393
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,559
feature value attack

394
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,000
so what could possibly go wrong

395
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,799
so here we have listed the six most

396
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:41,919
common methods to spoof the facial

397
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:44,720
recognition system for example the photo

398
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,039
attack and more advanced attack like it

399
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:49,760
was adverse serial example attack we're

400
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,520
going to talk about this attacks in more

401
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,760
details next

402
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,960
so this is the face photo attack we can

403
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,280
print weapons written

404
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,679
photo on a piece of paper and as you can

405
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:04,640
see it's very easy to to to do

406
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,039
even kids can do it right see they are

407
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,520
very happy

408
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,600
and this is what we call mr orange

409
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,559
attack basically we draw a human face on

410
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:15,679
orange

411
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:17,679
and in order to test the target system

412
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:21,039
phase detection function

413
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:23,679
and as we mentioned human face detection

414
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:26,080
is the first stage of every

415
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,880
phase recognition system simply draw a

416
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,600
human face on orange we easily spoof the

417
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,240
fish the facial recognition system when

418
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,720
the system does not have good phase

419
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,000
antisporting mechanism

420
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,240
okay so

421
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,880
our first target of smart lock from

422
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,960
xiaomi

423
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,240
let's play the video first

424
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:52,960
okay

425
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,120
as we can see from the radio recording

426
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,240
when we presented a orange to lock we

427
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,440
will not just detect it as a real human

428
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,799
even but even think this guy is 24 years

429
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:07,039
old

430
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,240
and we also test the xiaomi lock with a

431
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,360
face photo attack and adversarial

432
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,840
example

433
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,919
attack and as we can see every tricks

434
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:19,039
will work

435
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:21,520
the picture from the left is a real

436
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,440
human vector

437
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,400
and xiaomi lock has detected correctly

438
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,960
but when we present a phase photo which

439
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,559
is the one in the middle

440
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:31,840
uh

441
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:35,039
and this adverse serial example mask

442
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:36,559
this one here

443
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:39,280
it will also detect it as a same

444
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,960
victim so that all works

445
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,799
but this type of attack can be easily

446
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:47,840
prevented because some more advanced

447
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,799
system it will come with the um infrared

448
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:52,880
camera and this is what it looks like

449
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,159
from a facial

450
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:56,559
recognition system on foot wheel as we

451
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:59,280
can see if we presented a human face

452
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,240
photo or video on a mobile select one

453
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,760
here

454
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,480
on the right and to the infrared camera

455
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,159
you will actually see nothing at all

456
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,600
um usually we need to do some action

457
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,240
like open our mouths or shake your head

458
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,520
for the face

459
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,679
onto spoofing system to depend determine

460
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,520
whether your face presented is a real

461
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,640
human being or not but what can we do

462
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,919
well what we can do is cut a hole

463
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:29,039
and

464
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:31,679
in the eyes or mouse area

465
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:34,720
to bypass the detection

466
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,760
and we even can buy a customizing face

467
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,840
sculpture

468
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,760
to to bypass the system which lacks

469
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:46,000
detection on a human skin texture

470
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,840
so here's the video demo for the face

471
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,840
sculpture attack on

472
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,440
huawei p30

473
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,440
pro

474
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:05,159
hey

475
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:35,480
so it's worth it

476
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,880
uh as we mentioned early on the

477
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,880
principle of adversarial example attack

478
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,559
is a attacker as intentionally designed

479
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:54,159
girl to cast a machine learning model to

480
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:55,600
make a mistake

481
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,919
as we can see when we added a small

482
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:03,279
product perturbation to the hana picture

483
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:04,559
the

484
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:07,200
machine model will have

485
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,720
99 on three

486
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,919
percent

487
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:14,559
confidence

488
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:16,400
to think it is

489
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,080
even instant and this is a classic

490
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:24,559
adversarial example type

491
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:28,679
and based on various

492
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:32,480
characteristics adversarial example can

493
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,200
be

494
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:38,000
a divided into three different attack

495
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,159
methods such as

496
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:43,200
with a without target

497
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,640
white box

498
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,200
or black box attack

499
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,000
and

500
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:53,360
one step of multi-step type

501
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:58,080
we mainly use the black box

502
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:02,000
adversarial example attack method for

503
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,520
testing

504
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,840
the stressful ability

505
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:10,400
of the one serial example is

506
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,640
guaranteed by john

507
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,159
training of multiple models

508
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:20,320
the normal model training process is to

509
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,559
try the

510
00:25:21,559 --> 00:25:23,520
parameters

511
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:27,360
of the model of the

512
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,400
data set big data set

513
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,279
the

514
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:34,559
uh adversarial or simple as chinese

515
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:39,120
symbol under the condition of fixed

516
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,799
parameters

517
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:41,679
which

518
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:44,080
continuously

519
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:48,159
makes the output of the model close to

520
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:49,120
our

521
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:52,120
expectations

522
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,120
at the basin aerial

523
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:01,440
fluxing has a big impact on the attack

524
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,640
without recap id

525
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,080
we can add perturbation in different

526
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,360
areas on the face but based on a

527
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,360
research article

528
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:16,559
ramu chinhua university

529
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:17,600
the

530
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:21,039
pertinent area within the eyes and the

531
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:22,320
nose

532
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,760
as a

533
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,960
parents

534
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,400
success rate

535
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:32,159
so once we

536
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:35,200
made the uh

537
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:39,360
the serial example based mask we can

538
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,400
present

539
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,120
to some online face id

540
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,919
algorithm for testing

541
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:50,559
one interesting fact is even we use the

542
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:52,480
same mask because

543
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:56,640
because the human face skin and

544
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,520
shape

545
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,919
are different

546
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:02,960
one person may have more success with

547
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,880
than the others

548
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:05,600
as

549
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:09,760
if the picture shows only 73

550
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,720
the

551
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,880
similarity and

552
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,799
the picture on the right have 89

553
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:19,799
percent

554
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,360
okay so

555
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,399
this is a video demo for the adversarial

556
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:29,840
example attack on huawei p30 pro face id

557
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:33,158
login system

558
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:39,439
so first this is a real person

559
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,600
it can be

560
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,960
login successfully now

561
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,159
the attackers come in

562
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:51,440
it doesn't work at the first time

563
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,679
and then he starts wearing a

564
00:27:54,679 --> 00:27:56,799
adversarial example

565
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:59,120
mask

566
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,360
straight

567
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,479
right so

568
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:09,440
and this this is a video demo for the

569
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,159
adverse serial example attack on wema

570
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:16,279
welcome face id system

571
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,039
so again

572
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:21,520
without a mask

573
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,679
it doesn't work

574
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:26,000
so now we start wearing

575
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:26,960
a

576
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,960
modified

577
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,840
mask

578
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:36,080
let's try again

579
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,480
regarding

580
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:45,760
and this is another video

581
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,279
uh the demo

582
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:49,760
but the target is the car which we

583
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,720
cannot disclose the name um but this car

584
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,760
actually

585
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,320
allows us to turn on the engine

586
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:59,039
and drive off if we bypass the face id

587
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:00,320
system

588
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,039
so

589
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:03,760
it's kind of scary uh

590
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,000
if we can bypass it right with the

591
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,559
adversarial example mask

592
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:10,960
so we need to continue you see them

593
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,840
we can need to try

594
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:20,639
and yeah eventually it works

595
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:22,960
so

596
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,559
okay

597
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:29,440
so now we have the clear idea of

598
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,120
principle of

599
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,760
adversarial attack is we can add a small

600
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,200
perturbation

601
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,799
to cause the machine learning model to

602
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:39,279
make a mistake and during the research

603
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:42,080
we have found by putting a target face

604
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,120
image on the attacker's face uh it can

605
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:48,240
come it can cover attack phase partially

606
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,960
and we can deceive some of

607
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,720
our face recognition system with the

608
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,480
higher successful rate

609
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,360
and this

610
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,720
this is a common limitation for 2d

611
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,679
face recognition system

612
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:03,840
so this is a radio demo for the feature

613
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,360
replace attack

614
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:10,158
and we test it on xiaomi note 9.

615
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,159
so

616
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:15,679
without a mask

617
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:18,240
it won't work

618
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,440
then i will gonna wear this

619
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,240
special mask

620
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:37,559
always works all the time

621
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,399
um well of course

622
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:47,279
when system center rule so tight and

623
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:49,840
like very high threshold value we won't

624
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,840
able to bypass it easily

625
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,399
and this one is the face id system for

626
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:55,600
banking

627
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,679
login system which we will file to

628
00:30:57,679 --> 00:30:58,880
getting

629
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:02,320
good funding and for us right

630
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,600
and so

631
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,399
the threshold value this is car where

632
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:08,159
pen tested before which you cannot

633
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:09,600
discuss the name

634
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,000
but just like a lost smart car

635
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,760
uh it has a android based ivi which we

636
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,200
were able to get in

637
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,840
uh in the engineer mode and then we once

638
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,840
we're in the engineer mode we're able to

639
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:25,360
enable adb connection

640
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:29,039
and once we got a db cell

641
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:32,000
uh we are root straight away so what we

642
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,840
what would you do when you got a rose on

643
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:34,960
ioi

644
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:35,919
um

645
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:37,600
maybe you replace the new screen feature

646
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,720
maybe

647
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,960
right

648
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,159
see

649
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:46,480
pretty cool

650
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,279
so and this car also gets a

651
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:52,000
face id function however the anti-facial

652
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,559
spoofing is so tight so good so we

653
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:56,559
cannot spoof it with the tricks we were

654
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:57,919
just mentioned above

655
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:01,440
but we are roots on the system remember

656
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,240
turns out the threshold value configure

657
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:07,519
file is stored locally on the ibi so we

658
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:10,159
can actually modify it to a very low

659
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:14,320
value in order to bypass it right

660
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,159
so here's the video demo

661
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:18,880
for the attack

662
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,519
so first we saw modify the threshold

663
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:22,399
value

664
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:25,360
and when we tried to log in

665
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,559
it failed

666
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:29,600
try again

667
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,960
yeah it won't work

668
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,080
so

669
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,640
then we start to do some magic like by

670
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:38,480
changing the threshold value

671
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:40,240
and

672
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,559
once we change it we need to uh reboot

673
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:44,880
iui system in order to get it from

674
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,200
working

675
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,360
so

676
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:53,519
once the system uh is rebooted itself

677
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:56,000
and we can go in to try again to see if

678
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,440
it works

679
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,159
so

680
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:01,519
now system reboot it

681
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:04,240
okay

682
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:07,960
so let's try again

683
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:17,760
you can see the season

684
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,720
yeah it's working see

685
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,120
sinking sinking thinking

686
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,640
yeah

687
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,880
cool

688
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:31,679
similarly this is a face id system we

689
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:33,679
have come across during another pen test

690
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:34,480
ops

691
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:37,039
but this system has two human features

692
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:40,000
stored in the database once we got root

693
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,480
in the system we can replace one feature

694
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,840
for our own

695
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:46,080
and then the system will verify any one

696
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,480
thing for logging in successfully which

697
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,279
means we can log in as a victim

698
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:52,880
victims still able to log in as in

699
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,320
themselves

700
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,559
which means nobody will even know we

701
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:59,120
were there

702
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:00,880
okay

703
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:01,760
now

704
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,760
what if we cannot get a

705
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:06,159
cell on a target and then the rules of

706
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:09,040
face id is so tight

707
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:09,839
and

708
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,679
are we our option yet

709
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:15,240
let's take a look

710
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:23,040
see

711
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,639
the door is open

712
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:27,839
so yeah a simple rf replay attack will

713
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:28,639
work

714
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:29,679
because

715
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:31,839
uh those access control system usually

716
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:34,639
have multiple features enabled

717
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,879
so it turns out our target can also be

718
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:38,639
opened by a fixed

719
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:41,199
code radio remote controller just like

720
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:42,800
people said it's not a bug it's a

721
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,280
feature

722
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:47,440
okay let's summarize some of the

723
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,520
technique we have seen

724
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,560
so far

725
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:53,199
for the face detection it can be spoofed

726
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:55,359
by a mr orange attack

727
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:57,520
um phase photo attack and phase

728
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,440
sculpture attack

729
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:02,320
and for the face anti-spoofing

730
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:05,200
the feature replace attack and the

731
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,520
serial example attack will work

732
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:10,240
and for the future matching feature

733
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,240
value attack threshold value attack is

734
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,880
always a trick we can always try

735
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,040
so in the end let's not forget those

736
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,920
extra function attack by re using the

737
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,920
hacker if or something to

738
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,960
uh replay right

739
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:25,920
okay

740
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,960
here's uh some uh references if anyone

741
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,920
like to look to know more

742
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:32,800
and

743
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,119
see we can for the research we have done

744
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:37,440
a lot of readings right

745
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,560
um

746
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:43,240
yeah i think that's it thank you

747
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,839
you
