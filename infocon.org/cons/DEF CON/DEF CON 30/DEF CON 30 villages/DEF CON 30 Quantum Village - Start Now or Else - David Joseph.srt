1
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:13,400
good afternoon everybody

2
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:18,779
who believes that we will

3
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:21,960
never materialize a quantum computer

4
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,300
which is large fault tolerant and

5
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,800
capable of breaking today's modern

6
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,080
cryptography can I have a show of hands

7
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,939
who thinks that we will never create one

8
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:33,480
okay

9
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,579
I'm not entirely sure why uh why you're

10
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:37,739
here but uh please do stay

11
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:39,840
we're going to talk more about it so

12
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,399
everybody else believes that we will

13
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:44,180
eventually get there

14
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,379
who thinks that it will happen within

15
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:49,519
the next 30 Years

16
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,140
okay that's uh that's a reasonable show

17
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,460
of optimism

18
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,340
15 years

19
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,199
okay so that's a large condition

20
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:01,260
contingent of the uh the 30-year crowd

21
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:04,199
10 years Keep Your Hands Up

22
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:06,600
okay I like that

23
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,320
five

24
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,460
I like it

25
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:16,080
and who believes that one already exists

26
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,060
okay we've got some spies in the crowd

27
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,619
so I'm David Joseph I'm I'm here from uh

28
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:29,100
from sandbox AQ and basically we we put

29
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,680
out this paper a few months ago to talk

30
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,180
about this this problem that I'm going

31
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,920
to try and sort of summarize and and

32
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,740
gather together uh

33
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,600
and essentially there is so much going

34
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,479
on in Quantum Computing in pqc post

35
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,460
Quantum cryptography

36
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:47,479
there are enormous challenges that are

37
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:51,119
precipitated by uh you know this sort of

38
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:52,560
nebulous threat of quantum computers

39
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,659
where we're not we're not entirely sure

40
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:57,060
when they will uh when they will turn up

41
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,520
and it is such an enormous problem that

42
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,560
is very difficult to you know

43
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,960
conceptualize and think about where to

44
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,700
even start so I'm going to tell the

45
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,520
story at a at a reasonably high level of

46
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,258
how we get to where we are now and what

47
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:12,900
we can do next

48
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,280
foreign

49
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,280
algorithm

50
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,739
and okay you could go maybe go back to

51
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:21,239
Feynman who had this idea that you know

52
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:22,739
if you want to simulate Quantum systems

53
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:25,560
let's use other Quantum systems

54
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,340
but Shaw's algorithm uh in 1994 it's an

55
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,260
exponential speed up right this is

56
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,180
Paradigm shifting for the problems that

57
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:36,540
it affects that's super duper

58
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,280
however it only really affects finding

59
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,319
periods which is you know it's basically

60
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:41,700
long division

61
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,680
um it is literally the stuff that uh

62
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,959
that you did with the little boxes when

63
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:47,400
you're sort of like 10 or 11 years old

64
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,340
now I don't know how many of you use

65
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:53,040
long division in your everyday lives

66
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,780
I don't use it particularly frequently

67
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:00,120
unfortunately the one use case for long

68
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,620
division

69
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,900
is breaking cryptography right there you

70
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,239
know please do nitpick me if you if you

71
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:07,680
have other really useful applications

72
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,200
for discrete logarithm finding or or

73
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,780
long division I'm happy to hear

74
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,400
the other algorithm is Grover's

75
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,900
algorithm so it's kind of like it's not

76
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,519
as good as you know it's not Paradigm

77
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,440
shifting but you know quadratic speed up

78
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,780
is very nice it's extremely widely

79
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,819
applicable right searching on sorted

80
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:25,560
databases has applications in many many

81
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,420
different algorithms

82
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:29,640
and again unfortunately it weakens

83
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:33,239
symmetric crypto now it doesn't break it

84
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:35,640
it weakens it so that that's the sort of

85
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,700
the the background that uh that we have

86
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,319
and so today what I'm going to talk

87
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,260
about more is the the public key

88
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:46,019
cryptography side of things so here on

89
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:47,519
the left we're you know this padlock

90
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,319
sort of represents symmetric

91
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:50,940
cryptography which is basically what we

92
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,500
use for you know all of the bulk

93
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,480
encryption

94
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,700
this refers to handshaking in the middle

95
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:00,000
uh you know so when we want to get

96
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,620
properties like confidentiality we want

97
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,200
to make sure nobody's reading our data

98
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,260
or we want to get uh authenticity so we

99
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,140
want to ensure that whoever we are

100
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:11,640
exchanging our keys with is the right

101
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,400
person this is where we use public key

102
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,079
cryptography which was you know just

103
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,060
like absolutely mental that this thing

104
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,459
even exists I mean if you go back sort

105
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:22,560
of 70 80 years the idea that you could

106
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,240
establish secrets with other people

107
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,699
without even uh without even even

108
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:28,680
meeting them or without sharing any kind

109
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,759
of a secret

110
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,220
people didn't even imagine that that was

111
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:35,780
possible it's very very cool

112
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,240
on the left mainly affected by Grover's

113
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,160
algorithm and on the right manufactured

114
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,080
by Shaw and this is what I'm going to

115
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,060
focus on a little bit more today because

116
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,699
it's um that's really

117
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:51,780
where the greatest problem presents

118
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,280
and that's the bid in the uh in the

119
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,000
white dotted box

120
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:59,520
so we need many many problems for post

121
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,259
Quantum cryptography

122
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:03,060
I haven't really touched on the the

123
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:07,080
current standards uh which are RSA

124
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,699
um elliptic curve-based cryptography and

125
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:10,080
they're all based on many of the same

126
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,340
problems

127
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,979
uh that are all broken by Shores but we

128
00:05:13,979 --> 00:05:16,320
need many many many types of post

129
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,979
Quantum cryptography and here is why

130
00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:22,800
who here was surprised when Peter Shaw

131
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,699
published his algorithm in 1994 and it

132
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:27,900
broke all of uh all of current

133
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,940
cryptography

134
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,500
okay we've got one person that was

135
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,479
surprised here I wasn't surprised

136
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:36,380
because I wasn't born yet

137
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:40,758
but somebody wasn't surprised

138
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,740
I was reading a paper by

139
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:46,740
um Shamir the other day uh on Bermuda

140
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,360
kernel problem for

141
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,160
uh

142
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,259
for an identification scheme and

143
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:53,639
essentially this was in the abstract and

144
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:55,620
I found this super interesting the

145
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,780
security of the new scheme depends on an

146
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:00,180
NP complete algebraic problem rather

147
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:02,580
than on factoring and thus it widens the

148
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,860
basis of public key crypto which has

149
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:07,199
become dangerously dependent on the

150
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,479
difficulty of a single problem right

151
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:12,720
this was 1989.

152
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,280
and this guy wrote RSA

153
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,360
so there's good news there are many

154
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,820
types of post Quantum cryptography also

155
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,500
we believe and they're based on you know

156
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,600
all these cool different things my

157
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,520
favorite is lattices you know like just

158
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,560
repeating patterns of points in in very

159
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,720
high dimensional space right and if you

160
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,039
can find the shortest distance between

161
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:34,680
any two of those points kaching

162
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,419
you decrypted everything

163
00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:38,039
unfortunately it's actually very

164
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:40,560
difficult to uh to do that you've got

165
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,880
all of these sort of fancy things like

166
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,740
isogenes and multivariate very

167
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:46,020
mathematical very interesting not my

168
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:46,919
area

169
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:49,080
hash based cryptography is kind of it's

170
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,360
much more close to the symmetric stuff

171
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,560
that I was talking about so we think

172
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,840
that Grover may be the best attack for

173
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,880
that so it's quite conservative and then

174
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,340
you've got code based cryptography now

175
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:00,900
when it comes to code based cryptography

176
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,400
I mean this is this is based on the fact

177
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,460
that it's very difficult to decode a

178
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:08,220
random linear code and that's super

179
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,139
interesting because code coding Theory

180
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:12,360
basically derives from

181
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,240
looking into how can we transmit data

182
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,979
securely so I find it very very

183
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:18,419
interesting that actually this can be

184
00:07:18,419 --> 00:07:21,180
used to uh you know in a cryptographic

185
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,860
setting as well

186
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,660
so in principle

187
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:27,360
quantum computers can Factor what we've

188
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,120
currently got and in principle we have

189
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,699
lots of candidates to replace it

190
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:35,280
so maybe the talk ends here

191
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,258
unfortunately it's not quite that simple

192
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,039
I'm now going to take a you know a

193
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:42,660
second or two to talk about quantum

194
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:44,580
computers

195
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,259
there are many many types of quantum

196
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:48,240
computers they're based on Quantum

197
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,520
Optics superconducting systems

198
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,099
topological systems ion traps Quantum

199
00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:55,560
spin systems cold you know Ultra cold

200
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,300
gases trapped in sort of periodic

201
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,759
patterns of lasers right there are so

202
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,979
many different media that are currently

203
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:04,620
being intensely researched to try and

204
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,000
create the you know the next generation

205
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,220
of quantum computers that this says one

206
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:11,160
thing we are very very far in some

207
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,380
respects from creating these large fault

208
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:15,479
tolerant quantum computers because if we

209
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:17,699
had any clear favorites

210
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:19,680
the others would pretty much be you know

211
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,259
out of the race it is still wide open

212
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:25,199
this race right I'm sure not everybody

213
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,960
here is impartial uh about about which

214
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,699
one of these these systems is going to

215
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:31,560
be the the favorite

216
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,839
um but that's not my area so I'm happy

217
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:35,880
to hear more

218
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,559
and the problems that we face when we're

219
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,958
trying to build these things are

220
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:41,700
extremely varied

221
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:44,279
so let's take cubic count

222
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:46,200
everybody hears you know okay you know

223
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,220
somebody's come out with the latest

224
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:49,260
paper they've got you know this many

225
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,000
qubits this person's got dozens of

226
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,760
qubits and actually when we were writing

227
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,820
this paper for for nature we I actually

228
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:59,279
tried to to build a figure of the

229
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:00,899
different road maps in terms of a number

230
00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:02,519
of qubits

231
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:04,800
and I couldn't because it's absolutely

232
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,380
absurd and impossible right it's not

233
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,100
like

234
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,720
comparing those previous systems I

235
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,100
talked about it's not like comparing

236
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,959
apples and oranges it's like comparing

237
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,940
pineapples and Bricks

238
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:17,459
essentially so so D wave has 5 000

239
00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:19,320
qubits in their latest version right

240
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,540
Google's Quantum Supremacy experiment

241
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:25,019
back in 2019 had about 53. IBM I think

242
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:28,380
uh may be nudging over a hundred

243
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:29,940
um and then all these things go through

244
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,500
peer review and then every kind of you

245
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,779
know you know slings Market to each

246
00:09:33,779 --> 00:09:35,640
other about uh about everything that

247
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,779
they're doing wrong

248
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:39,420
it's very very difficult and these are

249
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:41,160
the reasons why there are so many

250
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,140
metrics that you need to nail to build

251
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,180
these large fault toll on quantum

252
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:48,060
computers Fidelity is an interesting one

253
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,680
a qubit

254
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,540
in its Quantum state is effect is

255
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:53,399
essentially like a point on a sphere

256
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:54,959
and when it interacts with the universe

257
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:56,459
when it's measured

258
00:09:56,459 --> 00:09:58,920
it collapses to a one or a zero

259
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,440
and a single cubic gate

260
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,300
is basically just trying to take that

261
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,040
point on the sphere and move it to a

262
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,779
different point

263
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:08,399
that's not very Quantum though we can

264
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,399
get like I know like 99.99 Fidelity on

265
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:12,540
those which means that you know we'll

266
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:15,480
get the right answer 99.99 of the time

267
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,399
but when you try and entangle these

268
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:18,720
things which is where you really get the

269
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,940
quantumness from it

270
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:23,580
that Fidelity at least as of a couple of

271
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:26,940
years ago was about 99.5 which still you

272
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:29,100
know it sounds high is it high

273
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,360
no

274
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,860
when you try and string together many

275
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:34,380
many many of these Gates it you know the

276
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:37,320
those errors that 0.5 error it

277
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,959
propagates and it just destroys the uh

278
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:40,980
you know the chance of you getting

279
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,240
anything meaningful out of the other

280
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,680
side

281
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,360
and people you know I think there's a

282
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,760
series of three papers on improving um

283
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,180
Fidelity uh of these two cubic Gates

284
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,459
just in nature this year so so this is

285
00:10:53,459 --> 00:10:55,740
it's still a super hot area of research

286
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:57,480
this is before we get into coherence

287
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,760
time that's about manipulating the

288
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,560
quantum States but while your Quantum

289
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,940
processor is manipulating certain

290
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:05,040
Quantum States the other ones it's got

291
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,800
to keep somehow isolated from the entire

292
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,120
universe right

293
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,880
it's not as simple as it sounds this is

294
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,279
why when I did a lot of my research on

295
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:17,040
on d-wave you know it's very difficult

296
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,320
to use long coherent type long coherence

297
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,120
times

298
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,860
then you've got the cubic count thing

299
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,839
which is kind of like it I mean that's

300
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:26,519
just a function of everything else that

301
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,380
you um that you're kind of breaking over

302
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:31,500
here circuit depth that's another Factor

303
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,480
what I'm trying to communicate and

304
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,740
that's before we're getting onto error

305
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,060
correcting codes which is the notion

306
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,800
that okay maybe we can create really

307
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,200
nice qubits that perform as qubits

308
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,779
should if we just kind of bundle maybe

309
00:11:42,779 --> 00:11:44,760
you know 100 or a thousand of them

310
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:48,360
together in uh in a very clever way

311
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:51,240
so these are the problems that an

312
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,740
enormous amount of very very smart

313
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,839
people are trying to work on right now

314
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:58,160
and develop solutions for

315
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,160
so this is very difficult so what are

316
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,839
the people that actually work on these

317
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:06,440
things think

318
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,399
let's go back to the question that I

319
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,940
opened with

320
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:14,220
Professor McKellen mosca of the

321
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:17,399
um iqc uh in Waterloo

322
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:20,399
every year he puts together a survey of

323
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,079
about you know a few dozen of the

324
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:24,660
world's leading Quantum researchers and

325
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,519
he asks them one of one of the questions

326
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:29,700
you ask them is you know when is a large

327
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,680
fault tolerant quantum computer capable

328
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,980
of factoring RSA 2048-bit Prime

329
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,959
semi-primes

330
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:39,060
and he asked them on a you know for

331
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:41,279
different time frames with a reasonable

332
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:45,060
level of granularity and okay so let's

333
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:47,160
say that you are looking to develop new

334
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,500
drugs or or maybe you're looking to to

335
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,260
do one of these other applications like

336
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:55,019
improve bus routes or something maybe

337
00:12:55,019 --> 00:12:56,160
this is the data point that you're

338
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,579
interested in because within 15 years of

339
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:01,260
those 46 people

340
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:03,480
at least 28 thought that there was an

341
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:06,000
even or better chance that we'd have one

342
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,880
within within 15 years right so more

343
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,139
than half thought that there was more

344
00:13:10,139 --> 00:13:12,120
than a half percent you know more than a

345
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:15,540
half chance that would have them

346
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:17,820
but maybe if you are an information

347
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:20,160
security officer

348
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,720
maybe those kinds of odds aren't

349
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,639
actually very nice

350
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:27,180
maybe if you know 10 of those 46 people

351
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:29,339
think that there's a better than five

352
00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:30,779
percent chance that this will be around

353
00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:32,820
in five years maybe you find that a

354
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:35,459
little bit worrying

355
00:13:35,459 --> 00:13:37,019
and here's why you might find that

356
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:38,880
worrying so if that is so if you take

357
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,040
away you know like any data points from

358
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,160
uh from today it's that people think

359
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,600
that there is you know a non-trivial

360
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,519
number of experts think that there is a

361
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,260
non-trivial chance that we will have

362
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:51,540
these large-scale fault tolerant quantum

363
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:54,240
computers in a reasonably short period

364
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,600
of time

365
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:00,320
so do we have time

366
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:02,220
no

367
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:04,680
if you are responsible for manufacturing

368
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:07,500
long field life devices so maybe this is

369
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,380
military aircraft maybe it's um you know

370
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:12,180
container ships you're going to be

371
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,980
putting in crypto Hardware that may be

372
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:16,740
responsible for authentication and once

373
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,899
you deploy these things they can be

374
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:21,600
expected to you know be operational in

375
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,800
the field for 10 20 30 years

376
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,420
and if you want to pull those things

377
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,519
back and you want to sort of you know

378
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,440
remediate the hardware you want to swap

379
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,779
it out there is a very real economic

380
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:36,120
costs to these kinds of uh to these

381
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,279
kinds of decisions so maybe it's nice if

382
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:40,260
you can actually pull that decision to

383
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:42,660
have Quantum resistant cryptography into

384
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:45,000
the present and save yourself costs in

385
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,079
the future

386
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:49,680
industrial Control Systems now uh the

387
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,139
idea that I mean industrial Control

388
00:14:52,139 --> 00:14:54,060
Systems have notoriously

389
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,220
you know flaky cyber security and the

390
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:58,380
reason why is because these things take

391
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:01,199
20 years to design tend to build and

392
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:02,820
then people want them to remain up and

393
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,920
functional for another 30 right so the

394
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,120
things that we've got now were around

395
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,199
you know

396
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:08,820
people were starting to think about them

397
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:11,459
back when um Riverstone Shamir and

398
00:15:11,459 --> 00:15:13,920
Adelman were were cooking up the their

399
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,000
RSA algorithm

400
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:19,079
but the problem is these things

401
00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:23,820
sometimes require about 99.99 uptime

402
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,920
that gives you a period of about six

403
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,320
minutes per year

404
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,300
to do your upgrades and that's barely

405
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,040
enough for a software patch let alone

406
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,620
ripping out your crypto Hardware

407
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,660
so anyway there's there's lots of very

408
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,760
difficult conversations to be had there

409
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:42,360
things need doing soon if you take that

410
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:45,980
previous slide seriously

411
00:15:46,199 --> 00:15:48,120
but it gets worse

412
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,680
this is the store now decrypt later

413
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,600
attacks so

414
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,820
it's really very simple it does what it

415
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,380
says on the tin

416
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:57,959
your adversary here he sits there and he

417
00:15:57,959 --> 00:15:59,699
monitors public networks or maybe even

418
00:15:59,699 --> 00:16:01,079
private networks say he's got a bit of

419
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:02,820
access to

420
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:04,500
and all he does is he downloads your

421
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,019
data right so let's take for example you

422
00:16:07,019 --> 00:16:09,420
know a TLS session as an example

423
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:11,279
he downloads the whole session the

424
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:12,959
handshake and the bulk encryption as

425
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:14,579
well

426
00:16:14,579 --> 00:16:17,160
and he puts them in his safe

427
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:20,060
and he waits

428
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:25,920
and in 5 10 15 maybe longer whenever

429
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,260
he's got access to his

430
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:30,300
Quantum operating system computer

431
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,940
whatever that is

432
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:35,040
he breaks the handshake which is where

433
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,259
the public key crypto is and once he's

434
00:16:37,259 --> 00:16:39,500
broken the the handshake and he's

435
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:42,600
extracted your symmetric crypto keys

436
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,940
what he can do then he doesn't have to

437
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,680
do any hacking he just decrypts the

438
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,279
entire session

439
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,639
I hypothesize that the difficult part of

440
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:56,040
this attack is going to be not the

441
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,540
quantum part of it not the actual

442
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:00,240
factoring I think the difficult part is

443
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,000
going to be finding out

444
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,819
what the targets are there is so much

445
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:08,040
data that you can look at that you can

446
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,079
extract and download and wait to crack

447
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,819
and you are only going to have a finite

448
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:14,640
amount of Quantum Resources

449
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,160
I think that relative to the the amount

450
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,959
of targets

451
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,419
the quantum part is going to be easy

452
00:17:21,419 --> 00:17:24,000
and that is a little bit scary because

453
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,400
uh yeah I don't know people are very

454
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,660
good at finding good targets

455
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:31,620
so

456
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:33,720
essentially we have mosca's theorem

457
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,900
right so he's a I promise he's a he's a

458
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,700
very good physicist he's done lots of

459
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:41,280
very complicated maths and yet this may

460
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,960
be his greatest Legacy to us this

461
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,380
theorem and he says if migration time X

462
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:49,500
Plus security shelf life Y is greater

463
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,140
than time to compromise Z

464
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:54,660
you should be worried

465
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:56,340
and that's because let's say this

466
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:59,580
migration to pqc takes you I don't know

467
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,919
five or eight years and let's say you're

468
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:03,299
a bank and you're you're required to

469
00:18:03,299 --> 00:18:04,740
keep your information secret for five

470
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:06,780
years well all of a sudden if you know

471
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,340
if there's a if there's a break within

472
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:10,559
13 years and these quantum computers

473
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:13,919
materialize you're in trouble

474
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:15,960
but let's be real there's many many

475
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,900
applications where we want uh

476
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:21,419
confidentiality to remain for much

477
00:18:21,419 --> 00:18:23,700
longer than five years right let's think

478
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:26,460
about uh you know

479
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:30,179
Pharma IP or uh you know military trade

480
00:18:30,179 --> 00:18:32,039
secret secrets

481
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:34,559
medical records we want to be preserved

482
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,840
for all you know for a lifetime you know

483
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,960
if uh if a diplomat from a conservative

484
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,000
part of the world if they're HIV

485
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,160
diagnosis is revealed they can you know

486
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,100
that can be used to Blackmail them

487
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,260
and so this is what you really need to

488
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,760
be concerned about

489
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:54,379
and so if we look at this timeline

490
00:18:54,539 --> 00:18:56,640
if you take the strategy

491
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,919
I call it the ostrich strategy

492
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:01,380
of burying your head in the sand I give

493
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:04,679
you five to seven good years right I

494
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:06,299
think you you'll lead a very comfortable

495
00:19:06,299 --> 00:19:09,799
life for five to seven years

496
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,660
then you'll have trouble right and and

497
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,160
you're going to be sweating under the

498
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,660
collar

499
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:18,120
because this is extremely unknown and if

500
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,400
some of the predictions from you know a

501
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,220
few slides previously come true and if

502
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,840
the the very smart people working on

503
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,240
developing these Quantum devices

504
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,100
actually materialize and uh and deliver

505
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,840
to these uh these funding bodies what

506
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,880
they've promised

507
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,400
things are going to you know move very

508
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,559
very fast and once we get close to

509
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:39,600
having blueprints for large scale fault

510
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,820
tolerant quantum computers there will be

511
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:45,918
a frenzy of activity to build them

512
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:50,780
so who remembers New Year's Eve 2008

513
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:54,840
nope okay so everybody else was blind

514
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:57,139
drunk

515
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,220
maybe it looks a bit like this

516
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:02,600
but not for

517
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,500
these researchers at Carnegie Mellon

518
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,299
University they released this

519
00:20:06,299 --> 00:20:09,720
vulnerability note on md5 md5 is

520
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:12,480
vulnerable to Collision attacks

521
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,820
and the overview says weaknesses in the

522
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:16,860
md5 algorithm allow for collisions in

523
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:19,020
the output and as a result attackers can

524
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:21,900
generate cryptographic tokens or other

525
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:24,000
data that illegitimately appear to be

526
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,480
authentic

527
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:30,240
and so this is what happens from time to

528
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,340
time cryptography gets broken

529
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:34,080
you know that's the way the world works

530
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,820
that's progress for you

531
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:39,020
and we have to act on it

532
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:43,860
now in 2012 flame malware was identified

533
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:45,660
and once this malware had been

534
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:48,299
fingerprinted and tested

535
00:20:48,299 --> 00:20:50,520
it was found out that it had infected

536
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,020
you know thousands and thousands of

537
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:53,820
devices around the world particularly in

538
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,679
the Middle East and it was sort of

539
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,179
hypothesized that maybe it had been

540
00:20:57,179 --> 00:20:59,700
around in the wild since about 2008.

541
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:04,020
we don't know exactly when uh the md5 uh

542
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,940
aspect of it was incorporated because it

543
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:08,460
was an extremely large uh sort of you

544
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:10,500
know Suite of malware that you know just

545
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,080
went on and on and on and you know zero

546
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:16,140
days Galore and all the rest of it

547
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:18,299
but he calls these gentlemen quite a bit

548
00:21:18,299 --> 00:21:19,440
of angst

549
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,419
there they are inspecting their their

550
00:21:21,419 --> 00:21:22,919
nice uh

551
00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:26,580
uranium enrichment centrifuges

552
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:29,039
and you know it was famously used in

553
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:31,919
stocksnet which basically was an act of

554
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:36,720
sabotage on the Iranian nuclear system

555
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,360
and one of the ways that hit the this uh

556
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:44,220
this this malware had operated is that

557
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,440
the servers which we use to control the

558
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,980
the plcs which uh which essentially ran

559
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,480
these uh

560
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:54,539
these nuclear plants were windows

561
00:21:54,539 --> 00:21:57,900
and this code had a signature which

562
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,640
appeared to be authentic

563
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:02,880
and it appeared to come from Microsoft

564
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,159
now Microsoft did not write this code it

565
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:08,760
is malware and what it did is its

566
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,039
averted trust in the Microsoft update

567
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:12,900
servers and this is a massive problem

568
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,600
because the reason Microsoft issue

569
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,059
updates is because they want people to

570
00:22:18,059 --> 00:22:20,940
be safe they want to release patches and

571
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,620
the idea is that these patches make you

572
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:25,080
safer so if all of a sudden people start

573
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,419
going oh I'm not so sure I'm going to

574
00:22:27,419 --> 00:22:30,059
install this latest update because it

575
00:22:30,059 --> 00:22:32,100
could be malware this is Extreme

576
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,500
extremely problematic now the way that

577
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,539
this particular example was done

578
00:22:36,539 --> 00:22:38,400
appeared to be more sort of client-side

579
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,840
which meant that

580
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,659
it was very very targeted but in theory

581
00:22:42,659 --> 00:22:43,919
this could have been used to push

582
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:46,380
malware to you know enormous numbers of

583
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:47,940
devices

584
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:51,299
and this demonstrates how

585
00:22:51,299 --> 00:22:53,400
a failure to transition

586
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:57,299
from broken cryptography in good time

587
00:22:57,299 --> 00:23:00,120
can cause absolutely Mayhem

588
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,799
and the moral of this story is that

589
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:03,299
people say that there's you know there's

590
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:05,820
often an easier way of getting into a

591
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,500
computer system than Breaking the

592
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,760
cryptography

593
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:11,820
and that is true until it's not

594
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:13,679
eventually there comes a point where if

595
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:15,059
breaking the cryptography is

596
00:23:15,059 --> 00:23:17,880
straightforward somebody will do it and

597
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:21,240
it will be very very problematic

598
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,620
and this is the thing another thing that

599
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:24,720
people say is okay well breaking

600
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,179
cryptography you know Quantum Quantum

601
00:23:27,179 --> 00:23:30,179
Resources will be very limited but you

602
00:23:30,179 --> 00:23:31,980
know they're only going to be able to

603
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:35,940
Target a small number of uh you know a

604
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:37,500
small number of handshakes to break or

605
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,720
it's very finite but the point that I've

606
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,760
just demonstrated is that if you find

607
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,760
the weak Link in the infrastructure you

608
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:47,400
can cause very very serious problems for

609
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,020
very very many people

610
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:51,480
so do not take this for granted

611
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,860
so this was a little bit of a side

612
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:54,480
anecdote to demonstrate to everybody

613
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,299
that this stuff is not theoretical it

614
00:23:57,299 --> 00:24:00,500
happens in the real world

615
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:03,080
now

616
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,559
part two I'm going to talk a little bit

617
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:06,539
about what's being done about it I'm

618
00:24:06,539 --> 00:24:08,220
going to focus a little bit more on what

619
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:10,140
the the US is doing about it there are

620
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:11,520
many many efforts that are going on

621
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,900
around the world

622
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,159
Etsy the international standards

623
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:17,159
organization 3gpp but I'm going to focus

624
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:20,480
a little bit more on the US government

625
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:25,020
and pqc starts with standardization

626
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:27,059
nist have already standardized two

627
00:24:27,059 --> 00:24:28,919
stateful hash based signature schemes

628
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:30,240
remember hashes of that really

629
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,100
conservative version they can be used

630
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,960
for authentication but not for

631
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,179
confidentiality

632
00:24:36,179 --> 00:24:37,799
and these systems have been standardized

633
00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:39,480
they are ready to go and we think that

634
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,860
the best quantum attacks on them or

635
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:43,080
Grover so that's not enormously

636
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,460
problematic

637
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:46,200
but they are stateful and what that

638
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:49,260
means is that you have a counter every

639
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:52,260
time you sign an application sorry every

640
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:54,480
time you you issue a signature

641
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,179
you must increment that counter if you

642
00:24:57,179 --> 00:24:58,919
use the same counter twice for two

643
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:00,720
different signatures your scheme will

644
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,220
break

645
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:04,080
and what that means is that this is

646
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,659
appropriate for certain applications

647
00:25:06,659 --> 00:25:09,059
like for example code signing or secure

648
00:25:09,059 --> 00:25:12,600
boot where one might expect to only need

649
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,700
to issue signatures you know maybe a few

650
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:17,100
times an hour at maximum but for other

651
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,140
applications this doesn't really scale

652
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:23,520
you know if you're if you know iot or

653
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,860
um you know maybe server side

654
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:29,700
um signatures for TLS for for web

655
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,200
applications

656
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,000
the risk is too high that you will

657
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,799
duplicate signatures so these things

658
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,240
exist

659
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,220
they can be very useful

660
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:42,539
and this is good pqc is uh is on its way

661
00:25:42,539 --> 00:25:45,539
but the big daddy competition is this uh

662
00:25:45,539 --> 00:25:47,820
the nist post Quantum cryptography

663
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:50,039
competition and it's very very spicy

664
00:25:50,039 --> 00:25:51,720
right

665
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,100
um and I'm just going to take you

666
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,960
through some of the drama over the last

667
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,440
five years

668
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,340
and this is a basic little timeline it

669
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:01,620
was announced in 2016 so we were aware

670
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:04,080
of the problem a little while back

671
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,900
submissions happen in 2017 and crypto

672
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,179
analysis has continued over the past

673
00:26:09,179 --> 00:26:12,659
five years up until the present day and

674
00:26:12,659 --> 00:26:15,659
uh Nest have recently made the the

675
00:26:15,659 --> 00:26:17,940
latest statement and we can expect to

676
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:19,440
have the first standards out in maybe

677
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,600
sort of 12 to 18 months

678
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,400
which is very good news but we know

679
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,260
which schemes will be standardized which

680
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:27,659
is fantastic

681
00:26:27,659 --> 00:26:29,220
so at the beginning there were 82

682
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:31,799
submissions of the e69 were deemed

683
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:33,059
complete

684
00:26:33,059 --> 00:26:36,120
26 progressed to round two 15 to round

685
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,220
three and in the recent announcement

686
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:40,980
four are going to be standardized and

687
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:43,740
four are going to be facing a little bit

688
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:46,700
more crypto analysis

689
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,559
now the way that Nest whittled down

690
00:26:49,559 --> 00:26:52,140
these submissions is

691
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:54,240
some of them were broken

692
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,820
some of them were just a little bit Naf

693
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:58,799
and some of them were encouraged to

694
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:00,779
merge because they were very similar and

695
00:27:00,779 --> 00:27:02,039
so they could use you know the

696
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:03,419
optimizations from one team and the

697
00:27:03,419 --> 00:27:04,980
optimizations from another and come up

698
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:06,720
with something slightly better to reduce

699
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,940
the amount of different things that you

700
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:11,900
could write a paper on

701
00:27:12,659 --> 00:27:14,340
and so this is what it looked like at

702
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:16,919
the um in round three so we had seven

703
00:27:16,919 --> 00:27:20,279
finalists and eight alternates now in

704
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:21,980
white we've got the ones which are for

705
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:24,539
confidentiality so securing your you

706
00:27:24,539 --> 00:27:26,340
know making sure that nobody can read

707
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:29,400
your your data when you encrypt it

708
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:32,100
and the ones in yellow are for uh

709
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,600
authentication so these are digital

710
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,720
signature algorithms

711
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,600
at the beginning of this year uh a paper

712
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,220
was released

713
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:43,679
and it broke rainbow right this is the

714
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:45,539
based on multivariates

715
00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:47,460
um quadratic equations

716
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:49,799
and the papers entitled we can break

717
00:27:49,799 --> 00:27:52,860
rainbow in a weekend on a laptop so this

718
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:54,179
was very very bad news for the rainbow

719
00:27:54,179 --> 00:27:56,279
Waters because they've been working very

720
00:27:56,279 --> 00:27:57,840
very hard on this for the past five

721
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,080
years

722
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,940
and then this and released their

723
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:04,380
announcement of what was going to happen

724
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:06,659
and

725
00:28:06,659 --> 00:28:09,840
wow this was surprising so first of all

726
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,480
rainbow obviously out

727
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,720
Sphinx has been subbed in Sphinx is uh

728
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,400
is based on hashes so very very

729
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,779
conservative we're happy with the

730
00:28:18,779 --> 00:28:21,299
security performance Wise It's a little

731
00:28:21,299 --> 00:28:23,100
bit slow

732
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:26,400
um so this has been sub-dim and this is

733
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,620
ostensibly because

734
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:30,240
nist didn't want to just rely on

735
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,520
lattices for final you know for for

736
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:35,880
signatures the only chem to be

737
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,520
standardized for for confidentiality is

738
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,799
crystals kyber

739
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:42,600
um classical mcclease did not make it

740
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,400
through

741
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,620
this upset some people I won't go into

742
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:48,059
that but

743
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:50,220
please anybody who loves deep Tech drama

744
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:53,220
sign up to the pqc Forum right

745
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:55,860
um it's highly highly entertaining

746
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:58,559
and then shortly after this happened oh

747
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:01,260
boy this is so exciting another paper

748
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:03,000
came out

749
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,840
and I and psych was broken wow

750
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,760
now in this latest one

751
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,980
this was even worse than the rainbow one

752
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:13,799
right so the people who broke psych you

753
00:29:13,799 --> 00:29:15,179
know these crypto systems are meant to

754
00:29:15,179 --> 00:29:15,900
take

755
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:18,600
hundreds maybe thousands of years to to

756
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,640
brute force them to break

757
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,159
they solved this in about an hour on a

758
00:29:23,159 --> 00:29:25,140
single core computer running a sage math

759
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:27,480
script right

760
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,159
that's a very bad look so I don't think

761
00:29:29,159 --> 00:29:30,779
psych will be progressing to any kind of

762
00:29:30,779 --> 00:29:32,399
standardization

763
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:34,320
but isogenes is not necessarily dead in

764
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,820
the water

765
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:37,860
and so one can think about 22 in terms

766
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:38,700
of

767
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:41,100
groups analysis

768
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:43,500
as psych and rainbow both getting broken

769
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:46,260
by a laptop in under a weekend which is

770
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:47,460
really quite phenomenal when you

771
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:50,880
consider that this is the leading pqc

772
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,740
process that has been ongoing for about

773
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:55,020
five years with some of the world's

774
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:57,600
greatest cryptographers all trying to

775
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,700
get fantastic papers by breaking schemes

776
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:02,220
and we are now in 2022 and this stuff is

777
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:03,720
still happening

778
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:06,919
it's very very difficult

779
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:08,340
I'm going to touch on a couple of

780
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:12,120
techniques that we recommend for

781
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:14,159
precipitating this transition and the

782
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:16,140
first is to use hybrid mode

783
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:19,200
we want you to use one traditional

784
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,140
algorithm and one pqc algorithm and the

785
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:25,080
point of that is it means that if one of

786
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:27,020
them becomes broken

787
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:30,419
your cryptography is as strong

788
00:30:30,419 --> 00:30:33,539
as the strongest one right so if your

789
00:30:33,539 --> 00:30:36,120
pqc gets broken then at least you

790
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:39,000
haven't reduced your security And if

791
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,580
quantum computers turn up then at least

792
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:43,980
you've got your pqc there right this is

793
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:46,080
not a long-term strategy but this is the

794
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,720
way that we recommend people begin to

795
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,059
get going right this is many people

796
00:30:51,059 --> 00:30:53,100
agree with this approach some people do

797
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,480
not

798
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,620
um but this is certainly what I would

799
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,600
suggest and what's great is that the US

800
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,360
government have said that this will

801
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,500
allow you to keep your fips

802
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,299
certification

803
00:31:03,299 --> 00:31:04,860
so if you need to process federal

804
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:06,299
information

805
00:31:06,299 --> 00:31:09,360
then you need your FIP certification

806
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,220
and what they say is that so long as the

807
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:13,440
traditional part is fips certified you

808
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,779
keep your FIP certification right so you

809
00:31:15,779 --> 00:31:18,539
can lob on any kind of crypto so long as

810
00:31:18,539 --> 00:31:22,200
the first part is traditionally

811
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,419
um fips certified and the other thing

812
00:31:24,419 --> 00:31:26,159
that we want to really really push is

813
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:28,679
crypto agility and this is the notion

814
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:31,140
that you can build cryptography

815
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:33,419
infrastructures that will allow you to

816
00:31:33,419 --> 00:31:34,980
be more agile they will allow you to

817
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:36,960
change your key lengths when your key

818
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,700
lengths need changing they will allow

819
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,020
you to update or switch your

820
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:43,860
cryptography when you prefer uh apart

821
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:46,440
from anything it means that if if some

822
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:49,080
cryptography gets fatally broken it will

823
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:51,360
allow you to switch that out very very

824
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,740
fast and you won't need to wait around

825
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:55,919
for third-party vendors

826
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:57,600
um and and then maybe even down the road

827
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,220
there are even cooler benefits you can

828
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:01,020
get like uh like having you know this

829
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:02,880
this cool autonomy that allows you to

830
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,460
optimize the cryptography uh you know

831
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:07,020
cocktails that you're using for any

832
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:08,940
particular application

833
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:10,320
and that's something which is just

834
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:13,080
completely not possible in you know the

835
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:15,860
modern architecture

836
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:19,020
so that's what nist is doing nist is the

837
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,340
standards organization it's kind of

838
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:21,840
their business to be standardizing stuff

839
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,419
but as we know governments are not

840
00:32:24,419 --> 00:32:26,640
cohesive organizations

841
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,500
are the US government taking their own

842
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,679
medicine

843
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:32,880
well actually they're not doing a bad

844
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,279
job I've been pretty impressed so in

845
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:37,380
January they released this memorandum

846
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:40,200
which said

847
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:45,120
Chief Information officers of major

848
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:48,840
um or you know of federal agencies need

849
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,640
to

850
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,500
within six months

851
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,720
have identified all of their Quantum

852
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,399
vulnerable encryption

853
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:59,159
and have submitted a plan for migration

854
00:32:59,159 --> 00:33:02,580
now six months takes us to July just

855
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:03,960
gone

856
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:06,779
have they done that well I don't know I

857
00:33:06,779 --> 00:33:09,840
think those timelines are

858
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,000
maybe ambitious would be would be

859
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,039
charitable however that's not the point

860
00:33:14,039 --> 00:33:17,159
the point is they are making it their

861
00:33:17,159 --> 00:33:18,779
Chief Information officers problems

862
00:33:18,779 --> 00:33:21,419
right they have to start acting and they

863
00:33:21,419 --> 00:33:23,039
have to start thinking about this and

864
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:24,600
this is so important because it is

865
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:27,779
absolutely impossible to mobilize large

866
00:33:27,779 --> 00:33:30,659
organizations and private businesses if

867
00:33:30,659 --> 00:33:32,399
the government is not acting first and

868
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:34,679
taking this seriously because if you are

869
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:37,380
a foreign nation state adversary or any

870
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:39,240
kind of you know any kind of adversary

871
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,940
with large resources

872
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:44,100
some of the juiciest arguments are going

873
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:46,500
to be so some of the juiciest targets

874
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:50,059
are going to be in federal government

875
00:33:51,299 --> 00:33:52,679
so now I'm just going to take a few

876
00:33:52,679 --> 00:33:55,500
moments to say okay at a high level what

877
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:59,659
can we all do about this

878
00:34:00,779 --> 00:34:03,000
we've come up with a four point strategy

879
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,799
that we think that everybody can follow

880
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:08,280
and everybody can start now

881
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:11,099
independent of Standards the first part

882
00:34:11,099 --> 00:34:12,780
is inventory

883
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:15,300
it is very difficult to change your

884
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,980
cryptography algorithms if you do not

885
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:20,159
know where they are right

886
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,839
so what does that involve

887
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:23,639
you need to look at your data in transit

888
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:26,399
you need to monitor your public networks

889
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:28,560
right you need to be looking at you know

890
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,839
you can look at packets you can sniff

891
00:34:30,839 --> 00:34:33,780
them you can work out from TLS headers

892
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,460
what's going on

893
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:37,379
maybe you need to zoom in and you want

894
00:34:37,379 --> 00:34:38,820
to scan localhost and you need

895
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:40,859
agent-based models to actually work out

896
00:34:40,859 --> 00:34:42,719
on a more granular level what

897
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:45,119
applications are using what crypto

898
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:47,339
you need to check what crypto is not

899
00:34:47,339 --> 00:34:49,918
just being used but it's supported so

900
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:52,500
when you know again I'm using TLS as a

901
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:55,260
as a representative example here

902
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,480
but a client will provide a series of

903
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,940
ciphers that they support

904
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:02,820
and hopefully with an updated server it

905
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:05,339
will pick the best one however

906
00:35:05,339 --> 00:35:08,760
if a client supports some dodgy old

907
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,500
crypto

908
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,540
and another server is introduced into

909
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:13,800
the network

910
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:16,260
that is not updated as it should be you

911
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:19,980
may then start using cryptography which

912
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:21,300
does not meet the policies of your

913
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:22,619
organization

914
00:35:22,619 --> 00:35:24,480
you need to be looking closely at your

915
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,640
legacy systems some organizations have

916
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,920
servers running which are you know 20 30

917
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:31,440
years old and the reason they are still

918
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,520
doing this is because they are

919
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:35,040
extraordinarily difficult to update but

920
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,440
yet they perform important functions so

921
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,940
these things almost have to be done on a

922
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:41,160
case-by-case analysis

923
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,619
oh and yeah also data at rest I mean

924
00:35:43,619 --> 00:35:47,280
that's you know it goes without saying

925
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,020
the second point is that you need to

926
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:50,640
strategize you need to start coming up

927
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,740
with a plan

928
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:54,480
and to do this you need to think about

929
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:57,260
store now decrypt later

930
00:35:57,260 --> 00:36:00,060
what are going to be

931
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:01,680
the easiest systems for you to

932
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,839
transition and what are going to be the

933
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:06,000
most important and sensitive systems for

934
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,280
you to transition

935
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:10,200
I would suggest that you start with the

936
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,400
easiest ones that's all the most

937
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,380
sensitive

938
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,660
you want to build in crypto agility from

939
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:17,579
the ground up and think about this the

940
00:36:17,579 --> 00:36:19,320
entire way through the process because

941
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,660
for a start you're going to have to well

942
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:23,579
I would recommend

943
00:36:23,579 --> 00:36:25,859
that you use hybrid systems but maybe

944
00:36:25,859 --> 00:36:27,720
you won't want to use hybrid systems in

945
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,579
five or seven years and you want to drop

946
00:36:29,579 --> 00:36:31,920
those uh you know the the traditional

947
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,720
part

948
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:36,720
please do think about the whole you know

949
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:39,180
the whole future and building this this

950
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:41,760
new better architecture which needs

951
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,920
defining in and of itself

952
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,660
as you're going forwards and then

953
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:47,160
there's a whole uh you know the

954
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,320
authentication issues of okay if you're

955
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,880
going to be deploying cryptographic

956
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,339
Hardware in you know in these industrial

957
00:36:53,339 --> 00:36:55,859
control systems or in these vehicles or

958
00:36:55,859 --> 00:36:58,619
whatever it is think about what's the

959
00:36:58,619 --> 00:37:01,440
economic impact of having to push these

960
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:04,980
fixes later on down the line

961
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:06,720
the third point is that you're going to

962
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,540
need to trial your crypto

963
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:11,460
you want to be making sure that your

964
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:13,619
systems don't crumble because for a

965
00:37:13,619 --> 00:37:14,940
start if you're going to use hybrid

966
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:18,119
crypto then all of the pqc portion of it

967
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:20,400
is overhead because you're still keeping

968
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,920
the classical part

969
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:25,619
if you're going to try fancy new uh

970
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:28,619
crypto crypto agile architectures then

971
00:37:28,619 --> 00:37:30,180
you also want to make sure that those go

972
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:31,619
smoothly

973
00:37:31,619 --> 00:37:33,540
and then the final part is obviously to

974
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:35,040
execute

975
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,859
um and pat yourself on the back

976
00:37:37,859 --> 00:37:39,900
and if you follow those first three

977
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,220
recommendations

978
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:43,020
you'll have greater visibility of your

979
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:46,380
networks on an ongoing basis

980
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:48,599
you'll have greater autonomy over your

981
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:50,400
cryptography you'll be able to make your

982
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,680
own choices about what policies you want

983
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:55,140
to use in your networks and with your

984
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:56,640
data

985
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:59,099
you will have a more agile and easier to

986
00:37:59,099 --> 00:38:02,280
update Suite of algorithms and set of

987
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,800
Networks

988
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,839
and these first three points will result

989
00:38:06,839 --> 00:38:08,520
in you having

990
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:12,480
a much more qualitatively secure system

991
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,140
right

992
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:20,339
so one inventory two strategize three

993
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:25,520
trial it and four execute on it

994
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,660
so here's what I made earlier

995
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:32,460
that's a line from Blue Peter if anybody

996
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:33,780
used to watch that it's a British

997
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:35,960
program

998
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:39,480
we've been running a partnership with uh

999
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:42,839
with SoftBank and we wanted to basically

1000
00:38:42,839 --> 00:38:44,160
go through some of these things and work

1001
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,980
out how does this actually play you know

1002
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:49,320
we want to you know

1003
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:52,440
do what we're recommending and and so

1004
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,540
I'm going to show you what we did and I

1005
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,400
highly recommend everybody else goes off

1006
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,960
and starts doing this themselves

1007
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,460
we found a use case that was relevant to

1008
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:05,119
their business case

1009
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:07,680
we thought about an application where we

1010
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,780
where we had control over all of the

1011
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:11,520
crypto so that we didn't have to depend

1012
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,440
on you know third-party vendors we could

1013
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:16,380
we could mod it ourselves

1014
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:18,300
and we came up with mobile VPN because

1015
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:19,320
we were working with their

1016
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:22,260
telecommunications uh branch

1017
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:26,040
so we start off with a mobile VPN

1018
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:29,099
and then we thought about okay

1019
00:39:29,099 --> 00:39:31,380
what is it that we want uh that we want

1020
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:33,119
to analyze

1021
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:34,680
well there are different types of

1022
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,960
browsing behaviors and we tried to

1023
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,000
categorize these we thought well

1024
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,800
the main browsing activity falls into

1025
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,380
these buckets social media

1026
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:46,079
generic browsing online gaming and

1027
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:47,640
streaming and they all have different

1028
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:51,000
TLS profiles that means you know

1029
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,880
lengths of time before your cycling Keys

1030
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:57,359
session lengths frequencies of brand new

1031
00:39:57,359 --> 00:39:59,839
handshakes

1032
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:02,579
The Next Step was to work out what it is

1033
00:40:02,579 --> 00:40:05,280
that we actually want to measure

1034
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,320
to start off with we figured let's just

1035
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,720
try and get as much data as we possibly

1036
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,520
can and then we can work out what's

1037
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,660
meaningful

1038
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,339
what matters

1039
00:40:14,339 --> 00:40:16,200
so we want to look at the latency of the

1040
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,700
handshakes

1041
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:19,920
any kind of network statistics that are

1042
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,599
a proficient network engineer can come

1043
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:23,760
up with that that might matter

1044
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,560
we want to look at the bandwidth of the

1045
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:27,300
application that you're looking at

1046
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,339
you want to look at the CPU loads on the

1047
00:40:29,339 --> 00:40:31,800
on the clients and the servers

1048
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,359
you want to look at

1049
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:36,599
what's the proportion of connections

1050
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:38,460
that are you know that have successfully

1051
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:41,000
being made

1052
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,099
and then don't worry

1053
00:40:44,099 --> 00:40:45,420
um we're not going to be doing any too

1054
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:47,880
much graph watching today but this is

1055
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,200
just some like initial results you know

1056
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,359
we thought let's start by breaking stuff

1057
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:53,579
out by pqc Family do the results look

1058
00:40:53,579 --> 00:40:55,440
like they should do well on the left

1059
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,420
you've got like Communications the

1060
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:58,800
ordering looks you know pretty much

1061
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,200
pretty much sensible

1062
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,700
um on the right you've got latencies

1063
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:05,579
does that look sensible okay yeah

1064
00:41:05,579 --> 00:41:07,560
roughly let's zoom in a little bit

1065
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:09,480
further

1066
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:11,220
let's look at these distributions on a

1067
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:13,320
slightly more granular

1068
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:13,980
um

1069
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:16,140
on a slightly more granular level let's

1070
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,880
work out where we can where we can put

1071
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:20,040
99 percentiles

1072
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,900
this is still latency and Communications

1073
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:23,880
data

1074
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,800
we had a look at you know why don't we

1075
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,540
ramp stuff to failure like you know

1076
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:29,700
let's really push our networks and our

1077
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:32,400
systems and and figure out where does

1078
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,380
stuff break and we plotted sort of the

1079
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:37,140
connection set success rate uh against

1080
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:39,240
you know the actual raw number of

1081
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:40,920
connections started

1082
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:43,140
and we found that you know actually for

1083
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:45,060
example structured lattices did really

1084
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:46,980
well up until about you know 150 000

1085
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:48,680
connections a second being initiated

1086
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:51,180
maintaining over 90 percent but

1087
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:52,560
something like unstructured lattices

1088
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,420
which is a bit more of a conservative

1089
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:56,880
option well it might do okay at the

1090
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,260
beginning but they really tail off

1091
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:00,420
pretty fast and you know it's a similar

1092
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:02,460
story for isogenies

1093
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:05,700
so some of this stuff you know sounds

1094
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:09,119
like it should be straightforwards we

1095
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:11,280
know that some systems perform worse and

1096
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:14,760
certain metrics but the reality is you

1097
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,859
need to know what this means for your

1098
00:42:16,859 --> 00:42:19,079
systems before you can go around

1099
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:21,540
updating them

1100
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:23,220
and so

1101
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:25,619
SoftBank have done it

1102
00:42:25,619 --> 00:42:26,460
um

1103
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:28,980
and so can you

1104
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:32,099
so in the first part I I sort of tried

1105
00:42:32,099 --> 00:42:34,500
to draw together the the pqc timelines

1106
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:36,540
which are a little bit more firm a

1107
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:38,160
little bit more concrete the quantum

1108
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:39,900
computer timelines

1109
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:42,540
which you know like there there are more

1110
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:44,400
opinions on Quantum Computing timelines

1111
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:48,240
than there are quantum Computing experts

1112
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,980
we had a look at little look at you know

1113
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:52,320
what what is the US government

1114
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:55,020
doing are they making the Right Moves

1115
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:57,780
how can organizations think about and

1116
00:42:57,780 --> 00:43:02,599
and use them as a you know as a beacon

1117
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:04,319
our

1118
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:07,260
you know our own recommendations for you

1119
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:08,339
to follow because it's all very well

1120
00:43:08,339 --> 00:43:09,900
summarizing this stuff but actually what

1121
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:11,339
people need

1122
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:14,640
is concrete advice to help them begin

1123
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:17,099
moving forwards we're not suggesting the

1124
00:43:17,099 --> 00:43:18,540
cyber security teams just drop what

1125
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:19,500
they're doing and start working

1126
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:21,660
full-time on the migration but they need

1127
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:23,579
to start thinking about this they need

1128
00:43:23,579 --> 00:43:25,800
to be people in the organization whose

1129
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:28,099
problem it is and who need to start

1130
00:43:28,099 --> 00:43:30,119
proselytizing to the rest of the

1131
00:43:30,119 --> 00:43:31,859
organization and letting them know about

1132
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:33,240
this stuff

1133
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:35,400
that's one of the big takeaways that

1134
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:36,720
we've learned from working with our

1135
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:39,119
colleagues at SoftBank which is that

1136
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:40,260
these guys really want to know about

1137
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:42,180
this stuff they want uh they want to

1138
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:44,099
learn what what it means to be Quantum

1139
00:43:44,099 --> 00:43:45,480
resistant they want to know how does

1140
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:47,520
crypt analysis work they've been asking

1141
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,800
us non-stop how do we know that it's

1142
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,780
secure and we keep being like well there

1143
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:54,720
are no attacks on it yet and then um you

1144
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:57,180
know but but Believers it's secure you

1145
00:43:57,180 --> 00:43:59,099
know nista looking at it and then

1146
00:43:59,099 --> 00:44:01,140
obviously you know site gets broken and

1147
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:04,020
we go well yeah unfortunately that's

1148
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:06,359
cryptography for you

1149
00:44:06,359 --> 00:44:08,280
but these guys are learning about it

1150
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:10,079
they're they're teaching the you know

1151
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:11,220
the other people in their organizations

1152
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:13,920
about it it's super useful

1153
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:16,260
and so they've started

1154
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:20,400
we've started and you can too so

1155
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,319
please do take a look at the the paper

1156
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:24,420
that we put out uh which is meant to be

1157
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:27,900
like a concise uh summary of all the

1158
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:29,099
different things that are going on

1159
00:44:29,099 --> 00:44:31,079
across the you know these two areas of

1160
00:44:31,079 --> 00:44:33,839
incredibly cool deep technology

1161
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:36,480
and and yeah take it back and share it

1162
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:40,340
with people and uh yeah thank you

1163
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:50,409
[Applause]
