1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:05,359
hey everyone count zero here welcome to

2
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:07,680
blue team village at def con this is uh

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,840
project obsidian and today we're gonna

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,840
talk about incident response

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,599
specifically final reporting made

6
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:16,599
exciting

7
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,880
really this is a way to discuss why this

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,640
dreaded yet critical part of incident

9
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:23,840
handling

10
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,000
is so important to the overall process

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,560
of incident response

12
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,079
so with that let's talk a little bit

13
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:34,480
about the incident response lifecycle

14
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,360
um

15
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,200
you've probably seen this if you've got

16
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,680
any of the other talks or pre-recorded

17
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,399
videos content for project obsidian so

18
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:43,280
far

19
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,960
but just kind of letting you all know

20
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,320
where we are in the incident response

21
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,840
life cycle

22
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,200
final reporting falls into the post

23
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,440
incident activities so that's where we

24
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,520
are now this is where we're going to

25
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,280
wrap up

26
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,160
the

27
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,760
information that we've gathered

28
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,120
throughout the

29
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,559
incident and the activities that have

30
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:03,520
been performed as well as making sure

31
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,320
that we successfully communicate

32
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,479
the

33
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,760
needs

34
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,960
and any after action activities that

35
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,600
need to occur

36
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,280
so what actually goes into a final

37
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,280
report

38
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,720
so these are some of the items that

39
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,759
we'll cover in this discussion these are

40
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:28,000
some of the key components to be sure

41
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,840
you include

42
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,479
not only for your executive levels or

43
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,640
your legal team who needs to understand

44
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,640
what occurred and what the business

45
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,520
impact may have been but also to

46
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,280
cover some of the technical details as

47
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,200
well so that your peer groups and

48
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,360
detection engineering with forensics

49
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,920
anything of that nature can be

50
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,360
used to

51
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,560
improve

52
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,560
the uh security of your organization

53
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,560
so we'll talk through a little bit of

54
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,799
each of these items and how they relate

55
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:01,600
to

56
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,840
what goes into our final report so the

57
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,200
executive summary detection analysis

58
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,239
we'll talk a little bit about

59
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,878
containment actions eradication recovery

60
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:14,160
and then finally lessons learned

61
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,280
so when it comes to the executive

62
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,879
summary portion

63
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,400
this is the

64
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,200
the hook this is what you use to get the

65
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,360
attention uh and this is often what gets

66
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,920
seen most uh by your executive

67
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,080
leadership teams uh you know the folks

68
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,840
who are controlling the purse strings so

69
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,599
that's how you

70
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,599
get some help if you need help in order

71
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,080
to deploy new products or get some

72
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,200
staffing

73
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,760
or make some changes to the security

74
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,720
posture of the environment

75
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,800
so a key thing here is to understand for

76
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,000
each one of the sections of final

77
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,040
reporting what is the audience

78
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,480
what are the components that go into

79
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,840
that

80
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,760
and how do you really

81
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,560
successfully communicate those needs

82
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,560
so for the executive summary portion of

83
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,720
a final report uh your audience is the

84
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,840
executive leadership team primarily

85
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,920
so you really want to make sure that you

86
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,080
write to to that level and help them to

87
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,480
understand what happened

88
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,519
in

89
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,599
straightforward and simple terms

90
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,120
so that they can communicate that

91
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,120
successfully and make informed decisions

92
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,000
so for the components that go into this

93
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,599
you want to

94
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:32,959
ensure that your audience understands

95
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,200
what you're trying to relate

96
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,760
and then relate that back to your you

97
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,080
know either business operations or or

98
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,599
functions depending on what the

99
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,080
organization is

100
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,840
that will tie your

101
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,519
incident and your

102
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,920
investigation into you know business

103
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,280
language or into legal language that is

104
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,280
consumable by those folks who are making

105
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,439
those decisions at the highest level of

106
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,599
the organization

107
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,640
another key component to the executive

108
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,879
summary is a high level timeline

109
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,120
the gory details you can save those for

110
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,319
later in the

111
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,560
report to communicate with your peer

112
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,399
team so that you can build detections

113
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,399
and you know other actions that may need

114
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,918
to happen at that level

115
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,240
but for this initial timeline you really

116
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,199
just want to go over the high points

117
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,800
so the leadership team understands what

118
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,600
happened and when this gives them the

119
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,400
understanding of

120
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,720
how to communicate potentially even with

121
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,160
the media depending on what is in play

122
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,080
or with you know

123
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,960
external legal teams as well so this is

124
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,360
a critical piece to to highlight that

125
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,440
time frame and the actions that took

126
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,720
place during that time frame to show

127
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,000
when

128
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,280
something occurred

129
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,160
what actions were taken to

130
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,560
mitigate or contain that risk and then

131
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,840
finally

132
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,759
what was done to

133
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,039
close the entire loop

134
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,840
from there you'll move into some

135
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,719
recommendations

136
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,039
it's good to define these

137
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:17,199
recommendations in both strategic and

138
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:19,600
tactical levels so at the strategic

139
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,680
level you're really going to communicate

140
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,759
with them about

141
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:27,280
large uh large changes or potentially

142
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,479
expensive changes depending on the

143
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,560
recommendation that comes to to mind

144
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,280
when

145
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,600
the incident is investigated

146
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,560
for the tactical tasks

147
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,560
looking at some simple things that may

148
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,720
be able to impact the security posture

149
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,479
maybe it's as simple as

150
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:46,800
if we just change the event log sizes

151
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,320
for our security log we would have had

152
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,880
more data to see what happened

153
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,159
during the course of this incident

154
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,080
or some simple um

155
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,160
actions that could take place on the

156
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,199
particular things that are being

157
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,440
recorded in your event logs so keep in

158
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,520
mind those things and try to define

159
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,000
those in a level of priority that is

160
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,680
understood by the executive leadership

161
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,840
team

162
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,199
and as you can see here some of the

163
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:20,000
things that you want to put into

164
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,199
particularly maybe an appendix or even a

165
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,840
separate document is like the full

166
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,080
timeline as well as the

167
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,440
indicators of compromise or iocs

168
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,919
so moving into the detection analysis

169
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:37,280
phase um

170
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,360
whenever you talk about this in your

171
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,759
final report think about your audience

172
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,479
as the technical leaders so maybe your

173
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,680
i.t

174
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,000
systems administrator leaders or network

175
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,680
administration leaders

176
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,599
and also your peers in your security

177
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:53,199
teams

178
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:54,639
it's the components that come into this

179
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:56,319
detections so

180
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:57,599
what

181
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:00,240
was detected and how did that come about

182
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,319
um you know was this a user that

183
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,800
reported a phishing email was this an

184
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,880
external report that came about from a

185
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,840
vulnerability that's new in the wild

186
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,120
or was it an alarm from your sim

187
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,280
so understanding how the detection

188
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,479
occurred

189
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,800
or if no detection occurred and you got

190
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,120
it reported in some other fashion that

191
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,160
all feeds into that final reporting and

192
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,240
betterment of your program so you can

193
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,240
take the information and say

194
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,919
we didn't get an alarm for this but

195
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:32,319
could we have and then you

196
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,599
are able to build on that

197
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,479
finally the analysis portion so

198
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,400
documenting the actions that are taken

199
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,160
and again you'll hear us talk about this

200
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,840
especially in the uh you know incident

201
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,560
response incident handling uh

202
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,720
part of the project obsidian

203
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,960
task that we've taken on is looking at

204
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,800
how

205
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,879
important documentation is for all of

206
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:59,440
these different facets of incident

207
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,720
response and digital forensics

208
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,560
so in the detection analysis portion of

209
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,560
this specifically you want to document

210
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,400
any of the actions that were taken how

211
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,160
did you dig in did you look at event

212
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,800
logs did you look at firewall logs did

213
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,039
you pull triage from a system and work

214
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:16,800
with the forensics team in order to find

215
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,080
out what occurred

216
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:18,879
in

217
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,960
user browsing history so there are a lot

218
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,400
of different actions that can be taken

219
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,479
during the course of an incident

220
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,080
especially with the investigation

221
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,639
portions so taking that into account and

222
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,400
truly documenting that well is a

223
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,159
critical piece and this is where you

224
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:35,760
communicate exactly what happened

225
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,159
another important thing to list during

226
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,000
this as we talked a little bit in the

227
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,399
detections portion opportunities so what

228
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,000
could have been done better

229
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,440
and what would have helped

230
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,040
with your detections next time

231
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:50,959
as far as what could have been done

232
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:52,959
better that could be process you know

233
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:54,880
that could be

234
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,959
better documentation on using some of

235
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:59,440
the tools that you have available

236
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,240
another thing to keep in mind is you

237
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,600
know detections so maybe your team is

238
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,680
the operations team and you're

239
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,839
responsible for the initial triage of

240
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:11,920
the alert but you've got a detection

241
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,760
engineering team that you can rely on or

242
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,399
some security engineering folks that can

243
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,160
help you build better detections in your

244
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,760
sim or in some other reporting or

245
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,440
alarming tool that you've got

246
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,120
so keep that in mind document those

247
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,959
things and it's really important to

248
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:26,560
write those down as you're going through

249
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,680
the process so keep a note of that while

250
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,600
you're doing your

251
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,360
investigation and that really helps

252
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,519
whenever you come back into

253
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,200
this final reporting phase you've got

254
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,360
those notes taken you've been

255
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,880
documenting what you've gone through and

256
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,399
what your thought process was at the

257
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:46,560
time so you don't lose that chain

258
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,000
so we'll move on

259
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,200
into

260
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,360
the containment phase

261
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,800
so when we've moved into the containment

262
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,920
phase for final reporting again you're

263
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,519
still going to be talking mostly to your

264
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:00,000
technical leaders and your peers

265
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,760
so this is the area that you want to

266
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,720
specifically discuss how did you stop

267
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,920
the bleeding

268
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,600
so how did you

269
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,600
take that action did you lock accounts

270
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,600
did you isolate some hosts or some

271
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,320
network segments

272
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,640
being able to define the exact actions

273
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,480
that you took and when

274
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,399
uh is an important part of understanding

275
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,880
the containment so this again feeds

276
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,680
directly into those timelines and that

277
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,360
critical communication that goes all the

278
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,200
way up to the executive leadership team

279
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,480
and as always

280
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,480
talk about any opportunities here what

281
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,360
would have helped in the future to stop

282
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,360
the bleeding faster how could you have

283
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,760
contained this more quickly

284
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,480
and whether or not that is a limited

285
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,839
pool of

286
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:50,000
people resources or if there are some

287
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,760
missing tooling in your environment or

288
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,760
missing logging in your environment

289
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,279
these are all of those opportunities

290
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,560
that you take

291
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,720
to communicate to the folks that hold

292
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,279
the purse strings who control the money

293
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:02,800
to

294
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,560
help them understand

295
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,360
we could have done better if we had

296
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,720
x y or z

297
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,240
and y

298
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,079
so putting that into that language

299
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:13,760
putting that into the business terms

300
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,160
putting that into impact is a critical

301
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,839
piece of this and understanding how

302
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:22,320
these containment actions take place is

303
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,200
a good way to translate that and again

304
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,200
this gets your technical leadership on

305
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,200
par with you and helps them understand

306
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,160
what you need to do your job and then

307
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,160
they can help to push that message up to

308
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,439
the executive leadership team

309
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,200
so moving into eradication

310
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,120
so after we've contained the incident of

311
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,079
course we're going to move into

312
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,399
eradication how do we get the adversary

313
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,560
out of the environment

314
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,720
again this audience is going to be

315
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,279
technical in nature

316
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,920
documenting your actions

317
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,000
continues to remain the critical piece

318
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,839
here so

319
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:05,440
documenting how the adversary was

320
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,079
removed from the environment

321
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:11,279
so did you need to reset passwords

322
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:12,800
did you need to

323
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,279
rebuild the system and how were those

324
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,279
actions taken

325
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,959
looking into that a little more deeply

326
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:20,320
for these opportunities in the

327
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,160
eradication phase and how you would

328
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,560
communicate needs there or opportunities

329
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,480
there

330
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,600
again

331
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,920
do you have a solid process in place to

332
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,240
rebuild systems do you test your backup

333
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,320
so that you know you could go back to

334
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,120
a pre-adversary action backup and

335
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,000
restore that and everything works fine

336
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,360
these are the critical pieces that you

337
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,600
can learn and you follow through with

338
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,360
the closure of this incident when this

339
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,360
final reporting phase to understand how

340
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,279
those actions need to be adjusted if

341
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,360
they do or if they work very well that's

342
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,120
also important to highlight so

343
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,959
highlighting your wins and highlighting

344
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:56,720
your opportunities

345
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,760
is a

346
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,519
critical piece of this reporting

347
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,920
function

348
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,399
and as always we'll continue to talk

349
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,320
about thinking through and thinking

350
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,680
through the future what are your

351
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,320
limitations what are your successes and

352
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,880
communicating that back up the chain

353
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,279
constantly so it can highlight what

354
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:17,200
you've done well and what you need help

355
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,320
with

356
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,480
as well as helping the leadership

357
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,079
communicate that again up to that

358
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,880
executive level

359
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,760
so finally we'll move into the

360
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,360
recovery phase and in recovery this is

361
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,800
really where we're getting back to

362
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,040
getting back to business

363
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,959
how do we get the organization back up

364
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,040
and running and

365
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,959
how did we test that those things are

366
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,800
actually functioning so this is where

367
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,560
you can communicate all of the things

368
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,680
that went well and the things that were

369
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,480
of issue again with this recovery phase

370
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,639
so this is the important part to help

371
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:00,800
the business understand here's what we

372
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,160
did here's how we got you back up and

373
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,760
running and here's how we're now serving

374
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,440
our customers or our constituents you

375
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,279
know whomever it is that this particular

376
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:10,399
organization serves

377
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,160
what you'll see is a lot of these phases

378
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,639
we have similar types of

379
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:20,240
details with the actions taken and the

380
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,360
opportunities and the reason that we

381
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,519
suggest breaking them down into the

382
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:27,360
incident response lifecycle pieces is

383
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,600
really to help you understand at each

384
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,440
one of these levels how this is

385
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,199
occurring and to make it easy to

386
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:35,760
communicate across the board with the

387
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,440
different functions that may occur in

388
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,040
the in the environment so you may be a

389
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,040
small team and everyone does all of

390
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,240
these things together in the small

391
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,920
security operations team or you may be a

392
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,680
very large team and you've got these

393
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,360
different components that can

394
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,519
take place so maybe you've got a malware

395
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:51,600
engineering team that can help you dig

396
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,600
deep into that or a service

397
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,920
or if you've got a forensics team that

398
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,880
really focuses on the deep dive

399
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,079
so keeping that in mind and

400
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:03,199
understanding how to communicate through

401
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:04,959
this final reporting process is a

402
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,920
critical piece of that

403
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,440
supposed to that activities so this is

404
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,839
where we are

405
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,959
in our incident response life cycle

406
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:17,839
so

407
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:20,079
this phase really

408
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:22,079
goes through not only your executives

409
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:23,279
but your technical leaders and your

410
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:25,120
peers as well so

411
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,360
this is where we're talking about

412
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,839
final reporting today looking at

413
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:31,199
all of the above

414
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:33,839
wrapping that all up into a an easy to

415
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:34,959
consume

416
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:36,160
document

417
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,000
potentially even a presentation

418
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,800
and being able to pass that along and

419
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,560
develop those

420
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,639
strategies and tactical recommendations

421
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,839
that may need to occur

422
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,600
with that we'll talk a little bit about

423
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,440
some reporting pro tips

424
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:00,880
so use a template

425
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,759
and

426
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:03,120
one of the things that we've got

427
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,600
developed is some some basic templates

428
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,120
for a lot of these different functions

429
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,279
so you may have already seen a

430
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:12,240
template on scoping or note taking

431
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,480
previous prior to this presentation

432
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,560
and the reason that we suggest templates

433
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,600
is

434
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,680
it ensures consistency and completeness

435
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,560
so

436
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,040
why does that matter so consistency is

437
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,320
important

438
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,800
to your

439
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,720
peer groups and your leadership team

440
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,480
they start to understand here's what to

441
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,920
expect i know where to look for the

442
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,759
important parts that

443
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:38,560
you know i need to focus on if it's that

444
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,160
summary in that timeline for your

445
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,920
executive leadership team they know hey

446
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,000
here's where i go and i see

447
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,240
what happened when and here's a quick

448
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,920
timeline so i can easily communicate

449
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,360
this

450
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,959
and completeness

451
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:52,480
this way you don't miss something so if

452
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,279
you've got all of these you know fields

453
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:56,880
or or

454
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,880
sections in your final report template

455
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,880
that you know need to be completed you

456
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,160
can take a look at that and it gives you

457
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,640
that opportunity to think have i done

458
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,400
this did i think through this part of

459
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,640
this final report and put that into

460
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,480
action

461
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,400
another important piece is you know just

462
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,079
the facts

463
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,079
in

464
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,480
incident response we really must

465
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,599
concentrate on understanding

466
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,679
what we know and what we don't know

467
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:24,640
and

468
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,679
trying to move from that hypothesis of

469
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,440
what happened into what we can actually

470
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,600
prove that happened

471
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,520
there are going to be times whenever you

472
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,200
don't have all of the data available to

473
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,320
prove that

474
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,000
so stick with what you can prove and

475
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,679
then highlight the things that you can't

476
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:41,120
prove

477
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,559
and why

478
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:46,880
that's where we come in with our

479
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,039
opportunities to improve

480
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:50,960
what's happening and what's uh what

481
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,480
what's happening and what processes we

482
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,039
use in the environment

483
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:56,799
as you're going through

484
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:59,120
your investigation

485
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,440
whether you're reversing malware or if

486
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,440
you are on the forensics team or if

487
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,039
you're on the operations team on the

488
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:06,960
front lines

489
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,760
write out your findings in report format

490
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,280
make good complete sentences

491
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,400
drop your thoughts into those notes

492
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,640
for

493
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:21,120
the steps that you're taking during the

494
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,559
course of the incident

495
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,080
this comes in

496
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,080
very very handy whenever you get to the

497
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,559
final reporting phase because then

498
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:29,840
you're mostly

499
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,000
copy paste and

500
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,760
you know do a little bit of wordsmithing

501
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,760
to make it read better

502
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,720
or you know read more clearly and

503
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,760
you're good

504
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,520
it really helps you to solve any of

505
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,679
those cases where if you've been working

506
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:45,840
on a particular thing for a while

507
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,679
you finally figured out the right you

508
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,280
know syntax to find what you were trying

509
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,559
to hunt for

510
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:51,840
and

511
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,360
you don't take good notes about it you

512
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,840
don't really show your work and then

513
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,919
your peer group

514
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,000
can't replicate the actions that you

515
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,400
took and so then it becomes harder to

516
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,160
define that and if you've forgotten

517
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,320
about it because you've you know been

518
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,080
working for a long time and have slept

519
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,280
since then and then that kind of went

520
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,480
away in your brain

521
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,919
so

522
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:14,160
keeping those those notes writing them

523
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,080
out in in report format so that you can

524
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,240
easily communicate those to others

525
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,640
will help sync that into your brain as

526
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,840
well as

527
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,760
translate that data over to something

528
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,520
that someone else can use

529
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,360
this can become a critical piece if

530
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,039
you're talking about building a new

531
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:31,280
detection so if you have found a way to

532
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,559
find

533
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:34,960
the evil and you can communicate that

534
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,640
over to the detection engineering team

535
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,480
or if you are the detection engineering

536
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,160
team and you need to do that later after

537
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,559
you finish this incident response action

538
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,400
you can translate that and remember what

539
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,720
happened

540
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,080
finally

541
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,160
normalize your time and map to a

542
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,360
framework so normalizing your time utc

543
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,919
utc utc utc it's the only time zone it's

544
00:19:57,919 --> 00:19:59,120
the only time zone we don't need to

545
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,000
worry about any other time zones um

546
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,960
the reason this is so critical is uh

547
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,600
whenever you're trying to

548
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,280
put together a timeline so everyone

549
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,039
understands what's happening you've got

550
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:12,320
to understand

551
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,080
where your data sources are coming from

552
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,919
for the investigation

553
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:19,200
and what happened during those periods

554
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,280
well if you're trying to chain

555
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,200
events together and you've got something

556
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,679
that is in pacific time and you've got

557
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:28,480
firewall logs that are in utc time and

558
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,080
you've got server logs that are in

559
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,039
eastern time in the us then

560
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:34,799
how do you map all those things together

561
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,880
and if you're trying to normalize that

562
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,919
into a sim

563
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:42,559
maybe there's challenges there too and

564
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:44,480
you've got issues with

565
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,240
you know communicating what happened

566
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,679
when and trying to follow the chain of

567
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:48,640
evidence

568
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,320
so really think about trying to get

569
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,159
everything converted into utc and then

570
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:53,760
it's okay to display in different time

571
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,000
formats but when you're doing the

572
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,200
incident analysis and you're doing

573
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,880
forensics

574
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,880
try to stick with utc and try to get

575
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,400
everything converted to utc if you can

576
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,679
mapping to a framework helps you

577
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:09,919
communicate the bits and pieces a little

578
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:12,640
easier as well so if you're focused on

579
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,480
you know nist or if you're focused on

580
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,559
miter attack framework

581
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,799
stick to that learn that and use that

582
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:20,480
it'll help with the

583
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,559
clarity of communication amongst all of

584
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,559
your different teams

585
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:26,400
so those are some critical bits and some

586
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,440
some pro tips for reporting

587
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:33,679
so finally

588
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:36,720
let's take a look at uh just a small

589
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,039
snippet of a final report and what we'll

590
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:41,520
do is show off the

591
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,440
basic template that you know will be

592
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:47,039
provided as well and help

593
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,880
help you understand you know some of the

594
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,480
some of the look and feel for that and

595
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,360
then hopefully you can take this and

596
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:57,799
use it for your own needs

597
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,639
so now we can see

598
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,640
this demo template and so what we've

599
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,280
provided is just a basic word document

600
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,039
to

601
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:16,480
highlight some of the sections that

602
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,240
might be critical to to your

603
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,320
investigation and putting that

604
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,720
information together

605
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,559
this happens to be in a microsoft word

606
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:27,520
format a docx format but this also works

607
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,360
in things like libreoffice as well

608
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:33,280
so if we scroll on down we'll take a

609
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:37,039
look at a basic incident summary

610
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:38,720
and this is

611
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,640
just a little bit of detail for kill

612
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,679
chain 3 which is mostly being discussed

613
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:44,559
during

614
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:47,280
saturday here at defcon

615
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,280
and so we'll look at you know what we've

616
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,880
done with this

617
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,799
very broad uh summary so far again this

618
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:57,120
isn't fully complete that's on purpose

619
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,400
so that you can have fun with the data

620
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,799
that's going to be released as well

621
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:02,559
but it kind of starts to give you an

622
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:05,039
understanding of how to

623
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:06,480
well communicate

624
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,919
some of this information for your

625
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:09,919
executive leadership team so we've got

626
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:12,640
some specifics on a date um we've got

627
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,480
some specifics that say there was an

628
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,039
alert that was triggered uh and you know

629
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,240
maybe

630
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,080
the security investment was a security

631
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,480
investigation was delayed and why

632
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,039
so this can be used to communicate back

633
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:27,039
to your teams to say hey

634
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:28,960
you know we had some we had some trouble

635
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,960
getting to this alert because we had

636
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,159
some other alerts that were stacked up

637
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:34,159
ahead of time do you have some issues

638
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:36,240
with people do you have some issues with

639
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,840
um

640
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,320
you know resourcing or or is it related

641
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,640
to uh you know cleaning up some of your

642
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,720
alerting so again do you need some

643
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,840
people to be able to

644
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,440
process those alerts more quickly

645
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,080
again we

646
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,480
throw the details out quickly at the top

647
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,760
what was happened

648
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,600
you know system was compromised here's

649
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,120
the time that it happened we've

650
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,200
confirmed data exfiltration here's the

651
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,559
time that we believe that occurred

652
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,880
and also a few more of the technical

653
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,400
aspects of

654
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,400
what

655
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,600
happened during the course of the

656
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,440
investigation and the course of the

657
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,360
incident and then some of the actions

658
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,760
that were taken to

659
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,919
contain that so here we see we've

660
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:23,520
blocked some network access we've done

661
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,279
some other things to to kind of stop

662
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:26,559
that bleeding

663
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:28,159
and then

664
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:30,720
giving them some tidbits on you know why

665
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,480
did this happen what are some things

666
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,159
that we could have done to

667
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:36,720
better protect this in this case we see

668
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,799
well it seems to be this is a password

669
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:41,840
spray on some internet exposed systems

670
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,039
and the fact that we didn't have

671
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:44,720
multi-factor authentication rolled out

672
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,279
to our end users

673
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:49,039
there was no

674
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:50,799
second layer of security kind of

675
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:52,400
protecting those accounts so the

676
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,120
adversary was able to get in

677
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,440
and we're going to kind of wrap up with

678
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,919
you know what are the

679
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:01,520
actions that need to be taken in this

680
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,840
instance we're saying you know what we

681
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,840
we can't trust our active directory any

682
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,679
longer due to what happened here so

683
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:09,279
we're going to have to you know rebuild

684
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:12,480
this and make sure to throw out some

685
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,360
you know

686
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,440
estimates for this looks like it's going

687
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,120
to take us you know a couple of weeks so

688
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,679
we're saying 14 days and

689
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:22,159
what does that mean to our you know

690
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:23,840
users so maybe office email is going to

691
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,400
be impacted for a while so

692
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,200
um

693
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,120
you know in in our instance fortunately

694
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,200
we've got the company website maybe was

695
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,919
hosted off-site so that's not impacted

696
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:35,279
right now because it wasn't connected

697
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:37,919
into our active directory so we can you

698
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:39,520
know post some messages up there to let

699
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,600
customers know hey we're going to be

700
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,200
delayed for a little while and getting

701
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,279
back to you on some of these actions or

702
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:46,720
some of these you know business

703
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,559
functions that we need to do so this

704
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:50,400
just kind of gives a quick highlight of

705
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,960
you know using this template and

706
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,440
and putting some things together

707
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,600
um some of the other items that you can

708
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,240
see here so we've got a call out to the

709
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,799
timeline so if you look at the incident

710
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:04,559
tracking you know spreadsheet that's

711
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:06,640
going to be thrown out along with some

712
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,679
of those other templates that we're

713
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:10,720
providing as part of this project

714
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,400
you can type that and tie that into here

715
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,000
so you can put your

716
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,440
you know detailed timeline you can put

717
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,080
like the summary timeline and throw

718
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,480
these contents into this final report to

719
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,760
make that easy to discuss

720
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,840
another option uh or another item that

721
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,919
we want to cover is the adversary

722
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,480
actions and here we're we're mapping to

723
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,840
you know the miter attack framework and

724
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,400
we're calling out some of those ttps

725
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,919
again this makes that cross

726
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:37,760
communication amongst the teams and also

727
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,000
amongst you know peers out in industry a

728
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,080
lot easier and a lot simpler so they

729
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,480
understand um

730
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,080
the actions that were taken and what

731
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,039
happened

732
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:48,880
so that just gives a rough idea of some

733
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,720
of the template actions that we've got

734
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,440
in play and as always you know use some

735
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,480
good headers use some good

736
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:59,600
incident report

737
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,480
contents so that way your executive

738
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,679
teams and your technical leadership

739
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:05,360
teams can click through this and you can

740
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,320
update this as a field in word or if

741
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,840
you've got

742
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,279
something like libreoffice as well this

743
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:12,960
comes in as an index and again the

744
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,720
update process is very similar

745
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,039
so with that we'll be wrapping up this

746
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:20,960
discussion shortly so we'll move back

747
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,080
into the presentation

748
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,880
so wrapping up with your recommendations

749
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,919
again talking about strategic uh versus

750
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:35,200
tactical

751
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,880
and making sure that you highlight those

752
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,159
quick wins

753
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:40,399
so strategic

754
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:43,360
in this case um if we're talking about

755
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,520
you know multi-factor authentication

756
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,559
that may not be a simple um

757
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:52,320
to execute a thing in your environment

758
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,520
there's

759
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,520
a lot that goes into that as far as you

760
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,159
know cost and implementation and you

761
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:00,000
know what systems may or may not work

762
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,919
with mfa

763
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:03,440
looking at anything that is policy

764
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,760
change related

765
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,720
again that's a bigger picture item that

766
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,320
the executive leadership team needs to

767
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,080
take into account uh you know there may

768
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,840
be legal implications there may be

769
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:17,760
um staffing implications that come into

770
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,080
policy changes on how things might occur

771
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,559
during the

772
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,039
setup of your security program and

773
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:27,120
finally staffing

774
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,520
staffing often is something that is tied

775
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,760
directly to budget because it has to be

776
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,679
paid for somehow and so that usually

777
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:35,520
ends up falling into that staffing or

778
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,679
that strategic portion of your

779
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:39,919
recommendations

780
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:42,000
just a quick hint on this uh you know

781
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,760
tactical recommendation so talking about

782
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,200
enhanced logging

783
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,559
if you've got a windows environment that

784
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:48,640
could be as simple as

785
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,960
starting to test deploying sysmon on

786
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,440
systems again it's something that's you

787
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,640
know free and is potentially low cost to

788
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,240
implement and manage depending on how

789
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,399
your system is set up or it could be as

790
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:02,960
simple as updating your gpos for your

791
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,440
windows hosts to enhance the logging

792
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,039
that's already built into the operating

793
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:08,559
system

794
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:10,399
again highlighting these quick wins in

795
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:12,880
this communication for the final report

796
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,240
is key

797
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,120
so that your technical leaders and your

798
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,720
executive leaders understand that you're

799
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,039
thinking forward about how to better the

800
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:24,000
environment and communicating that well

801
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,399
for them to understand and take action

802
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,360
and with that thank you very much for

803
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:34,080
your time we truly appreciate it and we

804
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,080
hope to see you in the blue team village

805
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:39,200
discord and you can jump in the discord

806
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,600
and ask lots and lots of questions uh

807
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,960
regarding project obsidian and again

808
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,039
the data sets that we've used to build

809
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:47,919
this

810
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:51,440
training content and these templates um

811
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,840
are going to be made available to you to

812
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,960
use at your discretion and hopefully

813
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,279
you'll learn some some things and be

814
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:01,440
able to implement and

815
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:06,200
better your security posture thank you
