1
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:05,240
hello everyone this is Wes Lambert um

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:07,379
speaking with you today talking about

3
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:10,740
creating a velociraptor collector uh if

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,179
you haven't heard of velociraptor

5
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:14,639
already it is an excellent endpoint

6
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,180
visibility tool used for host monitoring

7
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,300
host forensics

8
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:23,100
lots of lots of different different ways

9
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,740
it can be used threat hunting just a

10
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:27,420
great tool overall for that so we're

11
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,039
going to be talking about how to create

12
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,920
that dedicated offline collector so that

13
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,860
we can go over to endpoints and then

14
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,719
collect those forensic artifacts that

15
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,219
we're looking to collect

16
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:40,200
okay so without further Ado we'll go

17
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,300
ahead and get started with that

18
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,879
and just a brief overview here we'll

19
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,340
talk about why we might want to create

20
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:48,660
an offline collector and then we're just

21
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:50,280
going to go through the various steps of

22
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,680
creating that collector and then getting

23
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,800
the data that we're looking for

24
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,500
so typically we'll create an offline

25
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,800
collector whenever it well it could be a

26
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,019
couple situations so we might have

27
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:06,240
isolated networks uh networks that we

28
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,920
don't have access to from our

29
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,020
Velociraptor server that we maintain on

30
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:12,299
a dedicated host so maybe agents

31
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:13,920
wouldn't be able to communicate with

32
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,500
that server per se

33
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:18,420
or maybe we can't install local services

34
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,759
on those boxes or we don't have the

35
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:23,460
ability to you know we don't want to or

36
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,020
maybe we have customer environments

37
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:26,400
where we don't have architecture we

38
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,799
don't have Velociraptor stood up and we

39
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,259
don't have a client server uh kind of

40
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:33,900
architecture this is where we would come

41
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,600
in and create this offline collector and

42
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,340
then we can give it to our instant

43
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,500
responders and then have them go run

44
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,259
that on the machines in our isolated

45
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:44,460
networks or in those customer

46
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:48,000
environments so this is usually the the

47
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,920
main reason why we would want to create

48
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,000
this type of collector

49
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,320
now as far as actually creating the

50
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,880
collector there's going to be a few

51
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,619
different steps that we have to go

52
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:01,320
through so a lot of this is documented

53
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,159
very heavily and very well on the

54
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:08,280
Velociraptor docs site here if you go to

55
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,378
it'll be under triage and acquisition

56
00:02:10,378 --> 00:02:14,220
here and then scrolling down to offline

57
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,140
collections right here there's a great

58
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,420
section on how we can do that here and

59
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:19,560
I'm going to walk through some of this

60
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,200
right now

61
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,319
so we have a velociraptor server stood

62
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:28,500
up here just uh basically one client

63
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,260
joined to the server its name is VR PRD

64
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,060
and what we're going to do here is

65
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:35,160
create that offline collector

66
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,379
so to do that we're going to click over

67
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:40,680
here on the stack right here these these

68
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,260
uh scicon right here and we're going to

69
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,580
click what looks like this paper

70
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,440
airplane right here and what this is

71
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,200
going to do is take us to a wizard that

72
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,480
will allow us to collect the artifacts

73
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,879
we want to collect

74
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,620
specify what we're looking for and be

75
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,239
able to package that up into a single

76
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:00,959
binary to ship off over to our host

77
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,659
now this particular box that I'm looking

78
00:03:03,659 --> 00:03:06,239
to Target is going to be a Linux host so

79
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,400
I'm going to choose Linux artifacts here

80
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,040
just a few different ones such as the

81
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,120
APT sources packages maybe I would like

82
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,819
some netstat information

83
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:20,000
um let's see maybe some batch history

84
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,580
and a PS list as well so I've selected

85
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:26,519
all of those and now I can configure the

86
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:28,319
different parameters for that collection

87
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,299
if I would like to for each individual

88
00:03:30,299 --> 00:03:32,340
artifact

89
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:34,980
now going from there The Collection

90
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,840
specific configuration which is going to

91
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,640
be the overarching collection of these

92
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,780
artifacts

93
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:42,000
is going to be right here and this is

94
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,620
where we're going to specify our Target

95
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:46,080
OS we're going to specify some other

96
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,500
details to really guide our collector to

97
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,540
where we want it to be

98
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,459
so in this instance since I'm targeting

99
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:55,860
a Linux endpoint I'm going to choose the

100
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,659
Linux option here

101
00:03:57,659 --> 00:03:59,700
and I'm not going to specify a password

102
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,459
here but we could if we would like to

103
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:04,319
there are various report templates that

104
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,000
you can create or you can use the

105
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,220
default report template right now we're

106
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,840
not going to generate a report with that

107
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,480
we're just going to keep it the default

108
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,220
right here

109
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,440
and then also there are a couple

110
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,259
different options here of ways that we

111
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:22,320
can specify our collection or I'm sorry

112
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,199
the in format of our collection so we

113
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,759
can just have it be a zip archive that's

114
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:29,280
dumped locally on disk for the uh

115
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,680
particular endpoint we can shoot it up

116
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,900
to a Google Cloud bucket or an AWS

117
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,759
bucket which is really useful especially

118
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:36,960
if you're again in that customer

119
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,000
environment and you want to be able to

120
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,440
send that data back to a central

121
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,120
location where you can pick it up and

122
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:45,000
process it after the fact

123
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,639
um and then also SFTP is another option

124
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:49,320
that we have here but for the time being

125
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,820
we're going to choose the default zip

126
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,560
archive option here

127
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,540
if we wanted to change our binary that

128
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,520
we actually use our base binary we could

129
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,639
change that here this Velociraptor Linux

130
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:01,919
uh configuration right here we're not

131
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:03,539
going to do that right now

132
00:05:03,539 --> 00:05:05,039
and then there are some other details

133
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,080
here that we could fill out including

134
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:10,680
the output format of the results so we

135
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,780
could see that you know maybe we want

136
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,940
the results in Json or maybe we want the

137
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,560
results in csva and Json for

138
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,780
post-processing later maybe we have some

139
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,580
other tools that we want to import that

140
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,919
data into and it's only CSV compliant

141
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:25,259
that's another way that we can specify

142
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:26,639
that format there and be able to

143
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,500
post-process that data with additional

144
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,300
tools

145
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,699
another helpful thing that we have here

146
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:34,560
is this prefix and what this output

147
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,660
prefix is going to do is uh kind of like

148
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,580
what the name suggests is it's going to

149
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:41,520
prefix the name of the collection file

150
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,759
with whatever we specify here so I'm

151
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:48,539
just going to choose BTD 2022 to add

152
00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:51,600
that prefix to the collection

153
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,180
and then I can specify some additional

154
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,819
resources here in this next tab but I'm

155
00:05:56,819 --> 00:05:58,500
not going to this time I think all of

156
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,360
these defaults will work well for what

157
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,139
we're looking to do

158
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,800
and then we can review the different

159
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,479
details of the collection that we're

160
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,060
creating here we just scroll down this

161
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,880
is the actual vql or Velociraptor query

162
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:15,720
language uh that we'll we'll see here

163
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,120
um so

164
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,600
if we go over here and click launch

165
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,100
it's going to take a minute it's going

166
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,900
to go through and check and see what

167
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,180
kind of collector it needs to build it's

168
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:29,100
going to go through those steps and then

169
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,560
after that you'll see the status changes

170
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,780
for the Server utils create collector

171
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,220
artifact

172
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,680
and now we see that it's completed so we

173
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,900
can see the results here basically just

174
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,060
some summary details some hash

175
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:45,000
information uh for that binary and then

176
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,400
also the virtual file store path for

177
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,539
that

178
00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:50,400
and if we scroll up we can see the log

179
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,620
we can see you know what it did during

180
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,840
that uh Collective build and see if

181
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,240
there were any issues there

182
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,280
and then we can go to the uploaded files

183
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,780
here this is what where we're going to

184
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,819
actually download The Collector binary

185
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:05,039
and then we can put that on that

186
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:06,660
endpoint

187
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,460
so what we're going to do here is just

188
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:11,620
click to download this here

189
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:13,199
[Music]

190
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,759
and we'll see it's downloading we'll

191
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:16,440
wait for that to finish downloading here

192
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,060
in just a second

193
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,800
I'll take just a minute

194
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,539
and then once that's downloaded we'll

195
00:07:21,539 --> 00:07:25,500
SCP that up to our Target endpoint just

196
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:28,979
a very simple way to to copy that there

197
00:07:28,979 --> 00:07:32,099
so I'm going to go to the terminal here

198
00:07:32,099 --> 00:07:35,340
spin this just a bit

199
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:39,720
and I'm actually going to get a tab here

200
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,060
let's explain

201
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:45,840
and I'm going to SCP and downloads

202
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,060
selector

203
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:49,979
say

204
00:07:49,979 --> 00:07:54,318
we'll say which one was that

205
00:07:55,819 --> 00:07:58,860
let's go back here it should be this one

206
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:04,440
right here Collective velociraptor v065

207
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:07,680
and Linux

208
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,960
and we'll just copy that up to our

209
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,599
endpoint obviously if if you're in an

210
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:14,580
Enterprise or in some other type of

211
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:15,960
environment you might have a better way

212
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,520
that you do this whether it's through

213
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,280
Powershell or through uh you know some

214
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:23,879
other deployment machine or mechanism

215
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:26,340
that's certainly another way to do that

216
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,379
I'm just going to copy this up here to

217
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:30,780
the home directory

218
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:33,419
and this is going to be our server that

219
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:34,860
we're actually looking to investigate

220
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,299
here we're actually looking to kick off

221
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:38,880
this collector binary on this host and

222
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,099
uh this hostname Secret Sauce here you

223
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:42,059
know maybe there's some interesting

224
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:44,820
things here that an attacker is has gone

225
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,019
looking for and we're trying to find

226
00:08:46,019 --> 00:08:47,640
evidence of that here

227
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,779
so

228
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:50,459
we'll check to see if our collector

229
00:08:50,459 --> 00:08:52,920
binary is here and we do see that it's

230
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,920
right here collector Velociraptor v065

231
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,580
Linux and b64 okay and all we have to do

232
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,040
here really is just

233
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:05,040
actually I have to actually make it

234
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,519
executable

235
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,560
and then we'll just do

236
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,720
we'll execute the collector here we need

237
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,100
to do this from uh you know with

238
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,899
elevated permissions so we're using sudo

239
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:21,080
here

240
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,339
and we just hit enter and it just goes

241
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:25,740
off and does its thing and as you can

242
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,899
see this was super fast

243
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:29,940
um we can see you know kind of up here

244
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,519
what artifacts we were going through

245
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,740
these are not very heavy these do not

246
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,959
take very long but if we're using some

247
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,720
more uh intensive artifacts or where you

248
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,800
know we're taking longer to do things

249
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,360
you'll see that it may take a little bit

250
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,300
longer here to finish this particular

251
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,519
collection and output this

252
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,980
so we see the end report right here

253
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,899
essentially at the end of it and then if

254
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:54,060
we do an LS here we'll see the zip file

255
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,100
that it created and you'll see it's

256
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:00,420
prepended with our BTV 2022 collection

257
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,700
and then the hostname right here

258
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,940
so that's a resultant collection zip

259
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:09,120
file and if we were to unzip that we

260
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,040
would see all the contents uh you know

261
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,620
in this case Json

262
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:15,779
formatted uh the uh the artifacts that

263
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:17,279
we collected

264
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,880
but we want to do something else here we

265
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,420
want to take this and then import this

266
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:27,959
into our server so what we can do either

267
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:29,760
aside from just going off and reviewing

268
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,279
these results uh one by one or you know

269
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:34,140
in some other fashion post-processing

270
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,640
with other tools we can actually take

271
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,100
these and somewhat kind of sneaker net

272
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,500
these back into the server even though

273
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,660
we're not we don't have that client

274
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:45,000
server relationship uh that traditional

275
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,040
uh reporting back to the server kind of

276
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,240
thing

277
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,220
so what we'll do here is we'll actually

278
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:52,560
s p this

279
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,040
over to the Velociraptor server that we

280
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,600
have here

281
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,579
I'll move this over so we can see that

282
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:06,180
and if I remember the EIP address just

283
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:09,180
put that in the movie A little bit put

284
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:12,380
that in the home directory here

285
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:19,019
all right oops Okay so we've got to

286
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:22,220
the studio on that

287
00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:26,700
all right cool so we just needed those

288
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,380
admin drives so that we could copy that

289
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:32,279
over from the machine now again

290
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:34,920
um you know typically if you have a

291
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,060
different way that you post process

292
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,500
these results you might have this

293
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:41,880
already sending to AWS or to gcp so you

294
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,640
make that being be doing this manually

295
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,100
so you know maybe less of a step

296
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,320
necessarily for you to have to do that

297
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,740
so we'll go over to this near this VR

298
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,839
PRD server which is our Velociraptor

299
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:55,920
server here

300
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,440
and let's do a quick listing here and

301
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,500
we'll see that we have the btb 2022

302
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:04,320
collection here now one thing that we

303
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,779
have to do before we try to import this

304
00:12:06,779 --> 00:12:08,880
into the server and review the results

305
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,160
is we'll actually want to change the

306
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,440
permissions on this file

307
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,540
um just in case just to make sure that

308
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:17,760
the Velociraptor server here can have

309
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,700
permissions to import this uh into the

310
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,920
data store

311
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,320
so we've done that here

312
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,839
and we'll see Velociraptor Velociraptor

313
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,060
okay we're good there

314
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:32,639
all right so now so far we've created

315
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,160
that collector binary we've run the

316
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,260
collection it was super fast

317
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:38,579
um you know we've specified our

318
00:12:38,579 --> 00:12:40,740
different Linux artifacts and now we're

319
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,899
going to go import this in through the

320
00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:43,800
GUI

321
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,139
so I'm going to minimize this here

322
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:49,560
and what we can do here is

323
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,800
from the server artifact screen you can

324
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,880
search for imports

325
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:59,220
and here it is import collection this is

326
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,660
the one we want right here

327
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,820
and we can see right here that it's an

328
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:05,399
automated free I'm sorry it basically

329
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:07,980
takes a zip archive and then Imports it

330
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:10,440
into the server so

331
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,360
we can configure it here and leave the

332
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,279
client ID to Auto because we'll let it

333
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:17,339
just generate a random plan ID but one

334
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:19,700
thing that we can do just to help

335
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:22,019
differentiate this

336
00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:23,519
um or it sets you know tag it with a

337
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,800
particular name because again you know

338
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,139
these are kind of disparate collections

339
00:13:28,139 --> 00:13:30,300
the server has not previously known

340
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,279
about this particular box or these

341
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:34,019
results so we're going to call this

342
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:35,760
secret sauce for the host name of the

343
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,500
box that we

344
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,339
um

345
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:41,399
we ran that collection on and then we're

346
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:43,800
just going to specify the path on disk

347
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,440
to that collection and let's go back and

348
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,820
grab that file name real quick

349
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,959
just copy this

350
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,100
a little bit easier here

351
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,980
now one reason that uh we don't have an

352
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:04,920
import straight from the UI is because a

353
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,899
lot of these artifacts or these

354
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:10,139
collections can be very large especially

355
00:14:10,139 --> 00:14:12,360
if on Windows maybe you're running the

356
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,339
cape files Target artifact and maybe

357
00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:16,139
you're collecting a a ton of different

358
00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:17,880
stuff uh kind of a ton of different

359
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,160
things from that host it can be

360
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,279
gigabytes and gigabytes and gigabytes so

361
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,120
um

362
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,160
it can be really big so we don't want to

363
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,079
force that to the UI we just let the

364
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:29,639
server pick that up from the file system

365
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:32,180
like so

366
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,680
now if we wanted to specify any of this

367
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,420
stuff we could do that here I'm going to

368
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:38,760
leave it as the defaults and I'm going

369
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,139
to launch this

370
00:14:40,139 --> 00:14:43,019
and it should take just a second here

371
00:14:43,019 --> 00:14:45,720
and we'll see that finished

372
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,699
we can see the log here that it was

373
00:14:47,699 --> 00:14:49,740
creating a new client essentially and

374
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:51,860
importing that zip file

375
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:55,320
and then we can see these different file

376
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,699
names essentially that were in that

377
00:14:56,699 --> 00:14:58,560
collector binary

378
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,540
different Json files which we could have

379
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:02,519
reviewed manually but I wanted to import

380
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:05,880
it into the server to make it easier

381
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,519
and now this is a cool thing if we

382
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:10,620
actually go over here now to the clients

383
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,300
we'll see that this client isn't

384
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:15,060
necessary isn't necessarily connected

385
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:17,160
right because it's not in that client

386
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,680
server architecture but it does register

387
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,720
as a client and we can review the

388
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,880
results just like if we had it connected

389
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,639
to the server so if we go over here to

390
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,860
the collected screen

391
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:31,620
we'll see all of those artifacts that we

392
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:34,079
selected to collect

393
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:36,720
as collected underneath this client that

394
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,160
was imported

395
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,620
and now we can go back

396
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:43,019
and we can review these different if I

397
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:44,639
pull it up here we can review the

398
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,800
different results for each one of these

399
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,079
artifacts here and then if I had any

400
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:50,699
files uploaded we could do the same

401
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:53,300
thing for those

402
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:55,620
but we can review this stuff what makes

403
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,540
it really awesome is like as if it was

404
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:00,240
connected already to the server so it's

405
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,459
a really really great way to be able to

406
00:16:02,459 --> 00:16:04,680
take that data and import it back into

407
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:07,339
the server and have that same kind of

408
00:16:07,339 --> 00:16:09,779
post-processing capability right maybe

409
00:16:09,779 --> 00:16:11,639
even post-process it in a notebook like

410
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:14,040
we do with our other data uh and bring

411
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,560
that back in and just you know get at

412
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,540
what we're looking for so it helps us

413
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,339
that much more as an analyst or as an

414
00:16:20,339 --> 00:16:22,259
incident responder if we're able to do

415
00:16:22,259 --> 00:16:25,259
that very quickly and very efficiently

416
00:16:25,259 --> 00:16:27,360
so this is definitely a great way to do

417
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,540
that

418
00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:35,160
all right so I've kind of skipped

419
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,220
through these already these steps

420
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:39,480
but

421
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:42,420
as far as the demo and as far as uh you

422
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,800
know just showing you guys how to create

423
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,839
this collector binary

424
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,240
um that's really it it's very simple uh

425
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,620
it's very quick to be able to create

426
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,959
this binary if you wanted to configure

427
00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:53,759
it for AWS all you would have to do is

428
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,160
throw in those bucket details for S3 and

429
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,540
you would be good to go you'd be

430
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:00,480
uploading there but please if you have

431
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,120
any questions or feedback please feel

432
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,179
free to follow velocidex that's the

433
00:17:06,179 --> 00:17:08,099
handle for Velociraptor the folks behind

434
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:09,179
it

435
00:17:09,179 --> 00:17:10,439
um you know if you have any questions of

us know if you enjoyed this and if you

440
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:23,220
want to dig in more and uh you know

441
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:25,020
really go through the documentation

442
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:26,640
there's a link here that offline

443
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,460
collections page that are referred to

444
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:31,380
and again that is really going to be a

445
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,740
great place to go aside from this video

446
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:36,900
it really lays out the different steps

447
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,340
that you'll need to get going with this

448
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:41,100
so again please feel free to reach out

449
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,500
if you need uh have any feedback or any

450
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,020
questions and until then

451
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:50,539
uh Happy Hunting and have a great day

452
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,280
and you're good
