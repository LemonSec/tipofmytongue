1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:04,799
um welcome everyone this is our

2
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:07,279
module three session on generating

3
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:08,880
threat intelligence

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,719
from an incident

5
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:13,040
um this session uses data from kill

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,320
chain one

7
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,199
which will be made publicly available

8
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,480
and demonstrates how we can generate and

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,080
generate intelligence from an incident

10
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,760
or intrusion

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,439
and use that data internally

12
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,600
all right advancing the slides

13
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,200
um so

14
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,320
we will touch base on our objective

15
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,480
um and

16
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,399
we're gonna iterate we're gonna run

17
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:47,200
through

18
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,559
the cti lifecycle here um

19
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:53,120
we're gonna start by um touching on our

20
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,239
stakeholders requirements goals and

21
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:58,640
objectives

22
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,960
then we're going to get into the cta the

23
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,239
cti analyst role during an incident

24
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,040
and talk a little bit about processing

25
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,680
intrusion data and information

26
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,840
and

27
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,320
um the bulk of the conversation really

28
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,759
is going to be around

29
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:17,920
analysis and production

30
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,799
the research and elements to include

31
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:23,520
in a cti report

32
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,720
then we'll touch briefly on

33
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,240
dissemination how we're going to share

34
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,520
this and who we're going to share this

35
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,479
with

36
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:29,680
and

37
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,000
finally we'll wrap things up with

38
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,640
feedback and an evaluation a critical

39
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,079
step

40
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:39,280
in the cti lifecycle and

41
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,240
cti program in general

42
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,159
so we'll uh we'll touch base on that

43
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,720
here as well

44
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,720
so

45
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,720
the objective

46
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,960
is really

47
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,000
straightforward we're going to

48
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,399
demonstrate the important role that cti

49
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,960
plays both during and after an incident

50
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,560
and moving right along into planning and

51
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,720
direction i'll go ahead and pass it over

52
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,359
to stephanie

53
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,520
great so we're going to do an overview

54
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,959
of the stakeholders in this scenario

55
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:19,920
so the stakeholders for this kill chain

56
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,360
are our cso the cto the cio and

57
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,120
executive board

58
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,280
we have people sitting in the sock so

59
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,840
the defenders forensics team

60
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,480
instant response malware analysis and

61
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,560
threat hunting teams

62
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,920
we have sock management and the it team

63
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,480
and this phase of the cti lifecycle is

64
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,560
where our requirements are created

65
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,000
so we can see here in this diagram some

66
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,920
of our goals and objectives so we want

67
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,200
to identify

68
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,599
blind spots in our network how we're

69
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,360
getting attacked so in our endpoints

70
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,440
network platforms

71
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,680
we want to understand the adversaries

72
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,120
capabilities

73
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,680
how are they attacking us why

74
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,720
what is their method of attacking us

75
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,760
and

76
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,599
we want to also

77
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,280
call out explicitly

78
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,480
any new kind of

79
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,800
defense mechanisms we want to create

80
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,440
because of this cti life cycle we're

81
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,720
going through so those might be new

82
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,080
detections we write new threat hunts

83
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,400
new purple team test cases

84
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,920
so those might be

85
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,000
explicit test cases you run

86
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,840
with your purple team to

87
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,040
check if a certain blind spot has been

88
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,480
uh covered or not by your defenses

89
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,200
and while performing research isn't

90
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,760
necessarily a stakeholder requirement

91
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,159
um the cti team should be digging into

92
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,440
those iocs to find new information that

93
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,439
they can use to inform the various teams

94
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:54,480
so

95
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,159
we can use different tools and

96
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,319
analytical methods for this kind of

97
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,879
research

98
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:04,159
and back over to clay

99
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,120
all right so yeah so i'm touching on

100
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,920
collection here

101
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:12,560
um

102
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,720
right so artifacts will be collected

103
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,519
from

104
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:16,959
different teams

105
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,798
that are going to be involved during the

106
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:20,798
course of an incident

107
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:24,160
um this will be our our ir team

108
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,400
our forensics team

109
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,800
and even our malware analysis team

110
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,360
um who might get some artifacts from the

111
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,720
forensics team

112
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,720
um so all all of these teams work

113
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,960
together and there might be you know

114
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,759
some people might be on multiple teams

115
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,280
um

116
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,600
so every organization this will this

117
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,040
will look different

118
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,280
um additional data

119
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,520
and information will come from external

120
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,080
sources through oceans

121
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,400
on existing data

122
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,199
so ocean includes um

123
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,160
sources documented in our collections

124
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,680
management framework or collection

125
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,520
management framework that that we've

126
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,800
created

127
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,960
um but we'll also include sources that

128
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,280
are discovered through the process of

129
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,400
pivoting

130
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,560
which we'll touch on in a little bit

131
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,960
um yeah and pivoting on existing data

132
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:19,758
plays a critical role during oceans

133
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,720
when we're pivoting when we're using

134
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,400
open source intelligent

135
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,400
um

136
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,720
we might not know what data source we're

137
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,759
gonna

138
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,320
run across that might be useful

139
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,759
um

140
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:36,479
for example it could be as it could be

141
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:39,919
an article or a um an in-depth malware

142
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,560
analysis report that we find useful

143
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,840
um

144
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,560
so

145
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,560
during oscent um yes we will rely on our

146
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,240
platforms that we're aware of and that

147
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,360
we've documented in the cmf

148
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,120
but at the same time we're also going to

149
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,280
be

150
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,759
performing research that's going to lead

151
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,720
us to new data data sources that will

152
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,000
pull those in as well

153
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,680
just wanted to note on all of that

154
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,479
processing so this is the next phase in

155
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,880
the ctf life cycle and we'll be using

156
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,600
intrusion data and information

157
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,840
uh for

158
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,360
this now every organization will be

159
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,880
different and

160
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,199
depending on the level of maturity the

161
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,280
organization has this could be very

162
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,759
limited or quite verbose

163
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:30,960
um

164
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,280
tips are commonly used so the tip is a

165
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,600
threat intelligence platform

166
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,199
um for processing and opencti is a free

167
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,840
and open source platform and here's

168
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,479
um just a quote pulled from

169
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,560
from their website

170
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,360
and

171
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,440
yeah it's a great way just to to

172
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,599
structure store

173
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:52,880
organize

174
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,720
and visualize technical and

175
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,880
non-technical information about threats

176
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,440
automation of data from a tip to a sim

177
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,280
is another commonly implemented process

178
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,479
and as we're

179
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:09,759
working through these um

180
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,560
events or intrusions the daily work we

181
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,680
do

182
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,680
look for opportunities to develop this

183
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,960
phase

184
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,599
of the cti life cycle and ideas will

185
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:22,000
come at random times you never know when

186
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,080
an idea is going to strike

187
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,400
or present themselves

188
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:31,280
but make note document those and um

189
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,039
you know that way it'll you'll you'll

190
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:37,599
make improvements um along the way

191
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,440
so now we'll uh get into analysis and

192
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,919
production and for that i'll uh kick it

193
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:45,919
over to lucid

194
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,599
all righty

195
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,840
so uh analysis happens

196
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,400
uh during and in support in during an

197
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,160
incident and this can be to support

198
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,000
other teams and it it produces cti that

199
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,280
will actually be in uh reporting

200
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,360
and the ctre team can really add value

201
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,319
by analyzing osint um

202
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,400
by pivoting through iocs

203
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,960
like was was already mentioned uh you

204
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,800
know an open source intelligence can be

205
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,560
visualized

206
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,360
and analyzed a lot of different tools

207
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,960
platforms and models

208
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,199
and i'll have a demo here of a couple of

209
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,919
those tools a virus total in any run i

210
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,319
would provide sandboxing

211
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:35,599
and visualization of iocs

212
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,240
all right i just want to highlight

213
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,480
a couple of open source intelligence

214
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,399
tools that we can use

215
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:49,360
um maybe if we have an active incident

216
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,760
and we've been provided

217
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,360
some iocs

218
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,480
we can see what's publicly available

219
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,040
about those those iocs and see if we can

220
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,760
discover infrastructure or tactics

221
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,800
or other things that could help us to

222
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,839
help the other teams incident response

223
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,240
threat hunting to respond

224
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,560
to an incident

225
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,560
so in this case

226
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,600
the situation is that the

227
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,440
incident response team has provided us

228
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,360
with a domain

229
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,240
a user has clicked an attachment in an

230
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,399
email and it really wasn't what they

231
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,839
were expecting

232
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,800
and they reported it and

233
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,720
firewall logs showed

234
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,240
that this domain

235
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:39,320
baseball charlemagne lagardere.com

236
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,480
uh was contacted

237
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,760
so uh we did a little bit of um googling

238
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,080
first okay this looks like

239
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,240
might be a real uh

240
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,839
maybe french baseball team uh so maybe

241
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,320
this site isn't um

242
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,920
infrastructure that was set up by a

243
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,000
threat actor could have maybe been

244
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,920
compromised if this is really a

245
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,760
malicious site it's suspicious at this

246
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,360
point

247
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,120
we can see

248
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,120
an alien vault which is another provider

249
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,600
of open source intelligence

250
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,760
shows that this is probably a wordpress

251
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,320
page it's got this wp content in the

252
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,720
links that we see here the associated

253
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,480
urls so maybe it's a compromised

254
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,560
wordpress site we'll see maybe we'll see

255
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,760
nothing

256
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,360
when we look at virustotal now

257
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,200
virustotal

258
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,440
sandboxes urls

259
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,880
and files that people upload and then

260
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,760
comes up with a report essentially

261
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,079
of all of the behavior

262
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:43,120
from those executions

263
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,040
so if we look here we can see that the

264
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,880
domain itself is actually considered

265
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,399
malicious uh by some security vendors

266
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,760
six out of the 94.

267
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,279
as we go through the tabs there's some

268
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,519
more information about the domain

269
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:59,519
some relations this is really the bread

270
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:00,800
and butter here

271
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,959
virus total where it shows

272
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:05,519
some of the behavior uh and

273
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,640
and other relationships between this

274
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,959
domain and other files

275
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:13,440
um other files that contain this domain

276
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,399
in their tech in the in the file itself

277
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,720
uh files that when run communicated with

278
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,800
this domain

279
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,240
but really uh

280
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,600
the best

281
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,160
the best visualization of all this

282
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,320
information is to use the virustotal

283
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,800
graph now you can create this graph

284
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,519
after setting up a free account

285
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,519
and

286
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,600
we can look right away and see okay

287
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,320
something must be wrong there are

288
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,720
in fact uh document files that

289
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,760
communicate doc and xls excel

290
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,920
spreadsheets that communicate with this

291
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,639
suspicious domain now we already have

292
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:53,920
more information than we started with

293
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,320
but we can start to look over the uh the

294
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,279
graph

295
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,760
and we can see that these documents are

296
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,160
considered malicious by security vendors

297
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,800
by different antivirus

298
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,279
engines

299
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:08,639
and

300
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:11,279
we can really start to pivot from here

301
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,519
we could find a document that's

302
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,760
considered malicious and see what its

303
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,079
other relationships are and expand those

304
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:20,399
out these aren't expanded right now so

305
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:24,240
for instance if we expand domains

306
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,920
we will see that

307
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:26,880
there's some

308
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,959
other domains that get contacted when

309
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:30,959
this documents opened some of them are

310
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,880
related to microsoft so those might

311
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,800
aren't really suspicious

312
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,480
but there's other ones like this domain

313
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,639
tango with collette

314
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,079
and we can really just continue to

315
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:41,839
expand because

316
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:43,920
um if there's there may be other

317
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,600
documents that

318
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,360
also communicate

319
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,160
uh with with this uh with this domain

320
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,720
tango with colette

321
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,079
so we're going to find some additional

322
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,399
documents so this might give us you know

323
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,959
tango with colette that's a pivot to

324
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,200
infrastructure

325
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,720
from and we pivoted from that

326
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,279
infrastructure potentially to more

327
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:08,240
um

328
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,279
tactics uh to abilities

329
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,839
uh that that the actor has

330
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:15,360
based on you know

331
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,440
the uh the results but these are

332
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,800
executed in the sandbox

333
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,519
this is already a lot of information

334
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:27,120
that we could pass back to the other

335
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,200
teams we can really keep going we can

336
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:34,120
look around the graph and see that

337
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,120
um

338
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,480
there is

339
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,480
also this powershell script it's not

340
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,399
quite obvious from looking at that it is

341
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,399
uh the file name

342
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,240
uh that it's a powershell script but we

343
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,360
could see that is executed by

344
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,000
several of these files that communicate

345
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
with the domain the suspicious domain

346
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,440
that we've been given

347
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,279
so maybe our teams are going to start

348
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:59,040
looking for powershell scripts in their

349
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,519
in their in their tools their on-premise

350
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:03,839
tools

351
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,760
and another thing we can do

352
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,519
is that we can take a document

353
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:11,120
that

354
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,079
is

355
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:13,920
has relations

356
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,360
to this what looks like a campaign

357
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,000
and we can run it through any run now

358
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,279
any run is also a sandbox but

359
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,760
it will show it would play back

360
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,320
uh it was interactive first of all

361
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,920
when you run the file you're able to

362
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,079
interact with it in a in a virtual

363
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,000
machine in a sandbox

364
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,079
but then after the fact it creates a

365
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:38,240
report and a link back to that session

366
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,079
that shows what happened in real time

367
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:43,040
so

368
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,800
in this case we can really just look

369
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,600
back through all the public tasks to see

370
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,639
if a file of that hash was run through

371
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,040
any run

372
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,880
now we can see there's a bunch of

373
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,360
different runs this is a historic

374
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,480
campaign

375
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,720
from a a threat actor lazarus group

376
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,320
and we can see that

377
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,000
some of these may be more or less

378
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,800
complete as far as whether it act the

379
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,800
files actually reached out and

380
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,920
downloaded a malicious payload just and

381
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,440
that there could be all kinds of reasons

382
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,720
for that but uh this one here

383
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,199
is probably the most complete run

384
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:25,600
and we can see on the right here the

385
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,920
exact timings of um the fact that

386
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,360
windward ran

387
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,199
windows

388
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:34,160
microsoft word ran and that

389
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,839
an exploit of some sort caused this

390
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:38,480
powershell to execute

391
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,399
and we can see more information about

392
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,040
this powershell itself and all the

393
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,720
different events that happened as a

394
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,399
result

395
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:47,920
we can get a pcap that's actually

396
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,720
capture all the network traffic

397
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,360
that was generated from this session

398
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,440
we can see all the connections here and

399
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,040
look through them and see if there's any

400
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,320
other

401
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,800
domains maybe that we

402
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,959
that we missed when there's actually

403
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:05,399
this towing

404
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:08,079
operations there's another domain here

405
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:09,920
that we actually didn't yes i don't know

406
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,600
that we necessarily saw that on our

407
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,839
graph over here so

408
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,920
as you take bits and pieces that you get

409
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,600
from one tool you can put them into

410
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,639
another

411
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:20,320
and you can find out more information

412
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,399
that you can pass back as a

413
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:26,959
list of iocs it could be very useful

414
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:29,600
to threat hunting and

415
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,839
everybody else that's responding to an

416
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:33,680
incident

417
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,440
that is my demo of virustotal and

418
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,000
any run

419
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,120
so this graphic focuses on the

420
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,240
production

421
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,600
element of the phase

422
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,680
and this can be a template it's just it

423
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,600
shows some of the things that go on a

424
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,759
report it's not doesn't limit you to

425
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,920
just these items um

426
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,440
you know the graphics section doesn't

427
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,920
just show all it's not limp doesn't

428
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,839
you're not limited to these graphics uh

429
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:03,120
but you could put things on there like a

430
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,760
multi-graph

431
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,359
or a just a diamond model

432
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,760
but this is a good visualization of all

433
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,079
the things that would go on the report

434
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,240
and you're thinking about with a

435
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,640
complete report does it tell

436
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,839
or if you're thinking about whether to

437
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,039
put something on the report as you're

438
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:23,039
completing it you're trying to

439
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:24,640
ask the question does it help to tell

440
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,280
the story

441
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,240
so uh one of the things from the

442
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,000
previous slide the diamond model for

443
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,480
intrusion analysis

444
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,480
this can be used to both track uh

445
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,559
contract both fail or successful

446
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,120
intrusions

447
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,080
and it models the relationship between

448
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,440
data points

449
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,320
um

450
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,400
and it helps with pivoting testing

451
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,480
theories about how things are connected

452
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,720
or how an intrusion happened

453
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,640
um so in this example uh the antivirus

454
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,280
on an endpoint within the organization

455
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,360
detects a scheduled task that might be

456
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,960
suspicious

457
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,400
that information has passed a threat

458
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,080
hunting team that

459
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,280
discovers a maldoc malicious document

460
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,120
that communicates with infrastructure

461
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,280
which we see on the left

462
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,200
of the diagram

463
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,039
we're able to resolve that ip to a

464
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:21,200
domain name and that domain name we

465
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,880
don't know who the adversary is we're

466
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,240
just going to use it to define our

467
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,320
adversary so because we had malware i

468
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,799
love that xyz we're just going to call

469
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:31,840
this cluster of activity

470
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:35,120
part of outward love

471
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,640
and we can do this use this model to

472
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,679
perform analysis periodically whatever

473
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:43,039
schedule makes sense for the

474
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,760
organization

475
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:54,159
the other way to show the data

476
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,280
an intrusion is an intrusion summary

477
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,720
this is just a listing of all the

478
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,400
different uh

479
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,720
data points from the previous graph same

480
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,320
information

481
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,880
and intrusion summaries inside an

482
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,480
organization are really the best source

483
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,320
of intelligence show what's actually

484
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,760
going on with that company uh with you

485
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,840
know thousands of attacks going on

486
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,160
outside of the organization dated

487
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,160
even in a single day

488
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,000
and the diamond model can help to

489
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,840
visualize the data points from these

490
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,120
summaries

491
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,640
and then you can start to see clusters

492
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,039
of activity emerge from this process of

493
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:31,760
going from a summary to a way of

494
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,400
modeling or visualizing the data

495
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,440
to starting to see patterns

496
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,160
uh the miter attack navigator this is a

497
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,480
web-based tool um

498
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,000
it's free

499
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
for annotating

500
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,039
and exploring these matrices um

501
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:54,880
you can visualize your defensive

502
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,120
coverage you can plan for red or blue

503
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,400
team activities purple team

504
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,720
and

505
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,159
this is this this visual is a heat map

506
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:09,840
of ttps that were part of kill chain one

507
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,080
uh this is an example we there's not

508
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,600
every not everything that happened in

509
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,240
kill chain one is on here uh not all of

510
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,679
the little sub methods are on here

511
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:20,480
so

512
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,200
you'll be able to uh with a re there is

513
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,760
a link at the end of the presentation

514
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,400
or you can just search for this uh tac

515
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,400
layer navigator and fill this out

516
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,400
yourself

517
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:39,679
i will turn it over now uh back to clay

518
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:42,159
all right excellent thank you

519
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:46,559
so here is an example of a maltigo graph

520
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:50,240
maltigo is a link analysis tool um that

521
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,039
we can use to pivot um and to find

522
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:54,159
additional

523
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:57,679
uh data points um information and and

524
00:20:57,679 --> 00:20:59,039
context

525
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:01,280
um this example demonstrates how we

526
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,400
pivot from an ip address

527
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,640
to a file hash

528
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,679
so

529
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:09,679
the file hash that i'm referring to here

530
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:11,360
is the one that

531
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,880
is tagged as sandstone malware

532
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,280
just made that up

533
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,080
the malware has been attributed to a

534
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,200
threat group

535
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,440
we see stardust

536
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,480
kalima

537
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,080
reference there

538
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,039
but it's also associated with another ip

539
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:31,280
address which

540
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,960
has another

541
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,080
website

542
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,440
or url

543
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,679
associated with it

544
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:41,039
so all additional context

545
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:42,559
so now what

546
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:44,240
um

547
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,360
well the ip used in our intrusion can be

548
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,919
associated to other pieces of malware so

549
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:51,600
we can see that

550
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,240
um so this should be investigated for

551
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,559
additional evidence um

552
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:59,200
the malware we pivoted to um

553
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,760
or pivoted to in this example was not

554
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,080
found in our environment

555
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,480
so it is possible that another adversary

556
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,120
is using the same infrastructure

557
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,440
right so further evidence

558
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,720
is required

559
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,240
in order to be able to identify that

560
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,360
or

561
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,760
apply some sort of level of confidence

562
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,520
as well

563
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,280
so i actually

564
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,240
added

565
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,320
addition another piece of malware to

566
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,720
demonstrate that there are two pieces of

567
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,679
malware um in this scenario now so it

568
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:33,360
there there can be different scenarios

569
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,000
that come about but just wanted to

570
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,200
highlight this other possibility where

571
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,440
another piece of malware was identified

572
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,760
using that ip address or that ip address

573
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,760
was serving up multiple different pieces

574
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,840
of malware there and another one was

575
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:53,520
identified and it is attributed to a

576
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,879
different thread actor

577
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:58,880
in this example

578
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,559
it's noted that the limestone malware

579
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:07,039
is has been attributed to hidden cobra

580
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,640
so for our example and demonstration

581
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,600
purposes for kill chain one

582
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,960
um

583
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,280
two different threat groups using two

584
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,280
different p so two pieces of malware

585
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,200
have been associated with that with that

586
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,039
ip address

587
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:25,360
and each piece of malware is associated

588
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,760
with a different thread group

589
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,159
now one thing that is interesting

590
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:31,200
is that

591
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,640
hidden cobra and stardust kalima

592
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,360
are

593
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,840
attributed to north korea

594
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,280
so

595
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:42,240
we could say with high confidence that

596
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,360
our

597
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,039
intrusion

598
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:49,039
is associated with north korea

599
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:50,480
now

600
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,919
for

601
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:53,600
magnus tempus

602
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,640
um

603
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,919
attribution

604
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:58,400
is not one of our threat

605
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,240
intelligence requirements

606
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,640
maybe it is for your organization

607
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,039
um i would argue for most organizations

608
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:07,760
that attribution shouldn't matter

609
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,559
what matters is the intrusion right who

610
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:11,600
cares

611
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:15,440
who did it um how will how would

612
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,120
um

613
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,919
knowing the adversary change anything

614
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:21,840
you do would it

615
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,240
i would argue that it wouldn't um

616
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,080
perhaps another discussion for another

617
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,440
time but

618
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,240
um since attribution is not you know

619
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,840
what one of our threat intelligence

620
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,240
requirements it's an interesting

621
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,720
observation that we can make

622
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,640
and an interesting observation that we

623
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,400
can include

624
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,200
um or an interesting assessment maybe

625
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,159
that we can include in our

626
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:47,919
ctr report

627
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:49,279
um

628
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,039
yeah it could be useful

629
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:54,080
for other things as well but

630
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,159
yeah just wanted to really demonstrate

631
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:59,279
that maltego can be used for

632
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:00,720
for pivoting

633
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,960
finding additional information and

634
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,679
providing more context around an

635
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:08,240
intrusion

636
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,400
and with that

637
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:16,159
i'll kick it over to stephanie

638
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:18,080
great so

639
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,919
these last two sections will be about

640
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:23,520
dissemination of the information and

641
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,919
the feedback and evaluation

642
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:28,880
um so dissemination here

643
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,799
in this kill chain specifically since

644
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:33,120
all of our teams were involved in the

645
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,080
incident

646
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,559
um they're already aware of the outcomes

647
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:39,440
and aside from the report being

648
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,279
generated and being delivered to our

649
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:42,480
stakeholders

650
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,240
we don't have anyone else that we have

651
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,039
to update about the incident right so

652
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:49,679
there's no other dissemination required

653
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:51,520
in another scenario if there was a team

654
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,360
that wasn't involved and was not a

655
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,039
stakeholder

656
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:56,960
you might want to think about how to

657
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,559
distribute the information to them and

658
00:25:58,559 --> 00:25:59,840
what they need to know about the

659
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,240
incident

660
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,760
um

661
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,679
so next we'll talk about

662
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:07,520
uh here just an overview again of the

663
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,039
stakeholders

664
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:10,559
in this specific

665
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,880
incident so we had or this specific kill

666
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,919
chain

667
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:17,520
we had the executives management it team

668
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,360
and then members of our stock on the

669
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,600
right

670
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:25,279
so next we'll talk about feedback and

671
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:27,279
evaluation and

672
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:28,640
a method for

673
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,799
evaluating your cti lifecycle

674
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:33,760
so

675
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,039
here

676
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:37,440
during the planning and direction phase

677
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,600
you want to make sure you have defined

678
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:43,279
documented and socialized processes for

679
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:46,080
feedback you don't want to be

680
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,840
you want everyone to know how to provide

681
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,039
feedback

682
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:50,960
and you want a clearly defined process

683
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,240
for this you know you want it to be

684
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,120
documented so everyone is aware

685
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,360
and you want really ongoing feedback you

686
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,520
want it to be readily available for

687
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,039
people to give

688
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:03,760
feedback to you

689
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,480
and once you receive this feedback

690
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,960
you want to evaluate

691
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:09,840
uh

692
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,240
your processes so you want them to be

693
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:17,279
complete accurate relevant and timely

694
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,440
um so we'll talk about these in a little

695
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,799
bit more depth so you want to complete

696
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:25,360
you want your cti information

697
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:28,080
intelligence provided to be complete so

698
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,320
does it have enough information to

699
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,559
generate a proper response

700
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:35,679
so how comprehensive is the intelligence

701
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:38,799
are all of the data attributes present

702
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:41,360
is there vulnerability analysis

703
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,880
um

704
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,640
does it correlate across an entire

705
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,240
organization

706
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,559
and does it look at like non-cyber

707
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:50,640
intelligence and other events for like a

708
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,399
complete threat profile

709
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:53,840
so this comes back to like your

710
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,600
intelligence requirements at the very

711
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,559
beginning

712
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:59,039
uh were you able to

713
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:02,399
capture all of these and did you deliver

714
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:04,960
the next part is was it accurate

715
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:08,399
so were there errors in your generated

716
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:09,600
intelligence

717
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,760
you know what data sources did you use

718
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,159
were they accurate

719
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:16,480
was this the most up-to-date information

720
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,399
or were there information changes along

721
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:20,320
the way

722
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,360
and

723
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,960
is it time-bound is there like an

724
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,279
expiration for this intelligence

725
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:27,600
uh sometimes if you provide information

726
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,679
about specific iocs those might change

727
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:31,440
very quickly

728
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,760
so it's important to note

729
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,480
if it's time bound and how long this

730
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,960
will be accurate for

731
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,360
okay so now we'll talk about

732
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:44,559
is it relevant and is it timely so your

733
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:47,120
intelligence has to address the relevant

734
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,440
threats inside your organization and be

735
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,679
delivered in a way that allows for

736
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:53,840
effective action right so

737
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,919
does it map back to your original

738
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:58,480
intelligence requirements how do the

739
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,799
stakeholders submit requirements and

740
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:03,120
provide feedback for more relevant

741
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,200
intelligence

742
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,080
and is it timely it has to be produced

743
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,080
and delivered quickly

744
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,919
so it can be used fast enough to make a

745
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:13,120
difference

746
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,320
so

747
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,919
how is it delivered

748
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:18,159
to ensure quick consumption is it

749
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:20,640
delivered by email et cetera

750
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,880
uh how long between the discovery of a

751
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,840
threat and notifying the

752
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,440
stakeholders and is this is this

753
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,720
intelligence released to the

754
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,600
stakeholders as you go along and you

755
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:35,760
learn more or is it at the very end

756
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,240
so that's it for

757
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,080
[Music]

758
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,080
feedback and evaluation and i'll pass it

759
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,399
back to clay

760
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:46,640
all right thank you thank you stephanie

761
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,720
um yep so here's some resources that

762
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,840
were

763
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,120
touched upon

764
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:54,320
in the presentation

765
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,440
thank you

766
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,919
thanks for watching um

767
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:00,640
we uh join the conversation on discord

768
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:04,000
here um this is our discord

769
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,840
there's also the defcon discord that

770
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,919
that folks should be in

771
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:10,559
we'll be monitoring those channels as

772
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:13,520
well so please engage there

773
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,120
and

774
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:18,000
wanted to call out that we

775
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,520
we did create a module one session and

776
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,440
that was released

777
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,399
prior to defcon so

778
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:27,760
if you're unsure about any of the

779
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:31,679
content in this um in this module three

780
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:33,279
be sure to refer back to that that

781
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:34,880
module one session

782
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,880
that is available and up on youtube

783
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:39,600
so

784
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,480
thanks again everyone and look forward

engaging in the conversation and

787
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:51,840
see you in in future modules thank you
