1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:02,800
my name is damian grant and today i'll

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,120
be discussing diversity equity and

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,720
inclusion in cyber security

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,080
so a little bit about my background i

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:12,960
actually

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,400
currently work

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,519
within

8
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:17,119
digital forensics and incident response

9
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:19,680
for a large pharmaceutical company

10
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,000
um my background is i actually spent

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,480
eight years in the navy doing um

12
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,840
cyber security

13
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,359
in the form of network

14
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,320
testing and also working within counter

15
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,159
cyber intelligence

16
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,000
after leaving active duty i actually

17
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,399
went to the maryland air national guard

18
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,320
and i am a cyber space operations

19
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,879
officer with them as well

20
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:43,200
did consulting for a couple of years for

21
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,079
a large consulting firm mostly doing tax

22
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,680
service elimination vulnerability

23
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,920
assessment and also

24
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,000
doing some incident response services

25
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,719
for

26
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,960
mostly federal clients and some

27
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,399
commercial clients

28
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,239
i actually attended defcon a couple of

29
00:00:58,239 --> 00:00:59,760
years ago and and was very very

30
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,840
fortunate with a team of four

31
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,920
to actually win a black badge for uh a

32
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,600
missing person's osint ctf so i have

33
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,280
some experience here at defcon

34
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,560
so let's talk a little bit about the

35
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,759
problem

36
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:17,520
when we talk about the problem what we

37
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,080
tend to see when it comes to just

38
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,640
applicants in general to any sort of job

39
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,119
is that black applicants are less likely

40
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:27,200
to be contacted

41
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,200
when they are actually applying for jobs

42
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,960
there is a study that that showed that

43
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,560
uh if you

44
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,520
took the same resume and put a a white

45
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,200
sounding name on the resume and then put

46
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,200
a black sounding name on the resume sent

47
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,240
it out to all the same folks you would

48
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,479
get fewer responses for

49
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,880
a black applicant so you know there's

50
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,640
there's a barrier there to entry when it

51
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,360
comes to just the job market in general

52
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,439
when you look at stem

53
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:55,680
stem is is a place where you're that

54
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,920
you're really likely to see fewer black

55
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,399
faces and you know part of that is the

56
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,439
opportunity most lower income

57
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:04,719
schools

58
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:06,560
and lower income communities tend not to

59
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,959
have any kind of dedicated stem programs

60
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:10,959
and so you you see that there are fewer

61
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,800
opportunities for for black students to

62
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,200
actually be in those programs

63
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,920
really what you what you tend to see is

64
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,840
you know the opportunity will be there

65
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,599
for a lot of folks that are in you know

66
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,760
higher income communities but uh not so

67
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,520
much in in lower income communities

68
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,280
where a lot of black people actually do

69
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,640
live

70
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,120
and then what you start to drill into

71
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,680
um cyber security in general so a

72
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,160
computer science is a field of study

73
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,440
that that you just don't see a lot of

74
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,080
black faces in um that's something that

75
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,599
that uh you know has been improving

76
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,599
steadily but it's not improving at the

77
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:44,959
pace of

78
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,599
the actual openings that are being seen

79
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,760
within uh computer science and then

80
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,680
cyber security in general you know black

81
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,599
practitioners do not make up a large

82
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,000
part of information security analysts um

83
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,440
when when you start to look at the

84
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,879
numbers around

85
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:02,480
the the cyber security community

86
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,480
and then you actually really want to

87
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,159
kind of kind of dive into it as well in

88
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:07,680
terms of the culture

89
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,239
so recruiting especially in a highly

90
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:13,840
technical field is just somewhere where

91
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,159
people are at a disadvantage in general

92
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:16,959
um

93
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:18,239
recruiters tend to have a lack of

94
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,840
understanding of the

95
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,680
the the scope of responsibility of a

96
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,959
cyber security practitioner and and also

97
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,480
uh there are multiple different ways to

98
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,400
define skills so when people write

99
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,040
resumes even those those resumes might

100
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,959
actually apply directly to a specific

101
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,000
job within cyber security sometimes

102
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,080
applicants are passed over because

103
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,599
there are different ways to define

104
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,840
exactly what a hiring manager is looking

105
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,360
for

106
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,440
when you talk about certifications for

107
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,400
example

108
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,000
you might have a specific certification

109
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,080
like security plus and a lot of people

110
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,760
don't know that certified ethical hacker

111
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,439
is very similar to security plus in

112
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,200
terms of the skills that it actually

113
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,920
measures and so if a recruiter doesn't

114
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,599
see a specific

115
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:02,239
certification on someone's resume they

116
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,400
tend to look that person over because

117
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,319
they might not have the specific

118
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,159
certification that's called out in a

119
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,400
specific job posting

120
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,760
and when you start to get down to the

121
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,319
hiring managers so hiring managers have

122
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:16,639
really some unrealistic requirements

123
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,160
when it comes to

124
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,759
some things that are going on within

125
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:24,079
cyber security they're looking for um

126
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,320
experience that is is not necessarily

127
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,680
realistic

128
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,400
they want a you know a large breadth of

129
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,639
skills and experiences and they tend to

130
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,720
hire by tradition right i went through

131
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,160
this process i was a system

132
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,639
administrator or i was a network

133
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,320
engineer and you need to have these

134
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,080
skills in order to be in cyber security

135
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,600
and that's not necessarily the case

136
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,280
anymore a lot of folks that are coming

137
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,120
up in cyber security now

138
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,960
come up as a pure cyber security

139
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,479
practitioner as opposed to someone that

140
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,320
has a background in something like

141
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,680
network administration or system

142
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,040
administration

143
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,639
and then when you start to get into

144
00:04:58,639 --> 00:04:59,759
interviews

145
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,039
a lot of folks

146
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:02,560
kind of have the the stump the trump

147
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,000
mentality right

148
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,759
they come in with very very specific

149
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,680
questions looking for very very specific

150
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,720
answers

151
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,199
and that's not a really true gauge of

152
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,800
someone's skill

153
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,199
anyone can write up a technical

154
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,240
interview and ask for specific answers

155
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,560
but you know in practice the vast

156
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,880
majority of people that are actually

157
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,639
going through and doing

158
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,639
any kind of cyber security work

159
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:27,919
you don't necessarily you're not

160
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:29,440
necessarily pulling that information out

161
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,560
of your head you have you know guides

162
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,440
and

163
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,199
all kinds of different uh

164
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:36,960
tools at your disposal to be able to

165
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,199
understand exactly what's going on in a

166
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,759
specific cyber security discipline um

167
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,600
and you're not necessarily memorizing

168
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,759
all of this this stuff right so

169
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,919
it's just not a realistic gauge of

170
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:49,039
someone's

171
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:50,720
understanding of exactly what's going on

172
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,400
within the space

173
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,039
and then sometimes uh because cyber

174
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:58,479
security is a very very small field

175
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:00,720
folks post a position with a specific

176
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,560
candidate already in mind and already

177
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,960
you know potentially selected so people

178
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,199
are already behind the eight ball and

179
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,240
then

180
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,319
when you start to talk about the actual

181
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,479
positions that are out there

182
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,639
a lot of people point out the fact that

183
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,960
there are no true entry-level positions

184
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,039
within cyber security all positions

185
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:20,880
require experience which is very very

186
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,800
challenging for someone that's just out

187
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,800
of college or someone that might come

188
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,319
straight out of the military with us you

189
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,120
know a small amount of background in

190
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,039
cyber security maybe four years and you

191
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:32,319
know entry level positions they're

192
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:34,000
looking for six eight ten years of

193
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,919
experience and then a lot of hiring

194
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:38,080
managers are unwilling to take a chance

195
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,400
on someone that hasn't done cyber

196
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,400
security in a production environment

197
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,880
before because the demands on cyber

198
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,800
security practitioners are very high

199
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,039
it's a very reactive business so in

200
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:51,280
other words i don't have time to spend

201
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,440
you know training someone to do the job

202
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,120
and that's a you know a really

203
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,520
challenging tact to take when it comes

204
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,840
to cyber security in general if you are

205
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,840
unwilling to train someone into that

206
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,599
unicorn that you're looking for then

207
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:04,800
it's going to be very very challenging

208
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,639
for you to actually find a candidate

209
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,960
that can actually meet your requirements

210
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,639
and a lot of people because cyber

211
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,560
security is also overlooked in board

212
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,599
rooms are underfunded so a lot of times

213
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,160
salaries are well below market value and

214
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,160
that's why unfortunately they cannot be

215
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,479
competitive

216
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,240
and then you talk about the internal

217
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,120
problem right so as an individual

218
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,840
impostor syndrome is a real thing it is

219
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,360
something that plagues a lot of people

220
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,280
within highly technical disciplines

221
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,080
cyber security to be included and so you

222
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,160
start to really doubt yourself when you

223
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,160
see a job description that includes this

224
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,120
huge laundry list of requirements and

225
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,639
you think to yourself can i actually

226
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,720
meet those requirements can i actually

227
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,720
do the job and the challenge sometimes

228
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,639
is a job description is written poorly

229
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,879
right it doesn't really express the

230
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,879
actual skills required to do the job

231
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,680
it's just essentially this this

232
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,520
heightened laundry list of requirements

233
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,360
that that really isn't something that

234
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,000
you actually need to do the job

235
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,680
and then you start to talk about career

236
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,479
path

237
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,560
is there a defined career path for a

238
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,960
cyber security practitioner how many

239
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,720
cyber security practitioners do you know

240
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,599
that are out there that are self-taught

241
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,039
right they don't actually go through

242
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,599
formal training but they can do the job

243
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:20,879
and then just think about it from a

244
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,720
discipline standpoint right when you

245
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,080
look at that word cloud over there to

246
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,280
the right

247
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,440
how many different ways can you go as a

248
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,599
cyber security practitioner and what

249
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:30,639
what are all the different things that

250
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,039
you can do right if you don't have

251
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:36,719
specific skill sets you know in in

252
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,080
understanding and reverse engineering

253
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,640
malware can you be a malware analyst

254
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,958
if you don't understand automation can

255
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,120
you be a sim engineer

256
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,360
a forensic engineer can can those folks

257
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,040
actually come into the discipline

258
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,240
without

259
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,160
10 or 15 years of experience and do the

260
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,680
job and you know my my thoughts about it

261
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,640
is yes

262
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,160
those folks can actually come in with a

263
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,399
baseline and learn the job and they

264
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:01,920
might not necessarily be effective right

265
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,240
away but they can definitely get to a

266
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,800
point where you you can actually do the

267
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,880
job so you know a lot of the things that

268
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,279
we we look at as well is is gatekeeping

269
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:14,240
right people are just lacks to to really

270
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,800
understand exactly how a person thinks

271
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,320
and whether or not they have an analytic

272
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,880
mindset right and so they will

273
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,640
kind of write somebody off without even

274
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,480
thinking about whether or not the person

275
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,560
has the potential to do the job and

276
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,160
that's you know a very poor practice

277
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,160
so really what you want to do as an

278
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,680
individual is you want to start to

279
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,680
attack the problem one of the things

280
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,680
that you can do to attack the problem is

281
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,760
train yourself to a standard set of

282
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,760
skills there are resources that are

283
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,519
available to you

284
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:46,800
by the nature of your demographics right

285
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,480
an organization called women in cyber

286
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,600
security

287
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,040
will actually help

288
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,200
women black women that actually come in

289
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,360
and actually help them to train and it's

290
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,040
very low cost or no cost um sans has i

291
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,920
think no more no less than six different

292
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,880
um academies that they run and they run

293
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,000
those academies based on need right so

294
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,640
if you're affiliated with an hbcu or if

295
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,640
you're a veteran or if you're a woman

296
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,760
you can actually get into those

297
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,399
academies at little to no cost and that

298
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,480
will actually allow you to to to get

299
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,240
certifications that will will

300
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,040
demonstrate your skill and also

301
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,360
help you to actually get your start in

302
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,440
in the field and then when you start to

303
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,519
talk about um things like programming

304
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,839
right black girls code and girls who

305
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,760
code are a lot of different ways that

306
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,160
you can actually get into the field and

307
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,440
learn things that will kind of are going

308
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,760
to help you in your career and do so

309
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:44,399
again in in a low cost or no cost manner

310
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,959
so let's talk about networking

311
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:48,720
so

312
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,040
cyber security is a field that tends to

313
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,760
attract people that are introverts

314
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,440
it just happens that's just the way that

315
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,399
it is and so networking is a bad word to

316
00:10:58,399 --> 00:10:59,839
introverts a lot of people really don't

317
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:02,320
think about networking as a core skill

318
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,399
that they need in order to do their job

319
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,480
but it is absolutely a skill that you

320
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,399
need to do your job

321
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,880
so let's talk about my journey and the

322
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,560
way that i kind of worked when it came

323
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,399
to networking so when i left the

324
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:15,600
military

325
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,000
and i went into consulting consulting is

326
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,480
an area where you have to be very very

327
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,240
networking focused

328
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,680
i went to a lot of different networking

329
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,000
events um when i first started in

330
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,839
consulting and i wasn't really

331
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:29,920
comfortable and i developed a strategy

332
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,240
and that strategy was whenever i got to

333
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,680
a networking event i would immediately

334
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,640
look to find the most gregarious and

335
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,680
most

336
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,680
you know very friendly person in the

337
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,560
place

338
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,079
and i would introduce myself to that

339
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:42,959
person

340
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,959
and typically what happens when you meet

341
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:46,720
someone like that is they tend to drive

342
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,720
the conversation and the great thing

343
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,880
about that is i was able to talk to that

344
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,560
person get to know them

345
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,240
have them get to know me and then i

346
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,000
would use that person to actually meet

347
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,320
everybody else in the room so

348
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,560
it's all about number one

349
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,959
finding a way to get face to face

350
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:04,880
while you know the pandemic has has

351
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,200
really kind of driven us into a a

352
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,519
virtual world getting face to face

353
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:13,839
really allows you to to have more

354
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,680
understanding about what a person's all

355
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,000
about and and really connecting with

356
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
that person when you're face to face

357
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,600
when you are networking as well you want

358
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,880
to make certain that you're offering

359
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,880
help you want to bring something to the

360
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,040
conversation and and you actually have a

361
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,120
significant amount of value i can't tell

362
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,720
you how many mentoring or networking

363
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,360
relationships that i have been in where

364
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,519
that person's senior to me but i can

365
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,120
actually bring value to them by giving

366
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,959
them a different perspective so you know

367
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,079
make certain that you're offering

368
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:42,240
yourself up as help for anyone that's

369
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,079
out there it should be a symbiotic

370
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:46,560
relationship it should go two ways

371
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,839
don't be fearful when it comes to

372
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:49,040
networking

373
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,560
everybody wants to network and the

374
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,320
reason why is because it's incredibly

375
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,040
effective so don't feel like you don't

376
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,639
have anything to offer when you enter

377
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,639
into a networking relationship you want

378
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,160
to make certain that you're patient with

379
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,320
a relationship and that you don't expect

380
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,920
too much right away

381
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,360
people tend to

382
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,120
have a situation where

383
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,000
they

384
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,279
contact they're contacting you and

385
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,040
they might not necessarily have some fun

386
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,720
something for you right away but you

387
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,839
want to make sure that you cultivate

388
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:17,440
that relationship because

389
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,200
six months a year two years down the

390
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,120
road that person might be the person

391
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,040
that gives you the lead that you need in

392
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,880
order to get the job that you really

393
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,959
really want and you want to focus on the

394
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:29,839
relationship right make certain that you

395
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:32,560
are not just in the relationship as an

396
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,079
opportunity to network you are in the

397
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,440
relationship as an opportunity to

398
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,519
potentially help this person out with

399
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,839
something to actually focus on getting

400
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:41,839
to know more about them and having them

401
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:43,760
get to know more about you if you cannot

402
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,880
express

403
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,120
within that relationship exactly what it

404
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,199
is that you want out of your career then

405
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:50,399
it's going to be very very challenging

406
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,399
for someone to help you to get that

407
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:53,760
because if you don't know they

408
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,920
definitely will not know

409
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,399
i'm not a huge fan of social networks

410
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,480
but linkedin and other things like that

411
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,560
are ways that you can actually

412
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,920
use

413
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,839
social networking as a force multiplier

414
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:07,920
so make certain that you are connecting

415
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,160
yourself with people in that medium so

416
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,320
that you're not losing that relationship

417
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,680
and you want to make sure that you

418
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,760
absolutely follow up

419
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,680
a networking should be something that is

420
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,920
a scheduled activity on your calendar

421
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,600
you should be setting aside time for

422
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,600
networking because what it allows you to

423
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,839
do is ensure that you are actually doing

424
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:30,240
it and doing it in a purposeful manner

425
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,560
so if you are brand new to cyber

426
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,160
security you need to understand that you

427
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,839
are not going to hit a home run with

428
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:39,760
your first position in cyber security

429
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,600
it's just not going to happen and the

430
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,399
reason behind that is it's hierarchical

431
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,560
right the way that the cyber security

432
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,560
kill chain works is you're going to have

433
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,639
people in the sock that are doing jobs

434
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,639
that are a little bit more menial and

435
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:54,639
repetitive it's going to happen right so

436
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:56,480
you might have to spend some time in a

437
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,199
security operations center doing

438
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:02,160
long hours 24 by 7 schedules right so

439
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,240
you might have to pay your dues so you

440
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,160
want to be cognizant of that and not try

441
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,320
to hit a home run with that first job

442
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,480
take the entry level position

443
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,240
get your foot in the door and what it's

444
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,760
going to allow you to do is see the

445
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,760
entire cyber security kill chain and

446
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,079
understand hey listen i love working

447
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:19,920
with malware i want to be a malware

448
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,639
analyst or i love working with computer

449
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:24,079
forensics and i want to be a forensic

450
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:26,639
analyst that huge word cloud that i

451
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,560
showed you a couple of slides back it's

452
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,399
going to help you to understand okay

453
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,560
where do i fit in this cyber security

454
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,800
kill chain and what job can i do that's

455
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,320
actually going to energize me and you

456
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,079
want to pick a job not necessarily that

457
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:39,680
you're good at you want to pick a job

458
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,000
that energizes you i see a lot of people

459
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,519
get into cyber security and they get

460
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:44,959
burnt out because they pick something

461
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:46,880
they're good at but they're not having

462
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,639
fun doing what they're doing and it

463
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:50,560
leads to burnout if you pick something

464
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,800
that energizes you you will never work a

465
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,720
day in your life because you're always

466
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,160
doing something that you have a lot of

467
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,639
fun doing

468
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:00,720
so let's talk to

469
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,360
the senior leaders within cyber security

470
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,800
in the room

471
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,079
we have to be willing to reach back and

472
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:10,480
pull people along with us when we get to

473
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,920
a space where we feel like we're

474
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,959
successful and we have some influence

475
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:16,480
unfortunately

476
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,959
it's not an equitable field right you

477
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,160
have a lot of folks that are in the

478
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,240
field that are getting a lot of hands up

479
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,000
from folks that are have been in the

480
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,920
field for an extended period of time and

481
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,839
those folks tend to pull people along

482
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,480
with them that look like them right we

483
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,240
have to do the same you have to be

484
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,480
willing to reach back and pull people

485
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,240
along with you and make certain that

486
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,320
they are on your bench right so if you

487
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,160
know for a fact right that you have

488
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,600
people that you're going to need in the

489
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,680
future because you're building a team

490
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,120
you want to make certain that you you're

491
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,079
staying

492
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,639
in contact with some of the junior folks

493
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,639
that are in the field to ensure that

494
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,399
when you have a position that's that is

495
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:54,480
something that they can slide into that

496
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,399
you can offer that to them give them the

497
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,399
opportunity to come in and apply and

498
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,800
actually have an opportunity to to get

499
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,880
that resume looked at engage with others

500
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,119
within the field and and your peers as

501
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,559
you're a leader if they have

502
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,240
opportunities that are out there you

503
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,520
have to be willing to reach into your

504
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,959
network and say hey listen i think you

00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,760
looking for somebody that that looks

524
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,120
like you

525
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,640
would you reach out to this person

526
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,679
here's their phone number here's your

527
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,760
email address right and consider your

528
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,000
influence so make certain that you when

529
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,919
you have that that connection to someone

530
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:57,840
within your network you are forwarding

531
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,600
that connection along

532
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,039
and you also want to make certain that

533
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:03,360
you are visible within the field right

534
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,240
so

535
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,600
when you have the opportunity to

536
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,080
volunteer and and

537
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,679
provide your expertise you should do

538
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:12,320
that when you have the opportunity to be

539
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,480
visible you should do that

540
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,960
studies have shown that children

541
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,280
do things where they see themselves

542
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,160
represented so if a black child does not

543
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,440
see themselves

544
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,520
in a cyber security leader all they see

545
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,240
is white faces or all they see is male

546
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,640
faces you want to make certain that they

547
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,240
they see other faces right they see

548
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,320
black faces they see female faces within

549
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,760
the field and that's going to be

550
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,600
incredibly beneficial so if you have an

551
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,679
opportunity to volunteer if you have an

552
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:41,440
opportunity to mentor if you have an

553
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,960
opportunity to do something good for the

554
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,919
community you should do that

555
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:47,440
so really you know the things that we

556
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,760
talked about today are the challenge and

557
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,360
the culture associated with cyber

558
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,520
security right there is a you know

559
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,840
implicit bias when it comes to getting

560
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,840
hired within the field and there's a a

561
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,480
culture gap when you talk about getting

562
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,480
folks into cyber security that that are

563
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,640
black faces we talked about upskilling

564
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,039
ways that you can actually improve your

565
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:08,720
odds of actually getting a job within

566
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,799
the field networking is probably the

567
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:13,039
most important thing that we spoke about

568
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:14,799
during this presentation and that's

569
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:16,960
because it's the most effective thing

570
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,400
there are a lot of gatekeepers out there

571
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,160
and one of the ways to get past those

572
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,799
gay people is to use your network and

573
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,080
you want to make certain that you set

574
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,000
the right expectations

575
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,760
as a black face in the field there are

576
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,240
already so many barriers to your entry

577
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,840
you want to make certain that you are

578
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,440
doing the right thing and taking the

579
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,080
right positions to ensure that you have

580
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,480
a chance within the field and as a black

581
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,200
leader you have to reach back and you

582
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,520
have to help others within the field to

583
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,120
ensure that they have opportunities that

584
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,120
you may not necessarily have had

585
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,720

586
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,200

opportunity to reach out to me so if you
