1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,120
in this

2
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:03,280
you know in this context

3
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,920
i want us to see beyond just penetration

4
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:09,120
testers and uh black teamers you know

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,440
whenever hackers are mentioned etiquette

6
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,559
has now mentioned you know many people

7
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:17,039
where their mind goes to is uh oh

8
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:18,320
they're talking about penetration

9
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,400
testers or what they're talking about

10
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,920
you know those guys that breaks into

11
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,320
systems find vulnerabilities and then

12
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,119
you know recommend or remediation for

13
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:28,880
those vulnerabilities

14
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,560
now in this context we are not just

15
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,320
talking about red teamers we are not

16
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,640
just talking about pentesters we are

17
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,239
talking about

18
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,760
black individuals who are subscribed to

19
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,160
a system of growth and over time as

20
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,719
transitioned

21
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:45,840
into

22
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,800
a

23
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,719
a competent

24
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:49,520
uh

25
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,399
competent individuals who are skilled

26
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:54,000
you know

27
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,879
and can bring you know their cyber

28
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,440
security skills to solve you know

29
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,760
security problems

30
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,479
so what what what i mean in short is

31
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:07,439
that i want to create you know black

32
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,400
competent cyber security professionals

33
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,479
who are hackers

34
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,360
in their different domains

35
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,880
that is uh

36
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:21,040
it might be in a grc governance risk and

37
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,159
compliance it might be in you know soc

38
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:25,840
you know security operation center it

39
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,200
might be

40
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,200
other domains like risk management and

41
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,600
the rest but what we are saying is we

42
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,360
want to create more black you know

are competent to deliver you know in

47
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,640
those in their chosen domain not

48
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,960
necessarily in in the

49
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,799
penetration testing domain or in the

50
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:52,880
offensive you know domain it might be in

51
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,799
the defensive domain you know being the

52
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:57,040

whatever team

55
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,560
it is in cyber security so we want to

56
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,600
create

57
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,600
more black individuals who we will

58
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,399
represent the black community in

different systems but the right one and

173
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,080
the ones that will help you to attain as

174
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,759
you know that height as fast as possible

175
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:57,759
okay so cyber security growth systems

176
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,520
encompasses uh platform processes that

177
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,319
process and people the encompasses

178
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:05,919
platform process

179
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:07,759
and people now

180
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,479
it means that for for you to be able to

181
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:12,800
grow

182
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:14,639
when it comes to cyber security for you

183
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,400
to be able to grow

184
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,800
to that height to that level where

185
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,479
you become relevant in the industry

186
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:23,520
where you become you know someone who

187
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,800
people want to listen to who's um whose

188
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,960
opinion matters you know in the industry

189
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,759
you must you know subscribe to these

190
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,520
three um

191
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,720
three uh components of growth systems

192
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,720
which which are platform process and

193
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,879
people which are platform process and

194
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,240
people

195
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,960
so now talking about growth systems you

196
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,120
know

197
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,160
talking about growth systems

198
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,000
we see here

199
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,039
that um you don't just grow you know in

200
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:01,360
cyber security you don't just grow in

201
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,840
that there must be systems that support

202
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,240
you of course i've said that before that

203
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,520
helps you to grow now this system has

204
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,960
components

205
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,440
you know they have components and can

206
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,000
also be said to be a group of the three

207
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,039
categories which is platform process and

208
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:21,039
people now grow system can be a holistic

209
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,840
a model to strategically and sustainably

210
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,840
grow a

211
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,960
career you know strategy

212
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,560
sustainability it means you're strategic

213
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,159
about your growth

214
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,799
and then you are applying components or

215
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,760
systems that help you to sustain a

216
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,080
steady growth so it's not as if you're

217
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,440
getting to a point and then you're

218
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,760
stopping you know you are you are

219
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,440
evolving

220
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,320
you are evolving you are growing and you

221
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,880
you you have a continuous growth you

222
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,880
have a continuous growth and then you

223
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,480
take into consideration

224
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,800
you know key cross

225
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,160
practice linkages

226
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,279
which is between a platform process and

227
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,120
people

228
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,120
what what do i mean i mean you need a

229
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,320
platform to drive you need um

230
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,640
to subject yourself to process

231
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,959
of learning and

232
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:18,959
credibility process of learning and

233
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,839
credibility you know this process is

234
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:25,680
what will help you to sustain uh to to

235
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,080
make your voice head and also to make

236
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,120
people

237
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,680
you know trust you trust the quality of

238
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,839
value that you're releasing you know in

239
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,040
the industry also you need to connect

240
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,600
and learn from people of like mind and

241
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,920
also people who have gone ahead of you

242
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,800
you see now that this is strategic

243
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,880
and then subscribing to this

244
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,680
continuously will help you to sustain a

245
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,320
steady growth in the industry

246
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,880
okay so this growth system is now

247
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,360
divided i divide this into five which

248
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,440
are very very key

249
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,760
you know to launching you into a very

250
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,040
rapid and sustained growth number one is

251
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,640
virtual internship

252
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,959
and then you know categorizing it under

253
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:10,320
the

254
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,519
growth system component it is you know

255
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:16,240
it comes and fit in on that platform

256
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,160
then we have ant on practice

257
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,399
categorizing this under you know the

258
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,880
components of the system when it comes

259
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,720
to you know

260
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,800
growing continue

261
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,680
continuing to grow in the industry and

262
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,640
on practice falls on that platform and

263
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,279
then also uh cyber security

264
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,680
certifications you know falls on that

265
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,839
process while serving communities falls

266
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,560
under people professional networking

267
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,360
like

268
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,560
linkedin

269
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,880
platform that linkedin falls on the

270
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,160
people

271
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,600
you know now having all this

272
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,079
as you as your support system you know

273
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,399
that your growth will be very rapid you

274
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,079
know that your growth will be steady

275
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,800
you'll be able to sustain a substantial

276
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,839
growth

277
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,880
if you subscribe to all this now people

278
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,279
who are starting out cyber starters you

279
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,760
know enthusiasts who are trying to you

280
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,920
know get their food you know grounded in

281
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,560
the industry needs to subscribe to these

282
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,640
systems needs to support themselves with

283
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,120
these systems for them to be able to you

284
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,880
know achieve

285
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,079
more in

286
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,720
a very little period of time

287
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,600
you know and then the first one is

288
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,440
virtual internship you know i know

289
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,480
internship is when you actually

290
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,200
you know uh you uh

291
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,200
you you are taken in

292
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,720
as

293
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,240
like a staff or a walker who is of

294
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,880
course learning on the job and also

295
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,600
delivering values while you learn of

296
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,839
course that is what internship is

297
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:51,600
you you you have

298
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,399
entry level experience or zero to like

299
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,480
one year experience in a particular

300
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,480
field and then

301
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,480
you are trying to get the experience

302
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,240
industry experience in that particular

303
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,279
field

304
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,519
you go for an internship you know go for

305
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,600
an internship where you will learn

306
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,839
while

307
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:12,000
applying what you are learning you know

308
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,200
to also deliver value in whatever

309
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,800
company or industry you find yourself

310
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,120
okay so but now virtual internship

311
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,200
haven't defined what internship is in

312
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,760
that manner vital internship replicates

313
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,079
work at top companies

314
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,200
you know like

315
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,279
like a replication

316
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:30,399
like a

317
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:33,200
a snapshot of work

318
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,920
at companies or top companies and then

319
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,959
it connect enthusiasts or you know

320
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,959
people who are just starting out in the

321
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:43,440
industry to those companies themselves

322
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,800
it means that

323
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,800
with bachelor internship you know cyber

324
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,720
security enthusiasts can leverage on

325
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,200
different cyber security projects you

326
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,160
know the way it is done in the industry

327
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,920
you know it it

328
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,200
it would uh replicate it would um give

329
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,519
you a snapshot of the way

330
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,040
cyber security projects have been done

331
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,760
in the industry and then workloads for

332
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,320
career growth so it means that you'll be

333
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,839
exposed to different projects different

334
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:13,360
workloads

335
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,959
that that replicates real life

336
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:20,399
real life real life you know workloads

337
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,760
that are being done that have been

338
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,480
handled by real staffs in an

339
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,200
organization so that platform

340
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,720
virtual international platform provides

341
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,680
you with you know that opportunity to

342
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,959
interface

343
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:35,760

testimonies of

514
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,600
of different

515
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,760
entry-level

516
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,000
tech

517
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:08,240
individuals who are at the opportunity

518
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,480
you know to be called upon by employers

you know when it comes to deliverables

521
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:16,720
uh

522
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,960
during their virtual internship with

523
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,559
such employers

524
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:23,039
then we have relevant experience

525
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:24,559
you you gain you know you have

526
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:27,039
engagement with activities that sponsors

527

experience in the industry of course you

528
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,320
know uh experience is is is is one of

529
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,360
the challenges that entry-level jobs or

530
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,000
job seekers or cyber security starters

531
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
have in this industry

532
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,159
you know experiences is one of the

533
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:43,919
challenges they do not have industry

534
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:46,080
experience they do not interface with

535
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,840
the production environment where they

536
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,000
would do the real thing you know using

537
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,799
the real technology you know to access

538
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:56,159
real you know organizations network but

539
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:58,400
via you know virtual internship you you

540
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,360
have that opportunity to engage with the

541
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,280
activities that sponsors you know

542
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,840
experience in the industry it means that

543
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,840
if an organization is uploading their

544
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,000
workload the real workload like a

545
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,360
replication of the reworking that they

546
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,679
do on a daily basis it means that for

547
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:16,000
you to complete that task you will gain

548
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,520
such experience that you would have

549
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,640
gained if you actually visited or if you

550
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,600
are you are actually a staff

551
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,720
or an employee in that organization as

552
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,080
an entry-level

553
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,039
individual or as a cyber security system

554
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:33,600
okay then the last one here

555
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,159
advantages of vital internship the last

556
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:38,400
advantage here is you are open to job

557
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,080
opportunities face to face with job

558
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:40,960
opportunities in the partner

559
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,039
organizations so these organizations

560
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:44,960
what they are trying to do is you know

561
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,280
train you expose you to skills and

562
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,039
qualities needed in the industry for you

563
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:51,280
to try and then if you exceed their

564
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,080
expectations

565
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,159
if you exceed their expectations they

566
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:59,039
reach out to you and then they offer you

567

real

568
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:01,840
internship not virtual now real

569
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,520
internships where you can whether

570
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,360
remotely you know intel with them and

571
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,520
work on real life project

572
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,960
you know this

573
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:09,720
will help you

574
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,520
[Music]

575
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,919
this will actually help you

576
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:17,600
to to gain a lot of insight into how

577
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,520
work

578
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,039
is being done

579
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,039
in the industry

580
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:25,360
on deliverables

581
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,360
when it comes to cyber security okay

582
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,600
let's quickly move on to

583
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,559
the next system uh growth system and on

584
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,960
practice hands-on practice uh this

585
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,559
cannot be overemphasized because uh

586
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:40,960
your cyber security status or people who

587
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,440
are just starting out in cyber security

588
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,080
they they no no organization will give

589
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:49,120
them that you know that privilege to you

590
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:49,840
know

591
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,520
lend with um

592
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,520
production environment

593
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,000
you understand so and that is why

594
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,720
a percentage or a certain level of

595
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,440
experience is required even to start as

596
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,600
an entry-level job in cyber security

597
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,919
so it means that employers you know have

598
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:10,320
that you know confidence that at least

599
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,720
you can handle some technologies and

600
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,240
some tools

601
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,960
professionally or ethically so that you

602
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,280
don't you know cause more problems

603
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,360
than what problem you're supposed to

604
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,400
solve okay so and that is why antoni

605
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,520
practice

606
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,480
comes you know very very helpful you

607
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,240
know participating in activities rather

608
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:34,240
than positive passively reading a result

609
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,720
or attending a class

610
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,919
you know

611
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:40,159
so it means that you know just going

612
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:42,880
through a resource you know reading will

613
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,760
not actually give you that feel or give

614
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,279
you that you know

615
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:48,840
that

616
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,440
competence in some activities that

617
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,000
relates to cyber security of course you

618
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,919
you you might not have the opportunity

619
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:57,279
to interface with the production

620
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:59,200
environment where you carry out this

621
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,000
thing in real time or in a real life

622
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,840
project of course but there are

623
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,919
platforms that have been designed you

624
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:07,600
know to replicate

625
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,000
some of this practical

626
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,880
you know practical uh

627
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,440
jobs or tasks you know that helps you to

628
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,480
actually learn the skill and learn how

629
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,400
to handle some of these technologies

630
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,880
ethically and professionally so learning

631
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,679
and growing by doing through

632
00:24:24,679 --> 00:24:27,520
experiencing something so it means that

633
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,200
while you begin to engage hands-on

634
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,360
practice you will begin to learn and

635
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,799
begin to grow by doing so the more you

636
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:36,720
do this is a practice there's a thing

637
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,440
that says practice makes perfect so it

638
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,200
means that while you are doing you can

639
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,320
make all the mistakes you want to make

640
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,600
because this is not a production

641
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,279
environment this is just like a staging

642
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:50,559
environment where you know scenario uh

643
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:52,960
being you know uh

644
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,799
carved out

645
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:58,080
as like a gamified you know stuff has a

646
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,200
gamified uh task that you can actually

647
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,360
play around with so even making mistakes

648
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,760
will not affect any you know any

649
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,000
companies network or any companies

650
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,559
workstation you'll be able to do

651
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:13,840
learn and online and relearn you our own

652
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,760
practice okay this will give cyber

653
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,679
security enthusiasts an opportunity to

654
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:20,000
immense themselves in a learning

655
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,480
environment while putting their acquired

656
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,720
skill to use and building new ones so it

657
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,320
means that you will be in learning

658
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,600
environments where you can immerse

659
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,440
yourself

660
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,880
where you can immerse yourself

661
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,880
to a deep learning experience

662
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,120
you know where you can put your acquired

663
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,159
skills to use and then learn new ones

664
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:45,039
for example cracking a password

665
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:46,400
you know that is

666
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,120
one of uh these abilities ability to

667
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,360
crack past that you need to you know

668
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,279
have as a cyber security professional of

669
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:54,960
course you know because if you come in

670
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,960
andy most especially via penetration

671
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,520
tester you know cracking a password now

672
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,559
you you know no organization as a

673
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:05,360
starter or as an entry

674
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,480
level job and no organization will give

675
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,760
you

676
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:13,360
maybe they are logged on um

677
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,520
environment their website local

678
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,520
environment or login environment for you

679
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,080
to practice password cracking or

680
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,480
practice brute forcing you understand

681
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,600
but as on practice platforms we give you

682
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:29,120
that opportunity to practice with fake

683
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,400
websites

684
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,120
well i don't want to say think let's say

685
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,760
um so that doesn't mean something else

686
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,679
you know

687
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,279
um

688
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:41,919
a simulated yeah simulated it is

689
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:44,240
simulated in a website or simulated

690
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,880
environment that helps you to practice

691
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,799
brute forcing helps you to practice

692
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:50,880
password cracking helps you to use

693
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,279
metasploit helps you to you know break

694
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:56,000
into you know virtual machines you know

695
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,640
bypass authentication and the rest you

696
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,039
do these things which you know

697
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:03,600
having a rest of mind that you are not

698
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,080
compromising a real organization's

699
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,159
network or that you are not having any

700
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,480
negative impact on a reorganization

701
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,799
network

702
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:16,320
okay so benefits of ants on practice

703
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,640
now before you move to benefit of anton

704
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,799
practice you know some of these as for

705
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:24,720
us and practice uh platforms uh

706
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,159
try hack me cyber defenders at the box

707
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:30,559
you know these platforms give you this

708
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:34,240
leverage to be able to perform practical

709
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,520
you know

710
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:39,039
perform practical uh

711
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:41,039
you know hands-on

712
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:43,360
practical hands-on tasks that will help

713
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,200
you to develop the skill and the ability

714
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,320
to do some of these stuffs you know and

715
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:52,720
then this will help you you know to grow

716
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,240
while you are trying to get your food

717
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,320
into the industry

718
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,919
so what are the benefits of hands-on

719
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:00,240
practice cyber security enthusiasts can

720
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,480
develop expertise through a blended

721
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,559
approach of instructor-led videos of

722
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:06,480
course there are instructor-led videos

723
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,320
on some of these platforms that help you

724
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,039
to see how it is being done then you can

725
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:13,679
also replicate the way it has been done

726
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:14,880
learning path

727
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,080
different learning paths and

728
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,559
hands-on exercises

729
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:23,520
hands-on exercises where you do it what

730
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,840
you have learned in instructor-led video

731
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,200
or what you have learned and you walk

732
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,760
through you can actually practice them

733
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,320
you can do them on your own

734
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,559
via hands-on exercises you know cyber

735
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:35,679
security changes that can length

736
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:38,000
adversity through short gamified reward

737
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,360
labs

738
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:43,120
labs that shows you what what um

739
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,279
at an attack

740
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:47,440
what an attack uh looks like it's a

741
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,840
basically attack loops like and how you

742
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,760
know investigating such attacks

743
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,640
investigating um

744
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:58,159
a an attacked website investigating a

745
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:00,320
compromised website uh breaking into

746
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,559
virtual machines using metasploit to get

747
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:03,440
um

748
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,399
to bypass authentication brute forcing

749
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:09,120
and the rest of them so this gamified

750
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,840
reward labs helps you you know to lend

751
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:14,559
these things without compromising a a

752
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:17,360
real organizational network

753
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,200
now cyber security enthusiasts can take

754
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,200
their cyber security skills to the next

755
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,760
level through gamified hands-on training

756
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,600
experience you can take it to the next

757
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,559
level i've seen you know uh entry-level

758
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:31,360
job job job seekers cyber security

759
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,360
status enthusiasts people who are just

760
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,760
starting out i've seen some of them who

761
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,760
are very passionate about you know

762
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,600
handsome practice

763
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,000
who have practiced so much on platforms

764
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
like try help me having you know

765
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,320
becoming you know

766
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,399
part of the top

767
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:51,919
1 percent on the platform

768
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:53,279
you know it means you have learned so

769
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:55,360
much you've got so much skill practical

770
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,159
skills that you can actually use uh

771
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:02,000
during uh real rewards and projects okay

772
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,520
so cyber vendors enthusiasts can

773
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,360
practice validity their skills and

774
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,320
acquire the ones they need you know as

775
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,559
much as also grc

776
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:13,919
governance risk and compliance

777
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:17,039
um compliance and two just also you know

778
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:19,919
uh can also learn from

779
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:22,320
industry experts you know i believe

780
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,360
there are random practices that

781
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,760
in the future will be released with labs

782
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,200
that can help you to develop your

783
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,600
justice skills

784
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,640
okay the third system of growth is cyber

785
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,799
security certifications you know this

786
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:38,799
also cannot be overemphasized you know

787
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:40,559
certification exposes you to

788
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:42,480
cutting-edge specialized and

789
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,880
vendor-neutral technologies so there are

790
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,000
technologies that you use to make

791
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,320
to to to accomplish or to deliver values

792
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,120
help solve security problems in the

793
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,440
industry and then certifications help

794
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,080
you exposes you to some of this you know

795
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,919
modern and cutting edge you know

796
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:03,279
specialized sometimes they are

797
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:05,760
specialized based on the fact that you

798
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,519
know those technologies and these

799
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:08,960
certifications some of those

800
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,559
certifications are supporting certain

801
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:12,000
technologies and then we have dental

802
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
neutral certifications that are that are

803
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,919
not necessarily supporting

804
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:18,000
certain or specialized technology but

805
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,840
covers you know

806
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,519
holistically

807
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:24,640
a certain domain in cyber security so

808
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,919
certain industry skills cannot be

809
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:27,679
cutting without certifications that is

810
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:29,039
very correct

811
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:31,279
certain industry skills

812
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:33,519
can not be gotten without certification

813
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:36,159
for example networking skill of course

814
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:38,240
you can learn online

815
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,480
via moc

816
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,519
massive open online courses of course

817
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:47,120
but for you to get the skill required

818
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:50,399
actually to implement you know some of

819
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:53,039
these you know technologies some of

820
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:54,480
these

821
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,960
tools you need certifications that

822
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,880
teaches you how to improve how the

823
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,120
implementation is for example firewalls

824
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,039
you know there are different

825
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:05,200
types of firewalls or different examples

826
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,919
of hours for from different vendors

827
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:09,039
for you to be able to know the

828
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:10,960
configuration of some of these firewalls

829
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,840
you need to learn it from you know the

830
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:14,960
vendors

831
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,799
who manufacture the firewalls or who

832
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:19,760
develop the firewalls whether logical or

833
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,840
physical you know you know and then you

834
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,399
can start start with free cyber security

835
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:26,240
certifications available and then

836
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,799
migrate to paid ones

837
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:30,720
you can then migrate to paid ones you

838
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,559
know i normally advise you know cyber

839
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:35,200
security statuses or enthusiasts to

840
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,120
start with free ones three ones that

841
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,799
will introduce you to the basics and

842
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:41,279
foundations of cybersecurity basics and

843
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:42,960
foundations of some of these tools and

844
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,960
technologies that will get you informed

845
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,880
theoretically then you can begin to

846
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,519
migrate to paid ones that will actually

847
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:51,679
you know help you to dive deep

848
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:53,200
deep into

849
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,960
some of these technologies and some of

850
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,840
the skills so what certification offers

851
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,000
you

852
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,399
the first things education provides you

853

you know

861
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,519

technologies to actually deliver on

869
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:38,960
those projects on those tasks then

870
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,320
validity

871
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,159
also this showcase

872
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:43,360

technology certain terminologies and

879
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,640
concepts in cyber security this is why

880
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,640
certification is very key

881
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,399
is very key

882
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:04,880
and it is a process that you must you

883
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,559
know subscribe to

884
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:08,079
this is this process that you must

885
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:11,040
subscribe to you keep getting certified

886
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,879
in different techniques of course you

887
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:14,480
might know those technologies you might

888
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,040
know how to use it you might not weird

889
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,639
you know

890
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,719
you know be skilled in using those

891
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:23,280
technologies skilled in you know certain

892
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:27,119
areas of cyber security but of course um

893
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:29,520
before you are able to show any employer

894
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,119
or before you're able to show anybody

895

how skilled you are by doing some of

896
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,560
those things

897
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:37,599
you know certification can go before you

898
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:39,839
to get them informed that you actually

899
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:41,839
know what you are doing that you

900
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:43,679
actually move about those technologies

901
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:45,599
that you actually have

902
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:47,119
the knowledge

903
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:49,040
you know to to carry out those tasks and

00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:00,079
system of support in cyber security

908
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:03,359
communities this is extremely important

909
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:05,520
this is extremely important you know the

first-hand information on trends in

973
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,200
cyber security there are communities

974
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:24,000
risks you know imagine threats the

975
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,839
impact some of these threats are having

know why community contains

981
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:38,640
you know

982
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:41,040

still going there you can have access to

986
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:50,880
you know cyber security leaders service

987
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:54,160
ability subject matter experts

988
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,320

meet or even interact with outside the

991
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,839

outside

1003
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,200
cyber security communities

1004
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,880

i've actually met with them

1013
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:50,160
through communities

1014
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,400
communities brought us together

1015
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,720
i don't even need to you know go through

have access to to to cyber security

1024
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:15,920
experts industry experts you get

1025
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,480
mentorship from them

1026
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:21,760

1029
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,680
that you cannot get outside cyber

1030
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:30,960
security or outside communities

1031
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,960
outside communities

1032
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,400
there are several opportunities i've

1033
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,640
come across i belong to a diary of

1034
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,280
today's communities

1035
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,760
there are a community and there are

1036
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:44,240
several opportunities that i've i've

1037
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:47,520
gotten from that community for for from

1038
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,599
being a member of that community that

1039
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:52,160
normally naturally i would not be able

1040
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,240
to get them if i do not belong to that

1041
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,320
community because sometimes those kind

1042
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,079
of eating opportunities are just you

1043
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:02,079
know shared within the community

1044
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:04,880
i could remember like last year you know

1045
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,200
there are certain you know slots that

1046
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,359
was given to the

1047
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:10,960
to the community lead of diary of

1048
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,640
workers

1049
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:13,920
to the community leader of diary of

1050
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,920
workers for internship internship slots

1051
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,599
like 10 of them

1052
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:20,079
now that kind of opportunity is not

1053
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:23,520
published publicly

1054
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:26,000
so it was it was released within the

1055
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
community and the only people that got

1056
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,960
those slots came from the community

1057
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,800
and i know blacks in cyber security also

1058

and now

1414
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:31,119
the connection all the connections you

1415
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:34,720
are sending out is to somebody who is

1416

00:54:44,799 --> 00:54:47,359
that's misplayed prior misplaced

1422
00:54:47,359 --> 00:54:50,000
priority when it comes to connection you

1423
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,839
know making connections

1424
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,359

how would it mean of course yeah

1426

relationship matters of course but

1427
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:05,599
relevant one matters most

1428
00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:07,599
then communities there are different

1429
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:10,160
communities you can join on linkedin you

1430
