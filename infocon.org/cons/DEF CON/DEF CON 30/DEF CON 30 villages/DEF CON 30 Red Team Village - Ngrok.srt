uh but what i do at ingrock is i make

20
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,039
sure that we are we're telling stories

21
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:50,800
that are useful that we're sharing

22
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,960
documentation that's useful that we're

23
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:53,760
uh

24
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,520
using use cases or sharing use cases

25
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,960
that are useful making sure we're

26
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,440
solving real problems for people as

27
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,120
opposed to convincing them they have

28
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,120
problems they don't actually have

29
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,720
very cool awesome so um yeah again thank

30
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,520
you for uh supporting red team village

31
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,600
just wanted to know why you wanted to be

32
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,280
involved and

33
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,600
like what are your ties to like cyber

34
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,040
security

35
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,360
yeah absolutely so uh myself personally

36
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,640
a good number of people on the ingrock

37
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,439
team

38
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,600
spent years at octa doing single sign-on

39
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,119
identity management so there's a lot of

40
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:27,520
deep identity and security routes there

41
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,520
uh ingrock itself we are we're an active

42
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,200
participant in the ecosystem we've got

43
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,840
millions of users and unfortunately some

44
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,320
portion of them are bad actors if you

45
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,000
caught the trend micro report a few

46
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,320
months ago you know we are a fishing we

47
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,640
are often used in fishing tools uh which

48
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,479
is unfortunate and we're trying to stop

49
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:47,920
that we're trying to work together with

50
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,000
different teams uh to prevent that from

51
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,479
happening so we looked out for guys like

52
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,560
yourself or teams like red team village

53
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,640
and everything to be able to say what

54
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,159
are what are people doing like what's

55
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,240
the bleeding edge of stuff how can we

56
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,159
learn what's going on and we want to

57
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,920
meet the responsible researchers out

58
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,000
there work with you guys more regularly

59
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,799
more

60
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,878
more quickly so that when patterns

61
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,560
happen we can we can go ahead we can

62
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,720
step in we can interrupt them uh we want

63
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,319
to you know work with some of the best

64
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:15,920
and brightest see what they're doing see

65
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,120
what we can learn see how we can

66
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,360
mitigate things and more than anything

67
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,879
like learn about what you're doing in

68
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,360
your day job even outside of ingrock uh

69
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,959
totally unrelated to that sort of thing

70
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:26,879
because yeah you know we we are a major

71
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,480
player in the ecosystem and we want to

72
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,480
be a good citizen about that

73
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,120
definitely yeah no uh it's a great

74
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,160
product really uh nice to use

75
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:36,879
for

76
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:39,200
good security practices it's just

77
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,760
unfortunate it's been abused but

78
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,519
it's it really goes towards the

79
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:45,840
accessibility and availability and how

80
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,760
how awesome the product is the the

81
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,360
tunneling the edge service so um yeah uh

82
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,080
i guess if you could talk about um

83
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,760
you know it's gonna be interesting

84
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,560
discussions with with your team and uh

85
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,879
some of the participants but for someone

86
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:04,239
that isn't really entrenched into cyber

87
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:05,440
security

88
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,920
uh what would you uh say your top three

89
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,760
recommendations are for like starting in

90
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,959
there

91
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,640
oh getting started getting started is

92
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,720
always one of the the hardest things to

93
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,720
think of because i try to rewind back to

94
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,560
when i was doing it

95
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,959
i'd say right now a good principle

96
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:22,480
career principle in general not just

97
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,480
cyber security related is always be

98
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,360
learning uh pick up see what people are

99
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,120
doing see what the latest news reports

100
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,879
are when you when there's a breach that

101
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:32,319
happens there's one going around right

102
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:35,519
now related to sms and uh second factor

103
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,680
read about it learn uh dig into the

104
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,159
postmortem see what's going on see how

105
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,480
uh see how it was perpetrated on the

106
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,920
flip side see how it could have been

107
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,159
mitigated so with the like the sms

108
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,640
attack going on right now uh you you

109
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,400
figure out pretty quickly that otp codes

110
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,640
are not always the best option and in

111
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,280
fact are often not a good option at all

112
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,159
in different circumstances right so

113
00:03:58,159 --> 00:03:59,840
uh so it's it's learning and then

114
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,959
understanding what works and what

115
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,879
doesn't work and then me personally one

116
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,319
of the things that's always served me

117
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,120
well is whenever i'm trying to analyze a

118
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,040
system whether that system is an

119
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,040
organization or whether that is a an

120
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,360
application or whatever i try to dig up

121
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,640
the assumptions

122
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,320
what assumptions did somebody have when

123
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,600
they're building this when they're

124
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,079
designing this this operation

125
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,000
and what happens if those assumptions

126
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,040
are wrong

127
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,720
so how can we test each of them how can

128
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,880
we figure out if this assumption is

129
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,280
wrong what happens then and frankly it's

130
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,160
so much fun because people think oh yeah

131
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,000
this is always going to be the case or

132
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,160
this will never be the case

133
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,520
and then you just tweak it you see

134
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,080
figure out what happens now

135
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,440
awesome yeah no sounds it is fun stuff

136
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,000
and um i'm happy that uh

137
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,520
that's kind of like the

138
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,680
the motto you guys go by and i'm sure at

139
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,360
n grog it's a similar uh mentality um is

140
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,520
ngrok hiring if so

141
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,000
