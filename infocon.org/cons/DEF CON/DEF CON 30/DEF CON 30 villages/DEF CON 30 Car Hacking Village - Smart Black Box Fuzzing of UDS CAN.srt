1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:04,400
hello my name is jun your song

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,879
i'm a second or so of this store

3
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:09,200
and i'm going to present today instead

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,480
of the first

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,000
course

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,840
the title of this talk

7
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,359
is smart blackbox version of udscan

8
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:19,760
it will describe how to do uds came

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:24,240
forgingware in the blackbox environment

10
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,199
so

11
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:26,960
who we are

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,279
we are all editing employee members in

13
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,279
the art crypt

14
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:33,840
autocrypt is a mobility secret company

15
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,480
and recently we focus on the automotive

16
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,040
cyber security

17
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,760
we have conducted body tests and pen

18
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,520
tests with automakers and your suppliers

19
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,320
also currently we are developing a photo

20
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,680
specialized for beakers

21
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,280
so in this talk

22
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,160
i would like to share tips and know-how

23
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,719
that we have experienced during the test

24
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,480
during the following tests in the

25
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,839
automotive industry

26
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:05,920
so

27
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,000
first let's talk about fuzzy tests in

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,040
the automotive industry

29
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,760
automakers often have no choice but to

30
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,080
perform broadcast project

31
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,640
because the tier suppliers don't provide

32
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,840
the calls to automakers

33
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,840
also automatically should test the

34
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,799
complete speaker

35
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,880
since about hundreds of issues are

36
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,680
connected in the comparative speaker it

37
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,400
is very hard to get or issue source

38
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,280
codes and instruments instrument them

39
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,720
and build them again for fuzzing

40
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,600
so

41
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,079
it's inevitable to do break exposing

42
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:47,119
tests in the fig in the completed

43
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:49,680
speaker

44
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,759
however

45
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,840
breakfast protein for vehicle is not

46
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,520
easy

47
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,840
first we cannot do coverage guided

48
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,040
forging because there is no source code

49
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,840
second we cannot crash triage in detail

50
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,880
because we can't connect into the inside

51
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,199
of issues

52
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:12,239
the only way we can monitor status and

53
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,400
obtain the information about the target

54
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,440
beaker

55
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,920
is the width port or harness scan lines

56
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,400
you know we cannot do most things only

57
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,120
using these lines

58
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,760
what we have to do in blackbox project

59
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,440
in this talk we define three black

60
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,760
passporting challenges

61
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,040
first test case generation

62
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,319
in blockbusting coverage guided pausing

63
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,400
is impossible

64
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,200
so we can't monitor code coverage

65
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,640
achieved by

66
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,200
the test case

67
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,280
the heart to generate effective test

68
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,440
case

69
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,720
second fail detection

70
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,120
in blockbusting

71
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,360
there is no way to connect into the

72
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,400
target

73
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,159
by accessing t-shirt or the book board

74
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,159
so we can't directly monitor the

75
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,560
positive process

76
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,480
then how to monitor

77
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,280
target and how to know all to file

78
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,840
issues

79
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,200
third reset

80
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,000
folder should continue to voting even if

81
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,239
the target is there

82
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:29,760
in order to do that

83
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,680
folder should automatically initialize

84
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,440
the target

85
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,159
but again there is no way to connect

86
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,480
into the city

87
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,799
then how to reset where reboot

88
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,319
is ut when

89
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,879
it is there

90
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,720
can you solve these challenges only

91
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:51,359
using the harnessed canines or obd port

92
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,640
so

93
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,360
this talk proposed how to do smart

94
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,720
breakfast protein for uds can

95
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,640
to do smart forcing

96
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,040
we solve the previous challenges by

97
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,760
using uds features

98
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,080
this talk will be a practice guide for

99
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,159
people who want to do

100
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,799
automotive forging test in the black box

101
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,360
settings

102
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,960
this is the review of this presentation

103
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,919
so until now it was introduction

104
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,080
next i'm going to explain how to solve

105
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,000
these challenges

106
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,199
test case generation mail detection

107
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,199
and target reset

108
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,120
and finally i'll conclude the talk

109
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,360
okay let's talk about test case

110
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,400
generation first

111
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,240
test case generation is most important

112
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,960
part of project

113
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,960
we consider three things to generate

114
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,520
effective test case

115
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,360
first

116
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,759
it's efficiency to generate a test case

117
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,199
only for the available uds service

118
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,320
second

119
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,479
photo should transmit the test case

120
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,080
complying with

121
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,880
the message sequence

122
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,160
third

123
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,400
photo should transmit multiple frames

124
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,080
when the test case is locked

125
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,000
to effective forcing further should

126
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,360
consider the above ud scan features

127
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,199
so i'm going to explain the details of

128
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,440
each item in the next slide

129
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,400
before that i'm going to describe the

130
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,479
basic rules of test case generation

131
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:39,280
further set of target issues and

132
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,360
generates test case for each ut service

133
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,639
it means that canadians oxide are fixed

134
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,160
and other fields are mutated

135
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,000
of course you can mutate canida and

136
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,039
service id but it is not effective

137
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:56,080
because

138
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,560
most issues filter wrong can id and

139
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,280
service id

140
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,080
there are

141
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,600
26 services in uds and each service has

142
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,240
their own service id

143
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,039
folder doesn't need to generate and test

144
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:16,240
the old youtube services because

145
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,560
not all services are available in the

146
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,240
issue

147
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,560
in my experience usually about 10

148
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,560
services are available in the issue

149
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,360
so it is efficient to generate test

150
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,479
cases only for the available services in

151
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:36,880
the target issue and test only them

152
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:38,880
so

153
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,280
before start voting

154
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,039
further should check the available

155
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:46,240
services on the target

156
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,720
to check the available service

157
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,120
first further send the verify message

158
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,479
over each uds service

159
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:57,039
this failed message is a request that

160
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:00,479
issue must send the response

161
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:03,520
second folder checks the response to the

162
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,160
total request

163
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,800
then folder decides the availability of

164
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,000
the service depends on the response

165
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,960
if it is a positive response the

166
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,599
services are available

167
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:20,319
or if there is no response

168
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,000
the service is unavailable

169
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,520
and if a negative response is mischief

170
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,400
further decide depends on the negative

171
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,400
response code which is energy

172
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,840
it means the puzzle doesn't decide that

173
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,160
the service is unavailable even if the

174
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,280
negative response is returned

175
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,440
some negative responses are decide as

176
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,440
available

177
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,599
i'm gonna show some examples in the next

178
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,919
slide

179
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,560
first

180
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,120
this is the example of positive response

181
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,360
and no response

182
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,400
if a positive response is returned

183
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,400
we can know that the surface is

184
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,919
available it's

185
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,639
it's very trivial

186
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,720
in this example

187
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,160
further text

188
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,879
diagnostic session control service

189
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,680
when a positive response is returned

190
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,160
we can know that diagonal stick session

191
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,080
control service is available

192
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,000
second there is

193
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,479
if there is no response within the timer

194
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:31,840
period

195
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,839
folder decides that the service is

196
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,240
unavailable

197
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,000
because there is no response to the

198
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,360
messages that should be answered

199
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,799
it means that

200
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,800
the services are unavailable in the

201
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,199
issue

202
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,839
last case is negative response

203
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:53,120
as i said

204
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,959
not all negative responses are

205
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,399
determined as unavailable

206
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,399
photos should decide depending on the

207
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,959
energy

208
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,160
for example solve function not supported

209
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,760
negative response

210
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,720
is decided as available

211
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,800
because it means that

212
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,600
service is available but just the sub

213
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,600
function is wrong

214
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,480
so

215
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,800
if we can fix the sub function value in

216
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,560
is return of positive response

217
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,519
however service not supported

218
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:29,839
negative response is decided as

219
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:32,240
unavailable

220
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,399
because it means the services is not

221
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:37,120
supported

222
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,600
so fuzzer should make a difference

223
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,279
decision for each energy

224
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,720
next

225
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,360
father should consider the message she

226
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,480
calls

227
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,480
when it generates test cases

228
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,640
some music services have the message

229
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,160
sequence

230
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,480
it means that there are some services

231
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,200
that should be proceeded before

232
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,800
the target services is requested

233
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,480
folder should follow the message records

234
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,839
for example

235
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,640
if folder won't test

236
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,760
write memory by address service

237
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,640
the test case should be transmitted

238
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,760
after

239
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,920
both diagonal special control and

240
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,000
security assets are passed

241
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,480
if the puzzle doesn't one of the two

242
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,160
servers

243
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,200
uh if the folder doesn't pass one of the

244
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,480
two services

245
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,240
the target issue

246
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,720
will ignore the right memory by our

247
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,839
address request

248
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:49,120
so the test case becomes meaningless

249
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,320
therefore

250
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,240
for your most

251
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,440
know the uh folder must know the basic

252
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,000
sequence of all

253
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,480
uds services

254
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,079
next photo should also follow the

255
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:08,720
multi-prime transmission rule which is

256
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,440
iso tp

257
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,519
if test case payload exceed a byte the

258
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:18,000
test case should be transmitted in multi

259
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,360
frames

260
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:24,000
and it should follow the isotp rule

261
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,880
the last payload should be divided into

262
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,399
multiple frames

263
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,120
and further should transmit the first

264
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,279
frame and first

265
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:36,000
then photo shoot transmitted consecutive

266
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,720
frames after receiving the

267
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,600
flow of control frame

268
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,399
if fodder doesn't follow this rule and

269
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,880
just transmit the large payload

270
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,040
the target issue will ignore the test

271
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,360
case

272
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:56,560
until now

273
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,160
i talked about test case generation

274
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,880
now i'm gonna talk how to detect or

275
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,639
failure

276
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,760
caused by exposing tests

277
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,240
proposal must decide pass or pay at each

278
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,760
time whenever it sends a test case

279
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:22,160
we introduce four pair criteria

280
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,120
first

281
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,000
no response to the values request

282
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,399
after test case transmission

283
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:31,360
puzzle sends the valid request to the

284
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,399
issue and check the response

285
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,720
if there is no response within a timer

286
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,760
period

287
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,079
it's a fail

288
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:41,920
second

289
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,720
specific negative response to the value

290
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,160
request

291
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,240
if proposal receives some special

292
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,839
negative response

293
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,839
to the valid request it also fail

294
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,920
but not all negative responses are

295
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,920
failed

296
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,079
first and second criteria

297
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:03,040
are same is the way used in the services

298
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,839
availability check

299
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:09,760
third one is a diagnostic trouble code

300
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,600
which is a dtc

301
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,920
occurrence

302
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,120
further periodically checks whether this

303
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,480
occurs

304
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,480
if new ddc occurs

305
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,920
it reports as fail

306
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,480
last one is

307
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,000
usually specified k message occurrence

308
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,880
if

309
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,279
if tester specifies a

310
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,639
can message

311
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,240
as a fail

312
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,120
the further report failed when that came

313
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,519
message occurs

314
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:42,720
so

315
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,279
now i will describe the details of each

316
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:48,279
criteria

317
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:52,639
first one is no response

318
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,839
further sends a valid request after test

319
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:00,959
case transmission to check target state

320
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,920
if there is a positive response it's

321
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,040
passed

322
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,040
but there is no response within the

323
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,959
timer period for the report paid

324
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:14,000
in uds the deposit timer period is 50

325
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
milliseconds

326
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:19,040
next

327
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,240
negative response

328
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,120
if there is a negative response to the

329
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,079
valid request further reports fail

330
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,959
depending on the energy

331
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:32,320
as you need this

332
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,480
service available to check

333
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,160
certain energy are decided as past

334
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,959
not fail

335
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:44,959
this example is the same in the service

336
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:47,359
checking

337
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:49,920
even if some function not supported

338
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,639
negative response is returned

339
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:54,000
it passed

340
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,199
but

341
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:56,000
if

342
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,800
sub is not supported

343
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,320
relative response return is to pay

344
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,760
so far should decide depending on the

345
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,399
energy

346
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,399
third one is

347
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:15,760
diagnostic trouble code

348
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,480
if unused tissue of course

349
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,120
it's failed

350
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,680
father can detect the cross of duty

351
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,959
tissue

352
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:30,560
by sending lead this information request

353
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:33,680
if there is a new ttc

354
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,240
the issue will return the response with

355
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,279
the new this information

356
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:40,880
if there is no

357
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,320
uh no new dtc

358
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,800
it's the past but if there is a utility

359
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,839
occurs

360
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:53,399
it will be paid

361
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,800
last one is usual specified k message

362
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,439
occurrence

363
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,959
tester can specify a certain k message

364
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:06,839
across as

365
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:10,720
fail then if the cam message occurs for

366
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,279
the first page

367
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:16,079
but there is a precondition to use this

368
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:18,160
method

369
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,800
further must be able to monitor the

370
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,519
canvas that the chemist has to be

371
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,240
transmitted

372
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,600
so

373
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,680
this example showed the

374
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,600
overview

375
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,440
for example

376
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,480
when

377
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,759
we do voting tests to the heavy unit

378
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:39,519
issue

379
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:41,600
we can define the following k message

380
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,440
across hva

381
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,040
such as

382
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,240
break break press or accelerate paddle

383
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,079
press

384
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:52,800
or any other chemists that have no

385
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,000
relation with the head unit

386
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:56,959
and

387
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:00,320
can cause the dangerous situation

388
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,120
while driving

389
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,240
it's a kind of custom rule so

390
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:10,559
tester just specify some chem message

391
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:13,839
which are which it

392
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,880
prohibited occurrence

393
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,679
when

394
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:21,520
forging test is conducted

395
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:29,039
but as i said it requires a precondition

396
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:32,720
to monitor the occurrence of k messages

397
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,440
project should be able to monitor the

398
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,000
canvas

399
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:43,200
so we will talk about how to detect the

400
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,440
phase

401
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,080
when they are cursed photos should

402
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,720
initialize the target

403
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,679
now i'm going to talk about how to reset

404
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:57,720
the target issue automatically

405
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,120
uh when they are crossed

406
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,200
it means that

407
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,760
the target is dead or

408
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,200
some trouble occurs

409
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,000
in that case the photo should initialize

410
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
the target to continue the forcing test

411
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,360
if the puzzle cannot initialize

412
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,918
the target

413
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,440
the following test will be terminated or

414
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,679
meaningless tests will be

415
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:34,400
conducted

416
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,320
test can manually initialize sut

417
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,960
but it's a very top task

418
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,160
to do whenever fail occurs

419
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,280
because testers should keep an eye on

420
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,000
the suv while the project

421
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,919
is in progress

422
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:54,080
you know falling test is

423
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,799
a very time consuming

424
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:57,980
task so

425
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:59,280
[Music]

426
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,320
people cannot stay home during the whole

427
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,320
time

428
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,120
so

429
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,760
automatic associated set

430
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:11,000
is required

431
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,039
so this is the

432
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:18,080
result overview left figure shows the

433
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,600
example when there is no automatic reset

434
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,720
and right one shows the

435
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,160
example

436
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,840
when there is a reset process

437
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,200
if possible transmit the test case

438
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,840
even if acut is

439
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,240
there will be a meaningless test

440
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,679
because

441
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:44,160
suit is there

442
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,320
so we should

443
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,240
reset or reboot the target

444
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,440
when valid of course so right figures

445
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,120
show the example with reset

446
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,919
when folder detect fade you need to

447
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:02,720
execute reset process to initialize the

448
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,400
target

449
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,679
after target is reset

450
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:10,960
after reset the test will be

451
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,480
the test will be continued

452
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,960
then how to reset

453
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:25,360
we can use two uds services

454
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,919
issue reset and clear diagnostic

455
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:30,159
information

456
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:32,960
first issue set service

457
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:37,039
can do reset issue

458
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:39,919
if some function value is one

459
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:41,440
hard reset

460
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,880
is proponent

461
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,080
other reset is performing power on or

462
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,679
startup

463
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:50,720
the target the issue

464
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,200
and if the function value is three

465
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,360
software reset is four point

466
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,440
software said is just a restart

467
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,840
duplication program

468
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:00,559
so

469
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:03,600
in my experience harder is said i

470
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,080
recommend hardly said

471
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,480
but sometimes somebody said is also

472
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,720
wrong

473
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,480
and

474
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,120
second one is clear diagnostic

475
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,440
information

476
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,799
service

477
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:21,280
this service clear all

478
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,080
diagnostic trouble code data which is

479
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,480
dtc

480
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,760
you can specify the data you want clear

481
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:33,120
using the parameters

482
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,360
but we

483
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,880
i recommend to clear all these data

484
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,840
by setting all parameters as ff

485
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,520
so in the slide i

486
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,799
just write

487
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:48,559
telephone

488
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:52,639
fourteen and three ff

489
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,960
that's the effect means

490
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,320
uh

491
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,799
choose all

492
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:02,639
all data to be clear

493
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,039
so when

494
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:08,640
as i've said before the folder

495
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,679
can detect fail

496
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:14,080
detecting dtc occurs

497
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,600
so when

498
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,520
dtc occurs

499
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:21,280
each uh the photo detects as va

500
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,320
and then

501
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,880
what should clear that ttc

502
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:29,760
to continue the next test case

503
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:36,080
so now i'm gonna conclude this talk

504
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,000
in automotive industry

505
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,600
black passport

506
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,600
request post testing is often required

507
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,640
to do smart breakdowns pausing

508
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,520
folders should consider the features of

509
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:53,960
ud scan at each step

510
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,440
first test a test case generation

511
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,679
folder should check the available

512
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:01,600
services and

513
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,720
generate test cases for only the

514
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,080
available services

515
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,480
this is more efficient

516
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,440
and the test case should be generated

517
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,320
and transmitted with the consideration

518
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,200
about

519
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,600
percentage sequences

520
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,440
also frame types

521
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:25,679
if a payload is over eight bytes

522
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:28,559
the pedal should be transmitted in

523
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:31,360
multiframes

524
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:33,600
and

525
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,679
there are four methods to detect fail

526
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:40,000
first one is no response

527
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,559
second one is negative response

528
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:43,440
epithet

529
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,400
transmission project will

530
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,039
transmit the valid request

531
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:51,679
and if there is no response or

532
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:54,400
some negative response is returned

533
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,200
then it will be failed

534
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,840
but not all negative responses are fair

535
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,880
so for the shoot decide depends on the

536
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,520
energy

537
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:11,200
and third one is dynamic trouble code

538
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,360
and

539
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,559
also you just specified k message across

540
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:21,440
it should can be failed or criteria

541
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,640
tester can specify some chemistry across

542
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,520
to be obeyed

543
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:29,440
and

544
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,799
in the reset

545
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:32,559
process

546
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:34,720
project should be

547
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,559
project should automatically

548
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:39,760
reset the target

549
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,159
folder can

550
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:45,360
first can reset the issue by using issue

551
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,400
reset

552
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:50,799
and clear diagnostic information service

553
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:54,080
so when photo detector fail

554
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,559
the folder should automatically reset by

555
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:58,080
using both

556
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,600
service

557
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,960
after

558
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,279
a reset is confirmed

559
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:05,520
then folder should

560
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:09,120
transmit the next test case

561
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,840
so this is end of my

562
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,240
presentation

563
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,799
thank you very much

564
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,840
you
