my talk the man in the middle is a short

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,160
history of the black community's battle

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,300
with big Tech and government

6
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,840
surveillance my name is Alexis Hancock

7
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,460
I am the director of engineering at the

8
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:16,320
Electronic Frontier Foundation a

9
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,539
non-profit organization that helps to

protect your digital Liberties online

11
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,840
it's been around for a little over 30

12
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:22,740
years

13
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,840
and I've been a technologist for about

14
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,880
10 so

15
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,500
I've been everything from web

16
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,660
development web developer to assist

17
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,260
admin to software engineer one two three

18
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:35,640
all of those things at different

19
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,960
companies and non-profits and agencies

20
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,700
I currently manage to open source

21
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,280
projects certified and https everywhere

22
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,559
under the encrypt the web initiative at

23
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,239
eff

24
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,760
I also create security education content

25
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,860
when I can and also give security

26
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,780
trainings when I can

27
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:57,360
I also research digital identity

28
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,579
technology internet security policy

29
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:01,079
especially as it pertains to government

30
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:04,019
Network surveillance and censorship and

31
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:05,519
occasional mobile security research

32
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,299
especially on Android

33
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:10,880
so the background to this

34
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,460
was in 2019 I had just finished reading

35
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,080
this book in particular and had a few

36
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,140
questions about how did we successfully

37
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:21,060
circumvent surveillance

38
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,159
and organize with each other

39
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:25,580
between not only plantations but

40
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:28,080
different you know Community Pockets

41
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,000
over time all the way through Jim Crow

42
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,500
when we were under such heavy

43
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,939
surveillance by the government even to

44
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:35,040
this day we still are in many different

45
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,840
respects especially if you are involved

46
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,400
with black lives matter in any way

47
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,460
respect shape or form you'll probably be

48
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,619
have been you know or known someone

49
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:45,119
who's targeted by surveillance in some

50
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,939
way and I will tie all of that to modern

51
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:51,360
times from this period where I had

52
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,520
questions especially since the story

53
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,520
goes over Maroons in particular are the

54
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,560
American Maroons we know about

55
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,200
The Maroons in Jamaica a lot of people

56
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,840
may know about the revolution of Haiti

57
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,820
when they had liberated themselves From

58
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:08,399
Slavery but not much has said it besides

59
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,280
you know the Nat Turner Rebellion or you

60
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,840
know Harper's failure fairy rebellion

61
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,000
and those different bigger events but

62
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,040
those bigger events were all led up to

63
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,599
the smaller events of rebellion and

64
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,239
resistance and those smaller networks

65
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,160
that were created outside of plantations

66
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,800
where enslaved people had ran away and

67
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,239
freed themselves and actually lived

68
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,160
within miles of the plantation that they

69
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,140
ran away from to stay connected with

70
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:37,140
family and so they were able to

71
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,300
traffic information between plantations

72
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,239
with this network especially with

73
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:43,080
enslaved Africans that were a little bit

74
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,200
more mobile like boatmen fairy men cargo

75
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,200
carriers and such of people who were

76
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,819
allowed to at least go Plantation to

77
00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:53,160
Plantation and they were very pivotal in

78
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,340
that network of communication between

79
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:57,420
plantations since they couldn't read and

80
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,099
write they had to pretty much use their

81
00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:01,319
voice and so they had to use a lot of

82
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:04,260
verbal cues and communication and I

83
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,879
think the most prevalent example of this

84
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:08,400
is probably the Underground Railroad

85
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,560
like we're all familiar with that but

86
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,659
that was these actions were like the

87
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:14,519
precursor to help build something like

88
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:17,040
the Underground Railroad because we were

89
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,780
already kind of in practice with that

90
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,580
and then this book confirmed to me

91
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,440
something that was very important that

92
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,180
you know

93
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,640
and slaves being enslaved during this

94
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,879
time was such a traumatic situation for

95
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:32,640
a mass group of people who spoke

96
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,620
different languages you know and and

97
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,000
were able to come together and actually

98
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,700
create a new language Creole and others

99
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,640
um that were similar in dialect and also

100
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,440
the fact that they never gave their

101
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,120
enslavers a night of sleep like never

102
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,819
and it was you know it's not so much as

103
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:50,459
comforting but it's a it's a fact that

104
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:53,280
this book portrays where it's like they

105
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,060
had to outsmart them all the time

106
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:59,400
um their enslavers um the people who

107
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,200
were overseers the people who were

108
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,900
plantation owners like they never really

109
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,000
got to rest while they enacted this

110
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,500
horrible system on this group of people

111
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,540
and I'm glad they never got rest you

112
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,459
know you know I didn't and you don't

113
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:13,080
want these type of people to sleep at

114
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,000
night and they never gave them a wink of

115
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,918
sleep there was always a rebellion there

116
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:18,959
was always something in question and

117
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,358
this book kind of paints that picture of

118
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:24,600
the fact that this type of system

119
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,780
uh was not easy to maintain because

120
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:30,000
people were always organizing always

121
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,800
communicating with each other despite

122
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,080
the fact that All Odds were against them

123
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,199
terrain language written Communications

124
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,660
you know this book kind of highlights

125
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,699
that really powerful story behind the

126
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:44,280
scenes of not just you know defeat but

127
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,320
large amounts of Triumph in a way

128
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,639
because you know we're still here

129
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:50,360
because of them

130
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,419
and a lot of this too was about you know

131
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,400
the fact that hacker history and stuff

132
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,139
doesn't really get told intended with

133
00:04:58,139 --> 00:04:59,820
black history and I think there's

134
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,259
definitely

135
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:04,020
particular reasons for that but I try to

136
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:07,139
group in certain types of situations

137
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:09,360
like wiretapping in the U in the United

138
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,460
States and and the development of the

139
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,080
Telecommunications technology we use

140
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,720
today so wiretapping and public opinion

141
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,199
on wiretapping was largely shaped by how

142
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,380
it was being used and so the first major

143
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:24,300
case of talking about how law

144
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,160
enforcement was using wiretapping was

145
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,919
Olmsted versus United States Olmsted was

146
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:30,479
a bootlegger

147
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:31,440
um this was during the time of

148
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,880
prohibition

149
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,620
and

150
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:37,199
they had deployed wiretapping against

151
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,960
his ring of importing liquor and

152
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,340
shipping it around

153
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,860
so found out that this wiretapping

154
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,720
happened and Olmsted said that his

155
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,400
fourth and fifth amendment rights were

156
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,320
violated in this case in the Supreme

157
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,240
Court had determined that his fourth and

158
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,280
fifth rights were not violated This was

159
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,720
later overturned by a different case

160
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,360
cats versus United States I believe but

161
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,699
that was decades later

162
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:02,520
but this particular case in 28

163
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,080
um 1928

164
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,419
was very important in terms of shaping

165
00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:08,639
public opinion on why law enforcement

166
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,100
wanted to wire to happen and saying like

167
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,919
hey look the moral fabric of America is

168
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,380
in danger and in this terminology and

169
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:18,419
this usage of moral Fabric and Public

170
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:20,639
Safety gets used a lot when talking

171
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,039
about law enforcement and wiretapping

172
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:27,120
and then you go into 40s which was you

173
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,940
know that was during wartime and a lot

174
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:32,280
of uh secret Communications tactics were

175
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,259
developed during that time of war and

176
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:36,060
then you push forward into the 50s and

177
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,680
60s and I point out this particular

178
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,860
movie called The called wiretapper it

179
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:43,440
was based off a really real person uh

180
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,380
named Jim Vaughn Jim Voss sorry

181
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,600
and Jim boss used to be more engaged

182
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,039
with criminal activities and then later

183
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:53,039
on help the police to wiretap because he

184
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:54,720
had very Innovative devices he would

185
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,340
create where they didn't even need to

186
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,620
break an enter in order to wire to app

187
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:02,160
so they called on him and then this

188
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,080
movie was kind of created based off his

189
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,360
character and his story because he later

190
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,360
on converted to being a Christian and

191
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,460
there's even I think the movie ends on a

192
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,139
Billy Graham speech if you're familiar

193
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:15,060
with Billy Graham and

194
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:18,000
um televangelist type

195
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,160
um days so

196
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,160
this all kind of pushed wiretapping into

197
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,380
like you can he used it for good and

198
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:27,979
wiretapping is almost like an act of God

199
00:07:27,979 --> 00:07:31,919
uh in order to uh increase morality in

200
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,080
the United States and maintain you know

201
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,919
safety and morality and then you had in

202
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,020
1968 where that same language of

203
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:42,660
morality and safety gets pushed into the

204
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:44,460
Omnibus crime and control Crime Control

205
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:46,740
and Safe Streets act where a particular

206
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:49,740
Senator uh Senator McClellan

207
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,960
from Arkansas he was a democrat in the

208
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:55,020
staunch segregationist and he had pushed

209
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,220
for

210
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:59,580
this act to have Provisions for law

211
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,199
enforcement to be able to wiretap

212
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,780
because he wanted to stop the

213
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:06,900
extremist groups out there who were in

214
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,300
extremist groups also including you know

215
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,860
anyone involved with the Civil Rights

216
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,360
Movement whether it be black panther or

217
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,620
not

218
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:17,400
um to to be investigated without you

219
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,800
know warrant you know have a warrantless

220
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,780
search with wiretapping without being

221
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,879
notified without being served a warrant

222
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:26,520
so this act was very pivotal in that

223
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,800
case where I I don't even believe that

224
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,360
the senator even knew about cointel pro

225
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,680
at the time that wasn't Declassified

226
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,599
until later because the FBI was already

227
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,200
doing warrantless wiretapping by 68 like

228
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,019
we all sort of know that but this act

229
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,519
kind of put in the public light and put

230
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,320
it on the books as a very legal thing to

231
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,300
do rather than a behind the scenes

232
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,459
operation by the FBI

233
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:49,019
and there was a lot of adjacent public

234
00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:50,820
sentiments that came along with

235
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:53,700
extremist black groups it was also a lot

236
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,980
of Red Scare Tactics of you know getting

237
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,680
organized crime there was even a lot of

238
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,440
um you know push to catch gamblers and

239
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,040
and and and even other like mob crimes

240
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,660
stuff like that to actually deploy

241
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:09,120
wiretapping on other organized crime and

242
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,980
kind of like reel in

243
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:13,740
um these groups through wiretapping and

244
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:16,140
showing these cases as like see look

245
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,180
this is a good example of wiretapping

246
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:21,620
and this is why we need to do this

247
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:24,660
and so tracking back to 1964 and the

248
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:25,920
type of technology that the black

249
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,660
community used at the time in order to

250
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:30,180
organize in order to get information out

251
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:32,519
there was radio and phone so

252
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:34,440
radio is most often used for public

253
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,620
information and phone lines uh were used

254
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,600
for communication between civil rights

255
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,140
organizations

256
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,560
and so this goes into a t or the

257
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,220
localism uh the term Ma Bell if you

258
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:52,500
remember hearing that term growing up

259
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:56,040
but Ma Bell was the Monopoly the ATT

260
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,519
um dominated telecommunications from

261
00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:02,779
1877 to 1983 that's over a century so

262
00:10:02,779 --> 00:10:05,279
they were just one entity that the

263
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,560
police could go to and ask okay we need

264
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:10,140
a wiretap and you know there was no

265
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,940
other companies go through two at the

266
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:14,579
time was just them and you still see

267
00:10:14,579 --> 00:10:15,899
remnants of the Bell System today

268
00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:18,000
because at T still exists today today

269
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,279
even after the Anti-Trust Bank breakup

270
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:23,700
so they're still doing fine and then you

271
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:26,279
have Bellow system breakup and it was

272
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:27,720
kind of like kept this naming Convention

273
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,360
of Bell so Pacific Bell southern belle

274
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:33,019
southern belle was very much so involved

275
00:10:33,019 --> 00:10:36,180
in a lot of the the issues with the

276
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,920
Civil Rights Movement being wiretapped

277
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,180
and so

278
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,100
even after the breakup it was still an

279
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,399
issue

280
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:48,360
uh at T from 1960 to 1975 to push in a

281
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,399
little bit of phone freak history they

282
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,040
were aware about blue boxes in 1961 if

283
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,019
you're not aware what blue boxes are

284
00:10:55,019 --> 00:10:57,360
they are multi-frequency communication

285
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,339
devices that

286
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:01,860
um mimic that dial tone numbers that you

287
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:04,079
hear and were able to get free phone

288
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,240
calls essentially and phone freaks were

289
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,220
very into this device during this time

290
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:10,140
especially through 64. it was very

291
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,339
popular then

292
00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:13,440
and

293
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,779
they ran Mass recordings they being ATT

294
00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:19,620
to detect this toll fraud but they

295
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,720
didn't really want to admit to

296
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,339
um but publicly say like Hey we're

297
00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:25,500
recording without consent and they

298
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,700
didn't want a lot of heat on them so

299
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,680
they had a very cozy relationship with

300
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,260
law enforcement to make sure that you

301
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,820
know I guess the heat was off of them

302
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,620
because they look we are helping the

303
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:38,160
police catch the bad guys so they you

304
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,620
know allowed them to wire tap whenever

305
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:42,480
warrantless search whenever on phone

306
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,060
calls and in exchange it kind of kept

307
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:46,860
Anti-Trust at Bay because they were

308
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,360
pretty much seen as friends of the law

309
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,459
and it didn't keep it long for that long

310
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:52,139
keep it off for that long you know

311
00:11:52,139 --> 00:11:54,899
because in 83 they were broken up but

312
00:11:54,899 --> 00:11:57,180
still they were still um

313
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:00,779
very much so involved with uh keeping

314
00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:02,940
their power in this way of of forging

315
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:04,320
their relationship with the law which

316
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,200
became turbulent in the 90s but I will

317
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,880
get to that point a little bit later

318
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,680
and so a particular type of phone line

319
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,600
that was used by civil rights

320
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,279
organization was called wide area

321
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,680
telephone service or watch phone lines

322
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,160
they would have precursor to 800 numbers

323
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,320
back then long distance even through the

324
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,880
90s was still considered pretty

325
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,639
expensive and even then during the 60s

326
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:31,740
50s and 60s like County day County calls

327
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,779
were built as long distance so if you

328
00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:35,160
had an in-watch phone line that your

329
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,200
company or organization paid for anyone

330
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,760
making that call to that phone line

331
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,560
would

332
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,300
um it would be for free for them and you

333
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,339
would have to pay pay a flat monthly fee

334
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:47,100
to maintain that line so organizations

335
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:51,480
with watch lines were Snick core kofo

336
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,240
seoc or organizations that we probably

337
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,639
are very familiar with in passing of

338
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,500
learning about civil rights organizing

339
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,240
and

340
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,579
and they use these lines in order to get

341
00:13:02,579 --> 00:13:04,860
information out there fast

342
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,660
between each other and now it actually

343
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,820
have like something called Watts reports

344
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,980
which is widely documented and you can

345
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:13,200
see like the list dump online of watch

346
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,480
reports from different organizations

347
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,040
and how they were able to communicate

348
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,260
with each other they had a format for

349
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:20,519
these things

350
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:22,440
um and they were intaken usually by

351
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,800
black women on the phones 24 7. these

352
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,480
lives were open so they were taking in

353
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,579
shifts very very organized work on

354
00:13:29,579 --> 00:13:31,380
getting information out there in between

355
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:33,420
each other

356
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:36,420
so traditional oops sorry traditional

357
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:37,680
phone pairing

358
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,720
uh you know you would go through a

359
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,399
switchboard operator at the time this is

360
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:42,920
when things are a little bit more manual

361
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,300
and that switchboard operator was

362
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,579
usually a white woman and if that

363
00:13:47,579 --> 00:13:49,560
particular person wasn't really

364
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,839
uh sympathetic to the civil rights

365
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:53,519
movement in any way shape or form and

366
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:54,540
knew that you were trying to make a call

367
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,820
to like say kofo they could just end the

368
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,440
call drop the call and the other person

369
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,699
here then would never receive the

370
00:13:59,699 --> 00:14:01,980
information and often they would

371
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:04,440
possibly tip off law enforcement in the

372
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,060
area too saying that you know there's a

373
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:08,699
high mass volume of requests going to

374
00:14:08,699 --> 00:14:09,839
this organization for a particular

375
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,100
reason you might want to watch out for

376
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,079
this organization so this was often

377
00:14:13,079 --> 00:14:15,839
unprompted uh

378
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:18,360
you know relationship with the law at

379
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:22,019
the time to capture activity by civil

380
00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:24,300
rights organizations

381
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,100
and so with

382
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,920
phone calls and Watts what ended up

383
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,720
happening was you could bypass the

384
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,579
switchboard operator and directly call

385
00:14:32,579 --> 00:14:35,040
to organization now I did not stop

386
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,100
wiretapping but a lot of coded language

387
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:41,420
was used to kind of confuse the police

388
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:43,920
and it would buy them enough time

389
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,019
because watch phone lines weren't

390
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:47,820
necessarily for

391
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,399
um I would say Communications for a

392
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:53,220
long-term events or things it was to get

393
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,779
quick information out there so while

394
00:14:54,779 --> 00:14:56,279
they're trying to figure out what these

395
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:58,740
with this coded language meant they

396
00:14:58,740 --> 00:14:59,760
could get the information to the

397
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,800
organization even if they were being

398
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,060
recorded

399
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:05,040
because the important thing was making

400
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,300
sure that the other person or the

401
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:09,740
organization knew what was going on

402
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:12,720
and so the ways that the FBI wiretap

403
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,240
during cointelpro they would just do

404
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:18,300
like Dragnet records of tapped phone

405
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:21,420
lines uh either through the company and

406
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,339
it would have like a pair number with um

407
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:27,060
the cable connecting to the FBI in the

408
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,980
field office or

409
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:32,040
they would do install microphones like

410
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,259
on the target's home device

411
00:15:34,259 --> 00:15:37,100
so what ended up happening there was

412
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,360
wiretaps were a lot more easier to

413
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,980
accomplish because it didn't need to

414
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:43,740
enter a target's home even though that

415
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,779
was fairly easy to do most times anyway

416
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:50,180
the wiretaps were just more convenient

417
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:54,540
so there was interference a lot with you

418
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,279
know organizations and this was actually

419
00:15:56,279 --> 00:15:58,560
a watch report that had talked about how

420
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,920
a kofo office was denied installation of

421
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,899
a phone from a local Telephone Company

422
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:06,779
because what ended up happening here was

423
00:16:06,779 --> 00:16:10,860
during this time a lot of people

424
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:12,000
um

425
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,519
didn't exactly own the phone think about

426
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:16,199
it as like internet service providers

427
00:16:16,199 --> 00:16:18,000
and the way they provide modems but it's

428
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,040
not your modem in particular you just

429
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,500
rent it out and you could use your own

430
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,199
modem in your own router if you knew how

431
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:27,360
to like pair it up with your system and

432
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,639
had the know-how to configure it but a

433
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:31,740
lot of people just accept the modem

434
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,899
router device that's from their ISP

435
00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:35,940
today and just run it out so it's kind

436
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,680
of like the same system here where you

437
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,540
would get a phone from the Bell System

438
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,759
and it would say like property of Bill

439
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:44,339
system under under the phone like emboss

440
00:16:44,339 --> 00:16:45,720
under the phone so it's kind of like the

441
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,060
same relationship so they could deny

442
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:50,399
um installing their device even though

443
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:53,279
any telephone probably could have done

444
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:56,120
pretty well but it had to be a telephone

445
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,800
established by the company

446
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,899
um so

447
00:16:59,899 --> 00:17:02,220
this watch report was interesting to see

448
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:05,099
like kind of how this was going on still

449
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:09,059
how unprompted by law enforcement

450
00:17:09,059 --> 00:17:10,619
different entities like

451
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:12,839
telecommunications companies were still

452
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:14,039
interfering with the Civil Rights

453
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:16,400
Movement

454
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:18,780
and you know if you're familiar with the

455
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:21,059
cyber security term you know man in the

456
00:17:21,059 --> 00:17:22,980
middle or monster in the middle attacks

457
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:24,780
used to be very literal during this time

458
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:27,480
where you know Clan Knight Riders and

459
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,740
such would

460
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:32,280
you know be out here and actually attack

461
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,140
different organizations burn down

462
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:35,940
buildings things of that nature or even

463
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,919
kill someone you know these watch

464
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:40,140
reports get really dark some of it gets

465
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:41,880
a little light where it's like okay

466
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,520
um someone was doing a protest to

467
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,580
someone was denied admission somewhere

468
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:50,760
to a car you know being lit on fire

469
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,260
outside someone's home to someone

470
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:54,660
showing up missing or dead it was very

471
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:57,419
dark stuff so this information was

472
00:17:57,419 --> 00:17:59,400
important to get out quickly and that

473
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,200
was the main goal of watch phone lines

474
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,700
and it literally saved lives

475
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,280
and so going back to like a small take

476
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,380
on radio really quickly

477
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,360
um radio was very important too because

478
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,799
it got out

479
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:16,380
public information quickly to a lot of

480
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:18,900
people and so voter education especially

481
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,880
when people weren't really quite aware

482
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,860
of how to register or how to circumvent

483
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,299
the dangers that involved with

484
00:18:24,299 --> 00:18:26,100
registering to vote because it was very

485
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,140
high dangers on that where people were

486
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,700
getting threatened so this information

487
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,440
was sent out there's like hey watch out

488
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,260
for this group on this corner or hey

489
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,120
there's these police blocks then they

490
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,919
would coded language we could come in

491
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,140
again saying traffic you know jams or

492
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:42,179
something like that in order to kind of

493
00:18:42,179 --> 00:18:44,220
you know give the feeling that they

494
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,020
weren't necessarily guiding anything

495
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:48,660
with protests but still giving that

496
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:51,000
indicator to the community and black

497
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,740
owned radio stations were definitely

498
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,419
interfered with as well but they did

499
00:18:54,419 --> 00:18:57,000
sustain during this time and so you had

500
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,580
this like picture illustrates from a

501
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:01,679
really good book that

502
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:04,320
I also read called radio and a struggle

503
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,059
for civil rights in the South by Brian

504
00:19:06,059 --> 00:19:08,460
Ward and his pictures from that book

505
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:10,380
where it kind of described the

506
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:13,260
relationship between werd Atlanta black

507
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:16,140
owned radio and SCLC office sharing the

508
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:19,500
same building so that was a very very um

509
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,840
a great visual indicator of like what

510
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,160
the relationship looked like at this

511
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,559
time despite the the barriers and the

512
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:27,980
issues

513
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,220
and so I want to talk about really

514
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:31,020
quickly the permit systems from times of

515
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:34,919
fear so you have crying you know being

516
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:36,660
you know you have to stop crime you have

517
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:38,820
to stop socialists or commies like

518
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:41,160
during the Red Scare Tactics during like

519
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,620
the labor movement and then

520
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:46,679
you know the language shifts to a war on

521
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:50,940
something War on Drugs war on terror

522
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:54,000
um were war on nouns but it was very

523
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,360
much war on people and so when you talk

524
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,179
about war this is a very specific case

525
00:20:00,179 --> 00:20:02,340
of War time

526
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,140
you know tactics and things that

527
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,419
wouldn't normally be deployed during

528
00:20:06,419 --> 00:20:10,380
saying times of quote unquote peace

529
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:12,500
um

530
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,940
War on Drugs you know had entire

531
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:17,700
organizations created like dea war and

532
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,740
Terror you had a DHS and then subsequent

533
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:22,140
organizations out of the DHS like TSA

534
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:25,260
and ice and you know you have all of

535
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:27,720
this language that sort of justify

536
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:31,200
creation of systems and also Justified

537
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,600
um immense amounts of a warrantless

538
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,600
search in different areas and even you

539
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,360
even if you push on tours today you'll

540
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,179
have things like the Patriot Act Right

541
00:20:42,179 --> 00:20:44,760
um that definitely was invoked to just

542
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,400
bypass all means of like warrants or any

543
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:51,179
sort of procedure or due process so

544
00:20:51,179 --> 00:20:53,460
you look at this language shifting to

545
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:56,640
war on a noun but it's very much so

546
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,059
beyond that it's not about the drugs it

547
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:01,919
wasn't about the terror itself it was

548
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:04,320
about monitoring or justifying a group

549
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,840
of people and it would be justified if

550
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,460
it was just like oh we're just catching

551
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:11,100
the bad guys but then you see something

552
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,380
like the war and Terror where it goes

553
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:16,500
from trying to surveil bad guys to just

554
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,980
monitoring mocks wholesale wiretapping

555
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:22,500
Moss Communications and then you really

556
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,500
have to question you know who is framed

557
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:29,159
as the person perpetuating the fear and

558
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:32,039
who is the entity trying to push towards

559
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:34,380
even more violation of privacy and

560
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:37,200
rights so it's really hard to come back

561
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,760
from this type of thing where you're

562
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,860
establishing permanent systems during

563
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:42,659
times of like immense amount of like

564
00:21:42,659 --> 00:21:45,059
fear for Public Safety and we really do

565
00:21:45,059 --> 00:21:46,799
have to check ourselves during these

566
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:49,320
times of fear on what are we pushing for

567
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,900
exactly when we ask for or certain

568
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:54,860
solutions to things

569
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,360
and so I want to talk about really

570
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,520
quickly a case that the FBI had used to

571
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,980
try to expand wiretapping Beyond just

572
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:04,860
requesting telecommunications so a lot

573
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:06,600
of you may be familiar with the case

574
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,880
that happened where there was like this

575
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,559
huge Crackdown of computer hackers in

576
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:13,200
the early 90s and

577
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,580
you know groups like masters of

578
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:16,260
deception and such were like brought in

579
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:18,020
they were wiretapped

580
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:21,240
for their Communications as well and

581
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,340
then what ended up happening is like the

582
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,559
FBI got involved wiretapped them and say

583
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:27,480
look like this case was successful

584
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,940
because we caught the bad guys we caught

585
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:32,220
the computer hackers and we did it

586
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:34,620
through wiretapping so therefore every

587
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:38,340
device in any home should be installed

588
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:39,960
with some sort of wiretapping mechanism

589
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,960
that we can just tap into ad hoc and

590
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,360
that was a really extreme request that

591
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,039
the Electronic Frontier Foundation had

592
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:48,419
spoke on

593
00:22:48,419 --> 00:22:49,980
um Mike Godwin at the time was staff

594
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:52,500
Council and had talked about it with the

595
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,720
actual representative um with the FBI

596
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,299
who had problems with um eff's take on

597
00:22:57,299 --> 00:23:00,840
denying um the FBI's requests to do this

598
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,340
and the telecommunications companies

599
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:05,280
weren't really uh too too hype about

600
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,080
this either so it was really interesting

601
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,520
to kind of see them finally sort of

602
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,320
fight back for once and this is post

603
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,799
Anti-Trust breakup so this was not as

604
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:15,360
much money and resources to do this

605
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,039
stuff so this type of wiretapping was

606
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,240
getting a little expensive and

607
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,980
installing device on everybody's phone

608
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:21,900
was probably very expensive so I'm going

609
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,039
to go ahead and say it was more about

610
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:24,539
money than privacy from the

611
00:23:24,539 --> 00:23:27,600
Telecommunications standpoint but this

612
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,039
is kind of like the precursor to what's

613
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:31,380
going on today with the FBI too so I

614
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:33,539
wanted to talk about that so today you

615
00:23:33,539 --> 00:23:35,940
have back doors on encryption or the

616
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:37,980
requests from the FBI for back doors on

617
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,179
encryption

618
00:23:39,179 --> 00:23:41,580
once again large companies like apple

619
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:45,120
Google who you know dominate iOS

620
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,179
dominate the the creation of Android and

621
00:23:48,179 --> 00:23:50,840
especially with iPhone so stay um Apple

622
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:53,039
controls the operating system and the

623
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:56,520
manufacturing of the phone FBI I went to

624
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,440
Apple many times to tell them like hey

625
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,900
give us a key that will allow us to tap

626
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:04,080
into phones ad hoc and so far they have

627
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,400
denied them this

628
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,080
um but this is yet another private

629
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,419
company that's left up to their own

630
00:24:09,419 --> 00:24:11,940
whims on why they would say no or not

631
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,620
thankfully a lot of public pressure has

632
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,779
been put on Apple to uphold their word

633
00:24:15,779 --> 00:24:18,120
but then you see that the FBI is like

634
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,760
labeling encryption as a barrier to good

635
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,279
police work like this is not giving us a

636
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:25,500
key to see people's Communications uh ad

637
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:29,880
hoc is is not good for our own work and

638
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,440
not being able to catch the bad guys

639
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,360
even though the FBI has been fully

640
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,600
capable of being able to do this without

641
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,760
needing to break encryption tools for

642
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,419
everyone

643
00:24:39,419 --> 00:24:41,520
uh there's a recent story that came out

644
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,340
in motherboard by advice about how they

645
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:46,799
had a whole operation that that pushed

646
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:48,539
out you know fake encrypted messaging

647
00:24:48,539 --> 00:24:50,279
apps that actually was secretly managed

648
00:24:50,279 --> 00:24:53,400
by the FBI called in nam and so they are

649
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,260
able to do police work without breaking

650
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,179
encryption for everyone and that's not

651
00:24:57,179 --> 00:24:58,980
the main point here because the fact

652
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:02,220
that not bad guys aren't the only ones

653
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:03,480
using encryption it's journalists

654
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,220
activists and if we don't have

655
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:06,419
encryption it actually at least

656
00:25:06,419 --> 00:25:09,000
everyone's susceptible to bad guys even

657
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,520
more especially people who get targeted

658
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,039
by different governments or people who

659
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:15,900
get targeted by different groups or even

660
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:18,480
their abusive partner so you have to

661
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,679
really think about these things when

662
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:21,240
you're talking about and framing things

663
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,799
as we're trying to save the children

664
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:24,900
we're trying to save

665
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:27,240
um you know people from Mass amounts of

666
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,100
crime they're trying to save them and

667
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,440
help them

668
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:34,140
not be targeted by the bad guys but for

669
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:35,880
the most part if you break encryption

670
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,380
for everyone you actually make everyone

671
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:41,900
more susceptible to said back eyes

672
00:25:42,299 --> 00:25:44,640
and so I talk about this framing the FBI

673
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,679
actually monitored heavily monitored

674
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:49,200
Freddie gray protests with spy planes

675
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,020
and this was really like unprecedented

676
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:54,240
in a certain way because of the type of

677
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,279
aircraft that was deployed

678
00:25:56,279 --> 00:25:57,720
um the way that they had monitored

679
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,100
people who were involved with the

680
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,779
Freddie gray protests and these are

681
00:26:00,779 --> 00:26:02,700
people who weren't an extremist group

682
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:05,100
these were people who were

683
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,380
out there trying to get Justice for a

684
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:08,520
particular person that was shot by

685
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,080
police and the fact that the FBI got

686
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,940
involved and also framed them as the bad

687
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:14,220
guys and tried to like push this

688
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:17,159
narrative onto people exercising their

689
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:19,620
right to protest it makes you it gives

690
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:21,059
you pause when they make requests to

691
00:26:21,059 --> 00:26:23,059
break encryption

692
00:26:23,059 --> 00:26:25,380
and you know so black movements and

693
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:27,059
encryption have you know developed a

694
00:26:27,059 --> 00:26:28,620
really close relationship because this

695
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,419
technology is out there now for our

696
00:26:30,419 --> 00:26:32,880
usage and we can use it to organize with

697
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,820
each other and so this um byline says

698
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:37,140
that the Civil Rights activist cited

699
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:39,720
with apple against the FBI Apple Feud

700
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,640
but I would wouldn't say that they sided

701
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,679
with apple I would say that they are

702
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:46,440
enforcing the notion that no company no

703
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:49,559
matter who controls the keys should be

704
00:26:49,559 --> 00:26:52,980
um saying yes to the FBI to just give a

705
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:54,840
back door and if that company is Apple

706
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:57,000
or Google then that's the company that

707
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,919
you're going to go after to actually

708
00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:01,260
uphold their word because we've all know

709
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:03,179
that we have the most experience here

710
00:27:03,179 --> 00:27:05,220
with cointelpro and we don't want to go

711
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:07,559
back to that realm again where we have

712
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:09,179
end-to-end encryption and then they're

713
00:27:09,179 --> 00:27:12,120
using quote unquote once again black

714
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,620
extremist groups

715
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:16,679
um to to kind of push towards this Mass

716
00:27:16,679 --> 00:27:19,080
surveillance again in order to keep the

717
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,779
public safe and so signal downloads have

718
00:27:21,779 --> 00:27:24,419
been way up and and we don't want to um

719
00:27:24,419 --> 00:27:26,279
impede on those things because in the

720
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:27,779
end encryption is for everyone it's not

721
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:30,000
just for nerds it's for activists it's

722
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,620
for journalists it's for people who are

723
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:34,200
trying to organize and we want to be

724
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,779
able to keep using these tools despite

725
00:27:36,779 --> 00:27:38,760
the fact that

726
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,440
um we're being targeted and monitored

727
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,840
for trying to organize for our rights

728
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:46,200
and so a lot of people may be out there

729
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,120
you know this group can be I guess can

730
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,860
considered you know hackers in this

731
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:52,020
group right and there's some people that

732
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:54,000
have been making calls like black owned

733
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,919
communication apps but if you do make an

734
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:57,720
app that's targeted towards our

735
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,520
community I also want you to know you

736
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,020
will also be susceptible to law

737
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:03,720
enforcement requests so be very careful

738
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:06,960
about creating stuff as well that you

739
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,500
know have etee encryption because you

740
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,659
will see requests come your way as well

741
00:28:12,659 --> 00:28:14,220
and then you'll have to answer the same

742
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:16,260
question that Apple has answered do we

743
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:18,419
succumb to law enforcement or want that

744
00:28:18,419 --> 00:28:20,700
consequence and also shout out to crypto

745
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,500
Harlem for teaching the community about

746
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,659
signal and tour and other devices out

747
00:28:24,659 --> 00:28:27,000
there and tools

748
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,220
so my takeaways from this uh you know

749
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:30,779
open Protocols are very important

750
00:28:30,779 --> 00:28:32,520
interoperability with different systems

751
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,140
are very important because obviously

752
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:36,000
monopolistic communication companies are

753
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,860
a single point of failure

754
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:39,659
um and and this that's been a big thing

755
00:28:39,659 --> 00:28:41,460
for me when I did this research was like

756
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:43,679
wow you know this is kind of like the

757
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:45,179
trend that I'm seeing because it's very

758
00:28:45,179 --> 00:28:48,480
easy to ask one entity versus many so

759
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,340
open protocols and interoptability with

760
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:52,140
those Protocols are very important

761
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:53,640
because then other people can create

762
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,980
their own systems outside of big Tech or

763
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:58,740
whoever in the future is considered too

764
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:00,600
big to fail right and then black

765
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,100
movements have already always been

766
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:05,399
monitored but the main point of them

767
00:29:05,399 --> 00:29:07,320
was getting information out there

768
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,600
quickly to the community and so that was

769
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,340
something for me to always consider is

770
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:13,799
like what is the safest fastest way for

771
00:29:13,799 --> 00:29:16,679
me information to be spread so

772
00:29:16,679 --> 00:29:18,120
I want people to think on these things

773
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:21,059
and think about how our ancestors were

774
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:23,640
you know surveilled but also they use

775
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,620
the technology at hand to get

776
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:27,659
information to each other in order to

777
00:29:27,659 --> 00:29:29,940
keep each other safe and they did such

778
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:32,100
an amazing job despite the fact that

779
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:34,740
cointelpro was in full force in the 60s

780
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:37,919
right so thank you for coming to this

781
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:40,320
talk um I hope you all learned a little

782
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,779
something out of this I try to merge in

783
00:29:42,779 --> 00:29:44,159
a little bit of hacker history here too

784
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:46,559
to kind of see the parallels and I hope

785
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:50,039
you also go out there and push for

786
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:52,320
encryption or etee on normal

787
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,840
Communications for everyday lives thank

788
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:57,379
you so much
