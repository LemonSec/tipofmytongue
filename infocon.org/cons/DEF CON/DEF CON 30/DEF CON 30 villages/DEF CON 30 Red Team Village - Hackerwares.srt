00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,320
horsepower Villages around the world I

13
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,420
have been doing this for past six years

14
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,940
now and we are present across 10

15

countries so far including from them

16
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,540
conferences like Defcon China Port blue

17
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:43,200
root con hack in the box and a lot of

18
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,140
resized and stuff uh really excited to

19

22
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,140
thanks for being here uh we were a fan

23
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:56,940
of your previous work

24
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,460
um we we I think you reached out to us a

25
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,500
few few weeks months ago and we got

26
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,180
started on our project uh can you can

27
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:04,080
you tell me a little bit more about

28
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,560
yourself and and your company

29
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,700
yeah um so I uh basically

30
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,720
um uh

31
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,180
right so I I have been doing the badges

32
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,759
for the last five six years and

33
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:22,439
um for

34
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:24,840
for like first half of like first two

35
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,479
three years I was just doing it uh

36
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:28,860
I haven't been doing budgets for five

37
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,540
six years and

38
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:34,560
um I I uh do it under the my startup

39
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,840
name hackaway because software hardware

40
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,180
and we have cover

41
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:40,200
um

42
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,280
um so uh our goal is to bring uh

43
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,520
creativity in electronics uh in the

44
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,280
sense uh we engage the conference

45
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,040
attendees in learning something as well

46
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,640
as uh gaining the skill sets of Beats

47
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,719
soldering or the cryptography or uh all

48
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,159
sort of stuff Badges of

49
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,619
multi-dimensional tools uh deep learning

50
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:07,500
or just hacking stuff around and that's

51
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,318
what we want to encourage we want to

52
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:13,260
encourage experiential learning and uh

53
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,980
we just wanna our goal is to bring

54
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:19,099
education in the most fun way possible

55
00:02:19,099 --> 00:02:23,819
and make it creative

56
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:25,980
I I know especially with this year uh

57
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,360
supply chain is something that we were

58
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,580
concerned about uh how do you uh how do

59
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,500
you mitigate against that with uh the

60
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,040
way that you do your Manufacturing

61
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,739
um so uh because we have been working

62
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:39,780
with the same team for last five six

63
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,400
years so

64
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,760
um we have just grown so much more

65
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,940
um like kind of hard coded into knowing

66
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:50,220
what is coming and trying to be prepared

67
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:53,599
well ahead of the time uh we have very

68
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:59,819
trustworthy uh suppliers and uh uh and

69
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:03,360
they are just ready to help and at any

70
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:08,459
point we want and uh in general it has

71
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:10,739
affected in some ways for example the

72
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:13,580
the component prices have gone little up

73
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:18,840
uh but uh but yeah we do have we still

74
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:23,220
do enjoy uh that uh relationship with us

75
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,799
with our suppliers and

76
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:29,340
um in general everyone is uh super happy

77
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,980
to work on the badges because it's among

78
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,980
the most fun and creative projects uh uh

79
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,959
maybe take on so it's not just surprise

80
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:42,000
but even the fabrication unit workers or

81
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,700
uh

82
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:46,620
anyone in the entire process uh super

83
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:49,200
excited to work on the badges and uh

84
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,060
there's always a lot of fun to do it and

85
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:54,780
uh so we have grown to work super hard

86
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:58,200
um on the uh on on every single thing

87
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,060
that sounds fun especially with how

88
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:03,060
creative the Badgers can get how did uh

89
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,739
how did you get started with uh with

90
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:07,939
making badges in the first place

91
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,260
um so like roughly six years ago I was

92
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,540
doing Engineering in India

93
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:15,840
um in the college and uh my plan was I

94
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,478
will drop out of college

95
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:21,899
um uh when I make some kind of an app or

96
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:23,460
when I build like a security company

97
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,380
either after two

98
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:26,160
um

99
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,360
never had plan to graduate but I

100
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:34,020
and is in the second year uh I saw this

101
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:37,979
uh really awesome badges in Defcon and

102
00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:41,460
then I asked the Indian conferences guys

103
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:44,160
that hey Defcon has this really cool

104
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,560
stuff why don't you guys make it and

105
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,600
then they just they were like we have

106
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,820
endless list of problems to go through

107
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:53,040
before even think about making these

108
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,820
things but if you are interested maybe

109
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:59,820
we can support you in some way and while

110
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:02,940
it was just like a random is actually a

111
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:05,340
Facebook comment to be honest it's not

112
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,860
even like a like a promise or anything

113
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:11,280
but I kind of took it really seriously

114
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,800
and I dropped out of college next day

115
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,199
and then I went to fabrication and it

116
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:18,380
again had no idea about

117
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:20,820
manufacturing or anything so I just go

118
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,759
to the fabrication and I'm like uh

119
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,740
here's the thing I just want to spend a

120
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,840
day here I will see everything that's

121
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,840
going on here and I just wanna learn

122
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,880
about what all there is and that's how I

123
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,460
learned about PCB Manufacturing in that

124
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,400
day and then eventually all the assembly

125
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,340
and all the processes in it so we did

126
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,199
end up making badges for that Indian

127
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:44,940
conference and then

128
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:48,000
eventually we made this that's how I

129
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,820
started making Badges and then

130
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,800
um we made it for a few more conferences

131
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,800
and then uh we hosted a hardware Village

132
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,319
in Defcon uh it was called bucks Village

133
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:01,740
Defcon China to be process and

134
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:05,520
um I think that's when we sort of uh

135
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,860
kind of became more known I guess

136
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:13,199
so that year we ended up going to many

137
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,120
many countries where we hosted Harbor

138
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,120
Villages and made badges for Converses

139
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:22,380
so yeah that's how I started um so so I

140
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,960
dropped out of college because I wasn't

141
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,440
finding it creative and fun and it was

142
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,080
kind of killing my passion for computers

143
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,880
but um

144
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,039
to be honest and when I started making

145
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:36,660
by just I was just like I don't wanna

146
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:38,880
like I know what I don't want to do and

147
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,800
I don't want to do college

148
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,539
um I just want to do cool stuff and then

149
00:06:42,539 --> 00:06:45,180
that's how I started but it was only

150
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:47,280
over the course of time that I realized

151
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,259
I kind of solved my own problem which

152
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:51,960
was that uh the education back in

153
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,680
college wasn't that creative and fun and

154
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:59,280
badges became that way of learning that

155
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,099
uh that's this is how electronics and

156
00:07:02,099 --> 00:07:04,620
this is how programming and this is how

157
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:07,080
Hardware hacking can get creative and

158
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:10,340
can get fun and uh it that's how you

159
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:13,919
that how it it promised a lot of

160
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,780
creativity and

161
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,699
um all the out of the box thinking and

162
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:19,319
all with all the things you can do with

163
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:21,259
it so I kind of solved my own problem

164
00:07:21,259 --> 00:07:23,520
that's what I realized over the course

165
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,460
of years actually

166
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,979
now that is just like a phenomenal story

167
00:07:28,979 --> 00:07:31,620
uh and I know definitely uh when it came

168
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,479
to the red team Village and like trying

169
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:34,800
to figure out like what our next steps

170
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,300
were you know we we knew we wanted to

171
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,160
build a badge uh so we were just kind of

172
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,139
scouring out there like who who actually

173
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:42,300
makes these badges uh just trying to

174
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,800
find like you know a good vendor and

175
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,720
everything uh and when I you know

176
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,340
scrolled across their website and I was

177
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:48,479
looking at some of the previous badges

178
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,099
you made you know that that's where like

179
00:07:50,099 --> 00:07:52,020
I found you know like I had I had one of

180
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,699
your badges you know uh and I'd use the

181
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:55,139
previously so I was like oh man this is

182
00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:56,639
this is the person we have to go through

183
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,400
uh someone's like super easy uh to kind

184
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,720
of make that decision

185
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,400
and definitely like the process working

186
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,460
with you uh in regards to the design and

187
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,840
you know a lot of your creativity and

188
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,699
like your suggestions you know like you

189
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:09,900
know obviously we have ideas and

190
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,759
everything but uh you know you really

191
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:12,900
kind of helped us through that process

192
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,400
and kind of designed like a really

193
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,080
awesome product

194
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,539
um so like I just you know can we take a

195
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:19,620
moment kind of get like a little sneak

196
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,539
peek of this badge and just kind of you

197
00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:24,000
know see some of it uh maybe maybe tease

198
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,819
some of the uh special kind of things on

199
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:27,900
it

200
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:32,360
sure so uh we started with uh just your

201
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:35,099
red team logo because that was a really

202
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:37,559
easy Choice uh we didn't have to install

203
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:40,380
too much on the design uh The Moment I

204
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:44,339
Saw the red team logo uh uh I was like

205
00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:46,920
okay so the eyes can be the ladies that

206
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,140
glow somehow and then I saw their horns

207
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:50,700
and then I was like I want to do

208
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,680
something with those two and that's how

209
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,019
you ended up with this form factor and

210
00:08:55,019 --> 00:08:56,279
uh

211
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:58,560
this is the badge mode again don't see

212
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,300
too much of it there's a lot of Clues

213
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:04,019
but uh yeah if I can hold close to yeah

214
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:06,300
so it looks amazing

215
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:10,500
um yeah so we uh so first thing first

216
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,980
was how do we just get these shades of

217
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:17,339
uh uh the your logo accurate and that

218
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:19,260
process you know a bit of trial and

219
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:22,920
error and but uh eventually uh we did

220
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,500
get it right basically with the shades

221
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,959
with the PCB Shades in here you can see

222
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:29,580
there are darker red shades and then

223
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:33,540
lighter shades uh the kind of uh the way

224
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:36,180
we attained It Is by like double

225
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,880
layering the color so uh the darker

226
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,060
shade has a black uh shade underneath

227
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:44,580
and then we put the red on top of it so

228
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,980
it becomes darker and then the light one

229
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:49,440
has a white layer and then on top of it

230
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,160
we put the radius so we do all sort of

231
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,240
this

232
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,060
uh experimentation all the time trying

233
00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:00,600
to do uh trying to do something uh cool

234
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,480
with the PCB fabrication

235
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:08,040
um so uh it was uh so we have been

236
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,380
making these badges on atmega like the

237
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:13,079
one you have shown uh which was kind of

238
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:15,300
like this it is your package

239
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,760
um so we have been making uh this guy

240
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,880
just on at Mega platform so

241
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,940
we have for most of our time we have a

242
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:26,940
stick to at Mega chips because uh one

243
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:30,240
they were available easily uh from where

244
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,019
I come from and second was that

245
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:36,779
um there were a lot easier to teach

246
00:10:36,779 --> 00:10:39,959
people how to program it

247
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:42,660
um and that's how we ended up with our

248
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:45,720
other risk one of our recent badges was

249
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:50,640
this one if I get you yeah so

250
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,399
this one is powered with the atmega as

251
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:56,040
well if you can see uh

252
00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:00,260
uh and naturally the the choice uh

253
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:04,440
was same initially because as the sale

254
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,899
in in programming world is if something

255
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:09,060
was don't change it

256
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:11,100
um but

257
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,260
um but yeah it started with ATM guys but

258
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:16,800
then I really didn't want to put like

259
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,079
make people connect to all these ISP

260
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:22,140
headers and and try to because you still

261
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:25,260
need bit of um electronic knowledge to

262
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:28,560
connect this properly and then you will

263
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,860
feel again nobody has all this is nobody

264
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,600
moves around with ISB programmer unless

265
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,420
you're a hardware hacker so

266
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:39,480
so my focus was let's make a badge that

267
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:42,420
people can just plug it with micro USB

268
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:45,860
and then they can connect it with their

269
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:48,839
terminal serial monitor or terminal

270
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:53,160
which are one they want and uh the badge

271
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,720
will load up some really cool puzzles

272
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,399
and it will do something

273
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,579
so that's what eventually manage we have

274
00:11:59,579 --> 00:12:02,519
this micro USB cable so people can just

275
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:04,680
plug in there if you have Android cables

276
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,120
I guess old Android code you can just

277
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:09,120
plug it and you can fire up either

278
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,720
Arduino ID and Arduino ID has inbuilt uh

279
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,100
serial monitor

280
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,260
you can use that or you can if you're on

281
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:19,260
Linux you can just use terminal and get

282
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:21,959
on it's pretty simple again we'll write

283
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:24,540
tutorial to guide people how to do it

284
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:29,940
guide uh help anyone to do it and uh so

285
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:32,940
when you connect the badge it prints out

286
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:35,940
some really cool artwork and then it

287
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:40,139
asks you a puzzle and if you answer all

288
00:12:40,139 --> 00:12:43,920
the puzzles correct it's gonna turn

289
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,720
all daily design

290
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,600
and this is essentially your bragging

291
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,360
rights to roam around in conference and

292
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,399
just let people know you have solved the

293
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:54,779
person

294
00:12:54,779 --> 00:12:55,560
um

295
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:58,620
just something uh symbol we wanted to do

296
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,380
so uh

297
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:03,779
we did extensive testing on even M1 Max

298
00:13:03,779 --> 00:13:06,660
so it works on M1 Max too so technically

299
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,260
it should work on pretty much everything

300
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:12,480
so that's that's what I uh what we set

301
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,440
out to do

302
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,440
um when I thought about such a badge

303
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,500
that I really wanted to people to just

304
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,540
use their existing cables and connect to

305
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,459
their system and it will just fire up

306
00:13:23,459 --> 00:13:26,519
all the stuff they need Without You

307
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:28,680
particularly knowing the intricate

308
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,720
details of electronics are Hardware

309
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,279
hacking

310
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:35,720
um and that's what I thought about and

311
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,579
uh that's how I got in touch with you

312
00:13:38,579 --> 00:13:41,519
guys I think not too long ago it was

313
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,940
what April end of April yeah it was the

314
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:48,360
end of April and then uh we spent some

315
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,360
time uh figuring out the circuits we

316
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,279
actually uh

317
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,100
for the first time we have we are not

318
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,800
using at Mega chips anymore uh we are

319
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,680
using chips from a company called uh

320
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,260
above if I'm pronouncing it right a b o

321
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,519
v

322
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:08,240
um and then we are we have also soldered

323
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,720
ch340g for USB to serial communication

324
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:17,519
uh so uh I'm excited to see

325
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:18,199
um

326
00:14:18,199 --> 00:14:20,699
how how many people solve the challenge

327
00:14:20,699 --> 00:14:22,560
first of all

328
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,079
um that's the most straightforward thing

329
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:27,420
you can do and then I am also going to

330
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:30,120
see how people uh do a bit of Hardware

331
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,180
hacking on this and we have some pins

332
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:36,839
left on the back side if you do some

333
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:38,839
full trickery or black magic it should

334
00:14:38,839 --> 00:14:42,120
probably do something cool and I would

335
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:45,720
really love to see how people do rest of

336
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,459
the things like all the cool stuff with

337
00:14:47,459 --> 00:14:50,940
it in Hardware hacking as well uh so

338
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:53,220
that's that was our plan uh to make a

339
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:58,019
make a A Bad City of sort of uh thing

340
00:14:58,019 --> 00:15:01,920
and then uh make it as is just plug me

341
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,399
to your system and it will do something

342
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:09,839
very uh very cool uh very cool response

343
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:10,800
so

344
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,800
this is what happens when all challenges

345
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,440
are solved when no challenges are solved

346
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,600
it will just blink out

347
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,519
in D4 this is a default mode it will

348
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:24,440
just blink out some stuff uh

349
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,680
and we'll have a challenge uh for

350
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,180
everyone that's going to be there on

351
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,399
site uh we we will have a pre-order go

352
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,220
out but uh but for the folks who solve

353
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:37,199
it first uh we'll have we'll have prizes

354
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,120
for them uh so because you're swinging

355
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,779
by the red team Village uh in the

356
00:15:41,779 --> 00:15:44,040
flamingo uh is where we're going to be

357
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,600
staked out we'll have we'll have some

358
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,160
prizes set aside for those that are

359
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,440
first to solve

360
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,380
yeah I am I'm excited to see how it goes

361
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:53,940
yeah

362
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,860
we are definitely looking forward to it

363
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,480
and then uh you know one of the things

364
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,740
that you were nice enough to share is

365
00:15:58,740 --> 00:15:59,639
that you're gonna be coming out this

366
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:01,320
year so what are you know what are some

367
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,519
of your plans for Defcon when you come

368
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:04,680
out this year

369
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:08,100
um so uh this is the first patch that I

370
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:12,720
have made for uh Defcon this year uh

371
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,899
last year we made a batch for uh uh

372
00:16:15,899 --> 00:16:20,220
Defcon uh Village called uh blockchain

373
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:21,199
Village

374
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:24,000
and uh wait

375
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,100
foreign

376
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:29,100
so

377
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:33,360
right so last year we made a batch for

378
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,360
uh uh blockchain Village in Defcon and

379
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:40,500
it was dispatch if you can see here it

380
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,980
was dispatch actually uh

381
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:46,320
so uh

382
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,800
my other plans are I may be making one

383
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,720
or two other badges

384
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,720
um not for a village but on a on a

385
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,120
personal level because I uh I think I

386
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,820
have something very cool to do with the

387
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:02,759
badges this year so yeah this was made

388
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:04,140
for blockchain Village they are not

389
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:06,079
hosting it this year but

390
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:09,839
uh I'm trying to so last year when we

391
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,179
made this patch it had a one of the

392
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:15,179
Challenge from the CTF and then it has a

393
00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:16,679
binary mode where you can put those

394
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:18,419
binaries and see if your answer is right

395
00:17:18,419 --> 00:17:20,160
and then if it's right it leads you to

396
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,020
something cool

397
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:25,020
um so uh this year we are taking it one

398
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:27,179
notch forward and trying to make a

399
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:29,400
version

400
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,140
three actually we are on Watcher three

401
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:34,799
now uh the other this one's the version

402
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:38,160
two it has little more

403
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,020
um

404
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:42,539
kind of it has little more content in

405
00:17:42,539 --> 00:17:45,960
terms of challenges so we are now on to

406
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:50,160
level three of this and uh we may or may

407
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,700
not have some cool challenges on web3

408
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,980
um as well as some other good stuff so

409
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:59,039
I'm planning to have that badge around

410
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:02,400
as well in Defcon for for first time and

411
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,820
see how it goes and it may be a pin I

412
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:09,299
don't know which was which went popular

413
00:18:09,299 --> 00:18:11,580
couple of years ago or something in

414
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:14,280
Vegas so

415
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,440

416
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,660
