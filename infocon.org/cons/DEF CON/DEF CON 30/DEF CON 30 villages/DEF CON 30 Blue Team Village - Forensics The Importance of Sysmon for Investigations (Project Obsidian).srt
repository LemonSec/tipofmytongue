1
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:03,840
okay

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:04,880
so

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,720
this talk

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,280
is about the importance of sysmon for

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:13,519
investigations i'm extreme paper clip

6
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:15,679
who am i exactly

7
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:18,800
uh digital forensics nerd linux geek

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,680
infosec dork lifelong student of

9
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,039
everything

10
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,199
amateur history buff

11
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:26,880
spice fanatic

12
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,519
loads of fun

13
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,760
can follow me on the twitters but i'm

14
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,760
probably not that interesting

15
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,079
okay

16
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,920
what this talk is and is not about this

17
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:40,800
talk

18
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,200
is not an advanced guide to sysmod

19
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,079
what it is is basically just a simple

20
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,600
intro to sysmon

21
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,360
here are a few things we're going to

22
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,840
talk about we'll talk about what is

23
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,440
sysmon

24
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,480
an overview of the sysmon events

25
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,359
what is the sysmond config

26
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,479
we'll go over installing sysmon

27
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:07,360
and

28
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,600
some examples of my favorite sysmon

29
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,680
events

30
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,320
and some sysmon examples

31
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,439
for an investigation

32
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,799
okay

33
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:19,920
so

34
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,240
you're probably asking

35
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,520
really just cut to the chase and tell me

36
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,040
what is sysmon

37
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,560
okay here's the tldr sysmond creates the

38
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,240
logs that should exist in windows event

39
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,840
logs by default but do not

40
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,119
sysmon creates very unique

41
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:42,960
event logs

42
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,399
specific

43
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,720
for security

44
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,520
think of it that way

45
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,920
here are some more facts about sysmont

46
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,920
so sysmon was created by mark

47
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,840
versinofiche and

48
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,200
thomas garnier

49
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,119
sysmon is short for system monitor

50
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,240
it's a part of the windows sys internal

51
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,080
suite

52
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,000
sysmon was released in 2014

53
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,440
it's

54
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,959
both a device driver and a service

55
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,400
and it creates logs specifically for

56
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,840
security you could say

57
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,599
a very brief history of susman so it was

58
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,560
first released in 2014

59
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,040
and it initially only had three event

60
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,480
ids

61
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,800
event id 1 which shows a process created

62
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,959
event id 2 a process changed a file

63
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,800
creation time

64
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,440
and event id 3

65
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,280
network connection

66
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,879
this little snippet right here i took

67
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,319
from web archive

68
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,640
so

69
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,120
let's do it an overview here of the

70
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,840
sysmon events

71
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,360
the latest version of cisvan has 26

72
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,599
event ids

73
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,800
it's version 1334

74
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,319
and you can see there that it was

75
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:13,920
released in may

76
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,119
of 2022

77
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,879
note also there's also a version

78
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,440
for linux this is a recent thing

79
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,519
uh i'm not gonna go into it on this talk

80
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,879
but it's something you should check out

81
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,519
okay let's go over all the events don't

82
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:33,360
worry we're not gonna

83
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,599
deep dive into these

84
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,040
uh so

85
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,720
let's do an overview of these events

86
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,400
event id one

87
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,959
uh like like i said earlier is process

88
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,840
creation

89
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,599
um some of the things that are really

90
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:50,239
interesting about event id one uh of

91
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:51,840
course

92
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,080
two things in my opinion

93
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,799
uh you're gonna see the command line

94
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:59,040
and you're gonna get a hash

95
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,480
of the process

96
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,480
it's very useful

97
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,159
uh i'm going to go a little quicker here

98
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:07,200
so event id 2 the process change the

99
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,319
file creation time

100
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,439
event id 3 network connection

101
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,439
very useful

102
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,478
uh event id4 sysmont service state

103
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:21,440
changed you can see in the logs if

104
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,160
sysmon was stopped

105
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,639
and of course event id5 the process was

106
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,639
terminated

107
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,840
event id 6 a driver was loaded

108
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,560
this can be very useful

109
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,000
event id 7 is image loaded now think of

110
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,040
an image not like a picture uh in the

111
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,960
world of cis1 an image is basically

112
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,840
an executable

113
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:54,840
event id 8 is create remote thread

114
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,639
uh

115
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,720
event id 9 raw access read

116
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,560
event id 10 process access now event id

117
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,800
10 can be very useful

118
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,360
uh for example at

119
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,080
finding evidence of

120
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,560
mimikats

121
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,600
event id 11 file create

122
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,240
also very useful you can see something

123
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,160
like if a

124
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,759
somebody ran

125
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,720
a query to

126
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,360
spit out

127
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,639
bloodhound.zip you're going to see that

128
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,680
that file was created

129
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:36,639
event id 12 these are you could think of

130
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:41,039
these as the the registry events here

131
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,600
this one event id 12 talks about an

132
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,800
object was created or deleted

133
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,720
in the registry

134
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,120
event id 13

135
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,600
shows you the value that was set

136
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,080
for that registry event and event id 14.

137
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,880
it talks about the key and value rename

138
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,840
event id 15

139
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,759
create stream hash

140
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,240
um i'll be honest

141
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,520
this one hasn't really rocked my world

142
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,360
um

143
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:21,240
event id 16 service configuration change

144
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,360
and these two below are the pipe

145
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,639
events

146
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,800
so you can see a pipe created event id

147
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:34,680
17 and event id 18 pipe connected

148
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,440
this can be very useful in malware

149
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,840
hunting

150
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,800
event id 19 wmi event these are you

151
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,960
could think of these as the wmi events

152
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,240
here

153
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,840
you can show event id 19 shows activity

154
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,039
detected

155
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:52,720
event id 20

156
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,360
shows uh

157
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,039
the

158
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:59,440
consumer

159
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,840
event id

160
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,400
21

161
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,120
consumer to filter

162
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,880
fun stuff

163
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:11,039
okay event id 22 dns event very cool i

164
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:12,720
love that one

165
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,080
event id 23 file deleted

166
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,360
uh

167
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,479
can be

168
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,199
useful it can also be noisy

169
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,960
uh event id 24 clipboard change

170
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,000
uh i'll be honest this one

171
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,360
kind of baffles me uh event id 25

172
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,520
process tampering

173
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,520
a good example of that is

174
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,639
if you

175
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,720
hollow

176
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,880
an executable

177
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,599
let's see there's a tool called shelter

178
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:45,599
that can help you do that where you can

179
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:50,160
insert a payload for a shell code

180
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,599
event id 26 file delete detected it

181
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,599
could be good and it could be bad

182
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:58,879
because it can be very noisy

183
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,080
okay those are the events so

184
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,599
let's talk about

185
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,680
the sysmon config

186
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,039
the sysfont config here's the tldr the

187
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:10,800
syswan config

188
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,960
is an xml file that defines what gets

189
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:19,360
included or excluded in the sysmon logs

190
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,800
it's a big deal

191
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,080
why

192
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,800
why is it a big deal

193
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,720
well okay so it's a big deal because if

194
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,360
your sysmon config is configured to be

195
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,120
over inclusive

196
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,958
you could end up with a lot of garbage

197
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,479
data

198
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:40,958
that can make it hard to analyze and and

199
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,518
sift through

200
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,600
and uh on the other hand if you exclude

201
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,720
too much

202
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,959
in your sysmond config then you're

203
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:52,640
probably going to be missing valuable

204
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,959
log data that could potentially contain

205
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,560
evidence of malicious activity

206
00:08:59,120 --> 00:08:59,920
so

207
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,519
here's

208
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:04,080
a few facts about the sysmond config

209
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,399
here's a little example um

210
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:09,600
so in

211
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,680
right here you can see in the xml file

212
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,440
some things i'll just point them out uh

213
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,920
the rule group is like a simple way you

214
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,680
can group the rules

215
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,399
for a specific event id

216
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,120
uh and note the way that the in this

217
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,240
case the group relation uses the and to

218
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,279
define how the rules are used an

219
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:32,399
alternative to this would be an or

220
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:35,519
um okay process create

221
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,839
let's see is an example of

222
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:40,399
basically event id one

223
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,959
and this rule right here is going to

224
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:46,640
match on include

225
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:49,120
image like i said is is the word used

226
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,600
for an executable in this example the

227
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,160
image is timeout.exe

228
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,440
command line

229
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,519
uh is one of the fields

230
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:02,240
in event id1 and in this example it

231
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,560
shows us that the command line simply

232
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,319
just contains 100.

233
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,839
a little more about the system on config

234
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,839
as you'll note in the sysmond config

235
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,560
there are conditions you can use you can

236
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,560
see here in this little example that's

237
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,680
uh

238
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,880
and

239
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,480
or condition

240
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,640
equals is

241
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,560
or condition equals

242
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,480
end with

243
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,839
or begin with

244
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,839
so

245
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:38,800
you might be thinking

246
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,279
where do i get a good

247
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,640
pre-made

248
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,600
sysmond config that i can start with

249
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,920
yeah it's a great question

250
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,160
so

251
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,560
i would say that

252
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,040
olaf hartong has a great system on

253
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,800
config

254
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,519
and he makes a great modular

255
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,160
sysmon config that you can use

256
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,880
to easily customize your rules

257
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,399
for each event id

258
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,480
it makes it very easy to

259
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,880
manage

260
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,200
big thanks to olaf for making such a

261
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,959
great cis1 config

262
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,519
okay let's take a little look here

263
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,320
so

264
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,079
here you can see

265
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,720
a little of what his sysmon config looks

266
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,680
like

267
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,920
um

268
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,120
olaf's sysmont config is pretty darn

269
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,920
great uh but you have to understand you

270
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,079
will need to spend some time getting to

271
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:43,040
know the sysmon config and adjust it to

272
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,200
your specific environment

273
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,560
it's a

274
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,680
big part of it a big deal

275
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,200
to help you with that

276
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,240
you can go to the trusted sex system

277
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,959
community guide which is

278
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:58,480
quite wonderful

279
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,240
and written by

280
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,000
carlos perez dark operator

281
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,560
a note about carlos pretty much

282
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,279
anything he writes or creates

283
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:13,519
is amazing you can learn a lot from him

284
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,279
okay

285
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,120
now let's talk about

286
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,360
installing sysmon

287
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,440
it's quite easy you just follow these

288
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,360
steps you basically download this sysmon

289
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,839
unzip

290
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,800
grab your sysmon config make sure you

291
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,959
save it to the same folder

292
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:34,240
and then you're going to run this

293
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,600
command

294
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,240
right there

295
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,079
you note you can also do this with the

296
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:42,079
script of course i'm not going to go

297
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,639
into that for the sake of time but just

298
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,519
know that that's an option

299
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:50,880
so after sus1 is installed you should

300
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,839
see this

301
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:58,240
and if you want to go see the cis1 logs

302
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,760
you can open up

303
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,120
event viewer

304
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,120
and go to applications services logs

305
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,480
microsoft

306
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,600
windows

307
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,639
sysfon and click on operational

308
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:14,160
and then you'll see the logs

309
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,399
okay now what

310
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:17,920
you might say

311
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,360
okay i have installed this one now what

312
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,279
well now you need to send these cismod

313
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:26,240
events to a sim

314
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,079
and you might ask

315
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,560
wait what is this in

316
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,480
a sim is basically a security

317
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,480
information and event management system

318
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,040
and it's think of it like a cen it's

319
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,959
basically a central place to send all

320
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:42,240
your logs

321
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,440
so you can analyze and search the data

322
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,519
and here are a few uh examples

323
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,360
splunk

324
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,360
is they have of course a paid version

325
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,000
and they have a free version but

326
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,199
note that the free version allows up to

327
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:03,760
500 megabytes per day

328
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,720
which is actually not a lot of data

329
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,399
you might be surprised how quickly you

330
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,480
get to that limit

331
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,000
uh security onion is great it's free

332
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,639
it's a great community but note that

333
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,480
you're on your own to set it up and get

334
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,839
it running

335
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:22,959
and the same is true with the elk stack

336
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:25,839
by elastic

337
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:29,440
so

338
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,639
let's talk a bit about some examples of

339
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,399
my favorite sysmon events

340
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,120
since spawn event like i said event id

341
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,720
one

342
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,399
process creation

343
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,440
is just fabulous

344
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,760
uh sysmon event id3

345
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,360
network connection

346
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,519
also fabulous

347
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:56,720
sysfon event 22 dns event

348
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,040
fabulous

349
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,120
let's talk about them

350
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,639
so

351
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,519
in sysmon event id 1

352
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,199
i wanted to show you here a little

353
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:09,360
example of some of the

354
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,040
fields that it captures

355
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,240
uh

356
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,680
so in the field

357
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,639
rule name you can see there i just want

358
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:22,560
to note uh olaf's sysmon config contains

359
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,880
miter attack ids here and that's very

360
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,560
useful

361
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,560
uh note the image which is the

362
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,759
executable

363
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,880
in this case it's notepad plus plus

364
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,639
uh let's see

365
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:38,560
also you can see here the command line

366
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,759
that's

367
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:43,519
the greatest that's wonderful

368
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,839
you can see the user in this case it's

369
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:48,959
just username is just an example

370
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:51,519
and this is also very very important

371
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,199
you get hashes

372
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:56,560
so you can see the sha1 md5 hash

373
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,240
it's cut off but you can't see it but

374
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,600
over on the

375
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,680
right you can also get imp hash

376
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,240
note also at the bottom you can see the

377
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,959
parent image which was the parent

378
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,720
executable

379
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,839
and the parent command line

380
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,000
wonderful

381
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,040
okay

382
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:21,279
event id 3 network connection

383
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,600
uh here's here i show you an example

384
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,839
here i just included it

385
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:28,320
note in the rule name you can see right

386
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,279
there

387
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,120
what olaf's

388
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,440
sysmon config has for the rule name you

389
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,560
can see the

390
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,600
miter attack id

391
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,839
wonderful

392
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:42,240
and in this case let's see you can also

393
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,320
see the user

394
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,120
you can see the protocol

395
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,079
source

396
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:49,279
ip

397
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:50,800
source port

398
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,639
destination ip

399
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,399
destination port

400
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:57,360
absolutely wonderful

401
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,360
so valuable

402
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,600
so

403
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,119
event id 22

404
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:08,559
dns event dns query

405
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:13,119
uh this is such a great event uh

406
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:15,520
one of the greatest parts about this you

407
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,919
can see the query name right there in

408
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:20,480
the middle in this case it's

409
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,760
some google

410
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,799
telemetry garbage probably

411
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:27,039
and you can see the image the executable

412
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:31,960
firefox and it shows you the user

413
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,640
okay let's get to some examples

414
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,240
of sysmon used during an investigation

415
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,039
so in this case you can see sysmon event

416
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:44,559
id1

417
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:46,720
and we're doing a query for

418
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,679
uh the command who am i

419
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,360
this can be

420
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,559
either

421
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,640
completely

422
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,039
harmless

423
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:59,360
event

424
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,400
or

425
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,799
it could be an attacker that ran who am

426
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:03,840
i

427
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,880
to understand what kind of uh privileges

428
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,960
they have because they had just popped

429
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,360
the box and they're

430
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,720
so

431
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,840
very useful

432
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,760
and here

433
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,039
we're looking at sysmon event id 3.

434
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:23,280
this is just a general search really to

435
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,678
look at

436
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,440
the processes source ip source port

437
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,200
destination ip

438
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,919
destination port

439
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:35,200
these can be

440
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,799
very interesting

441
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:38,480
for example if i was to

442
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,160
specify the destination port as 445

443
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,919
that would be very interesting showing

444
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:46,480
smb

445
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:48,080
okay

446
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:51,200
this is spawn event id 22 this is a

447
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,440
really good one it's really fun uh this

448
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,640
is rare

449
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,200
dns queries

450
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,840
so we're looking basically at one

451
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,840
machine in particular

452
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,559
and we're looking at the rare

453
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:08,080
dns queries that it ran

454
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,919
this can be very interesting very

455
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:13,440
helpful during an investigation

456
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:16,400
okay

457
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,360
some closing thoughts

458
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,240
so

459
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,039
what what do you see here yeah

460
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:25,360
these are some typical answers i've

461
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,400
heard when i ask folks who work in

462
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,320
incident response

463
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,120
if the companies they work with

464
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,679
resolving an incident

465
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:37,760
have sysmon deployed in their

466
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,240
environment

467
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,520
so i see things like rarely

468
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,720
never

469
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,240
hardly ever

470
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,400
this is a good one yes but not

471
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,480
configured to send to the sim

472
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,760
so i guess

473
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,799
i just want to say you know

474
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:59,039
if you have never

475
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:01,520
deployed sysmon

476
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,960
in your environment

477
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,880
please do

478
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,600
install sysmon and make sure you send

479
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:11,760
the suspend events to a sim

480
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,159
could really help everybody

481
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:16,960
in an incident

482
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,280
that's it thanks

483
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,840
join the conversation uh meet up with

484
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,000
the blue team village

485
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
discord.blueteamvillage.org

486
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,840
i'm extreme paper

487
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:36,240
clip thanks

488
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,039
and you're clear
