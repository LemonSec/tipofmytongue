00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,720
could see maybe something like that

184
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,919
that'll do it

185
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:22,320
uh so yeah so uh we got you 1080p back

186
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,480
and going hopefully we'll figure out our

187
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,440
uh

188
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,120
our issue with our

189
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,919
our hdmi cable and we'll have uh much

190
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:31,360
better consistent capture across both

191
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,720
team members tomorrow

192
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,000
something about this cable is like it's

193
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,039
heating up or something because the

194
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:36,640
first we had several hours of testing

195
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,480
last night with no problem

196
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,840
and something something's going on now

197
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:42,559
so we'll we'll give that a run and sure

198
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:44,159
enough i literally just saw a rename

199
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:46,240
solve puzzle so we've renamed this

200
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,399
function solve the puzzle

201
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:50,320
um so what they're looking for they know

202
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,159
it's a puzzle of some sort

203
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:54,240
i'm curious if we get uh someone just

204
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,000
kind of running it and interacting the

205
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,519
binary or if we're doing a more static

206
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:00,000
analysis

207
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,200
but actually yeah this should be should

208
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,559
be much higher quality with with a full

209
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:03,679
1080

210
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:05,440
unfortunately we don't have even the

211
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:08,320
local recordings were also not 1080 they

212
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,320
were only in 720 as well so i apologize

213
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,840
those first couple matches

214
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,840
uh we're not gonna have

215
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,960
uh we're not gonna have the the um

216
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,480
uh the higher quality video for those

217
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,760
either but

218
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:23,039
all 12 other matches from here on out

219
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:24,559
are going to be in high def

220
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:26,000
because we have a lot of these to go so

221
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,360
you'll see your favorite players that

222
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,039
won in the first couple rounds they're

223
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:30,320
going to come back we're going to we're

224
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,840
going to see them again

225
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,159
uh so oh no that was cool what was i

226
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:35,440
didn't i didn't notice that website have

227
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,279
you seen that one before

228
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:38,880
uh no i'm curious what that was so now

229
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,799
they're on the ubuntu repo

230
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:42,240
they're getting a particular glib c

231
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,159
version which makes sense

232
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:46,080
that's often common now i think for most

233
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,679
of these we like included the lib c if

234
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:50,399
we thought it was necessary yes um so

235
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:51,919
it's kind of a hint to the teams like if

236
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:53,600
we we we're we're trying to like give

237
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,600
out everything that we could uh make it

238
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,440
as self-contained as possible

239
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,679
and so we'll see uh

240
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:01,519
we'll we'll see if that one ends up ends

241
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:03,440
up being useful but we've got our binary

242
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,320
challenge uh this one is starting to to

243
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,840
be a little bit

244
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,359
more difficult though i would i would

245
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:11,040
say yeah our challenge difficulty is

246
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,599
cranking up yes a tiny bit

247
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:14,639
uh and we're gonna see that kind of

248
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:15,918
trend throughout the whole the whole

249
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:17,280
rest of the weekend right i'm sure we'll

250
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,399
have some easier ones something somebody

251
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:20,719
finds an amazing solution to solves it

252
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:22,239
quickly yeah but on the topic of like

253
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:23,760
difficulty like

254
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,320
that's i mean we have an idea of like

255
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,839
what's more difficult and what's easier

256
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:29,440
and so on but

257
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,119
uh of course like we can be wrong like

258
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:32,960
people can have like different uh you

259
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,040
know specializations in their skill sets

260
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,520
and uh and so on so something that we

261
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,760
might think is in both directions right

262
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,440
right exactly yes so

263
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,679
uh something that we might think uh is

264
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:45,359
easy might be actually kind of tricky

265
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:46,960
and then the other way around so it's

266
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,639
going to be interesting to see what's

267
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:49,679
what's going on there's still some

268
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:51,119
reversing like the initial reverse

269
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:53,040
engineering going on of the

270
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,839
program for example this kind of step uh

271
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:57,359
was not really needed in the previous

272
00:34:57,359 --> 00:34:58,400
challenge where we just gave them the

273
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,720
full source code yes with like names and

274
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,880
everything

275
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,920
and it is a uh yeah as an organizer you

276
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,599
have a lot of levers to pull you have a

277
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:09,040
lot it's ironic because we have the

278
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,560
organizers here uh playing though

279
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,320
unfortunately they're on our non-capture

280
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,800
screen unfortunately um

281
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,160
i just had to make sure that we had them

282
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,280
lined up right i freaked out for a

283
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,640
second not realizing that yes they are

284
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,960
they are the right halves um

285
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,280
but uh the team organizers uh we're not

286
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,359
seeing them but as a challenge organizer

287
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:26,960
as somebody making challenges

288
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,720
you can strip a binder you cannot serve

289
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,320
a finder you can include debug symbols

290
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,520
you cannot have any you know so all

291
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,800
these yeah different levels of

292
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,200
optimizations yeah like because a lot of

293
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,119
optimization also kind of acts as a

294
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:38,800
slight like objection

295
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,280
obfuscation yeah yeah so um

296
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,040
we've all seen these like you know

297
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,359
optimized mem copies and everything but

298
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:47,040
you have all these like magic stuff

299
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,240
going on yeah

300
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,720
so yeah yeah you get vector operations

301
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,640
and you're in your mem copies

302
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:53,359
so

303
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:55,200
yeah and that's and that's where to some

304
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,880
degree you can make

305
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,560
uh an easy challenge hard with just

306
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,800
tedious things yeah so it is interesting

307
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,160
that you see a lot of sort of like i

308
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,760
would say cheap challenge design where

309
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,040
it's like yeah we just made it harder by

310
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,960
doing x right it didn't make it more

311
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,480
interesting it just made it like yeah

312
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,480
just slightly more annoying to do

313
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,680
the thing that you want so it's

314
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,760
sometimes a really good easy challenge

315
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,599
is actually like you're just really

316
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:17,040
focusing on that one core thing that you

317
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,720
want you want to do yeah which makes a

318
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,640
lot of fun for for what we're doing here

319
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,400
so right

320
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,720
so still that's i'm reversing trying to

321
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,320
name different things we've seen like

322
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,079
the name the functions like soul puzzle

323
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:29,440
and you see some variables getting named

324
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:32,000
like the input

325
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,359
it's all trying to like get get an

326
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:34,960
understanding of

327
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,200
what is this program doing

328
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,640
uh and there are kind of like two parts

329
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,560
to it like first of all like what's the

330
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,440
um

331
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,359
intended functionality of the program

332
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:44,960
and then from there you can start to

333
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,839
understand uh in in what way is it

334
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:49,839
acting uh not as intended like where is

335
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:51,920
that or well in this case we're where

336
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,359
the

337
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:55,599
the author intended a bug right but in

338
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:56,880
the normal case where it's unintended

339
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,960
vulnerabilities yeah or in this case

340
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,800
what's the surface level intended what's

341
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,320
it what's it claimed to be able to do

342
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,240
yes uh and then what is it what does it

343
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,240
actually do that maybe may be different

344
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,599
right

345
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:10,079
so let's see uh what we're doing so and

346
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:11,200
this is nice too because we're actually

347
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,160
getting this is the first time we've

348
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,280
seen a little reverse engineering

349
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,280
workflow yes a lot of the other ones

350
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,520
have been like basically a quick glance

351
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,520
at the code or disassembly has kind of

352
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:22,079
like revealed what's going on yeah here

353
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:23,599
they actually need to kind of understand

354
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:25,359
what is going on

355
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:27,760
okay so we're still sort of starting our

356
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:30,000
framework for our our exploit here but i

357
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,599
don't i think it's just

358
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:33,040
getting the menus and interacting with

359
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,560
it right and so we're looking oh okay so

360
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,480
there's a current puzzle state

361
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,920
all right so

362
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,280
puzzle that puzzle looked interesting

363
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,720
that looked like maybe like a nine by

364
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,880
nine grid yes of number numbers yeah it

365
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,119
could be uh maybe like a sudoku i i

366
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:46,960
think that's a great guess and of course

367
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,240
you know we're a little little spoiled

368
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,920
here a little tainted knowledge but this

369
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:52,560
is indeed a sudoku uh in fact when we

370
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,240
when when somebody was like

371
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,599
kind of play testing and validating this

372
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:57,200
challenge we sort of were like wait a

373
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,520
minute you just you just saw the sudoku

374
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,040
and that's it and the author was like no

375
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,640
no no no no

376
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,320
that's not actually not actually

377
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,320
possible uh so it is a little bit

378
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,760
trickier than that so we'll see as our

379
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,200
teams discover

380
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,079
um

381
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:11,599
it's not just a straight put it into a

382
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:13,599
sudoku solver get a correct answer and

383
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:14,480
win

384
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,839
um it is gonna be a little bit more

385
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:17,599
tricky and this is one

386
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:19,680
i i'm almost positive we're gonna need a

387
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,400
hint on right so i'm i'm gonna propose

388
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,640
at like 15 minutes in

389
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,640
if we don't see

390
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:29,040
um like progress progress and in fact

391
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:29,920
actually let's why don't you go ahead

392
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,359
and take a look at the organizers maybe

393
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:33,440
too i will do that and if we if we're

394
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,920
looking for them to to uh kind of have a

395
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:36,960
hint as to what they're doing like

396
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:37,760
indicate that they know what they're

397
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,200
doing

398
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,880
yeah yeah

399
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,720
oh does it come occasionally okay

400
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,160
so it's apparently flickering in and out

401
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,920
occasionally we're getting getting our

402
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:46,960
video

403
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,880
we we swapped out the capture card that

404
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,960
worked for a while until it didn't uh

405
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,720
and then we swapped out the usb-c cable

406
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,480
an hour for a while until it didn't and

407
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,920
so now we're convinced that it's just

408
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,920
the hdmi cable itself

409
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,680
uh that is causing trouble and i think

410
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,040
this has been true even if we were

411
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,599
direct wired into the laptop so it's not

412
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:06,079
the capture on the other side

413
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:08,000
yes because we also did swap out the uh

414
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,240
the usbc adapter once too so we've

415
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,839
swapped every component except the hdmi

416
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:14,880
cable uh

417
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,720
partly because they're like taped to the

418
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:17,920
floor and they're a 30-foot long cable

419
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,280
so we got to go and get some oh there we

420
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,480
go i saw

421
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:23,119
i did see a solver pop up briefly i saw

422
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:24,720
something i'm just going to say also the

423
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:27,040
player from the organizers copy pasted

424
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:29,680
the uh current state of the puzzle into

425
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:32,079
and they googled for a sudoku solver

426
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:34,720
um so we'll see to what extent that will

427
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:35,839
help them

428
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:39,760
um it's i mean again i'm not completely

429
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,200
familiar with the

430
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,440
intended solution here but

431
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:46,880
i would assume that it still involves

432
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:47,599
like

433
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:49,680
solving the sudoku but not only doing

434
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:52,400
that it is trickier than that

435
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,920
yeah that's right so

436
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,480
um i have a little bit more info um yeah

437
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,760
we're still seeing that that kind of

438
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,560
solver flash in and out occasionally

439
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:03,040
um on on the display

440
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,640
so uh

441
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,319
it it there's gonna be some memory

442
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:07,920
corruption here yeah there is indeed

443
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,079
this is not just now although i will say

444
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:12,800
it is actually a perfectly valid

445
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,480
category of challenge a lot of ctfs

446
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,560
right where you would actually do have

447
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:19,119
a more programming challenge or a puzzle

448
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:20,800
that happens and i think

449
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,000
honestly even in moderation i think

450
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,920
those can be fun and enjoyable yes mixed

451
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,280
in amongst your traditional like happy

452
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,200
competition yeah typically they are

453
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:30,240
branded as uh ppc is the category in

454
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,640
normal uh ctfs which i think is like

455
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,480
professional programming challenge or

456
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,760
something like this

457
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:38,560
uh people familiar with like you know

458
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:41,839
icpc style uh algorithms competitions or

459
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:43,760
so might find although usually they're

460
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:46,000
kind of like framed uh slightly

461
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,319
differently yeah but it's kind of like

462
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:50,800
the same uh general idea there yeah and

463
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,280
there's there's no security flaw there's

464
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,680
really just rather solving some hard

465
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,200
mathematical problem with the right

466
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,040
algorithm or with the right approach

467
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,760
uh to to kind of get it working so but

468
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,079
that's not the case here like there's

469
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:05,520
there's an aspect of that but that's not

470
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,040
enough we are doing right this is this

471
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,880
is truly a ponable there is memory

472
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,319
corruption involved

473
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:12,480
uh yeah although i will say and i'm

474
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:15,520
looking to see if somebody finds um

475
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,440
the the sort of like win function like

476
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,760
when you have a correct soul ct

477
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:22,720
correct cell sudoku um

478
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,000
i think we're going to see like so this

479
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,319
this function here uh they've named it

480
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:27,200
check

481
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,640
returns right whether or not we've

482
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:31,680
successfully calculated the value

483
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:34,560
um a valid uh

484
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,000
uh solve

485
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,599
this uh

486
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:39,680
the result of that is going to determine

487
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,040
basically what you call a win function

488
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,480
so it is going to kind of do the win for

489
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,280
you

490
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,119
so you already sort of you know you have

491
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:47,119
to solve it right your just question is

492
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:49,119
okay what mechanic will actually get me

493
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:51,040
to solve it and can i cheat it do i have

494
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,640
to have a combination of a solver plus a

495
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,640
g like what what what is that that ratio

496
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:57,040
going to entail because at face value

497
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,640
it kind of looks like you just sold this

498
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,960
education and you win yeah but but you

499
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,440
know like def con finals even even being

500
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,680
a sort of easy live ctf i would i would

501
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,040
think people would be like nah wait a

502
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,720
minute like there's there's something

503
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:11,119
here and i think if you can also

504
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:13,839
uh there's not a lot of uh

505
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:17,200
values here and so i don't know like

506
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,720
i think the idea is that this these are

507
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,000
just not

508
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,200
solvable because there's not enough

509
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,720
information in there like some sudoku

510
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:23,760
balls are very minimal but they're

511
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,599
designed to be solved right right made

512
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:27,200
to be solvable i think i remember that

513
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,920
like if you have 13 digits you're

514
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,920
guaranteed to have oh is that so here we

515
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,000
go

516
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,720
okay so this one definitely has more

517
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,000
than that but there's going to be some

518
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:40,800
other

519
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,880
issues with it still i'm not sure if my

520
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:45,280
trivia is is correct but i i vaguely

521
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,880
remember like if you have 13 digits you

522
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,560
have a unique solution you can have a

523
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,480
unique solution with fewer digits but

524
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:51,760
that's not guaranteed i don't know that

525
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,599
that's true because i can just give you

526
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:55,680
all of the ones for example

527
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,599
and all of that

528
00:42:57,599 --> 00:42:59,280
and i'll and all the twos

529
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,160
and that doesn't give you enough

530
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,040
information to know where all the

531
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,340
numbers other numbers are

532
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:06,000
[Music]

533
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,200
maybe maybe

534
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,720
because like you could no so it's high

535
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:11,200
it's maybe it's 21 or something then i

536
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:12,960
there is a number

537
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,400
i'm just you know where's where is our

538
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,560
cracking the cryptic uh

539
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:19,920
friends yes and go to the youtube stream

540
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:22,240
yeah great uh great channel so so here

541
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:24,640
we go we're seeing uh sudoku solver

542
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,480
python so we're seeing people invest get

543
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:27,599
that all right

544
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:30,079
we are now 15 minutes in yes i think we

545
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:31,839
should be preparing our hint because i

546
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:33,359
actually think this one is a little too

547
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:35,119
subtle and we're gonna have to point

548
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:36,000
them

549
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,319
in the right direction yes uh without

550
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:39,760
actually giving them the thing so yeah

551
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,119
and we should note this notice now that

552
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:44,240
even though uh the time is like 24 right

553
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:46,160
five point four we started seven days

554
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,839
because of technical difficulties so

555
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:49,520
they are only 15 minutes into the

556
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,359
challenge correct correct so we have we

557
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:53,440
have more more time than the clock looks

558
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:54,640
like compared to the other ones where we

559
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:56,400
started much closer to

560
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:59,200
uh to on time so

561
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,440
uh we're trying a solver again so so

562
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,599
trying a solver on here which is

563
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:05,680
not going to be sufficient so i think we

564
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:06,960
need to figure out if there is an

565
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:10,000
official hint from the challenge author

566
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,880
so we've got uh glenn over in in the

567
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:14,480
production booth

568
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:16,400
as it were which is otherwise known as

569
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,000
the other side of the table that we're

570
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,319
sitting at here yeah um

571
00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:22,400
it's gonna it's gonna reach out and see

572
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,400
if we have an official we have like

573
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,160
three times the number of computers

574
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:27,599
compared to the number of crew members

575
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:30,000
for this uh setup we have a lot of

576
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,560
displays and i mean

577
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:34,800
an order of magnitude more cables i

578
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,960
think then uh

579
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,960
yeah but it's uh

580
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:40,720
and once we once we find out what is

581
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:43,599
breaking our our secondary capture uh

582
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:44,960
and so actually speaking of which i'm

583
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:46,000
gonna go ahead and go take a look at

584
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,280
organizers i want to see if they're

585
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:49,359
making progress right uh while we figure

586
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:52,319
out what we're doing with that uh with

587
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:54,560
that hint yeah if we're gonna give it um

588
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:55,839
and if the chat if you guys have any

589
00:44:55,839 --> 00:44:57,760
questions uh about where we're going uh

590
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:00,319
let us know yep uh and i'll be back with

591
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:02,240
an update great

592
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:03,200
so

593
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,520
while uh jordan does that

594
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,680
uh we can try to

595
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:08,560
uh

596
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:10,319
see is uh

597
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:13,200
that uh we okay so i've just been

598
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,400
informed that

599
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:17,440
uh the puzzle that the uh that you are

600
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:18,400
given

601
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,960
is impossible to solve that's the kind

602
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:23,520
of the trick here so at face value

603
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:24,880
everything looks fine you just need to

604
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:26,720
solve this sudoku but actually there is

605
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:29,280
no solution this is a an invalid state

606
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:31,280
uh for the sudoku

607
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:32,640
so

608
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,560
once they and this is something that can

609
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:36,720
really throw you off right because if

610
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:38,800
you uh take this and like you put it

611
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,000
into a solver or something and the

612
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,240
solver says like nah there's no solution

613
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:43,680
you might be starting to think like

614
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:46,240
maybe the solver has a bug or like some

615
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:48,480
maybe my in the format of my input is

616
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,000
wrong or something like this

617
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,359
um

618
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:52,079
and

619
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:54,480
only later you might question the like

620
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:57,119
the impossibility of the puzzle

621
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:59,520
um so this is where they have to then

622
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:02,160
cheat to solve the impossible

623
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:04,079
sudoku uh

624
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:04,800
to

625
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:07,440
then get this win function

626
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:08,640
um

627
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,720
we can see here on on the balsam screen

628
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:12,400
that uh

629
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:16,960
they are looking still at the kind of uh

630
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:19,680
the compilation here um thinking hard

631
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:21,280
about this

632
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:22,480
uh

633
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:25,280
trying to figure out like what is going

634
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:29,440
on here like why is this not working um

635
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:31,200
they have this it's it's this check

636
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:32,720
function right

637
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:34,960
uh so they're trying to think about like

638
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:37,200
what in what way does this function not

639
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:38,480
behave

640
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:40,800
uh correctly maybe uh maybe they have

641
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,319
realized that like you're given an

642
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:43,520
impossible

643
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:44,800
uh puzzle

644
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:46,000
um

645
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,480
so let's see they're gonna try to

646
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:49,839
seems like they're writing like a small

647
00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:51,920
like formatting uh function they're

648
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:53,119
looping through

649
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:56,720
like the x and y axis and uh printing uh

650
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:58,480
something

651
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:00,480
um so yeah

652
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:02,720
um

653
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:04,800
still unsure exactly where they're going

654
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:06,400
with that but let's see here now they

655
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:09,280
run it so so okay so a quick update is

656
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:10,960
both teams are taking this sort of wrong

657
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:12,160
approach now and they're still looking

658
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:14,000
for solves so the hint they're both

659
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,520
going to get is you can't win you need

660
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:17,040
to cheat

661
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:18,640
right

662
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:20,400
which is uh

663
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:21,680
almost feel like there's some kind of

664
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:23,680
deeper

665
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:25,520
uh thing i mean it's it's a true life

666
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:27,200
statement yeah yeah

667
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:28,960
um

668
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:31,920
yeah that's uh

669
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:34,079
um

670
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:35,440
yeah i had a lot of thoughts about that

671
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:38,400
but let's not go

672
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,880
yeah um i you know so here's the other

673
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:42,079
question do we want to give them a

674
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:43,839
little bit more of a hint

675
00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:45,359
um do we want to tell them exactly kind

676
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:46,960
of how like the more of a hit is to what

677
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:48,000
they want to change i think we have time

678
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,559
right now we have time uh let's do that

679
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:53,680
and uh yeah in fact

680
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:55,839
well that's too late now uh

681
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:57,520
i mean i was thinking it's in terms of

682
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:59,760
like since this is the last match of the

683
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:00,720
day

684
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:02,400
we could have afforded like you know

685
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,160
extending the uh

686
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:05,920
standard game time but yeah i don't know

687
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:08,160
if it's fair to do that once well we do

688
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:10,000
it to the same two players either way

689
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,760
it's it's only fair relative to each

690
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:12,559
other

691
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:13,520
because every match is different

692
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:14,559
different challenges different

693
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:16,480
conditions and so to some degree right

694
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:18,559
so you could argue that it's fair but

695
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:19,760
let's see you can't win you need to

696
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:20,800
cheat

697
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:24,400
you need memory corruption yes

698
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:29,119
it's uh it's dangerous to go alone like

699
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:30,240
take this yeah

700
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,680
it's dangerous to go alone take this

701
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:35,200
memory corruption i love it

702
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:36,559
um

703
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:37,599
all right

704
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:40,559
here goes the first tense yes

705
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:42,240
we'll see if this gets them on the right

706
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:45,119
track again or if we need to uh

707
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:47,359
in the meantime i'm trying to decipher

708
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:48,400
what this

709
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,480
script is doing they have a sole

710
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:52,160
function there which then will not

711
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:53,760
really help them since you can't solve

712
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:54,720
this

713
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:56,800
um

714
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:59,599
it's uh

715
00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:02,160
yeah it's still like you know a little

716
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:03,920
bit unclear where the players are in

717
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:05,680
this unfortunately we can't read the

718
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:07,599
minds of the players that would be uh

719
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:09,119
immensely helpful uh when doing this

720
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:10,480
type of commentary we can just try to

721
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:11,920
guess based on what we're seeing on the

722
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:13,200
screen

723
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:15,599
so and yeah again like if you have any

724
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:18,240
uh questions or comments from from

725
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:19,839
all of you who were watching this i got

726
00:49:19,839 --> 00:49:21,119
some smiles i wish you all could have

727
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:23,520
seen it but there was like oh yeah of

728
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:26,160
course okay okay so they both they were

729
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:27,839
both you know going down the solver

730
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:28,880
approach

731
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:30,319
so i think we're going to see a lot more

732
00:49:30,319 --> 00:49:32,160
ida now right uh we're going to see them

733
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:34,559
actually dig into the binary right uh

734
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:37,520
and follow it that way

735
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:39,280
so that's that's all that's nice to to

736
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:42,000
hear that like the the hint was uh

737
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,800
appropriately level then that it was uh

738
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:46,559
useful to the players yeah i think they

739
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:48,559
both they both were at a spot where it's

740
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:49,920
going to help both of them

741
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:51,680
we'll see if either one starts to starts

742
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:53,920
to uh take advantage of that or not okay

743
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:55,280
yeah so we're looking at checkset we're

744
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:56,880
looking at the binary properties seeing

745
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:58,720
is you know and that's actually a great

746
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:00,319
habit to be in too i really think that a

747
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:02,240
lot of people overlook that again we saw

748
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:04,400
that last one with with a mallard with

749
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:05,599
the ducks where

750
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:06,480
uh

751
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:09,119
like it not being randomized uh i think

752
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:10,480
add a little bit extra slow down there

753
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:12,319
right yes definitely because you could

754
00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:14,240
have gone straight into uh you know yeah

755
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:17,359
this is i i think i i have this as a

756
00:50:17,359 --> 00:50:20,000
pretty good habit like always run a file

757
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,520
always run check sec

758
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:22,720
uh

759
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:24,240
yeah it's kind of like when you're doing

760
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:26,720
reversing uh reversing engineering

761
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:28,559
challenges always run straight strings

762
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:30,880
always been walk yeah just like

763
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:32,400
just out of habit yeah just like the

764
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,400
things that you things that you do

765
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:35,920
right all right so let's let's watch

766
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:38,160
this okay so now yeah now we're seeing

767
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:39,599
them actually where we want them now

768
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:41,520
they're back to reverse engineering

769
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:44,000
they're looking for vulnerabilities uh

770
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,400
and and what they're gonna do

771
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:47,839
is they're gonna use the vulnerability

772
00:50:47,839 --> 00:50:49,599
to win they're gonna use the memory

773
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:50,880
corruption

774
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:54,960
uh to get to to to not code execution

775
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:57,040
directly right but to the win state so

776
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:57,680
what they're gonna do is they're gonna

777
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:59,680
need to corrupt in such a way that they

778
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:01,599
can create a solved board and they

779
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:02,800
should hopefully still remember this

780
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:04,400
right because they know that the point

781
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:06,000
was to win they saw that they saw the

782
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,680
win they saw the win state they saw

783
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:08,880
that's why they were trying to solve the

784
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:09,920
puzzle

785
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:11,839
so i think they know that yeah the

786
00:51:11,839 --> 00:51:13,200
question is

787
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:15,520
uh are they going to

788
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:16,400
uh

789
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:17,440
be able to figure out the memory

790
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:19,119
corruption in time so that's the

791
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:20,160
question that we're looking for and this

792
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:21,599
is kind of interesting i think uh this

793
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:23,200
type of ponable where like a lot of

794
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:24,800
ponables you have kind of this like

795
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:27,520
standard workflow where you try to uh

796
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:29,280
gain control of certain aspects of

797
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:30,559
memory yeah you're trying it's always

798
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:32,079
it's a pointer over right right

799
00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:33,280
something that gets you a memory right

800
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:34,720
so you can get a pointer over right do a

801
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:35,680
rough

802
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:38,160
like you know um but here you're just

803
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:39,839
doing kind of like maybe we call it like

804
00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:41,599
a local memory corruption you're just

805
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:43,440
like or or it's not quite a logic

806
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:44,720
vulnerability and that it is memory

807
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:46,880
corruption but it's not useful it's not

808
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:49,280
being used for control flow right

809
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:51,760
hijacking you're using it specifically

810
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:53,920
to just change the behavior of the state

811
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:55,200
and change the behavior yeah the

812
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:56,480
functionality through its normal

813
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:57,839
legitimate means

814
00:51:57,839 --> 00:51:59,520
but by entering a memory state that it

815
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:02,400
didn't intend for you to enter right so

816
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:04,240
in a lot of these cases like the program

817
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:06,480
wouldn't crash for example with the like

818
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:08,480
if the exploit is like slightly

819
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:09,920
yeah you just you just fail to get a

820
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:11,040
correct puzzle it's just not solved

821
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:12,480
right yeah

822
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:13,920
but it's not to say that they couldn't

823
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:15,280
crash not with this vulnerability

824
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:16,720
necessarily it depends on how it's

825
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:19,200
actually constructed but there are there

826
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:20,880
are certainly use cases or there are

827
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:23,119
cases where you know an exploit

828
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:25,200
isn't actually exploitable in the in the

829
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:26,400
co you know

830
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:28,559
direct code execution state it is rather

831
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:30,960
just by exercising some other

832
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:33,599
logical state of the program and i think

833
00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:34,319
yeah

834
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:35,920
in general like what everything we say

835
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:37,760
here about like the you know pornables

836
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:39,920
and like general ideas there are a lot

837
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:42,079
of like ifs and buts and stuff like to

838
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:43,920
all of these exceptions but you know

839
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:46,000
we're trying to you know make some broad

840
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,359
strokes here about

841
00:52:47,359 --> 00:52:50,319
different types of challenges

842
00:52:50,319 --> 00:52:51,839
i'm a little nervous this one feels like

843
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:53,680
that we the first one we might have to

844
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:55,200
unleash a sudden death i'm hoping we

845
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:57,680
don't right um but and i like the

846
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:59,119
challenge because like you know like

847
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:01,119
we're talking about i think it has that

848
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:03,280
that good twist that you're gonna not

849
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:04,319
get a

850
00:53:04,319 --> 00:53:05,599
a pointer over right but you're gonna

851
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:07,359
like you know influence the state of the

852
00:53:07,359 --> 00:53:08,559
binary so

853
00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:10,880
i'm hoping and we've got we've seen

854
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:12,880
great work from all the teams so far so

855
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:15,119
we know we have high quality people

856
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:18,559
uh we'll see how it's going

857
00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:20,559
this is also i say the one of the larger

858
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:22,640
binaries we all get very small binaries

859
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:24,559
very very self-contained this one's a

860
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:26,079
little bigger it's still i think small

861
00:53:26,079 --> 00:53:28,000
on the ctf scale of things which in ctf

862
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,240
is smaller than real world binaries oh

863
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:32,000
yeah but relative to the live ctf

864
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,160
binaries this is this is larger than

865
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:36,160
some of them

866
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:38,240
yeah luckily they don't have to like

867
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:41,280
sift through a 300 megabyte binary uh

868
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:43,839
what who doesn't love yeah

869
00:53:43,839 --> 00:53:46,079
yeah sorting out uh massive binaries

870
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:48,319
yeah i think i remember

871
00:53:48,319 --> 00:53:50,800
opening the minecraft binary in ida at

872
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,559
some point uh

873
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:55,280
then i went to bed and uh yeah continued

874
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:57,599
today yeah no i think it was like just

875
00:53:57,599 --> 00:53:59,200
barely finished but it took like eight

876
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:01,440
or nine hours to analyze that

877
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:02,160
yeah

878
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:04,000
big binary or even like obfuscated

879
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,680
binders can

880
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:08,000
can take a long time to analyze for sure

881
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,520
yeah

882
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:10,960
all right here we go so let's look we're

883
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:14,640
seeing in 64 inch

884
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:15,520
so

885
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:18,480
making sure the types are correct that

886
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:21,760
is a that's that's good i think i think

887
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:23,440
uh

888
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:25,040
analyzing the types is useful although

889
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:27,280
what i will say is that just looking at

890
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:29,040
decompiled code

891
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:31,359
is maybe not the best way to analyze any

892
00:54:31,359 --> 00:54:33,839
kind of type issues right no i think

893
00:54:33,839 --> 00:54:35,520
it's like

894
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:37,280
it's a good it's a good start to give

895
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:40,880
you the big picture uh and uh

896
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:42,319
but then at some point you might have to

897
00:54:42,319 --> 00:54:44,319
drill down on things and i think this is

898
00:54:44,319 --> 00:54:45,680
also kind of interesting again with like

899
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:47,680
different types of uh pawnable

900
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:49,520
challenges like uh some portable

901
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:52,319
challenges like the bug is obvious and

902
00:54:52,319 --> 00:54:54,000
the exploitation is difficult absolutely

903
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,200
and then you have these more like

904
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:57,599
reversing heavy probables where like you

905
00:54:57,599 --> 00:54:59,520
have to figure out like very complex

906
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:01,200
data structure but once you have kind of

907
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:03,599
sorted everything out the bug just like

908
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:04,799
appears

909
00:55:04,799 --> 00:55:06,880
and then from there it's typically not

910
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:09,200
that hard or yeah and i think our our

911
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:10,880
previous examples several of our

912
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:12,240
previous challenges were more on the

913
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:13,440
side of like

914
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:15,520
it's obvious where the bug was but

915
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:17,280
actually landing it was was sort of the

916
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:19,440
trick like we just let you run six calls

917
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:21,359
yes which ones that's the tricky part

918
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:22,720
right actually your payload the

919
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:24,640
execution same thing with like not

920
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:26,240
coding like we just ran your bites sort

921
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:28,160
of you had to like do that it's i think

922
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:29,440
there's a sort of like shell coating

923
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:30,720
heavy and this sort of like constrained

924
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:31,920
environments are some of my favorite

925
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:34,160
challenges um probably because i'm just

926
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:36,000
bad at the like the more uh i don't know

927
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,640
it's a tedious but the more in-depth

928
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:41,359
long-term reversal

929
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:43,119
so i mean i'm more of a reverse engineer

930
00:55:43,119 --> 00:55:45,200
myself so like i like those things but

931
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:47,200
then for example when you get to these

932
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:48,799
like you know complex heap exploitation

933
00:55:48,799 --> 00:55:50,960
things then i'm you know completely uh

934
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:52,160
you know out of luck there well there's

935
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:53,920
always just you know kind of familiarity

936
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:55,520
and and experience with it one of the

937
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:57,119
things i was going to mention um and and

938
00:55:57,119 --> 00:55:59,200
i say this that i don't do the reversing

939
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:01,040
everyone's as an author of a reverse

940
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:02,640
engineering tool well maybe that's why

941
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:04,640
you built the tool well that's also why

942
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:05,839
i have co-workers who are much better

943
00:56:05,839 --> 00:56:07,440
than i am that's the other i highly

944
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:10,000
recommend that approach um

945
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,319
so the but one of the things that i was

946
00:56:12,319 --> 00:56:14,319
going to comment on is that i like one

947
00:56:14,319 --> 00:56:15,599
of the things that gedra i think really

948
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:16,799
does well

949
00:56:16,799 --> 00:56:18,799
that a lot of uh

950
00:56:18,799 --> 00:56:21,119
um

951
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:23,280
both ida and binja have actually changed

952
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:25,599
as a result is their side-by-side view

953
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:27,440
having the synchronized side-by-side

954
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:29,599
decompilation with this assembly i think

955
00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:31,359
was a really important improvement and

956
00:56:31,359 --> 00:56:33,280
kind of like the standard workflow and

957
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:35,040
so now you'll see ida and binja both

958
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:36,240
have much better

959
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:38,079
split pane synchronization those kind of

960
00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:39,760
workflows very much inspired i mean you

961
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:40,400
know

962
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:42,880
i assume ilfaq also was was inspired and

963
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:44,400
was like oh yeah that's a you know yeah

964
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:45,440
i like the way the gear does that too

965
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:46,240
but

966
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:47,599
certainly from from bingham's

967
00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:49,040
perspective like we definitely did that

968
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:51,359
as well yeah um so i do think it's it's

969
00:56:51,359 --> 00:56:52,799
good seeing difference oh here we go

970
00:56:52,799 --> 00:56:54,480
we've got uh

971
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:55,680
i don't know is that the same that's

972
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:57,119
just the same screen

973
00:56:57,119 --> 00:56:59,680
um but we are so they're looking at

974
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:02,480
libsy uh

975
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:04,319
uh trying to download like the

976
00:57:04,319 --> 00:57:06,880
appropriate limc version right yeah so

977
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:08,880
they're using this um

978
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:11,440
web page where you can like put in uh

979
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:14,960
offsets for uh different

980
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:16,880
uh functions to like uh

981
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:19,200
to match up with like fingerprint uh the

982
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:21,680
libc version and then download it so

983
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:23,280
uh most of the times i think you need

984
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:25,839
like two offsets and then it will match

985
00:57:25,839 --> 00:57:28,559
to which version of limc is running so

986
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:30,000
again

987
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
when we're building these challenges

988
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,720
if we don't think they need

989
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:36,559
libsy we're not providing it no that's

990
00:57:36,559 --> 00:57:38,400
not true in all competitions though so

991
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:41,280
you know they may not yes trust us yet i

992
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:43,200
think this is like

993
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:45,280
it is a convention among i would say

994
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:46,000
like

995
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:49,040
experienced uh organizers within this

996
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:51,440
right because why make that

997
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:53,760
an extra tedious step that it's just

998
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:55,280
it's just mechanical and you just go to

999
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:56,480
the way we all know about the website we

1000
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:59,119
all know how you would do it however

1001
00:57:59,119 --> 00:58:00,720
if you come up with a solution that's

1002
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:02,720
different than the intended one you

1003
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:04,720
might have a solution which does require

1004
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:06,319
absolutely and then you might go this

1005
00:58:06,319 --> 00:58:08,160
way anyway

1006
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:10,400
yeah so it's not necessarily bad it is

1007
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:12,160
just it should be a hint that maybe

1008
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:13,760
you're not taking the intended route

1009
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:15,520
right yeah doesn't mean that you're

1010
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:17,839
wrong but you might be venturing into

1011
00:58:17,839 --> 00:58:19,359
like unknown territory all right so

1012
00:58:19,359 --> 00:58:20,559
let's be thinking about our next tent

1013
00:58:20,559 --> 00:58:22,319
because like i said i'm a little

1014
00:58:22,319 --> 00:58:23,760
concerned we might need to do a

1015
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:26,400
different one yeah um oh no triple tap

1016
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:28,880
control and get the uh get the spoken

1017
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:31,280
dictation pop up

1018
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:32,960
i'm gonna go

1019
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:34,160
oh nope nope there's somebody else in

1020
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:35,359
the background excited about something

1021
00:58:35,359 --> 00:58:37,119
yeah i thought for a second we had a

1022
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:39,200
surprise win off screen uh i'm gonna go

1023
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:40,079
ahead and

1024
00:58:40,079 --> 00:58:43,280
check in with uh

1025
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:45,599
organizers is is

1026
00:58:45,599 --> 00:58:47,760
organizers organizers is unfortunately

1027
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:49,520
not being captured

1028
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:51,440
so we're kind of in the dark there uh so

1029
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:52,319
i'm gonna see if i can get a little bit

1030
00:58:52,319 --> 00:58:53,280
more of an insight hopefully we're

1031
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:54,240
making good progress there and i can

1032
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:55,839
come back with a little bit of an update

1033
00:58:55,839 --> 00:58:56,880
yep

1034
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:59,040
um and then maybe then go ahead with

1035
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:02,400
some hint and based on current status uh

1036
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:03,680
so um

1037
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:07,599
yeah again they're looking at like um

1038
00:59:07,599 --> 00:59:09,599
figuring out like glibc versions or

1039
00:59:09,599 --> 00:59:11,440
downloading uh

1040
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:14,160
like an ubuntu image i'm not entirely

1041
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:15,920
sure what's going on there

1042
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:17,040
uh but

1043
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:18,480
yeah

1044
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:19,599
uh

1045
00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:21,599
we'll we'll see if we can manage to kind

1046
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:22,960
of like see what in what direction

1047
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:25,680
they're going with with this

1048
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:28,000
um

1049
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:32,520
but yeah i

1050
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:37,200
it's it would be very interesting to see

1051
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:38,720
like if they have

1052
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:40,799
kind of figured out where

1053
00:59:40,799 --> 00:59:43,200
uh where this check function is going on

1054
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:44,960
uh unfortunately i don't have like the

1055
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:47,359
reference solution so i'm not like

1056
00:59:47,359 --> 00:59:48,799
super familiar with like exactly where

1057
00:59:48,799 --> 00:59:50,640
it's where like where it's doing

1058
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:52,079
something incorrect

1059
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:54,799
but um

1060
00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:56,640
yeah it's uh

1061
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:57,680
also going to be interesting to hear

1062
00:59:57,680 --> 01:00:00,720
then what what the organizers are up to

1063
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:02,480
if they have good progress so we're also

1064
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:04,240
kind of a little bit in the in the dark

1065
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:07,119
uh on that but um

1066
01:00:07,119 --> 01:00:08,960
hopefully

1067
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:10,240
um

1068
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:12,240
we i think we are going to give them a

1069
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:13,920
hint that i'd see

1070
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:15,520
jordan and

1071
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:16,720
ben are discussing a little bit but

1072
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:18,559
what's the exact hint that we want to

1073
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:20,960
give them here to to you know

1074
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:23,770
point them in the right direction

1075
01:00:23,770 --> 01:00:26,839
[Music]

1076
01:00:26,839 --> 01:00:30,880
it's yeah you can see here in the uh

1077
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:31,680
uh

1078
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:33,520
lower lower corner here we have from

1079
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:36,079
time to time we have uh the organizers

1080
01:00:36,079 --> 01:00:38,240
screen like flickering in and out uh

1081
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:39,680
unfortunately

1082
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:42,640
that's the tech situation right now

1083
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:44,079
and uh

1084
01:00:44,079 --> 01:00:45,280
in the meantime i can give you a little

1085
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:47,280
bit of an update on the

1086
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:48,880
combined scoreboard for the for the

1087
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:52,000
defcon ctf uh we have

1088
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,880
still like a fairly tight race we have a

1089
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:56,559
span of

1090
01:00:56,559 --> 01:00:58,480
about 18 000

1091
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:01,359
points for the the leaders katzebin down

1092
01:01:01,359 --> 01:01:02,960
to 14

1093
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:06,400
000 points for the team in 16th place so

1094
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:08,480
definitely still like everyone is

1095
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:10,400
definitely still in the game

1096
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:13,839
uh with top three being katsubin uh mmm

1097
01:01:13,839 --> 01:01:15,839
and perfect roots and they are all

1098
01:01:15,839 --> 01:01:17,440
within like

1099
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:19,839
you know less than uh

1100
01:01:19,839 --> 01:01:22,880
some percent or so of each other so it's

1101
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:25,760
it's uh or maybe like ten percent uh

1102
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:27,119
each other so

1103
01:01:27,119 --> 01:01:30,000
yeah definitely a good uh

1104
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,960
good competition there um

1105
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:35,040
so um

1106
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:36,880
jordan is coming back here so what's the

1107
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:39,040
status what's uh organizers doing uh

1108
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:40,160
we're gonna need some hints they're

1109
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:41,599
they're both still looking i don't see

1110
01:01:41,599 --> 01:01:42,960
any kind of progress so we're gonna

1111
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:45,280
we're gonna drop a hint yes um the hint

1112
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:46,160
that we're gonna there's a couple of

1113
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:47,440
hits we considered one is have you

1114
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:48,960
considered fuzzing

1115
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:50,319
because literally just sending in a

1116
01:01:50,319 --> 01:01:52,960
bunch of a bunch of bytes will actually

1117
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:56,799
um cause overwrite your your uh

1118
01:01:56,799 --> 01:01:58,799
your your game state yes right so that's

1119
01:01:58,799 --> 01:01:59,839
the key thing that they need to figure

1120
01:01:59,839 --> 01:02:01,680
out that if they send in just a too big

1121
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:03,839
of a solution it will actually corrupt

1122
01:02:03,839 --> 01:02:05,680
the the state and they'll get weird

1123
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:07,280
board boards and then it's a matter of

1124
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:09,359
oh okay how do i now create a board that

1125
01:02:09,359 --> 01:02:11,760
would be solvable right so one that we

1126
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:14,880
considered the other one was um

1127
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:17,280
don't let yourself be boxed in

1128
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:18,960
to your solution it's a sudoku puzzle

1129
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:20,799
that's a little probably more obscure so

1130
01:02:20,799 --> 01:02:22,559
yeah um i think we're going to go with

1131
01:02:22,559 --> 01:02:24,000
just um

1132
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,920
how big how like how big is your

1133
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:27,599
solution again question mark or how many

1134
01:02:27,599 --> 01:02:29,440
bytes is your solution question mark

1135
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:31,119
um as our as our next tent and i think

1136
01:02:31,119 --> 01:02:31,920
we're going to give them that because

1137
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:33,760
there's still some work to be done right

1138
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:35,520
um and we want to to give them both a

1139
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:36,880
shot at getting it

1140
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:37,760
otherwise we're going to go to our

1141
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:39,280
sudden death so that's the hint we're

1142
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:40,880
going to go with in the meantime we had

1143
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:43,920
a comment here from from kgf uh these

1144
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:45,520
seems interesting c challenges i think i

1145
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:46,640
would try them all but i'm sure i would

1146
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:48,480
take a lot longer i would too yeah so

1147
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:51,119
that's okay but it is uh like a good

1148
01:02:51,119 --> 01:02:54,240
idea uh i mean in general for ctfs to

1149
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:55,359
like uh

1150
01:02:55,359 --> 01:02:57,200
try out challenges after they've been

1151
01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:59,119
solved uh normally for a lot of

1152
01:02:59,119 --> 01:03:02,160
ctfs people publish uh write-ups so you

1153
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:04,240
can like try the challenges uh that you

1154
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:05,839
didn't manage to solve

1155
01:03:05,839 --> 01:03:07,359
and then kind of use like a write-up or

1156
01:03:07,359 --> 01:03:09,599
so as a reference and then and guide

1157
01:03:09,599 --> 01:03:14,160
your attempts as well to learn more um i

1158
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:15,680
think the idea is that we are releasing

1159
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:17,760
all the challenges it might uh take a

1160
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:19,839
few days for us to uh recover from this

1161
01:03:19,839 --> 01:03:21,920
uh weekend we have

1162
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:24,240
15 matches so

1163
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:28,160
another 11 matches to go after this one

1164
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:30,000
but yeah we'll we will definitely

1165
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,039
publish them

1166
01:03:31,039 --> 01:03:33,359
uh and then uh yeah you can even like

1167
01:03:33,359 --> 01:03:36,079
you know organize your own like mini uh

1168
01:03:36,079 --> 01:03:38,079
uh tournament in your own uh you know

1169
01:03:38,079 --> 01:03:40,079
ctf team or uh

1170
01:03:40,079 --> 01:03:42,640
you know hacker space uh

1171
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:46,400
uh i know that i heard from before the

1172
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:48,799
competition that uh shellfish actually

1173
01:03:48,799 --> 01:03:51,359
did some practice uh for this tournament

1174
01:03:51,359 --> 01:03:53,920
uh by doing like a small uh

1175
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:55,359
mini competition

1176
01:03:55,359 --> 01:03:56,799
of their own within the team which i

1177
01:03:56,799 --> 01:03:58,960
think it paid off and at least it

1178
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:00,480
appears to pay off

1179
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:02,640
as one of the winning teams yeah we'll

1180
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:04,400
see how far they can go

1181
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:05,839
um

1182
01:04:05,839 --> 01:04:08,240
so we have the hints prepared jordan is

1183
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:09,760
going to go and hand that off to the

1184
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:10,960
players

1185
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:14,960
uh we are what's the clock at so we are

1186
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:18,319
so 5 45 so we are 35 minutes into the

1187
01:04:18,319 --> 01:04:20,880
game which is mean that we are running

1188
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:23,200
uh up like against the sudden death uh

1189
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:25,440
clock here uh let's see if they can

1190
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:27,280
manage to figure out this on the other

1191
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:28,640
hand this is also kind of a similar

1192
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:30,079
situation to

1193
01:04:30,079 --> 01:04:32,079
the previous challenge where we were 35

1194
01:04:32,079 --> 01:04:34,720
minutes into the game and then uh it

1195
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:36,400
kind of just like clicked for one of the

1196
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:38,160
players and they managed to go all the

1197
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:41,039
way so uh it's gonna be really exciting

1198
01:04:41,039 --> 01:04:44,079
to see what's going on still a bit

1199
01:04:44,079 --> 01:04:47,440
difficult to kind of like get a read on

1200
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:49,359
uh balsam's progress or like their

1201
01:04:49,359 --> 01:04:50,799
understanding of that they're kind of

1202
01:04:50,799 --> 01:04:52,079
like looking at the code probably

1203
01:04:52,079 --> 01:04:53,440
thinking very hard about you can see

1204
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:55,200
like the mouse moving around

1205
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:56,799
trying to build this mental model of

1206
01:04:56,799 --> 01:04:58,160
what's what's going on you're like kind

1207
01:04:58,160 --> 01:05:00,319
of like running the code in your head

1208
01:05:00,319 --> 01:05:02,000
you know what if this has this value

1209
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,280
like how does that it's probably the

1210
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:04,960
least interesting part of a live ctf

1211
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:06,079
right that's the only downside when you

1212
01:05:06,079 --> 01:05:07,680
have a more reverse engineering heavy

1213
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:09,440
challenge yes is that you're just seeing

1214
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:10,960
people like maybe name stuff if you're

1215
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:12,480
lucky or add comments but most of the

1216
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:14,640
time it's just looking at it right and

1217
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:15,839
what we you know when you know you're

1218
01:05:15,839 --> 01:05:17,039
getting closer when you start seeing a

1219
01:05:17,039 --> 01:05:18,640
crash in a debugger and a payload being

1220
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:20,640
written yeah and we don't have it yet

1221
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:22,400
i'm gonna go ahead and keep an eye on uh

1222
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:24,640
the organizers just briefly yeah and see

1223
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:26,000
if we get any kind of that similar

1224
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,440
product progress

1225
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:30,559
right so we have um

1226
01:05:30,559 --> 01:05:32,240
oh okay we did have a comment somebody

1227
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:33,119
else pointed out thank you for

1228
01:05:33,119 --> 01:05:34,240
clarifying

1229
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:36,160
um the reason that that somebody was

1230
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:37,440
looking for the lipstick was to actually

1231
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:38,640
run it because if you don't have the

1232
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:39,920
same vm

1233
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:42,880
uh handy you can't run that uh libsy so

1234
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:44,000
you can just grab the lipstick from

1235
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,680
another another version

1236
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:47,280
of linux to be able to run the binary so

1237
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:49,119
that is another a completely valid

1238
01:05:49,119 --> 01:05:51,440
reason that you might do that um yes

1239
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:53,440
probably just easier to maybe look at a

1240
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:56,000
previous stream or i have we actually i

1241
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:57,520
don't think we've told people

1242
01:05:57,520 --> 01:05:58,720
what platform that most of our

1243
01:05:58,720 --> 01:05:59,760
challenges all of our challenges were

1244
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:01,839
created on that's actually a good note

1245
01:06:01,839 --> 01:06:03,839
yeah so for future for future things we

1246
01:06:03,839 --> 01:06:05,440
should because that's again

1247
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:07,359
normal and a ctf happens all the time

1248
01:06:07,359 --> 01:06:09,119
you have to figure out the os that it

1249
01:06:09,119 --> 01:06:10,480
was created for match version

1250
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:11,839
information and whatnot

1251
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:13,119
not our intention to make that part of

1252
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:14,640
the challenge here and it's the thing

1253
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:18,319
it's like ubuntu 22 was recent somewhat

1254
01:06:18,319 --> 01:06:21,200
recently went in like lts release and a

1255
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:22,640
lot of people haven't

1256
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:26,400
uh updated to that yet um i uh you know

1257
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:28,640
i i will accept like shared

1258
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:30,079
responsibility on this because like you

1259
01:06:30,079 --> 01:06:32,559
know update your computer's people uh

1260
01:06:32,559 --> 01:06:35,680
but 2004 2204 would probably be the

1261
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:37,839
ubuntu it's the most you know common or

1262
01:06:37,839 --> 01:06:38,880
debian

1263
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:40,400
uh certainly it's it's frequently but

1264
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:41,200
all right let me go and take a look at

1265
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:42,559
the audiences i'll be back and we'll see

1266
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:44,079
how it's going awesome

1267
01:06:44,079 --> 01:06:45,520
so um

1268
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:46,720
i was

1269
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:49,760
talking about something um

1270
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:51,760
when it comes to these challenges

1271
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:53,119
um

1272
01:06:53,119 --> 01:06:55,520
trying to get back on you know my train

1273
01:06:55,520 --> 01:06:56,960
of thought there

1274
01:06:56,960 --> 01:06:58,240
um

1275
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:01,640
with uh

1276
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:03,280
oh yes so

1277
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:05,520
you know uh with this like uh

1278
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:07,359
looking at another player looking at

1279
01:07:07,359 --> 01:07:09,440
code trying to figure things out

1280
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:12,160
a lot of times when i talk to people um

1281
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:13,920
who are you know not experienced ctf

1282
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:16,079
players or don't know what ctfs are

1283
01:07:16,079 --> 01:07:17,440
uh you often get the question it was

1284
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:19,200
like oh is this some kind of like

1285
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:21,359
esports thing or like could you could

1286
01:07:21,359 --> 01:07:23,359
you make this into some kind of like uh

1287
01:07:23,359 --> 01:07:25,359
esports thing and to an extent this is

1288
01:07:25,359 --> 01:07:28,400
kind of what we're trying to do here

1289
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:29,280
but

1290
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:31,680
of course it has its shortcomings that

1291
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:32,400
like

1292
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:36,160
some aspects of ctf um is

1293
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:37,920
kind of like watching someone else take

1294
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:40,400
a maths exam uh it's you know

1295
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:42,799
occasionally not the most exciting so

1296
01:07:42,799 --> 01:07:45,039
we're uh really trying to by adding this

1297
01:07:45,039 --> 01:07:46,480
commentary and trying to understand what

1298
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:47,760
the players are doing we're trying to

1299
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:49,839
make this an interesting and educational

1300
01:07:49,839 --> 01:07:52,319
experience for all of you um

1301
01:07:52,319 --> 01:07:54,079
viewers uh there

1302
01:07:54,079 --> 01:07:58,480
um so i i hope you uh do

1303
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:00,319
uh enjoy this and then you're gonna have

1304
01:08:00,319 --> 01:08:02,480
some takeaways and definitely check out

1305
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:04,880
the challenges uh afterwards

1306
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:08,400
uh to also kind of get a feel for

1307
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:10,559
oh that's you know it might some of

1308
01:08:10,559 --> 01:08:12,000
these might seem simple but when you're

1309
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:13,520
sitting here and actually trying to do

1310
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:15,760
it you have to

1311
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:17,359
consider and take into account all these

1312
01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:19,759
like small little details like

1313
01:08:19,759 --> 01:08:21,520
if you're just out off by one like a

1314
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:24,238
small bit somewhere like the whole thing

1315
01:08:24,238 --> 01:08:26,319
uh doesn't work you need to do all this

1316
01:08:26,319 --> 01:08:28,000
troubleshooting debugging

1317
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:29,839
uh and uh

1318
01:08:29,839 --> 01:08:31,679
i think i mentioned it earlier but like

1319
01:08:31,679 --> 01:08:35,120
when you're writing exploits you are

1320
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:36,479
essentially it's like software

1321
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:38,479
development but with your like hands

1322
01:08:38,479 --> 01:08:40,319
tied behind your back you don't get like

1323
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:41,520
all the nice

1324
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:43,279
tools and helps and error messages that

1325
01:08:43,279 --> 01:08:44,960
you get like during normal software

1326
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:46,000
development

1327
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,080
processes where you know you have all of

1328
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:50,479
these modern uh tools to help you but

1329
01:08:50,479 --> 01:08:52,158
here you're kind of like you're trying

1330
01:08:52,158 --> 01:08:54,960
to bend something in in a way that was

1331
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:55,839
not

1332
01:08:55,839 --> 01:08:58,399
like intended to be used you're

1333
01:08:58,399 --> 01:09:01,120
messing with the state of memory um and

1334
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:03,279
so on so

1335
01:09:03,279 --> 01:09:05,359
it's you really have like everything

1336
01:09:05,359 --> 01:09:06,880
stacked

1337
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:09,839
against you and that is like a big part

1338
01:09:09,839 --> 01:09:11,920
of the challenge when doing these uh

1339
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:13,839
ponables these memory corruption uh

1340
01:09:13,839 --> 01:09:15,279
challenges

1341
01:09:15,279 --> 01:09:18,000
um looking here at the code here we can

1342
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,759
see that

1343
01:09:19,759 --> 01:09:22,080
the balsam player is writing some small

1344
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:24,399
helper function here to send the number

1345
01:09:24,399 --> 01:09:26,719
uh maybe they're gonna try to you know

1346
01:09:26,719 --> 01:09:28,799
use this to try to send different num

1347
01:09:28,799 --> 01:09:31,040
amounts different number of numbers

1348
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:32,880
and uh you know see if they get a kind

1349
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:34,640
of any kind of reaction

1350
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:36,238
out of that

1351
01:09:36,238 --> 01:09:37,679
um

1352
01:09:37,679 --> 01:09:40,960
haven't really seen yet what

1353
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:42,479
oh so now they're gonna send like a

1354
01:09:42,479 --> 01:09:46,399
thousand zeros that's that's interesting

1355
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:49,439
so we um here like yeah it's unsolvable

1356
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:51,520
yeah like the sudoku itself is

1357
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:52,880
unsolvable and that's kind of like the

1358
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:54,960
twist of this whole thing that uh

1359
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:56,640
you know at face value just a solder

1360
01:09:56,640 --> 01:09:58,640
sudoku can win uh but then it's it's

1361
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:00,000
unsolvable so

1362
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,440
uh yeah that's kind of like the recap

1363
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:03,520
for for people just recently tuning in

1364
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:04,480
and

1365
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:06,400
speaking of recap

1366
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:07,600
just to tell you again a little bit

1367
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:09,760
about what we're doing here so we're

1368
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:13,360
here uh in vegas uh on site at defcon so

1369
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:16,640
organizing this live cdf as part of the

1370
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:19,679
um official defcon cdf so this is kind

1371
01:10:19,679 --> 01:10:21,600
of like a sub event where all the 16 uh

1372
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:23,280
participating teams

1373
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:25,520
uh participate in this like single

1374
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:27,760
elimination knockout tournament where in

1375
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:30,000
each match the teams send one player to

1376
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,360
go

1377
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:33,679
head to head against the other team to

1378
01:10:33,679 --> 01:10:35,840
be the first one to solve a

1379
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:39,280
relatively simple uh ctf uh challenge

1380
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:41,920
i mean relatively is relative yes yes

1381
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:43,679
and that's i really want to stress

1382
01:10:43,679 --> 01:10:45,280
relatively and i want to be clear i

1383
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:46,560
wouldn't personally solve half of the

1384
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:48,080
ones that were fielding in the allotted

1385
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:48,960
time

1386
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:50,719
uh i we you know tried some of them in

1387
01:10:50,719 --> 01:10:52,239
it you know i could get them but maybe

1388
01:10:52,239 --> 01:10:54,800
take a little bit a little bit longer so

1389
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:56,080
i have a lot of respect for these people

1390
01:10:56,080 --> 01:10:58,400
they're all very very good and they're

1391
01:10:58,400 --> 01:10:59,600
dealing with the pressure being on

1392
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:00,560
camera

1393
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:02,159
there's a crowd standing around them

1394
01:11:02,159 --> 01:11:03,760
watching them

1395
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:06,159
it is uh it can be

1396
01:11:06,159 --> 01:11:08,400
it can be pretty nerve-wracking so uh

1397
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:09,520
i'm

1398
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:11,679
predicting oh that is

1399
01:11:11,679 --> 01:11:14,400
quite the visual effect there yeah uh

1400
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:16,960
you know the photo sensitivity warnings

1401
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:19,120
here uh i think it's only on our monitor

1402
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:20,480
i don't see it no no no no it's it's

1403
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:22,320
it's on stream as well yes we have some

1404
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:23,840
yeah so switching not sure what that's

1405
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:25,600
about uh feels like our whole uh

1406
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:27,440
infrastructure is slowly melting uh so

1407
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:29,280
we don't know it's fine it's everything

1408
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:31,360
wow that is

1409
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:33,920
that is unusual yep um maybe we're

1410
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:35,760
getting hacked by the players like

1411
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:36,800
through the

1412
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:38,640
hdmi cable they're playing the other

1413
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:41,199
game the other the other ctf challenge i

1414
01:11:41,199 --> 01:11:41,920
mean

1415
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:43,840
we would be lying if we would say that

1416
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:46,320
we did not have a discussion about like

1417
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:48,400
what shenanigans could the team try to

1418
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:49,920
pull off and how we would yeah yeah

1419
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:51,440
measure against it or what we would do

1420
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:53,280
so doing that kind of like threat uh

1421
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:56,159
threat analysis uh or a threat modeling

1422
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:58,800
uh against three more minutes

1423
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:00,880
three more minutes until it's gone this

1424
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:03,280
has been a very fast 45 minutes

1425
01:12:03,280 --> 01:12:06,000
it's looking unlikely um uh that either

1426
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,239
one i did see some some debugger action

1427
01:12:08,239 --> 01:12:11,199
yes um i'm gonna make one last pass if

1428
01:12:11,199 --> 01:12:12,800
we see somebody very close so they're

1429
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:14,320
making progress we might be able to give

1430
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:15,520
them just a little bit extra but

1431
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:19,360
basically we're about ready to deploy

1432
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:23,040
or if they optionally want to extend it

1433
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:24,640
um that's not a bad idea we can both ask

1434
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:25,679
both if they both say they want to

1435
01:12:25,679 --> 01:12:27,040
extend it we'll let them go because

1436
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:28,960
they're the last one yeah and if

1437
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:30,960
so the rules are if one of them says

1438
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:32,239
they don't like they want to go side and

1439
01:12:32,239 --> 01:12:33,840
death then we go if both of them won't

1440
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:35,520
extend it then it's fine exactly right i

1441
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:37,360
will see what they say but ask them like

1442
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:39,360
you know

1443
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:41,679
independent like you know one-on-one

1444
01:12:41,679 --> 01:12:44,560
like to not give any like pressure

1445
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:46,320
yeah i mean it would it would be cool to

1446
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:49,280
see a solution on this and i think we do

1447
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:50,719
since we have been keeping up with the

1448
01:12:50,719 --> 01:12:54,320
schedule we do have that kind of time

1449
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:57,120
but again the uh yeah it's it's

1450
01:12:57,120 --> 01:12:59,199
difficult to to to say what the players

1451
01:12:59,199 --> 01:13:00,640
want like this is kind of like your kind

1452
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:02,400
of game theory thing like do you want to

1453
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:04,719
go to southern depth or not like it's a

1454
01:13:04,719 --> 01:13:07,120
high-risk environment right when you're

1455
01:13:07,120 --> 01:13:08,960
going to do this super fast

1456
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:10,960
do you think that you also you don't

1457
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:12,880
know the progress of the other player

1458
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:14,560
like do you think you have better

1459
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:16,159
progress than the other player in this

1460
01:13:16,159 --> 01:13:18,400
challenge right now and

1461
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:20,640
if you don't do you think you have a

1462
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:21,920
better chance of beating them in the

1463
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:24,320
sudden death one versus catching up with

1464
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:26,880
them in the current challenge it's uh

1465
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:29,840
definitely not an easy uh decision uh to

1466
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:33,440
make by the players so uh what's uh

1467
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:35,760
what's the verdict what do you think

1468
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:37,440
what would you if you're in their shoes

1469
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:39,199
oh no i would say extendeds absolutely

1470
01:13:39,199 --> 01:13:40,800
yes okay absolutely nice so we have a

1471
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:42,320
game here yeah so

1472
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:44,080
i'm i'm happy with this because i don't

1473
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:45,520
want to change the rules in a way that

1474
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:47,440
they're unhappy with but they both want

1475
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:49,199
to solve it maybe nobody wants to give

1476
01:13:49,199 --> 01:13:51,040
up on it no no no no no no that you've

1477
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:52,719
been working hard that you started

1478
01:13:52,719 --> 01:13:54,560
you're having a little bit of an idea

1479
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:56,159
i'm glad i really want to see them see

1480
01:13:56,159 --> 01:13:57,600
this through we'll let them go it's the

1481
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:59,520
last one of the day so we're not running

1482
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:00,800
over anything else

1483
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:01,679
um

1484
01:14:01,679 --> 01:14:03,360
i'm actually kind of excited no 100 i

1485
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:04,800
saw a

1486
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:07,199
story related to that so i was playing

1487
01:14:07,199 --> 01:14:09,760
in the qualifiers for the defcon uh ctf

1488
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:13,040
with our scandinavian uh team norscode

1489
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:14,239
and i was

1490
01:14:14,239 --> 01:14:15,920
basically sitting all weekend with one

1491
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:18,560
challenge uh so i mean i took breaks and

1492
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:20,080
met some friends and stuff but

1493
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:21,679
there was a lot of hours this is perry's

1494
01:14:21,679 --> 01:14:23,040
challenge there was this was paris

1495
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:25,199
challenge it was the uh crypto ponable

1496
01:14:25,199 --> 01:14:27,280
thing uh so after i don't know if i

1497
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:29,280
spent uh if i don't remember it was like

1498
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:32,239
10 20 or 30 hours on this but regardless

1499
01:14:32,239 --> 01:14:35,199
i uh solved it like two minutes after

1500
01:14:35,199 --> 01:14:38,880
the ctf ended yep and that uh yeah i

1501
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:40,560
mean on the one hand it's crushing and

1502
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:42,320
on the other hand though you still

1503
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:44,560
solved it you still solved it and that's

1504
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:46,239
the thing like

1505
01:14:46,239 --> 01:14:47,120
when

1506
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:49,280
when the time ran out like i could have

1507
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:52,320
just stopped because like

1508
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:53,520
it doesn't matter anymore like we're not

1509
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:55,760
gonna get any points but i i was so

1510
01:14:55,760 --> 01:14:57,840
close i did want not want to stop there

1511
01:14:57,840 --> 01:14:58,960
yeah

1512
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:00,800
so the only kind of like

1513
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:02,000
um

1514
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,400
saving grace for or you want to call it

1515
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:06,560
for that was that in the end

1516
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:08,320
solving that challenge or not would not

1517
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:09,760
have affected whether we qualified or

1518
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:11,679
not that that would have been crushing

1519
01:15:11,679 --> 01:15:13,199
that's a little demoralizing yeah when

1520
01:15:13,199 --> 01:15:14,080
it would have been it would have been

1521
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:15,440
the difference luckily even if with

1522
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:16,800
those points we wouldn't we would have

1523
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:19,280
been just below the qualifying limits so

1524
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:20,960
at least at least you had clarity there

1525
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:22,560
there either way yeah i i was

1526
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:24,000
comfortable with that that was fine and

1527
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,320
also that means that you know i could uh

1528
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:29,360
uh be part of this uh without having to

1529
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:32,880
like uh betray uh the team right so uh

1530
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:36,560
yeah all right okay so

1531
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:39,360
we are

1532
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:40,960
there's a question here about whether it

1533
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:43,360
was ncat no this was the uh

1534
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:47,280
it was a crypto ponable uh challenge uh

1535
01:15:47,280 --> 01:15:49,040
it was about like a function closure

1536
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:51,280
thing uh c plus plus we could go ask

1537
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:52,960
yeah perry she's somewhere so she was

1538
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:54,640
she just was in the room she just left

1539
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:56,880
right um but yeah i've heard a number of

1540
01:15:56,880 --> 01:15:58,719
people that that worked on that it was a

1541
01:15:58,719 --> 01:16:01,199
great challenge like i i enjoyed it a

1542
01:16:01,199 --> 01:16:02,960
lot

1543
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:05,760
but it was tough okay so

1544
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:07,840
we we don't have a hard time but now now

1545
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:09,040
it's basically we're just going to let

1546
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:11,360
it go until either we are convinced it's

1547
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:14,080
going to take way too long or uh

1548
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:14,880
you know

1549
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:16,320
we'll we'll we'll see at this point but

1550
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:17,280
they both

1551
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:18,560
want to keep going

1552
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:20,159
i would love for one of them to get it

1553
01:16:20,159 --> 01:16:21,840
it not only means we get to save one of

1554
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:23,520
our sudden deaths um but i think it's

1555
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:25,199
just way more fulfilling for them and

1556
01:16:25,199 --> 01:16:26,719
for the audience to see kind of like the

1557
01:16:26,719 --> 01:16:28,800
yes the hard one the hard one solves so

1558
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:30,320
we're looking forward to it

1559
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:31,760
um

1560
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:33,120
it is interesting that we've got rop

1561
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:34,880
gadget address just kind of coming out

1562
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:36,239
it looks like it looks like a template i

1563
01:16:36,239 --> 01:16:37,840
think that this existed because yeah

1564
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:40,719
hopefully they have an idea that that is

1565
01:16:40,719 --> 01:16:42,159
but we are seeing like someone is

1566
01:16:42,159 --> 01:16:43,920
writing something very deliberate here

1567
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:46,560
right this is like to print out

1568
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:50,159
the board somehow but um

1569
01:16:50,159 --> 01:16:51,300
let's see they are

1570
01:16:51,300 --> 01:16:54,320
[Music]

1571
01:16:54,320 --> 01:16:55,840
trying to see i mean this this like

1572
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:57,440
double loop there is to print out some

1573
01:16:57,440 --> 01:17:00,080
state but that part above

1574
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:01,440
you see something where they're like

1575
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:05,199
cutting off they're swapping

1576
01:17:06,480 --> 01:17:08,719
all right

1577
01:17:08,719 --> 01:17:10,320
oh is this just to

1578
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:13,040
generate a valid generate a uh solution

1579
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:14,560
that they i mean i would just search the

1580
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:16,560
internet for solid sudoku board and copy

1581
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:18,320
and paste it but but if that is what

1582
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:19,440
they're doing that would that would be

1583
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:21,360
valid too right so the idea is that you

1584
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:22,640
want to kind of like overflow and stuff

1585
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:25,760
to like basically insert

1586
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:27,520
to modify the state into something

1587
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:28,640
that's either

1588
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:30,960
solvable or already solved

1589
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:34,239
uh and uh so they need to have that okay

1590
01:17:34,239 --> 01:17:35,840
so we're seeing we're seeing interesting

1591
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:37,920
we're seeing calculations we're seeing

1592
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:41,360
uh length calculations

1593
01:17:41,360 --> 01:17:43,199
uh unfortunately i was hoping we'd get

1594
01:17:43,199 --> 01:17:45,520
some more uh

1595
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:47,120
video from the new organizer oh it came

1596
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:49,280
in briefly yes

1597
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:52,080
with some debugger output there right

1598
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:53,760
yeah yeah we'll leave it up for a second

1599
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:54,800
and just kind of show them both and we

1600
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:56,480
might be able to see a little bit yeah

1601
01:17:56,480 --> 01:17:58,800
see there it's coming on man that's

1602
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:01,440
tantalizing that's so mean yeah this

1603
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:04,239
this cable is has been yeah we might

1604
01:18:04,239 --> 01:18:06,320
have to do some shopping oh there is

1605
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:08,320
definitely a shopping run tonight so we

1606
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:09,920
should be able to have this solved uh

1607
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:11,760
and out of the way and that way we got a

1608
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:13,679
long day eight hours tomorrow of

1609
01:18:13,679 --> 01:18:16,320
hopefully uninterrupted stream

1610
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:17,840
yeah we'll see we'll see if that if that

1611
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:19,040
turns out to be the case i mean given

1612
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:20,960
that it's only been

1613
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:22,960
we've swapped out the capture card the

1614
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:24,480
usbc cable

1615
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:25,760
the hdmi is the only thing we haven't

1616
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:27,440
swapped out but it's been that same side

1617
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:29,360
of the table consistently

1618
01:18:29,360 --> 01:18:31,679
yes that's been having these problems

1619
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:33,040
it makes me think that yeah we've just

1620
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:35,600
got an hdmi cable that

1621
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:38,640
is suspicious uh so

1622
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:39,840
we'll see if we can we can get that

1623
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:41,760
going all right um

1624
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:42,800
actually let me i'm gonna go ahead and

1625
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:44,719
do another in person look i'm gonna go

1626
01:18:44,719 --> 01:18:46,480
ahead take a look at new organizers

1627
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:47,920
um we'll be back with an update shortly

1628
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:48,960
because i

1629
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:51,360
debugger is generally a good sign yes i

1630
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:54,239
suspect

1631
01:18:54,239 --> 01:18:56,320
i saw like a bin bash string in the

1632
01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:59,679
debugger there somehow

1633
01:18:59,679 --> 01:19:01,520
but that doesn't really make sense right

1634
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:03,520
because well i mean with the intended

1635
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:04,719
solution that doesn't mean they're not

1636
01:19:04,719 --> 01:19:07,120
going to do oh no yeah and there also is

1637
01:19:07,120 --> 01:19:08,560
the

1638
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:10,000
so i'm trying to remember how the wind

1639
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:11,120
function

1640
01:19:11,120 --> 01:19:12,800
runs it may just show it may be from the

1641
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:14,080
wind function

1642
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:15,520
on the stack as well too i don't

1643
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:16,719
remember but no they shouldn't be

1644
01:19:16,719 --> 01:19:18,320
getting to that

1645
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:21,280
yes let's see i don't see the

1646
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:22,960
in in the meantime i wanted to take like

1647
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:26,159
uh like just ask people who are uh

1648
01:19:26,159 --> 01:19:28,560
watching whether you are like uh and is

1649
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:30,480
it anyone here in uh

1650
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:32,719
in vegas attending defcon or are you

1651
01:19:32,719 --> 01:19:34,320
watching from uh

1652
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:36,800
all over the world like who do we have

1653
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:38,640
here we saw someone from kenya even uh

1654
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:40,159
chimed in earlier oh wow they were

1655
01:19:40,159 --> 01:19:42,400
watching so we know we do have yeah uh

1656
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:43,679
some world wide webs it's interesting to

1657
01:19:43,679 --> 01:19:45,440
go and see those like analytics

1658
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:48,320
afterwards see uh who's watching um

1659
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:50,400
but yeah it's uh do we have any people

1660
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:53,840
so and by the way like if you are um

1661
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:56,159
if you are here at def con uh you know

1662
01:19:56,159 --> 01:19:59,120
feel free to come by in the the ctf uh

1663
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:00,239
area

1664
01:20:00,239 --> 01:20:02,480
uh we probably won't be able to talk a

1665
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:04,320
ton but uh hopefully yeah like if you

1666
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:05,760
come if you come during matches you can

1667
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:07,040
watch the matches if you come between

1668
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:08,960
matches uh you can uh you know have a

1669
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:11,120
chat with us hopefully if we're not

1670
01:20:11,120 --> 01:20:12,400
panicking

1671
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:14,880
uh yeah someone's watching from the ctf

1672
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:17,760
floor okay nice and also from europe in

1673
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:19,600
the hotel room giving your feet a break

1674
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:22,239
yeah that's a wise decision i think i'm

1675
01:20:22,239 --> 01:20:25,520
ready for my my feet my throat like

1676
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:26,960
several parts of me to break oh yeah

1677
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:28,719
yeah i mean we've been talking here for

1678
01:20:28,719 --> 01:20:30,480
like okay so there's this is interesting

1679
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:32,320
these these uh those ascii values are

1680
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:34,719
being converted to integers on

1681
01:20:34,719 --> 01:20:36,080
on this so we we're looking at a

1682
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:38,320
debugger dump of the game state right so

1683
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:39,440
we can see

1684
01:20:39,440 --> 01:20:41,360
we do see the the game state the zero

1685
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:42,719
you know it's really obvious to see

1686
01:20:42,719 --> 01:20:44,320
those those numbers

1687
01:20:44,320 --> 01:20:47,120
cool um

1688
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:49,199
yeah and you can see

1689
01:20:49,199 --> 01:20:51,520
look at that bass uh thing there you

1690
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:53,360
have like generating a list of integers

1691
01:20:53,360 --> 01:20:56,000
from 0 to 96 which is

1692
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
interesting is that

1693
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:59,120
um

1694
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:01,760
yeah we have watchers from estonia and

1695
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:03,440
brazil people who are saying they they

1696
01:21:03,440 --> 01:21:05,600
want to go visit defcon in the future

1697
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:07,280
yeah i think uh defcon is like it's a

1698
01:21:07,280 --> 01:21:09,920
cool event to to visit it's uh i think

1699
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:11,280
they're trying to increase the amount of

1700
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:12,639
streaming and online presence as well

1701
01:21:12,639 --> 01:21:14,239
too so you probably will be able to find

1702
01:21:14,239 --> 01:21:15,280
other

1703
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:16,960
streams i think there's even some webcam

1704
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:18,800
like 360 degree webcam virtual cameras

1705
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:19,840
are putting up in a couple of the rooms

1706
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:21,920
where you can watch what's going on so

1707
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:24,000
trying to improve like the accessibility

1708
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
i mean i'm certainly with with kovid

1709
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:27,920
in general most conferences have tried

1710
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:30,000
to adapt better for okay we have

1711
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:31,040
somebody

1712
01:21:31,040 --> 01:21:32,639
watching right next to our camera let's

1713
01:21:32,639 --> 01:21:34,000
hope they don't bump it

1714
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,159
um

1715
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:39,760
but anyway again checking the

1716
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:42,400
code here they're writing um i'm trying

1717
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:43,840
to get a better feel for what they're

1718
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:45,520
doing like

1719
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:47,520
again they're generating like a list of

1720
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:50,880
numbers uh okay also they need to find

1721
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:52,880
like the right uh offset for their

1722
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:54,880
overflow this actually looks really good

1723
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:56,560
yes this actually does look really good

1724
01:21:56,560 --> 01:21:58,560
because like once they finish this yeah

1725
01:21:58,560 --> 01:22:00,239
yeah if they get the right offset let me

1726
01:22:00,239 --> 01:22:01,360
go look at the other one but we might be

1727
01:22:01,360 --> 01:22:04,159
closing in yes

1728
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:08,000
so that's that's really cool like we can

1729
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:09,440
like it once they get that thing it's

1730
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:11,199
going to be real quick like we are

1731
01:22:11,199 --> 01:22:12,880
probably going to miss

1732
01:22:12,880 --> 01:22:14,239
there's a big risk we're going to miss

1733
01:22:14,239 --> 01:22:16,960
like the moment but so basically if i'm

1734
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:18,239
reading this correctly what they're

1735
01:22:18,239 --> 01:22:20,320
trying to do is like find the offset in

1736
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:21,760
memory like

1737
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:23,360
they're overflowing something and then

1738
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:26,080
like how far into this do they want to

1739
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:26,880
put

1740
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:28,480
whatever they are placing there which

1741
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:31,120
should be the the solved or solvable

1742
01:22:31,120 --> 01:22:33,360
uh state

1743
01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:35,199
um so

1744
01:22:35,199 --> 01:22:37,040
yeah they might definitely be on to

1745
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:38,800
something they're switching the numbers

1746
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:41,360
around a little bit maybe it's that they

1747
01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:44,080
so they switched the zeros to a one

1748
01:22:44,080 --> 01:22:44,880
uh

1749
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:48,000
which seemed to have crashed the program

1750
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:48,570
and then

1751
01:22:48,570 --> 01:22:50,080
[Music]

1752
01:22:50,080 --> 01:22:53,040
checking why this is happening um yeah

1753
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:54,560
we have someone from morocco as well

1754
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:56,159
cool

1755
01:22:56,159 --> 01:22:58,560
uh that's uh it's cool to see we have

1756
01:22:58,560 --> 01:22:59,840
people all over

1757
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:00,880
uh

1758
01:23:00,880 --> 01:23:04,480
i guess the i'm trying to like

1759
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:06,239
work out like what what time it is

1760
01:23:06,239 --> 01:23:08,960
across the world at the moment uh

1761
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:11,520
but uh wait what's the people watching

1762
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:13,199
from europe it's like in the middle of

1763
01:23:13,199 --> 01:23:16,880
the night there uh so that's uh

1764
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:18,880
dedication

1765
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:21,120
uh i hope you're enjoying it

1766
01:23:21,120 --> 01:23:22,960
uh trying to see here that they're just

1767
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:25,520
quickly looking at the disassembly again

1768
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:26,960
uh

1769
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:29,440
trying to

1770
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:31,520
maybe looking for some specific offsets

1771
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:35,199
or so um

1772
01:23:35,199 --> 01:23:38,000
yes they did get some specific offset to

1773
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,719
to put a break point uh

1774
01:23:40,719 --> 01:23:42,080
there right and then they're also

1775
01:23:42,080 --> 01:23:45,199
looking at the base um

1776
01:23:45,199 --> 01:23:46,400
oh yeah to make the breakpoint in the

1777
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:49,040
car or maybe not the breakpoint or the

1778
01:23:49,040 --> 01:23:50,000
um

1779
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:51,040
the the

1780
01:23:51,040 --> 01:23:54,560
offset where to inspect the memory

1781
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:56,320
oh yeah

1782
01:23:56,320 --> 01:23:57,760
oh yeah people saying they're watching

1783
01:23:57,760 --> 01:23:59,040
from like yeah definitely middle of the

1784
01:23:59,040 --> 01:24:00,639
night um

1785
01:24:00,639 --> 01:24:03,840
you know uh

1786
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:08,400
awesome netherlands represented as well

1787
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:09,199
so

1788
01:24:09,199 --> 01:24:10,800
i i'm seeing some interesting stuff

1789
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:12,159
there but uh

1790
01:24:12,159 --> 01:24:14,840
what did you see uh

1791
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:18,159
uh yeah so the

1792
01:24:18,159 --> 01:24:18,960
i mean

1793
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:20,880
i hate to take bets yeah because i've

1794
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:23,600
lost a lot of money at this table so far

1795
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:26,719
if uh if uh if this was a gambling

1796
01:24:26,719 --> 01:24:28,159
arrangement i would i would not be doing

1797
01:24:28,159 --> 01:24:29,120
so well

1798
01:24:29,120 --> 01:24:31,679
but i will i feel also feel like i tend

1799
01:24:31,679 --> 01:24:33,440
to favor my side of the table and then

1800
01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:34,800
we've had all these surprise victories

1801
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:36,560
from the other ones yeah pop up several

1802
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:38,080
times but

1803
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:41,520
all that said i do think team taiwan

1804
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:42,880
has a little bit of a leap so looking at

1805
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:44,400
the new organizers

1806
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:46,960
we've got a script uh it has a bunch of

1807
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:49,040
it's some a mixture of gdb some phone

1808
01:24:49,040 --> 01:24:50,159
tools and then as well as you know

1809
01:24:50,159 --> 01:24:52,639
sending inputs and kind of breaking in

1810
01:24:52,639 --> 01:24:54,480
i didn't get the sense that they they

1811
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:55,440
had

1812
01:24:55,440 --> 01:24:58,480
an overall plan for what to do

1813
01:24:58,480 --> 01:25:00,400
right but again i

1814
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:01,440
definitely the one thing i've learned is

1815
01:25:01,440 --> 01:25:03,360
that i don't know what i'm doing anyways

1816
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:04,880
like it's it is really hard to

1817
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:06,159
understand exactly what's going on their

1818
01:25:06,159 --> 01:25:08,239
head and so you're not always right

1819
01:25:08,239 --> 01:25:09,199
um

1820
01:25:09,199 --> 01:25:13,000
whereas i will say

1821
01:25:14,480 --> 01:25:16,159
it certainly looks like with that offset

1822
01:25:16,159 --> 01:25:18,880
right we were seeing a a valid solved

1823
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:20,000
sudoku

1824
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:21,360
trying to find the right offset to line

1825
01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:22,560
it up which

1826
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:24,560
sounds like from what i understand of it

1827
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:26,560
is is the intended solution

1828
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:27,600
um

1829
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:29,120
so

1830
01:25:29,120 --> 01:25:31,599
we'll see

1831
01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:34,080
yep

1832
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:38,320
can we can we get some some confirmation

1833
01:25:38,320 --> 01:25:39,679
is the the solution

1834
01:25:39,679 --> 01:25:41,440
if is it just misaligning the correct

1835
01:25:41,440 --> 01:25:42,639
board the certain number of bytes will

1836
01:25:42,639 --> 01:25:45,920
that trigger it essentially

1837
01:25:45,920 --> 01:25:47,679
any credit board at the right offset so

1838
01:25:47,679 --> 01:25:48,560
just put the right amount of padding

1839
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:50,000
bytes in and then it will override it

1840
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:53,159
the right

1841
01:25:59,440 --> 01:26:01,919
sagan

1842
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:10,320
yep uh

1843
01:26:10,320 --> 01:26:13,679
then you mark it as salt yeah

1844
01:26:19,520 --> 01:26:21,120
oh just send anything and it will just

1845
01:26:21,120 --> 01:26:22,560
market us up

1846
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:24,159
right

1847
01:26:24,159 --> 01:26:27,120
okay so what uh our producer there said

1848
01:26:27,120 --> 01:26:28,800
was that

1849
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:30,560
you first you send

1850
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:34,639
a solvable state you override the

1851
01:26:34,639 --> 01:26:36,239
the thing the states with the solvable

1852
01:26:36,239 --> 01:26:37,840
one and then you just send something to

1853
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:40,080
like trigger to recheck and like have it

1854
01:26:40,080 --> 01:26:45,040
be uh solved and you get to win uh there

1855
01:26:46,159 --> 01:26:47,920
we can see here

1856
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:49,760
they are like working out in a text

1857
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:51,280
editor i think yeah it still looks like

1858
01:26:51,280 --> 01:26:52,960
they're trying to solve the state as it

1859
01:26:52,960 --> 01:26:56,320
exists not overwrite

1860
01:26:56,320 --> 01:26:58,800
the the state with their solve like so

1861
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:01,280
what i saw but i wonder i'm a little

1862
01:27:01,280 --> 01:27:02,239
afraid

1863
01:27:02,239 --> 01:27:03,600
they got the overwrite but if their

1864
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:05,600
exploit didn't try to like send another

1865
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:07,520
round for validation

1866
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:09,280
it like overwrote it

1867
01:27:09,280 --> 01:27:12,239
but then never oh oh wow that would be

1868
01:27:12,239 --> 01:27:14,719
uh that would be terrible um so it is

1869
01:27:14,719 --> 01:27:16,239
possible that they've essentially had

1870
01:27:16,239 --> 01:27:18,080
the right solution

1871
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:20,480
just didn't re-trigger it to be able to

1872
01:27:20,480 --> 01:27:23,280
actually get to the wind function um

1873
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:25,360
so

1874
01:27:25,360 --> 01:27:27,600
we will we will see

1875
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:28,880
uh we're only a little bit late

1876
01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:30,400
especially actually we technically we

1877
01:27:30,400 --> 01:27:31,360
have two more minutes before the

1878
01:27:31,360 --> 01:27:33,040
original length of this and we're

1879
01:27:33,040 --> 01:27:34,719
letting it run long just because of the

1880
01:27:34,719 --> 01:27:36,320
the last one of the day

1881
01:27:36,320 --> 01:27:37,440
um

1882
01:27:37,440 --> 01:27:38,800
and we prefer they have a chance to if

1883
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:41,520
they can but there will our voices will

1884
01:27:41,520 --> 01:27:43,199
give out and we'll be some point which

1885
01:27:43,199 --> 01:27:44,320
we say

1886
01:27:44,320 --> 01:27:46,320
sorry we're cutting you off uh but none

1887
01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:48,480
of us want that to happen so

1888
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:50,320
so we'll see yeah we're checking uh

1889
01:27:50,320 --> 01:27:52,719
we're taking a bets here and uh

1890
01:27:52,719 --> 01:27:55,199
hoping this will work

1891
01:27:55,199 --> 01:27:57,360
um we're also about to lose power on our

1892
01:27:57,360 --> 01:28:00,400
our chats yes tunisia excellent welcome

1893
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:01,199
yeah

1894
01:28:01,199 --> 01:28:02,719
i've been to tunisia for a ctf

1895
01:28:02,719 --> 01:28:04,719
competition have you really i actually i

1896
01:28:04,719 --> 01:28:06,000
think i get invited to speak there one

1897
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:07,600
time at a conference and yeah there we

1898
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:09,120
go um so

1899
01:28:09,120 --> 01:28:10,639
let's see if that actually powers it i

1900
01:28:10,639 --> 01:28:11,679
don't know what this is plugged into at

1901
01:28:11,679 --> 01:28:12,880
this point

1902
01:28:12,880 --> 01:28:14,800
yeah power on our one of our screen

1903
01:28:14,800 --> 01:28:16,480
services all right good and that way we

1904
01:28:16,480 --> 01:28:19,360
also have like a graphical glitch on the

1905
01:28:19,360 --> 01:28:20,960
about some screen but it's just it's

1906
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:22,400
just blocking the ads so i'm okay with

1907
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:23,840
it that sounds great that's okay i wish

1908
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:25,600
i wish all of my graphics list is just

1909
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:28,400
blocked out ads as i surfed oh yeah

1910
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:31,280
so uh as an employee of a big ad tech

1911
01:28:31,280 --> 01:28:32,880
company i will have to uh

1912
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:35,600
a large tech company whose revenue might

1913
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:40,480
depend heavily on ad yeah uh you know

1914
01:28:40,480 --> 01:28:42,320
yeah are you allowed to ruin ad blockers

1915
01:28:42,320 --> 01:28:43,440
no i'm not gonna make you talk at work

1916
01:28:43,440 --> 01:28:44,960
i'm not gonna take it work all right all

1917
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:46,800
right i'm not gonna do that

1918
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:50,159
all right so here we go

1919
01:28:52,080 --> 01:28:54,480
so i s this

1920
01:28:54,480 --> 01:28:55,760
still feels like we're trying to solve

1921
01:28:55,760 --> 01:28:57,040
it

1922
01:28:57,040 --> 01:28:59,600
i don't i don't see

1923
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:03,520
i don't see the the uh

1924
01:29:04,239 --> 01:29:05,760
the exploit like i don't see them

1925
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:07,199
actually like

1926
01:29:07,199 --> 01:29:09,199
exploiting it well i mean

1927
01:29:09,199 --> 01:29:10,400
this

1928
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:12,480
might still work like if their idea is

1929
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:15,120
to just like overwrite a couple of

1930
01:29:15,120 --> 01:29:16,639
values and then make it solvable and

1931
01:29:16,639 --> 01:29:17,920
then put it into solution like but

1932
01:29:17,920 --> 01:29:18,960
they're not a fast solution they're

1933
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:20,159
going to inherently have to overwrite

1934
01:29:20,159 --> 01:29:21,040
the whole thing though right because

1935
01:29:21,040 --> 01:29:23,360
they're just linearly well i mean it

1936
01:29:23,360 --> 01:29:24,880
might be that they think that they can

1937
01:29:24,880 --> 01:29:26,480
only overwrite like the beginning of it

1938
01:29:26,480 --> 01:29:27,920
or something like this you're still

1939
01:29:27,920 --> 01:29:30,159
gonna have a null at the end so no no no

1940
01:29:30,159 --> 01:29:31,440
necessarily because it's gonna convert

1941
01:29:31,440 --> 01:29:32,480
in written yeah i know that's okay

1942
01:29:32,480 --> 01:29:34,159
that's fair i mean it could it could

1943
01:29:34,159 --> 01:29:35,840
work like it's not the not not the

1944
01:29:35,840 --> 01:29:38,320
intended play but uh it could probably

1945
01:29:38,320 --> 01:29:39,760
work

1946
01:29:39,760 --> 01:29:41,679
so yeah

1947
01:29:41,679 --> 01:29:42,880
unless there's a question mark at the

1948
01:29:42,880 --> 01:29:44,239
very end of the puzzle if there's an

1949
01:29:44,239 --> 01:29:47,280
unallocated one at the very end that

1950
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:49,520
would have to be

1951
01:29:49,520 --> 01:29:50,960
well we'll see

1952
01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:53,840
yeah we'll see all right

1953
01:29:53,840 --> 01:29:56,639
a few more few few more bits

1954
01:29:56,639 --> 01:29:57,840
thanks everybody for hanging with us

1955
01:29:57,840 --> 01:29:58,960
this has been

1956
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:01,199
like just utterly exhausting and super

1957
01:30:01,199 --> 01:30:02,239
exciting

1958
01:30:02,239 --> 01:30:04,320
um just as a quick recap you know from

1959
01:30:04,320 --> 01:30:07,520
our from our earlier games we had uh a

1960
01:30:07,520 --> 01:30:09,280
nail biter of a finish at the very

1961
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:11,600
beginning from uh shellfish versus ptb

1962
01:30:11,600 --> 01:30:14,000
wtl oh yeah like they were

1963
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,239
i think within a few key strokes of each

1964
01:30:16,239 --> 01:30:18,080
other like you can't get a tighter match

1965
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:19,840
like i know we were looking at one

1966
01:30:19,840 --> 01:30:22,159
screen i would try to declare a winner

1967
01:30:22,159 --> 01:30:24,000
yeah and then the other one popped it

1968
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:25,920
just was so quick yeah so that was

1969
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:27,120
fantastic make sure you go back and

1970
01:30:27,120 --> 01:30:29,520
check the uh the replay on that one

1971
01:30:29,520 --> 01:30:31,840
uh we're gonna end the stream today when

1972
01:30:31,840 --> 01:30:33,199
we're done with this particular

1973
01:30:33,199 --> 01:30:35,760
challenge um oops sorry about that i hit

1974
01:30:35,760 --> 01:30:37,280
the microphone uh we're going to end the

1975
01:30:37,280 --> 01:30:39,679
stream today uh once we're we're done

1976
01:30:39,679 --> 01:30:41,040
with this challenge

1977
01:30:41,040 --> 01:30:42,880
and we wrap it up

1978
01:30:42,880 --> 01:30:45,600
but uh we'll be back tomorrow a long day

1979
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:46,960
tomorrow so the stream is going to run

1980
01:30:46,960 --> 01:30:48,800
for eight hours straight uh actually i

1981
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:51,120
guess nine at least because we've got

1982
01:30:51,120 --> 01:30:52,880
eight challenge no no that's right eight

1983
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:55,679
total hours this one's a one-hour thing

1984
01:30:55,679 --> 01:30:57,520
we'll see we may end up needing a break

1985
01:30:57,520 --> 01:30:58,960
we're gonna try to get breaks by taking

1986
01:30:58,960 --> 01:31:00,800
trading off you're gonna see some guest

1987
01:31:00,800 --> 01:31:01,920
commentators we're gonna have some other

1988
01:31:01,920 --> 01:31:03,440
people come in and fill out different

1989
01:31:03,440 --> 01:31:05,280
roles should we uh i think it was

1990
01:31:05,280 --> 01:31:07,199
already written on twitter but uh the

1991
01:31:07,199 --> 01:31:10,159
idea is to have uh we have a a live

1992
01:31:10,159 --> 01:31:14,159
overflow uh hopefully joining in and uh

1993
01:31:14,159 --> 01:31:17,120
kim also yeah brandon falck

1994
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:18,719
so two uh

1995
01:31:18,719 --> 01:31:21,760
popular uh people in like the uh

1996
01:31:21,760 --> 01:31:24,800
security uh like content creation the

1997
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:28,159
space yeah yeah i'm i'm i'm excited uh

1998
01:31:28,159 --> 01:31:30,000
looking forward to chatting with both of

1999
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:30,880
them

2000
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:32,159
uh and i'm also looking forward to have

2001
01:31:32,159 --> 01:31:34,639
a break and as we each get to

2002
01:31:34,639 --> 01:31:36,560
maybe maybe alternate uh every other

2003
01:31:36,560 --> 01:31:38,480
round so one of us will we'll get to the

2004
01:31:38,480 --> 01:31:39,679
rest and also

2005
01:31:39,679 --> 01:31:42,000
make sure we give our producer glenn a

2006
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,239
break as well so yeah we'll be cycling

2007
01:31:44,239 --> 01:31:45,280
through that

2008
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:46,560
um

2009
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:48,320
we've got a variety of different

2010
01:31:48,320 --> 01:31:50,800
challenges um maybe for any of the teams

2011
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:52,800
that happen to be listening we want to

2012
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:54,880
talk about like the overall types of

2013
01:31:54,880 --> 01:31:56,960
challenges that we have no no super

2014
01:31:56,960 --> 01:31:58,880
spoilers but like i will say i think

2015
01:31:58,880 --> 01:32:00,719
we're pretty representative right right

2016
01:32:00,719 --> 01:32:03,760
there's a uh heavy focus a little bit of

2017
01:32:03,760 --> 01:32:07,199
re yes there's um

2018
01:32:07,199 --> 01:32:08,719
certainly a little bit like shell coding

2019
01:32:08,719 --> 01:32:10,880
or constrained exploitation

2020
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:13,520
um

2021
01:32:13,520 --> 01:32:15,120
solution

2022
01:32:15,120 --> 01:32:16,800
quick look here again yeah trying to get

2023
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:19,199
caught back up

2024
01:32:19,199 --> 01:32:20,880
oh man so they have a solution there

2025
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:22,400
right so they're soul screaming this is

2026
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:24,840
i mean it's they haven't solved solution

2027
01:32:24,840 --> 01:32:26,639
but yeah

2028
01:32:26,639 --> 01:32:29,040
there is a hashtag free jordan glenn and

2029
01:32:29,040 --> 01:32:30,800

2034
01:32:42,480 --> 01:32:44,320
random person who showed up in our chat

2035
01:32:44,320 --> 01:32:45,679
certainly not the author of this

2036
01:32:45,679 --> 01:32:48,159
particular challenge that has uh

2037
01:32:48,159 --> 01:32:50,800
stymied our opponents for so long so

2038
01:32:50,800 --> 01:32:53,280
right yeah he but but you're not wrong

2039
01:32:53,280 --> 01:32:55,199
it's if they just would hack harder we

2040
01:32:55,199 --> 01:32:57,440
could we could take a break and we could

2041
01:32:57,440 --> 01:32:59,600
yeah we could get some dinner so

2042
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:01,920
let's let us consider it is i would say

2043
01:33:01,920 --> 01:33:03,199
we are going to have to hit sudden death

2044
01:33:03,199 --> 01:33:04,239
pretty soon because we're looking

2045
01:33:04,239 --> 01:33:06,000
another several minutes of sudden death

2046
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:06,840
as well

2047
01:33:06,840 --> 01:33:09,920
so um

2048
01:33:09,920 --> 01:33:11,600
we'll uh we'll we'll take a look maybe

2049
01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:12,800
i'll take one more pass at new

2050
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:16,560
organizers we'll talk about having a uh

2051
01:33:16,560 --> 01:33:18,000
you know queueing up a sudden death

2052
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:19,120
we'll kind of consider what we want to

2053
01:33:19,120 --> 01:33:20,239
go

2054
01:33:20,239 --> 01:33:23,360
um yeah i'll uh i'll go ahead and give a

2055
01:33:23,360 --> 01:33:25,760
bit of a oh just use a data glove that's

2056
01:33:25,760 --> 01:33:27,360
a what is the data glove that's in

2057
01:33:27,360 --> 01:33:29,120
reference i don't get uh isn't that the

2058
01:33:29,120 --> 01:33:30,159
uh

2059
01:33:30,159 --> 01:33:31,120
the

2060
01:33:31,120 --> 01:33:32,800
the game controller thing the no that's

2061
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:34,320
the power that's the power paragraph

2062
01:33:34,320 --> 01:33:36,639
yeah the 80s of course like yeah yeah

2063
01:33:36,639 --> 01:33:38,400
yeah no no i mean yes that's the thing

2064
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:40,320
from before i was born sam no trolling

2065
01:33:40,320 --> 01:33:43,440

01:33:45,520 --> 01:33:47,440
remember this no we don't we don't talk

2068
01:33:47,440 --> 01:33:49,360
like that that's uh yeah don't use it

2069
01:33:49,360 --> 01:33:51,040
yeah next you're gonna be asking for for

2070
01:33:51,040 --> 01:33:52,639
network forensics or something something

2071
01:33:52,639 --> 01:33:55,120
crazy yeah we might call the goons yeah

2072
01:33:55,120 --> 01:33:56,320
have them take you out of the room yeah

2073
01:33:56,320 --> 01:33:57,120
all right i'll go check out new

2074
01:33:57,120 --> 01:33:58,800
organizers and we'll be back i'll give

2075
01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:00,560
an update on the uh

2076
01:34:00,560 --> 01:34:03,440
defcon ctf scoreboard uh in the meantime

2077
01:34:03,440 --> 01:34:05,600
um so

2078
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:08,239
we have like a slightly larger spread

2079
01:34:08,239 --> 01:34:09,280
now

2080
01:34:09,280 --> 01:34:12,400
uh with uh like spanning from just a

2081
01:34:12,400 --> 01:34:15,120
below 14 000 up to

2082
01:34:15,120 --> 01:34:17,679
just above 18 000 points

2083
01:34:17,679 --> 01:34:19,760
between the 16th and the first place

2084
01:34:19,760 --> 01:34:23,280
with uh katsubin in first place mmm in

2085
01:34:23,280 --> 01:34:24,960
second place and perfect root in third

2086
01:34:24,960 --> 01:34:25,760
place

2087
01:34:25,760 --> 01:34:29,520
and if i'm not misremembering i think uh

2088
01:34:29,520 --> 01:34:31,440
last year we did have like a top fight

2089
01:34:31,440 --> 01:34:34,880
between katsubin and uh ppp

2090
01:34:34,880 --> 01:34:37,040
as well they have kind of

2091
01:34:37,040 --> 01:34:38,880
pulled ahead those two teams and created

2092
01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:41,760
like a slight gap down to third place so

2093
01:34:41,760 --> 01:34:45,679
uh i do think this uh like mirrors uh

2094
01:34:45,679 --> 01:34:48,320
some of what we saw last year uh with uh

2095
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:50,960
regards to like the standings but

2096
01:34:50,960 --> 01:34:52,639
this is only the first day of the defcon

2097
01:34:52,639 --> 01:34:55,280
ctf a lot of stuff can happen

2098
01:34:55,280 --> 01:34:58,000
uh this is like far from over uh so

2099
01:34:58,000 --> 01:34:59,520
we're gonna be

2100
01:34:59,520 --> 01:35:01,600
keeping uh

2101
01:35:01,600 --> 01:35:03,840
an eye on that um

2102
01:35:03,840 --> 01:35:05,199
throughout the weekend and give you

2103
01:35:05,199 --> 01:35:07,280
updates

2104
01:35:07,280 --> 01:35:09,440
it's uh yeah i mean if you're here in

2105
01:35:09,440 --> 01:35:12,320
the the ctf room you can see this really

2106
01:35:12,320 --> 01:35:15,119
funny uh visualization that the nautilus

2107
01:35:15,119 --> 01:35:17,679
institute have put up it's like some 3d

2108
01:35:17,679 --> 01:35:20,880
uh animation of like a bunch of weird uh

2109
01:35:20,880 --> 01:35:23,440
uh machines uh one for each team like

2110
01:35:23,440 --> 01:35:25,520
spitting random objects at the other

2111
01:35:25,520 --> 01:35:27,600
teams like showing i guess it's showing

2112
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:30,560
like who is attacking whom uh possibly

2113
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:32,159
there's like seashells and stuff uh

2114
01:35:32,159 --> 01:35:33,360
flying around

2115
01:35:33,360 --> 01:35:35,199
uh you know i guess there's some joke

2116
01:35:35,199 --> 01:35:36,880
about there about like shells and c

2117
01:35:36,880 --> 01:35:38,320
shells and you know that

2118
01:35:38,320 --> 01:35:39,520
um

2119
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:43,440
but again taking a look at the

2120
01:35:43,440 --> 01:35:46,000
screen of balsam here

2121
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,159
i'm i'm still not entirely sure they

2122
01:35:48,159 --> 01:35:49,440
have this like

2123
01:35:49,440 --> 01:35:51,199
partial solution or like a solution they

2124
01:35:51,199 --> 01:35:52,880
have a split up the solution into two

2125
01:35:52,880 --> 01:35:54,840
parts and

2126
01:35:54,840 --> 01:35:58,320
then trying to send some like they're

2127
01:35:58,320 --> 01:36:00,400
sending some data and then they're

2128
01:36:00,400 --> 01:36:02,159
sending the other solution still not

2129
01:36:02,159 --> 01:36:04,639
exactly sure what's going on

2130
01:36:04,639 --> 01:36:06,639
uh

2131
01:36:06,639 --> 01:36:08,880
so we have explanation data handler

2132
01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:10,719
crazy keyboards yeah i will have to look

2133
01:36:10,719 --> 01:36:12,480
that up uh

2134
01:36:12,480 --> 01:36:15,600
afterwards uh but uh yeah i still think

2135
01:36:15,600 --> 01:36:17,760
uh i'm still thinking power gloves would

2136
01:36:17,760 --> 01:36:18,880
uh you know

2137
01:36:18,880 --> 01:36:20,960
really help out in this situation

2138
01:36:20,960 --> 01:36:22,480
uh maybe you could have them like you

2139
01:36:22,480 --> 01:36:24,000
know different like rob gadgets and

2140
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:25,520
stuff mapped to the

2141
01:36:25,520 --> 01:36:27,280
different buttons and stuff that's uh

2142
01:36:27,280 --> 01:36:29,600
you know the way to go

2143
01:36:29,600 --> 01:36:31,679
anyway you can see uh i'm like in the

2144
01:36:31,679 --> 01:36:33,600
debugger here inspecting the memory

2145
01:36:33,600 --> 01:36:35,679
there a little bit uh so i'm looking at

2146
01:36:35,679 --> 01:36:37,119
the global variables you can see you

2147
01:36:37,119 --> 01:36:38,639
have the standard in the standard out

2148
01:36:38,639 --> 01:36:40,800
object and then further down

2149
01:36:40,800 --> 01:36:42,159
they have these objects and you can see

2150
01:36:42,159 --> 01:36:43,520
you can the

2151
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:45,840
byte values there in the like the middle

2152
01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:48,560
of the of the printed out block with the

2153
01:36:48,560 --> 01:36:52,159
different digits of the sudoku solution

2154
01:36:52,159 --> 01:36:54,480
um

2155
01:36:54,639 --> 01:36:58,880
yeah it like it feels like they are

2156
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:01,760
very close to getting it but still like

2157
01:37:01,760 --> 01:37:04,880
a bit unsure exactly what's going on

2158
01:37:04,880 --> 01:37:07,040
um

2159
01:37:07,040 --> 01:37:08,880
so um

2160
01:37:08,880 --> 01:37:10,480
yeah we have uh jordan coming back here

2161
01:37:10,480 --> 01:37:12,480
now so uh we'll get an update on on

2162
01:37:12,480 --> 01:37:14,400
where we are we are gonna give them a

2163
01:37:14,400 --> 01:37:16,239
sudden death hint we're gonna give them

2164
01:37:16,239 --> 01:37:17,760
a hint that is just because here's

2165
01:37:17,760 --> 01:37:20,080
here's the the thing that we have missed

2166
01:37:20,080 --> 01:37:21,360
talking about it so far i was looking

2167
01:37:21,360 --> 01:37:24,639
back over with the the example solution

2168
01:37:24,639 --> 01:37:27,920
and the the the nuance here

2169
01:37:27,920 --> 01:37:29,520
is that there's a length check that that

2170
01:37:29,520 --> 01:37:30,880
we've been that has been kind of showing

2171
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:32,960
up a little bit now length basically

2172
01:37:32,960 --> 01:37:34,960
um prevents you from even if you

2173
01:37:34,960 --> 01:37:37,199
overwrite it with a fully solved board

2174
01:37:37,199 --> 01:37:38,639
from actually

2175
01:37:38,639 --> 01:37:40,639
solving it on that throw okay so you

2176
01:37:40,639 --> 01:37:42,560
overwrite the state of the board all but

2177
01:37:42,560 --> 01:37:44,239
the last one

2178
01:37:44,239 --> 01:37:45,920
right and the last one you leave empty

2179
01:37:45,920 --> 01:37:47,360
and then you can just solve it by

2180
01:37:47,360 --> 01:37:48,880
overwriting the correct

2181
01:37:48,880 --> 01:37:51,280
last answer i see so

2182
01:37:51,280 --> 01:37:52,719
it's a little bit along the lines what

2183
01:37:52,719 --> 01:37:54,480
we've been talking about but

2184
01:37:54,480 --> 01:37:56,400
it seems that they've done like a weaker

2185
01:37:56,400 --> 01:37:59,440
variant of that where

2186
01:37:59,520 --> 01:38:00,960
they didn't have like as good of a

2187
01:38:00,960 --> 01:38:03,199
solution there's a question shot here

2188
01:38:03,199 --> 01:38:05,199
about uh is there anywhere that explains

2189
01:38:05,199 --> 01:38:07,280
the ctf format there's an 80 going on as

2190
01:38:07,280 --> 01:38:09,600
well as these only ones yes so kind of

2191
01:38:09,600 --> 01:38:12,560
like the main uh the main ctf the defcon

2192
01:38:12,560 --> 01:38:14,560
cdf is the

2193
01:38:14,560 --> 01:38:17,600
traditional uh defcon attack defense uh

2194
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:20,239
that you know we all know and love uh

2195
01:38:20,239 --> 01:38:21,360
although you know there's been like

2196
01:38:21,360 --> 01:38:23,600
variants and twists to it uh over the

2197
01:38:23,600 --> 01:38:24,480
years

2198
01:38:24,480 --> 01:38:25,679
um

2199
01:38:25,679 --> 01:38:26,560
then

2200
01:38:26,560 --> 01:38:29,040
within this competition this live ctf is

2201
01:38:29,040 --> 01:38:31,679
like a sub event where

2202
01:38:31,679 --> 01:38:33,520
it's running parallel to the attack

2203
01:38:33,520 --> 01:38:36,400
defense aspect of this so each team

2204
01:38:36,400 --> 01:38:39,119
sends uh one player for each match and

2205
01:38:39,119 --> 01:38:41,119
then we play this knockout tournament

2206
01:38:41,119 --> 01:38:42,840
and at the end this will generate the

2207
01:38:42,840 --> 01:38:45,840
ranking from the nokia tournament which

2208
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:47,199
is then

2209
01:38:47,199 --> 01:38:48,610
fed back in and will

2210
01:38:48,610 --> 01:38:50,080
[Music]

2211
01:38:50,080 --> 01:38:52,800
affect the scores of the main ctf

2212
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:54,960
event so

2213
01:38:54,960 --> 01:38:55,840
this

2214
01:38:55,840 --> 01:38:58,800
will be valuable and might definitely

2215
01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:01,199
affect the final standings of the defcon

2216
01:39:01,199 --> 01:39:04,960
ctf i'm not completely aware of like

2217
01:39:04,960 --> 01:39:07,119
what like the weighting factor is like

2218
01:39:07,119 --> 01:39:11,199
how the scoring model works for for the

2219
01:39:11,199 --> 01:39:13,280
ctf um

2220
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:16,159
and uh so so i i couldn't tell you like

2221
01:39:16,159 --> 01:39:19,199
exactly how valuable it is to win the

2222
01:39:19,199 --> 01:39:21,040
tournament versus getting second place

2223
01:39:21,040 --> 01:39:23,360
but we've been trying to find a balance

2224
01:39:23,360 --> 01:39:24,400
where

2225
01:39:24,400 --> 01:39:26,480
uh the teams can definitely i'll tell

2226
01:39:26,480 --> 01:39:29,040
you in a second but yes uh

2227
01:39:29,040 --> 01:39:30,719
first i'm gonna deliver the hint

2228
01:39:30,719 --> 01:39:32,800
and i'll be right back and we'll see if

2229
01:39:32,800 --> 01:39:35,280
we can we can bring this one home right

2230
01:39:35,280 --> 01:39:36,880
can you just read me the hints here

2231
01:39:36,880 --> 01:39:38,480
first here we go

2232
01:39:38,480 --> 01:39:40,880
first attempt overwrite almost all

2233
01:39:40,880 --> 01:39:42,719
second attempt solves due to length

2234
01:39:42,719 --> 01:39:45,040
check yes

2235
01:39:45,040 --> 01:39:46,800
and we will see if this does it yeah

2236
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:47,840
this is

2237
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:50,400
almost like a straight up solution like

2238
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:52,400
this could always be like a write-up for

2239
01:39:52,400 --> 01:39:53,360
the uh

2240
01:39:53,360 --> 01:39:54,480
you have to understand what the program

2241
01:39:54,480 --> 01:39:55,679
does and that that's the state that

2242
01:39:55,679 --> 01:39:56,960
they've they've got yeah but they have

2243
01:39:56,960 --> 01:39:59,119
that

2244
01:39:59,440 --> 01:40:01,679
so now we're going to give them like the

2245
01:40:01,679 --> 01:40:04,000
the final hopefully final hint here that

2246
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:05,360
we'll just like

2247
01:40:05,360 --> 01:40:07,520
hopefully blow this case wide open and

2248
01:40:07,520 --> 01:40:09,119
uh you know may have them solve it from

2249
01:40:09,119 --> 01:40:12,639
there uh did we get any uh

2250
01:40:12,639 --> 01:40:14,639
reaction from the players on that i was

2251
01:40:14,639 --> 01:40:16,080
too busy coming back i should have i

2252
01:40:16,080 --> 01:40:18,239
should have watched okay okay i see yeah

2253
01:40:18,239 --> 01:40:20,320
we got we got some forehead touching

2254
01:40:20,320 --> 01:40:23,600
okay uh says our producer yes

2255
01:40:23,600 --> 01:40:24,560
um

2256
01:40:24,560 --> 01:40:27,280
so we'll see will it i i think this was

2257
01:40:27,280 --> 01:40:29,199
this one i think is on us yeah i think

2258
01:40:29,199 --> 01:40:31,119
this was a little too subtle for what

2259
01:40:31,119 --> 01:40:32,880
we're kind of aiming for and again being

2260
01:40:32,880 --> 01:40:34,880
in a high pressure thing

2261
01:40:34,880 --> 01:40:36,560
it's is not to say that these are not

2262
01:40:36,560 --> 01:40:38,080
excellent exploiters it is just very

2263
01:40:38,080 --> 01:40:39,920
hard and there's this was a little bit

2264
01:40:39,920 --> 01:40:41,440
of a little bit nuanced a little subtle

2265
01:40:41,440 --> 01:40:43,679
nuance oh yeah because of the the way

2266
01:40:43,679 --> 01:40:45,280
that the length check happens in the

2267
01:40:45,280 --> 01:40:47,840
binary you can't actually

2268
01:40:47,840 --> 01:40:49,280
fully overwrite and expect to do it it

2269
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:50,880
will already know that it's an invalid

2270
01:40:50,880 --> 01:40:52,960
attempt and so it's not solvable but

2271
01:40:52,960 --> 01:40:54,400
then you have overwritten the the

2272
01:40:54,400 --> 01:40:56,800
correct state such that you can then

2273
01:40:56,800 --> 01:40:58,239
solve it because you moved it from an

2274
01:40:58,239 --> 01:41:00,560
insolvable state to a solvable state

2275
01:41:00,560 --> 01:41:02,320
right and somebody else might have got

2276
01:41:02,320 --> 01:41:04,400
it you don't know but it's definitely

2277
01:41:04,400 --> 01:41:05,520
this is definitely a little harder

2278
01:41:05,520 --> 01:41:06,960
certainly it's it's more subtle than

2279
01:41:06,960 --> 01:41:08,960
some of our previous challenges

2280
01:41:08,960 --> 01:41:11,360
um but but we'll see we'll do our best

2281
01:41:11,360 --> 01:41:13,440
to keep keep dialing in the difficulty

2282
01:41:13,440 --> 01:41:14,480
and

2283
01:41:14,480 --> 01:41:16,719
see how it goes so let's keep an eye out

2284
01:41:16,719 --> 01:41:18,560
for the the winner we may see because

2285
01:41:18,560 --> 01:41:20,400
we're not looking at the new organizers

2286
01:41:20,400 --> 01:41:23,520
uh we might get that uh off screen

2287
01:41:23,520 --> 01:41:25,520
uh or we might see team taiwan pull it

2288
01:41:25,520 --> 01:41:26,560
off here

2289
01:41:26,560 --> 01:41:29,280
uh in the main window so i'm i keep

2290
01:41:29,280 --> 01:41:30,560
rooting for for whoever we have the

2291
01:41:30,560 --> 01:41:31,760
capture card working on just by very

2292
01:41:31,760 --> 01:41:33,360
nature of being on my side of the table

2293
01:41:33,360 --> 01:41:36,239
yeah yeah yeah um but

2294
01:41:36,239 --> 01:41:38,159
but you know like uh

2295
01:41:38,159 --> 01:41:39,600
being a uh

2296
01:41:39,600 --> 01:41:41,760
swiss not citizen but swiss resident i'm

2297
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:43,679
you know kind of like maybe rooting for

2298
01:41:43,679 --> 01:41:45,679
organizers a little bit uh

2299
01:41:45,679 --> 01:41:48,400
so are they uh are they a swiss team so

2300
01:41:48,400 --> 01:41:51,600
they are a swiss british american team i

2301
01:41:51,600 --> 01:41:53,600
think uh oh

2302
01:41:53,600 --> 01:41:57,040
there we go all right so there you have

2303
01:41:57,040 --> 01:41:58,560
the winner

2304
01:41:58,560 --> 01:42:02,719
congratulations awesome awesome

2305
01:42:02,719 --> 01:42:04,800
oh my god down to there down to the end

2306
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:06,320
it happened again it happened again so

2307
01:42:06,320 --> 01:42:08,239
i'm gonna go you can go congratulations

2308
01:42:08,239 --> 01:42:09,840
go talk to the team i'm gonna go ahead

2309
01:42:09,840 --> 01:42:12,000
and see you all out uh just a quick

2310
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:13,119
summary i think we've already kind of

2311
01:42:13,119 --> 01:42:14,719
