31
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,440
we're starting i think everything's

32
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,280

33
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,000
uh to seeing the teams compete so before

34
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,520
we kind of get into the meat of it let's

35
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,360
talk a little bit about like the history

36
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,680
what this event is what we're doing uh

37
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,280
what we're hoping to see from the teams

38
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,080
so you know live ctf as a concept has

39
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,080
existed for quite some time hey triple

40
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,440
six we see you in there in the chat yeah

41
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,639
definitely let us know if you're doing

42
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,319
this uh we have to bring the camera in

43
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:05,199
if we get too many jokesters behind us

44
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,120
it is defcon so we're gonna yeah we're

45
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,160
gonna get that

46
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,199
um

47
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,600
live ctf uh has been around as kind of

48
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,919
as a name uh geohot started several

49
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:14,960
years ago

50
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,039
uh it was streaming on twitch and did a

51
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:18,560
couple he's kind of like live he was

52
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,240
playing capture flight challenges and

53
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,840
wanted other people to see him doing it

54
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,080
and kind of interact uh sort of early

55
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,520
live streaming stuff there was a couple

56
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,120
of different i guess experiments or

57
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,160
attempts

58
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,680
i did one couple years ago at defcon

59
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,199
finals where i messed up the audio and

60
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,720
it wasn't live and recorded it and it

61
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,479
was it was a bit of a bummer so like

62
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:35,600
we've had

63
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,840
uh a couple examples of that and then

64
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,199
you also were running pony racing right

65
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,160
yeah exactly so uh a couple years ago uh

66
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,880
we did for a year we run a monthly

67
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,479
uh like live ctf show on youtube

68
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:49,840
where we had four

69
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,160
contestants uh trying to solve the same

70
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,919
challenge head-to-head and like doing

71
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:56,720
commentary on top of that uh was uh

72
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,880
pretty popular actually uh a lot of

73
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,319
people like it's a lot of work though i

74
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,120
think people don't uh they underestimate

75
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,560
how hard it is to kind of get it so

76
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,680
let's talk a little bit about like the

77
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,440
kind of what we it is when we talk about

78
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,280
live ctf right obviously capture the

79
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,919
flag we're talking about a hacking

80
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:13,280
challenges

81
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,720
there's a variety of different you know

82
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,319
ctf out there with different uh

83
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:17,919
scoreboard and structure

84
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:19,440
and so when we say live ctf we're

85
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,720
specifically saying

86
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,160
a small group of people going head to

87
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,400
head on the exact same challenge and in

88
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,680
particular we're watching them we want

89
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,720
to see what they're doing that's what

90
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,880
makes live ctf really interesting

91
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,560
and this is exciting because we're

92
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,520
bringing live ctf to defcon ctf finals

93
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,520
so certainly one of the

94
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,599
premier capture the flag contests is

95
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:39,599
defcon ctf it's one of the i think it is

96
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,919
the oldest uh certainly continually

97
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:42,960
running

98
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,960
capture the flag event this is defcon

99
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,800
30. i think i mean they've had defcon

100
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,160
ctf

101
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,800
i came in defcon 9 21 years ago and

102
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,319
there was the ctf was already an

103
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,680
established thing like it's been around

104
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,120
for many years

105
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,520
and the idea is that we are going to

106
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,759
have all the the teams that are here

107
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,199
they're playing defense uts so to be

108
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,199
clear the ctf as a whole is going on

109
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,919
around us nautilus institute is running

110
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,479
the defcon ctf we are like a little

111
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,080
sidepiece and kind of inside of that

112
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,639
right and so this is a part of the whole

113
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,479
event if the teams do well here it will

114
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:16,800
add to their score for the final event

115
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,120
um so we're trying to add some uh like a

116
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,560
little bit of twist a little bit spice

117
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,960
to the competition like uh

118
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,360
bring that excitement and also to

119
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,440
make this accessible to uh the viewers

120
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,680
and see a little bit of what's going on

121
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,840
like the minds and computers of these uh

122
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,279
participants usually if you've ever been

123
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,320
to def con before and you've walked

124
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,240
through the ctf room nobody wants you to

125
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,039
look what they're doing because

126
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,640
competitors will cheat and finally one

127
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,399
another and it's it's you know so

128
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:41,760
they're all kind of like closed in and

129
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,000
it's not really spectator friendly last

130
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,200
several years teams have worked on cool

131
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,800
visualizations and so we've got one kind

132
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,000
of going on over here there's a 3d

133
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,920
visualization from nautilus that's

134
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,000
tracking their scoreboard uh ar if

135
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,680
you're talking about the defcon cts

136
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,920
scoreboard unfortunately no i don't

137
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,440
actually think we've asked nautilus

138
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,360
there is no public scoreboard right now

139
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,440
for the main event we can give you

140
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,000
updates uh throughout the event uh right

141
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,959
now so actually at the end of this

142
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:06,720
broadcast before we we turn over to our

143
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,080
next one if we had a little bit of time

144
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,120
we'll actually let you know what the

145
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,720
latest scores are

146
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,800
um otherwise find a friend who's at def

147
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,760
con and have them come in here and take

148
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,920
a picture uh i don't know if yeah what

149
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,920
the plan is on their scoreboard the live

150
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,320
ctf portion you'll see when we go back

151
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,080
to like our kind of intermission screens

152
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,320
you'll see the brackets so what live ctf

153
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,200
is going to be yeah actually carl what

154
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,399
do you tell them about like the

155
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,920
structure of like what that bracket is

156
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:28,800
and how that's going to work yeah

157
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,880
exactly so we're playing this as a

158
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,480
traditional

159
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,480
single elimination knockout tournament

160
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,959
so there will be so we have 16 teams uh

161
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,440
in the in the defcon ctf so uh we're

162
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,920
starting with the uh round of 16 uh

163
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,080
today we will have uh four matches and

164
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,959
then we'll continue uh tomorrow uh so

165
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:48,800
yeah that seems there will be one player

166
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,399
from each team

167
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,839
sitting at these tables behind us

168
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,480
with one computer they are not allowed

169
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,080
to communicate with their teammates they

170
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,519
will be uh wearing earmuffs to block out

171
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:02,240
our

172
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,519
commentary

173
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,920
and uh they both get the same ctf

174
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,160
challenge at the same time and the first

175
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,079
one to solve it uh wins the other team

176
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:11,920
is eliminated the winners advance to the

177
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,920
next round and uh in the end we will

178
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,000
have uh a winner of this tournament and

179
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,920
then and each round like what like gets

180
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,079
them points right yeah exactly so

181
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:22,000
the depending on how far they make it in

182
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,240
this tournament this will then add to

183
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,560
their scores of the the whole like def

184
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,800
con uh ctf uh

185
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,360
i mean the devcon cdf is a tech defense

186
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,519
ctf so you have like different uh

187
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:35,279
aspects of the scoring you typically

188
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:36,480
have like for attacking and for

189
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,560
defending and stuff so this will be like

190
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,279
another dimension to the scoring uh of

191
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,560
this event yeah in fact that actually

192
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,399
informed kind of how the points were

193
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,959
worked as nautilus and and we were

194
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:48,320
talking about kind of the design of the

195
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,279
game the goal is we want this to be

196
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:52,720
something teams take seriously we want

197
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,000
them to send their best person we want

198
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,360
them to really want to win and do well

199
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,560
because it will benefit them in the game

200
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,600
but also

201
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,519
not disrupt the whole game if one team

202
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:00,800
does well here

203
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,800
and um another team does well and you

204
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,320
know like we don't like to throw it off

205
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,600
too much right so kind of finding that

206
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,440
balance is is tricky i like what

207
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,800
nautilus has done i think it's going to

208
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,560
going to get us that uh and the other

209
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,560
thing to point out is the teams we're

210
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,000
going to have a lot of work we have a

211
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,200
lot of work cut out for us we're gonna

212
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,920
have 15 total matches throughout the

213
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,079
next uh three days today tomorrow and

214
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:21,200
sunday

215
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,519
but the teams have a maximum of four

216
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,800
events that they're in right because

217
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,640
there's only four rounds to go from 16

218
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,640
to eight to four to two to one

219
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,760
and so

220
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,240
the teams are out at most four hours for

221
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,399
if they get first or second place yeah

222
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:35,760
and in fact the teams that like don't

223
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,959
get any points

224
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:38,000
they're done and gone and they can go

225
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,079
back to the focusing the other events so

226
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:41,760
we hope to not like disrupt too much of

227
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,680
the normal flow of what of what teams

228
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,600
are doing yeah and we hope with the the

229
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,279
teams like we have we've talked a little

230
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,600
bit to the teams and we've heard uh like

231
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,079
some people they find this uh you know a

232
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:53,839
little bit nervous like being live on

233
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,720
camera it's stressful is so so but we

234
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,480
still like hope to make this like an

235
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,079
enjoyable experience for both the

236
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:02,079
participants and for all all of you

237
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:04,240
viewers as well yeah one of the game we

238
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,639
said earlier you know defcon is is not

239
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:08,480
accessible to a large extent you have to

240
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,399
already be in the ctf community

241
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,639
you have to already be very active to

242
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:14,800
even compete at the qualification route

243
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,120
to make it here and so we're hoping by

244
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,279
having challenges here that a little bit

245
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:20,880
more accessible

246
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,160
you'll be able to follow along you'll be

247
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,200
able to see kind of what they're doing

248
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,200
on a smaller scale and so speaking of

249
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,160
that

250
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,440
let's talk a little about the challenges

251
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,880
themselves and how they differ maybe

252
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,920
from the challenges that are going to be

253
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,839
happening for the rest of the ctf right

254
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:35,040
so i mean normally in a ctl a challenge

255
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,120
can i mean the you can have varying

256
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,519
difficulty of your challenges right but

257
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:41,600
especially in a top-tier competition

258
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,360
such as defcon you typically have pretty

259
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,079
difficult uh challenges it can take

260
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,160
many hours to

261
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,519
exploit these systems but we are aiming

262
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,519
to have matches here

263
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,920
of about like 30 to 45

264
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,760
minutes which means that that also kind

265
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,519
of put some constraints on the

266
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,959
difficulty of our challenges they cannot

267
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,200
be too difficult uh so we have had to

268
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,760
like try to find that balance between uh

269
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,200
you know

270
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,720
not so trivial it's like five minutes

271
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,399
you run one thing and you're done yeah

272
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:12,720
but also it can't take too long so

273
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,160
hopefully we got it right we'll find out

274
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,240
as the weekend progresses yeah and if we

275
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,959
don't like if the matches uh are like if

276
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:22,560
they go too long we have a sudden death

277
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,360
uh

278
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,959
round thing where

279
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:28,800
we have prepared some uh very um

280
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,399
simple challenges that we will then

281
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,480
switch out so we will stop the normal

282
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,680
challenge they will get this sudden

283
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,240
death challenge instead and then it's

284
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,920
really about being those are five-minute

285
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,360
challenges yeah they're meant to be like

286
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,279
very very straightforward and easy yeah

287
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:42,560
hopefully we don't have to use them but

288
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,480
if we do they're there and they're ready

289
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,480
uh with the idea that whether it's those

290
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,399
or the normal ones the fastest team wins

291
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,480
first person to solve it ends that ends

292
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,240
that particular round and we set up for

293
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,560
the next round and and start all over so

294
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,079
in terms of the type of challenges now

295
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:58,480
like the defcon qualification rounds you

296
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,399
often have a mixture of web and

297
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:01,600
forensics and now all these different

298
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,399
other things

299
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:03,680
finals though tends to be focused more

300
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,360
on pony right yeah so is that phoning

301
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,480
reversing like that low level uh

302
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,720
stuff yeah and so we've mirrored that as

303
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,240
well so if the teams were a little

304
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,519
nervous about like well wait a minute i

305
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,040
don't do a lot of web apps tech don't

306
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,760
worry uh we are keeping things in line

307
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,519
in part because we want

308
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:20,880
this to be representative of what the

309
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,399
teams are doing now like a little baby

310
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,240
challenges very similar to the style of

311
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,480
challenge if not the same difficulty

312
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,760
that they're doing in the final event so

313
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,120
you can get a sense of kind of what's

314
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,440
going on at home as we follow along and

315
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,120
speaking of following along if you are

316
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,720
in chat we are we are watching it we're

317
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,839
keeping an eye on it we're happy to

318
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:37,360
answer questions as we progress

319
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,959
throughout the day uh thanks earlier for

320
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:42,160
uh the

321
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,839
the question about the scoreboard so

322
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:45,440
just a quick update i'm looking at the

323
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,600
scoreboard right now uh currently

324
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,839
there's only uh a couple hundred points

325
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:51,440
separating first from last so they're

326
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,560
all started around 1600 points uh it

327
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,600
looks like this is going to be a

328
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,519
zero-sum game and so actually one of the

329
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,199
later streams we might bring on one of

330
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,279
the the nautilus folks and talk more

331
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,279
about it if we have if we have time yeah

332
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:05,120
um and so we'll learn more about how

333
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,720
they're doing it but uh zero is some

334
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,240
game where teams lose points and then

335
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,440
they go to other teams that gain it so

336
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,040
in other words if i get exploited by

337
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,199
another team i lose some points on my in

338
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:14,720
the form of my sla because i didn't have

339
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,880
a secure service and they gained some

340
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,480
points uh that they've sort of taken

341
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,880
from me yeah and also yeah on the topic

342
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,320
of uh like bringing in other people as

343
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,800
well so we will be on commentary uh

344
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,800
throughout the weekend uh but we're also

345
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,279
hoping to uh bring in some uh other

346
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,759
commentators some remote commentators as

347
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:33,040
well um

348
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,959
so yeah hopefully there will be a little

349
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:36,399
bit of a mix here as well on the

350
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:37,680
commentary assuming we can figure out

351
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,120
the logistics and the streaming and

352
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,120
everything is uh the connectivity guys

353
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,720
are working for us we are going to yeah

354
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,920
we will bring in a couple of folks that

355
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,519
you will probably recognize if you do

356
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:47,519
any online we don't want to like

357
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,519
promise yet until it works out but we

358
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:50,880
have some folks that i think you'll be

359
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,160
excited to hear from and we're looking

360
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,639
forward to having uh join the commentary

361
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,480
um and so keep an eye on that for that

362
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,600
that'll probably be

363
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,279
in tomorrow yeah we have a question in

364
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,279
chat here about uh whether each round

365
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,399
will have the same challenge or each

366
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:03,920
match will be unique so

367
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,920
uh each match will have a unique

368
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,600
challenge and this is because because of

369
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,600
course we are broadcasting this so all

370
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,720
the teams can watch uh the other matches

371
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,440
and uh in fact that might be like a good

372
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,440
idea to get like a feel for the type of

373
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,680
challenges we are going for uh so

374
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,360
definitely we couldn't have the same uh

375
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,120
challenges for each match because then

376
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,320
you could just copy the solution of the

377
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,600
previous yeah the only way to do that

378
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,040
would have been to sort of sequester and

379
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,800
take all the people in any given round

380
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,240
into a room not let them out and let

381
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,440
them one time and that just was we

382
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,639
weren't going to waste people's time

383
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,240
yeah so instead we wasted our time and

384
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,600
we made a lot more challenges it would

385
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,639
have been a lot easier if we only had to

386
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:38,079
make four challenges

387
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:40,480
but by making 15 challenges yes

388
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,600
different teams will get different

389
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,759
challenges we have actually told each

390
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,600
team though the name of the challenge

391
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,880
which is sometimes actually a pretty

392
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,320
good hint as to what kind of challenge

393
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,560
it is the category whether it's uh

394
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,720
reversing or opponentable today we have

395
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,199
all pwnables and we have a mix of x86

396
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:57,440
and x64 binaries i think there's one x86

397
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,440
32-bit the rest are all uh 34 or 64-bit

398
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,519
so that's the the challenges we've got i

399
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:05,119
love seeing the team hype keep up you

400
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,400
know cheering on your favorite teams

401
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,480
that's exactly what we want to see yeah

402
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,199
um and so speaking of uh favorite uh

403
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:12,640
teams so

404
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,480
maybe we should just mention like a

405
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,480
little bit about how they ended up here

406
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,480
uh as well because

407
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,000
i said we're here at the defcon finals

408
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,079
with the 16 teams they

409
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,880
had to qualify uh earlier this year i

410
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,039
think was back in may or april

411
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,480
uh in a

412
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,039
really tough uh qualifiers

413
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:34,160
absolutely so uh yeah the top 16 uh well

414
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,039
actually

415
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:38,160
you have uh the winner of last year uh

416
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,000
are pre-qualified for that definitely so

417
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,600
in in this case it really was just the

418
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,520
top 16 because it happened to be yes

419
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,960
because that team was also playing the

420
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,640
qualifier i think officially the

421
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,080
previous team didn't this year as it was

422
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,520
a clean break when i talked to nautilus

423
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,280
they said actually it turned normally

424
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,559
the team who won the previous hero

425
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,320
automatically gets a buy they weren't

426
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,440
sure about that in the end it didn't

427
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,679
matter because because the previous team

428
00:17:57,679 --> 00:17:59,679
qualified anyways but they were kind of

429
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,120
treating it as a sort of fresh break so

430
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,400
actually what you're going to see in our

431
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,600
bracket

432
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,960
which which actually we could pull up

433
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,320
the bracket now

434
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,520
when we can take a look at it you'll see

435
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,320
the way that the seating has worked is

436
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,000
the team who scored first place in the

437
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,520
qualification event

438
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,320
is

439
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,919
battling against the 16th place team

440
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:17,120
from the qualification event right and

441
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,320
so throughout

442
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,679
these events that's just kind of how we

443
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:21,919
split things up we chose a random order

444
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:24,720
for which match uh happens when

445
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,320
and uh we're going to be putting again

446
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,559
these kind of random challenges out so

447
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,240
you'll see where your favorite teams are

448
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,000
and kind of who they're battling um as

449
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,679
they make it through uh through the

450
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,600
rounds here uh the weekend again we're

451
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,520
gonna do four so round one will take us

452
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,679
down from the field of 16 to a field of

453
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:41,200
eight and we're gonna do half of that

454
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,720
round today so we've got four rounds

455
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,039
today tomorrow morning uh pacific time

456
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:46,880
at 10 a.m we're gonna do the second uh

457
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,360
start the next uh four rounds uh and at

458
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,039
that point we'll be into round two sorry

459
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:52,480
matches now we're gonna i gotta be

460
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,160
careful so just to be clear we have four

461
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,400
rounds and each round will have the

462
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,080
number of competitors

463
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,320
and then we're gonna have 15 matches yes

464
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,200
we have the language i'll probably get

465
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,320
it wrong and then we'll correct each

466
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,120
other if we do it um but that's the

467
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,200
that's the plan for uh for this whole

468
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,559
this whole event so

469
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:11,120
uh scoreboard update maybe or

470
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,120
we get everything else what do we need

471
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,679
um yeah i think um

472
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:18,000
we're uh that's uh

473
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,919
where we're at right now with the as i

474
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:21,360
said like uh

475
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,679
pretty tight i mean the the devcon ctf

476
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:26,480
just kicked off uh was like a few hours

477
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,280
ago

478
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,360
almost four hours ago yeah yeah so uh

479
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,600
it's still early uh early days three

480
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,320
years ago yeah the teams are within

481
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,559
percentages of each other

482
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:38,160
so but if you want to root on your

483
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,840
favorite team we'll do the top three so

484
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,160
we have water paddler in first with 16

485
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,000
282 points maple mallard magistrates or

486
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,760
as i plan to call them uh the mighty

487
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,640
ducks

488
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,160
because that name is really long we're

489
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,280
gonna have to come up with names for a

490
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,039
lot of these teams uh and in third place

491
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:55,360
is straw hat uh tied with actually yeah

492
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,440
they're tied for a second sorry um mmm

493
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,080
and straw hat uh and and and

494
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,440
there's a lot of history in all these

495
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,200
teams we're gonna talk more later we're

496
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,039
gonna talk about like the split of them

497
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:06,480
many of these teams are actually i think

498
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,679
almost all of them are actually

499
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:09,280
conglomerate teams or several teams have

500
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,559
come together again

501
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:12,159
speaks to the nature of this is like the

502
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,080
the hardest biggest competition that

503
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,679
several kind of elite teams come

504
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:17,440
together yeah to form a team to compete

505
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,039
here multiple different collaboration

506
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:21,039
teams here just to give an example you

507
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:22,400
have sauer cloud which is like a

508
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,080
collection of all the german

509
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,960
ctf teams uh which they already have

510
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,679
like really good uh ctf teams individual

511
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:31,600
teams yeah but then they they you know

512
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,280
bond together and this tells a little

513
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,200
bit about like just how fierce the

514
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,760
competition is at this event yeah so

515
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,120
we're gonna we're gonna look forward for

516
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,960
those we've got nine minutes until first

517
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,559
round let's go ahead and go back to our

518
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:43,919
intermission we're gonna bring up our

519
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:46,640
next uh two teams get em set cross your

520
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,000
fingers for the challenge i'm really

521
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,200
looking forward to seeing what the teams

522
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,880
do and we'll see you all in about nine

523
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,880
minutes

all right we are back i hope we'll find

562
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,399
out

563
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:34,559
uh we're we are going to count us in we

564
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:37,919
have our first two teams uh ptb wtl

565
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,760
and shellfish battling in our first

566
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,760
round of live ctf uh we've got the

567
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,200
screens up they're here behind us we're

568
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:47,760
gonna count them in in five four three

569
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,840
two

570
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,760
one it's live

571
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,279
they're refreshing the page random

572
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:56,480
applause for the last etf

573
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,880
okay so

574
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,799
now we'll watch and we'll see and make

575
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:01,919
sure this is working we're gonna go

576
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:04,000
ahead and bring up both their screens

577
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,360
and you can get a little sense of the

578
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,120
layout that we're going to be using

579
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,039
uh for for the event where you can

580
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:10,399
actually see see what they're what

581
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:11,679
they're doing

582
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:12,480
right

583
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,240
so uh

584
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,760
i see i love the full screen terminals

585
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,519
right right first thing we see yes uh

586
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:18,799
they've got a binary we've told them

587
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:20,399
it's a punable binary what was the name

588
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:22,480
of this particular challenge it's uh

589
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,559
just call me maybe right says call me

590
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:25,919
baby so we've got like a little meme

591
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:28,559
reference call me call me maybe

592
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:30,640
we've also got a competitor webcam which

593
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,000
has just got the laptop so you can't

594
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,039
really see a whole lot on that we'll

595
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:34,080
probably

596
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,760
not use that particular view

597
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,000
yeah um but we can see

598
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,240
we've got ida up and going we've got

599
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,399
terminals okay so let's take a deep

600
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:44,240
breath we can already see

601
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,679
pretty straightforward in fact we've

602
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:47,200
even got some symbols here right on this

603
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,440
particular binaries yes um and let's

604
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,480
let's uh we've got on the left we've got

605
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,720
um

606
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,279
we have uh pulmonary bytes uh the p2b

607
00:31:57,279 --> 00:31:58,720
vtl uh

608
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,720
here and we have shellfish uh on this

609
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,880
side on the right both using ida for

610
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:06,000
their uh disassembly uh i was hoping for

611
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,679
i did see binger running i noticed binjo

612
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:09,360
was actually running yep i think they're

613
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,799
prepared knowing you've been a developer

614
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:12,880
was one of the organizers like in case

615
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,399
there's something terrible that binge it

616
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:15,440
is better at we should we should leave

617
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,880
it up yes

618
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,320
it's a pretty small program here you can

619
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,840
see on the

620
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,360
shellfish uh

621
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,679
there you could get a glance of the the

622
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:25,039
code where

623
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:26,240
um

624
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,399
it's a program it's reading in some uh

625
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:30,960
commands uh sorry so arguments to uh

626
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,279
whatever syscall you want to make

627
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:34,720
and uh yeah then from then you can do

628
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,840
this how many times you want and then

629
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,799
you from there you want to get code

630
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:39,519
execution so so the vulnerability is is

631
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:40,960
there this is actually more of a shell

632
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,480
coding exercise

633
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,559
than uh a

634
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:45,840
um

635
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:46,960
like you don't have to find the

636
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,600
vulnerability it literally will just run

637
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,519
whatever syscall you want

638
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:53,200
and it's up to you to provide a series

639
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,519
of syscalls so like can't i just like

640
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:57,519
exec ve and run bash like immediately

641
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:58,799
like what you know is that not a valid

642
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:01,200
solution uh yeah i mean almost except

643
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,360
that you know to call it exact you need

644
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,519
a string of the of the program you're

645
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:06,960
executing so they first need to get that

646
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,919
string into memory somehow uh but then

647
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:11,519
it should be just smooth sailing from

648
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:13,039
there yeah and it's kind of ironic that

649
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:14,799
like we give them full sys calls but

650
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:16,480
they don't have the ability to just run

651
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,000
shell code right so because they don't

652
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,760
have actual shell code little things

653
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,039
like just

654
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:22,399
put some bytes directly into a piece of

655
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:25,039
memory is maybe a little bit trickier

656
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:25,919
and so they're not going to be able to

657
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:26,880
do that

658
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,480
um let's talk about what they're what

659
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,240
what's their goal what are they trying

660
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,679
to do here to show that they've won

661
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:34,000
right so the the goal of this challenge

662
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,360
and most of the challenges actually is

663
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,679
to gain code execution on the remote

664
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:38,480
system

665
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,080
and once you have that there is a small

666
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,320
program running uh sitting there that

667
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,559
you can run to um let's go ahead and

668
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:45,600
pick up shellfish there because i saw

669
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,200
them running the running the challenge

670
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,799
right so they've created kind of like a

671
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:52,720
uh template uh in their exploitation

672
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,640
script where uh they're just like

673
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,000
setting up the interaction with the

674
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,679
program like inputting the different

675
00:33:57,679 --> 00:33:59,200
parameters just making sure that that

676
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,960
works and then once they have that in

677
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,720
place they can get kind of like make an

678
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,399
abstraction on top of that and just make

679
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:05,600
all the syscalls that they want so

680
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,640
they're just going to use like a phone

681
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,000
tools or something like that to be able

682
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,359
to interact with a service but then

683
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:10,800
they're going to wrap that so that it's

684
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,560
this is called this parameters and it

685
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,760
will handle the text formatting and the

686
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,960
new lines and all that kind of stuff

687
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,239
right just let them build their builder

688
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:17,520
primitives this is very common when you

689
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,520
do this type of exploitation you kind of

690
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,760
like transform uh

691
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,399
functions in the program to like more

692
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:26,960
abstracted operations uh

693
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,800
and we had a question here in chat if

694
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,079
they have internet and they can google

695
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:31,440
stuff yes they do have access to that

696
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,359
actually we can see it just now so pdbw

697
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:36,639
uh just pulled up a reference here um so

698
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:38,399
i think we're looking uh if we switched

699
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:39,918
over in time you're gonna see them

700
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:41,440
looking up syscall tables which makes a

701
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,480
lot of sense that was actually what we

702
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,079
did we were testing this as well right

703
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:45,119
yes

704
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:46,800
um in fact the first thing they're

705
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,639
looking for is exactly e exactly as you

706
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:50,639
said oh i want to just write exactly i'm

707
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:51,839
running bash and that's where you're

708
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:53,359
going to first run into this well wait a

709
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:54,239
minute

710
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:56,159
how do i actually get the string it's as

711
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:58,560
we like had some of the nautilus members

712
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,760
and as we talked about this with some

713
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,160
folks yeah everyone's first reaction is

714
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,160
oh that's immediately trivial

715
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,440
and then you're like yeah but where do

716
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,720
you get your string from you've got to

717
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,640
have a pointer to a string

718
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,240
and so you've got to think a little bit

719
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,880
about that it's it's not super hard yeah

720
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,079
but you have to figure out how to get

721
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:16,240
something into memory first that's going

722
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,119
to be the string that you're going to

723
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:20,000
call yeah we can see here for shellfish

724
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,640
some debugging going on there was some

725
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,359
gdb with the jeff extension i'm a big

726
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:26,640
fan

727
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,880
makes life a lot easier

728
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,960
um i'm trying to see exactly what's

729
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,079
going on they're trying to put some

730
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:33,839
break points somewhere looking at the

731
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:36,800
memory mapping yeah okay uh so they

732
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,480
needed the base address there to put the

733
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,839
breakpoint in the right place although

734
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:41,680
there is a function in in jeff to to

735
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:44,560
automate that but however uh you know

736
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,480
what's the function uh it's called like

737
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,480
pie break so they will like do relative

738
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,640
to that oh that's kind of handy yes yeah

739
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,760
that does the math for you with the

740
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,599
offset that's cool

741
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:56,400
uh there's a lot of different nice uh

742
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,200
tricks uh with with that uh extension uh

743
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,480
framework

744
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,599
so i'm gonna talk a little bit just

745
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:03,280
about the teams too right because we've

746
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,560
got again we've got a lot of like these

747
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:07,599
conglomeration teams and so uh briefly

748
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:09,440
and we'll try not to miss so keep yeah

749
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,560
you keep an eye on the teams to make

750
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,760
sure i'm not missing somebody like you

751
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,240
know getting close um but we've got team

752
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,079
shellfish that has been around it's one

753
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:18,480
of the longest running ctf teams uh

754
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,640
originally out of ucsb but they've got

755
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,320
kind of i think connections now a lot of

756
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:25,520
different places uh so so uh team

757
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,680
shellfish is uh is currently one of our

758
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:31,200
battling teams and ptb wtl is pwned the

759
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,160
bytes

760
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,240
and wrecked the line wrecked the line i

761
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,079
was like i don't remember that one both

762
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:38,480
romanian teams right i believe so i

763
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,880
believe i think they have uh other

764
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,160
members as well but i think they're like

765
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,160
primarily uh romanian based at least and

766
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,680
i think we do see that especially in the

767
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,200
def con where the teams are like these

768
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,880
mega groups are coming yeah sometimes

769
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,400
they're just colleges or friends or

770
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,839
online communities and sometimes they

771
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:54,079
are just local regional or you know

772
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:55,760
country ctf teams they normally compete

773
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,440
against each other and then they come

774
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,960
together to form like a mega group and

775
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,960
so you got like this sort of country

776
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,599
you know based representation yes

777
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:04,800
which also says something about that

778
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,520
kind of like the you know ctf community

779
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,760
aspect of the whole thing i think it's

780
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,760
uh really nice to see these like

781
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,280
different like regional communities like

782
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,560
get it together you're both competing

783
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:17,119
against and also participating with yeah

784
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:18,880
um we're losing video on one of our

785
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,400
capsules we're not sure is it losing on

786
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,079
the stream as well or are we okay so i

787
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:23,520
apologize for the

788
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,599
for the flicker we've got some probably

789
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:28,400
loose cable somewhere yeah um this is

790
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,960
the joys but uh technically i'm you know

791
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,960
could be a lot worse like it is it

792
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,560
appears to be working and so that's our

793
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,320
big our big stress here so i saw some

794
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,320
was it like s trace output or something

795
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,359
from uh

796
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:42,960
from the ptb uh screen there uh

797
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,040
i'm not sure okay so okay i like that so

798
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,240
look at it i love that we're seeing the

799
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,320
highlights right so map we started with

800
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,760
executive e yes

801
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,119
that's going to be your ultimate goal is

802
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:52,160
you're probably going to want to trigger

803
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,000
exactly e but like you've got to get

804
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,680
your memory first and so we're seeing

805
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,119
like um

806
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:58,480
someone's looking we're going to look

807
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,640
for for map to try to get

808
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,560
get something into memory get a piece of

809
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,720
memory that we control but they're going

810
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,240
to have to still get something into that

811
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,280
region right they're still going to have

812
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,200
to actually get bytes at that address so

813
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,880
i see i'm seeing some very interesting

814
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,359
thing uh here on the shellfish side

815
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:15,359
they're grabbing the address of the

816
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:17,520
v syscall memory region

817
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:20,079
uh which was not involved in any of the

818
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:21,839
proposed solutions when we were testing

819
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:24,480
i love it so i really would like to see

820
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,960
what's what they're going for there

821
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,359
um and and to be clear we expect that

822
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:30,960
there will be lots this one in

823
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,720
particular has an infinite number of

824
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,400
solutions right there's going to be

825
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,839
all sorts of ways that we didn't think

826
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:37,680
about so we have one in mind that we we

827
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:38,880
expected but

828
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,160
um i'm actually one of the things that i

829
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,320
think is the most fun as an organizer is

830
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,400
when somebody solves your challenge

831
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,920
in a way that you completely did not

832
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,520
expect yeah yeah

833
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,440
as long as as long as it's not like so

834
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,280
in this particular case we're okay if

835
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,640
they solve it quickly because that's the

836
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,560
point is to be as fast as possible

837
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,000
sometimes if you build a really

838
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
difficult hard ctf challenge and

839
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,520
somebody like finds a trivial thing that

840
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,440
you forgot that's that's a little soul

841
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,040
crushing yeah yeah but like as long as

842
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,040
it's like a you know a cool solution or

843
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,720
like anything then that you just love to

844
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,079
see it yeah although it's sometimes

845
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:10,079
you'll i love how ctf organizers will

846
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:12,560
re-release a challenge right pat's the

847
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,320
easy bug you didn't intend give them

848
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,160
points still but then make them solve it

849
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,520
like the harder way as well too so i

850
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,040
think that's a decent trend and one one

851
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,920
good way to yeah um just get both out of

852
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,280
it to reward them for what they did but

853
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,520
but also keep doing that

854
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,680
so we have oh so we've got something

855
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,760
happening here so we've got an map cisco

856
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,599
okay so we're looking at ptb

857
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:34,720
uh and we've got mmap so we've got our

858
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,800
syscall wrapper we're gonna call the

859
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,760
syscall by name

860
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,760
so the maps this call what do we what

861
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:42,640
are we doing with that we know we're

862
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,160
going to ex is like ve is going to run

863
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,520
something but what's map going to do

864
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:46,880
that's going to help us

865
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:47,560
yes so

866
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:48,720
[Music]

867
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,160
we need to put the string somewhere in

868
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,160
memory we don't know anything about

869
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,160
where what memory is mapped and so on so

870
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,160
we'll just map we'll use the map thing

871
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,160
okay and we do and uh we didn't mention

872
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,760
this earlier i don't think but the

873
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,440
output of the syscall you ran is

874
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,960
returned

875
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,160
value

876
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,079
yeah so so if there if there is a return

877
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:07,599
from that syscall they're going to get

878
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:09,119
that information back so any of these

879
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:10,960
calls that that's useful

880
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,200
we're gonna see that so we had a comment

881
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,400
sorry question here about what happens

882
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,000
if they don't solve the challenge in one

883
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,760
hour so even before that i think it's

884
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,760
like 45 minutes or so sometime around 45

885
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,599
minutes yes if they don't we will switch

886
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:25,040
to a sudden depth challenge which is a

887
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,599
very simple challenge uh that they will

888
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:29,280
try to solve instead so we will just

889
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,040
like discard all the stuff they did so

890
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,560
far and we'll switch to like a super

891
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,079
super simple challenge and and mainly

892
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:35,119
the reason that we're going to do that

893
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:37,280
is just because we've got so many

894
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,280
matches that we have to run that if they

895
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,640
each start taking longer and longer and

896
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,079
we're off schedule we're keeping people

897
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:43,599
overnight and we got it would just be

898
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:45,680
kind of a logistical headache so

899
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,240
we hope we don't have to if uh we don't

900
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,520
have any bugs in our challenges and

901
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:50,800
they're all the appropriate difficulty

902
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,640
and the teams all do well you'll never

903
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,480
see them we'll save them for next year

904
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,800
um but uh those are like gonna be like

905
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,160
really really simple ones that we hope

906
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,680
they can solve within less than five or

907
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,760
ten minutes so that's kind of the backup

908
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,440
plan uh we'll find out if we need it i

909
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,200
have to say so far

910
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,280
right on pace super happy with this this

911
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,720
is like i think about what i would have

912
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,240
hoped and expected

913
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:12,079
um that we're seeing they've already got

914
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:13,599
their frameworks up they know exactly

915
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:15,119
what they have to do yes they're just

916
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:16,640
building the right building blocks to

917
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,319
kind of kind of see it yeah and this is

918
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:19,920
also i think something that's always uh

919
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:22,000
kind of a challenge for me when solving

920
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,400
these kind of challenges like uh how

921
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,079
much do you want like to take the time

922
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:27,760
and like build the proper abstractions

923
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,839
and like make your nice functions and

924
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:31,359
and how much do you kind of just want to

925
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:32,880
like you know take that leap of faith

926
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,280
and just throw together some like uh

927
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,359
really uh crappy code that might solve

928
00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:39,280
the thing like that might work but if it

929
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,800
doesn't then you have to like backtrack

930
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,240
yeah it was like it's a whole mess

931
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:43,440
there's i feel like there's a lot of

932
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,440
game theory to it almost in terms of

933
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,520
like you know risk reward explore

934
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,359
exploit uh kind of kind of analysis

935
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:51,359
where it's you have to figure out

936
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:53,680
is this uh

937
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,280
is is it worth it and you don't really

938
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,720
know you do develop i think a little bit

939
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,640
of an intuition like you can kind of

940
00:41:58,640 --> 00:41:59,920
look at it you sort of have a sense of

941
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,760
like okay no i just need to bang this

942
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:02,480
out

943
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,000
uh and just hardcode a bunch of bytes

944
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,359
and that'll be fine

945
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:07,119
in this particular case oh here we go

946
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:09,200
this is interesting so now we've got a

947
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,440
read syscall this is oh we also saw the

948
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:12,480
cisco list on the other side with

949
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,960
shellfish but but ptb

950
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,119
i think we have all the syscalls we need

951
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:20,079
i think i think read map x yeah exactly

952
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:21,680
i think this is it this is these are the

953
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,760
right ingredients they just gotta

954
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,599
assemble them correctly and make that

955
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:28,480
cake yes yeah and then we should be we

956
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,560
may be looking at the winner but um

957
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,240
we'll also keep an eye on shellfish and

958
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,720
see see what's happening uh there as

959
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:35,760
well

960
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,599
and make sure that uh

961
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:40,800
yeah so they're using the fxv

962
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,400
function which

963
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:45,200
i that variant i'm not i don't know i'd

964
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,400
have to look at the main page myself

965
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,200
yeah

966
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,880
i mean because these functions they come

967
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,640
in a bunch of different flavors yeah

968
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:51,839
right

969
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:54,000
so that's interesting and again there is

970
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,839
there is i think one of the things that

971
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:57,839
teams are going to realize is that we

972
00:42:57,839 --> 00:42:59,520
didn't go for tricks

973
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,280
we didn't we tried not to go for sort of

974
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,800
like tricky gimmicky things it's trying

975
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,160
to be like pretty straightforward we

976
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,160
want them to be fast and quick and sort

977
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:06,800
of

978
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,079
the obvious thing you would think of is

979
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:09,359
at least our intended solution

980
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:11,200
oftentimes that's that's not always the

981
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,680
case lots of ctfs right

982
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,760
you've got to find the the very tricky

983
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,200
uh thing and that makes it fun it

984
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:19,280
actually is super entertaining yeah um

985
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,960
something you can also learn stuff from

986
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,640
like it's down this rabbit hole of

987
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,240
research and stuff but i don't really

988
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:25,760
have time for that like right so like

989
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:28,480
punable that kr or you know like those

990
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,720
websites have amazing really cool things

991
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,000
you can learn

992
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,880
but here we're not trying to trick them

993
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:37,920
um yeah no no no gidger users yet uh i

994
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:39,280
have seen a couple of the uh

995
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:40,880
participants in the room using geardrop

996
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,400
so yeah maybe we should keep it like a

997
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,160
tally for the tournament like you know

998
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:45,520
it might be too depressing for me that

999
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:48,720
might hurt my ninja soul might be too uh

1000
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:51,200
too hurt by that yeah so so uh but also

1001
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:53,520
not aware uh jordan one of the founders

1002
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,760
of vector35 making a binary ninja which

1003
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,520
is not used in this match but we

1004
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,440
hopefully will see it i hope we see and

1005
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,839
if all i want is one binge a user to win

1006
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:03,760
one round and that'll make my hap make

1007
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:05,200
my heart happy right straight into the

1008
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:06,880
marketing material right i mean yeah

1009
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:09,200
exactly exactly it's i will say you know

1010
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,480
the funny thing is binder ninja was

1011
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,000
actually designed

1012
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,680
for ctfs originally it was meant to be

1013
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,520
very very fast and quick and like to

1014
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:17,200
common things like patching things out

1015
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:18,800
yeah were meant to be quick so that's

1016
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:19,920
probably kind of some of things it does

1017
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:22,319
well so it is actually well suited

1018
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:23,760
towards a very very fast-paced

1019
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:25,760
environment yeah but more important that

1020
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:26,720
is knowing what you're doing all right

1021
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:28,079
so back to shellfish what are you seeing

1022
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:32,079
so shellfish uh they are

1023
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:33,440
creating they

1024
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:36,480
writing a small ces program here uh

1025
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:37,839
we're calling maps yeah i think they're

1026
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:39,520
testing out they're they're maybe like i

1027
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:42,400
like that idea not completely sure about

1028
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,560
uh like the arguments or so for the m

1029
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:45,839
absolutely right they're writing a small

1030
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:47,599
little test program to just verify that

1031
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:48,880
they have like the correct understanding

1032
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,079
of this that's actually a really really

1033
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:51,359
good idea very good idea yeah because

1034
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:52,800
you know you don't want to like you have

1035
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,400
the added complication of a network

1036
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,000
service and the text protocol and you're

1037
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,920
throwing script in your wrapper no no

1038
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:59,680
just get rid of that abstraction test

1039
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:01,599
the syscalls in a row directly and then

1040
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:03,119
once you've got it working then you can

1041
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:04,240
sort of port it to your throwing

1042
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:05,760
framework i think that's a great idea so

1043
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,760
i'm happy to see that

1044
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,359
but we are seeing so we're seeing just

1045
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:11,440
the straight up approach over here on

1046
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:14,880
ptb wtl

1047
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:19,640
let's watch them as they've got it

1048
00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:23,200
yeah looking through yes is it uh is it

1049
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:25,119
buffered is input buffered or not

1050
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:26,560
they're checking that

1051
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:27,760
maybe they're looking for another piece

1052
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,200
of memory uh they're looking over here

1053
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:30,640
in like the data

1054
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:32,000
segment so i wonder if they're looking

1055
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,800
for a place to reuse but this is aslr

1056
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,000
right we didn't i don't think we gave

1057
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,920
them uh information about where the

1058
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:40,400
binary is actually executing here

1059
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:41,920
uh because it is kind of up to them to

1060
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:43,280
sort of like make their own memory with

1061
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:44,560
the syscalls that they've got yeah we

1062
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:46,560
can see here um

1063
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,640
going over to

1064
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:51,440
shellfish again

1065
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:52,400
they

1066
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,400
are

1067
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,960
putting this together this map syscall

1068
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,160
now

1069
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:02,000
and uh yeah i think are they like

1070
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,160
slightly behind the

1071
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:05,760
p2b at the moment

1072
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,599
you know it's so hard to say though

1073
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:08,880
having done you know we've both done i

1074
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:10,319
think several versions of these kind of

1075
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:11,680
events and it can be really tough

1076
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:12,880
sometimes you think somebody's like not

1077
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:14,000
even close and all of a sudden before

1078
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,319
you notice they've solved it yeah and

1079
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:17,760
sometimes you can see them kind of kind

1080
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:21,119
of bringing it home yeah um yes uh nick

1081
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:23,760
uh i'm i'm jordan hi ciphertext on

1082
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:26,960
twitter the vector35 binary ninja guy uh

1083
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:28,960
and david we have thousands of binary

1084
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:30,480
ninja users there are there are many

1085
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:32,400
thousands of binary ninja users

1086
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,560
um we'll see how many are here besides

1087
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:36,400
the one that we have from ptb even

1088
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,160
though they're not using it maybe they

1089
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:39,760
just ran it just to like as a show of

1090
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:41,599
solidarity for me to make me feel better

1091
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:43,440
i i'm a binary there we go there are

1092
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,280
there are yes there are binary users

1093
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:47,680
yeah but anyway looking at the the p2b

1094
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:49,119
uh screen here

1095
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:51,040
uh i think you can see that they're

1096
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:53,200
debugging the read

1097
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:55,440
the calls here right no sorry that's the

1098
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:57,760
input reading uh routine

1099
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:00,560
uh and they are doing this is called

1100
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:03,040
zero which is uh

1101
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:04,880
is that the read

1102
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:06,560
and uh

1103
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:07,440
yeah

1104
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:10,960
uh checking out some

1105
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:13,359
documentation about mmap stack overflow

1106
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:16,079
always trustworthy but we have um

1107
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:18,640
shellfish

1108
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,960
again yeah fixing the uh

1109
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:24,960
map uh

1110
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:28,000
okay so ptp just found map fixed so what

1111
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,839
they were looking for yeah is they

1112
00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:32,240
wanted to get the right flag to be able

1113
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:34,800
to pass to mmap to request a fixed

1114
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,000
address so you can just there's

1115
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,440
different modes of map you can request

1116
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:38,480
memory and just take whatever you can

1117
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,319
get or you can just say no no i want

1118
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:42,400
this address please give me this address

1119
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:43,760
yeah so they're just going to hard code

1120
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,200
some some adders that they hope nothing

1121
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:46,400
runs against and this is kind of like a

1122
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,720
key to the challenge right where

1123
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:50,800
since

1124
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,400
well not necessarily since you do get

1125
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:53,680
the return they get the return address

1126
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:55,440
yeah so that could like the simpler

1127
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:57,440
variant is to just to tell emma like no

1128
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:58,960
we're going to allocate it to it's one

1129
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:01,520
less moving part to worry about um so

1130
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:03,200
yeah yeah i think you can go kind of

1131
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:04,880
kind of either way and this is so this

1132
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:06,240
is where about 20 minutes and this is

1133
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:08,480
where i think we'd be evaluating

1134
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:09,920
are we going to give a hint and i don't

1135
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:11,599
think they need any hints they both

1136
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:13,200
really know i think generally what the

1137
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,359
shape of the problem is um they're both

1138
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:17,200
working on it i'm i have every

1139
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:18,480
confidence that they're going to i think

1140
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:19,599
they're going to finish it out the next

1141
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:22,240
uh 20 you know 10-20 minutes yes

1142
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,640
we hope we hope we're looking forward to

1143
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:27,279
seeing them do that

1144
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:29,280
all right

1145
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:30,880
so we forgot to bring our water bottles

1146
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:32,400
over here to to make sure we can stay

1147
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:34,640
hydrated but we'll uh we'll do that

1148
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:36,319
we're having to not only are we are we

1149
00:48:36,319 --> 00:48:38,559
yelling over the uh

1150
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:40,559
the house audio uh but we have our masks

1151
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:42,400
on and uh

1152
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:43,760
there have been easier streaming

1153
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:45,760
environments but i'm super excited to be

1154
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:47,680
here yeah

1155
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:52,240
so going over to uh p2b uh again um well

1156
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:53,599
and so yeah i think we mentioned this

1157
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:55,520
before but like this soft script they're

1158
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:56,880
running they're running locally they got

1159
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:58,240
the binary locally they're running in

1160
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:00,400
debugger so they can analyze both halves

1161
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:02,079
of it and then once they have it working

1162
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:03,359
yeah then they're going to go ahead and

1163
00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:04,400
throw it against the real server

1164
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,079
remotely which is like

1165
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:08,000
standard operating procedure i feel like

1166
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,040
for these kind of challenges right

1167
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:11,200
standard phonable challenge exactly and

1168
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:13,520
it's also why it's nice to have

1169
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:14,800
um

1170
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:16,400
it's nice to actually have like an

1171
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:17,599
environment where you can run it

1172
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:19,040
directly right whether it's the

1173
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:21,040
architecture you've got or the um

1174
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:23,520
operating system

1175
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:24,960
yes teams were a little worried about

1176
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:26,319
having internet and we're like no no we

1177
00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:27,839
want to see you in like internet and

1178
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:29,040
remember these are some of the best

1179
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:30,559
teams in the world and they're still

1180
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:32,160
looking this stuff up we all are are

1181
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:33,520
doing that let's take a look over here

1182
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:34,880
at uh

1183
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:36,559
shellfish again and see where we're at

1184
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:39,920
yeah so they have another syscall that

1185
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:40,720
they're

1186
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:42,000
setting up you see

1187
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,200
uh them like uh well retrying that so

1188
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:46,720
they're

1189
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:47,920
uh really making sure that the

1190
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:49,920
interaction uh here is working you have

1191
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:51,359
this like question from the program like

1192
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:52,720
do you wanna make another sys call so

1193
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:54,480
they're just setting that up uh to

1194
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:55,839
answer yes on that and then you see

1195
00:49:55,839 --> 00:49:57,760
they're about to set up another syscall

1196
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:58,960
oh there we go so we're looking at

1197
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:01,760
memory maps over on ptb so they briefly

1198
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:03,599
they tried to allocate the memory they

1199
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:05,119
went to look in the debugger and to see

1200
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:06,960
if the memory was allocated

1201
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:09,040
so the only thing i mean if if they're

1202
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:11,280
past that step the only thing left to do

1203
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:13,440
then is going to be to actually put bin

1204
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:14,720
bash

1205
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,160
there right like once they have the

1206
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:19,200
string been bashed into that location

1207
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:21,520
uh they they should be able to win you

1208
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:23,359
should should be able to yeah

1209
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:25,040
we have a question in chat about if the

1210
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:26,640
challenges are going to be released to

1211
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,960
everyone after the finals uh i mean

1212
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:30,400
we haven't really talked about that but

1213
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:33,040
i mean i assume so yes

1214
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:34,480
anything stopping us from doing that so

1215
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:37,680
uh i'm gonna say yes on that

1216
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:39,200
provisionally yes yeah we'll double

1217
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:41,040
check with so now's actually a good time

1218
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:42,880
to talk about if you keep an eye on make

1219
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:44,400
sure we're uh we're getting a little

1220
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,319
close over here on ptb so so carl if you

1221
00:50:46,319 --> 00:50:47,599
watch that

1222
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:49,280
but we do have a lot of people who've

1223
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:51,520
been helping out so far so there are

1224
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:52,640
three of us

1225
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:54,640
in person here at vegas that are doing

1226
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:56,319
all like this kind of stuff but we've

1227
00:50:56,319 --> 00:50:57,920
had several other people contribute

1228
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:01,119
challenges remotely uh test challenges

1229
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:02,960
uh do a lot of stuff we're looking real

1230
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:05,119
close over here okay so again we've got

1231
00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:06,400
our read

1232
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:08,720
we've got an exec we've got our map this

1233
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:10,400
might actually be it so let's take a

1234
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,480
look and follow along ptb

1235
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:14,800
uh because i'm i'm smelling blood in the

1236
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:18,000
water i think if there was

1237
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:20,559
yeah so they like

1238
00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:22,000
maybe they need to fix like some small

1239
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,599
thing here uh

1240
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:25,200
oh yeah is that they have some helper

1241
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:26,640
function there uh unfortunately i don't

1242
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:28,079
know really what it's it's

1243
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:30,800
like interactive is it oh is that

1244
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:32,800
is it is it

1245
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:36,240
oh they're solving it that's it

1246
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:38,319
that's it is that it is that it is that

1247
00:51:38,319 --> 00:51:41,040
it is going

1248
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:44,160
what what we already had oh my god we

1249
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:45,280
weren't even looking at the right screen

1250
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:47,599
congratulations

1251
00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:48,720
wow

1252
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:50,480
that was so close

1253
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:54,720
that was so close okay um well done

1254
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:57,280
i can't believe how close that was

1255
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,599
all right oh my god okay so that was

1256
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:01,520
outrageous uh

1257
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:03,280
give me also i will go over to the

1258
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:05,280
players you talked about the players

1259
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:06,400
all right

1260
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:09,040
yes that was unbelievable i was we even

1261
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:10,480
predicted we said we're going to miss

1262
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:12,640
one we're looking the wrong way

1263
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:14,960
all right so let's do a real quick recap

1264
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:17,119
so we were with the between the screen

1265
00:52:17,119 --> 00:52:18,480
kind of turning on and off a little bit

1266
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:19,760
on the shelf of shy we were a little

1267
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:21,839
behind i mean that was like

1268
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:24,640
seconds they were seconds away

1269
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:26,400
that was unbelievable what a great

1270
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:27,359
finish

1271
00:52:27,359 --> 00:52:28,240
um

1272
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:30,839
so just as a quick recap perfect

1273
00:52:30,839 --> 00:52:33,280
timing super exciting very well done to

1274
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:34,960
both of those teams

1275
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:38,319
that was so close so close

1276
00:52:38,319 --> 00:52:39,440
um

1277
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:41,760
so again once they were able to like get

1278
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:43,280
their shell all they had to do was run

1279
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:45,440
their script put their team number in

1280
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:46,880
from the page that told them what they

1281
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:47,839
had done

1282
00:52:47,839 --> 00:52:49,200
i'm happy we saw all of our

1283
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:51,200
infrastructure working uh the overlay

1284
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:53,760
when we got a winner uh congratulations

1285
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:55,680
to team shellfish but man well played

1286
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:58,079
ptb that was so close

1287
00:52:58,079 --> 00:52:59,839
uh really really well done we're gonna

1288
00:52:59,839 --> 00:53:02,400
let them go back to their uh their teams

1289
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:03,680
and keep working on the rest of the

1290
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,119
challenges here we'll see if we can

1291
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:06,240
figure out how to turn off the the

1292
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:07,599
winner script

1293
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:09,200
um

1294
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:11,359
and uh and get back to the stream we

1295
00:53:11,359 --> 00:53:13,200
will uh we're gonna leave the stream

1296
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:15,520
going so keep watching here but remember

1297
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:18,319
just on the hour every hour uh our goal

1298
00:53:18,319 --> 00:53:19,680
we're gonna have a new round and so

1299
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:20,800
we're gonna get set up we're gonna get

1300
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:23,200
the next team uh and then we'll update

1301
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:24,960
our bracket now we have our first winner

1302
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:27,359
congratulations to team shellfish

1303
00:53:27,359 --> 00:53:29,760
well done very well done oh my god

1304
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:31,599
that's so good oh my god it was so good

1305
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:33,200
yeah all right that's at a high bar for

1306
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:34,960
i think the competition for the the rest

1307
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:36,960
of the the event but what a way to kick

1308
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:38,640
it off uh we're gonna leave you at the

1309
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:40,079
intermission uh you can check out the

1310
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:42,079
scoreboard and then we'll be back in

1311
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:45,760
about 35 minutes with the next round yep

1312
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:48,530
see you later take care

1313
00:53:48,530 --> 00:54:18,800
[Music]

1314
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:21,800
so

1315

1495
01:35:05,679 --> 01:35:08,000
and uh we'll as soon as we get in the

1496
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:09,199
word that the server's live they'll be

1497
01:35:09,199 --> 01:35:10,960
able to refresh and start going on

1498
01:35:10,960 --> 01:35:13,360
challenge number two

1499
01:35:13,360 --> 01:35:14,560
you go ahead and count it count it in

1500
01:35:14,560 --> 01:35:17,040
count it in

1501
01:35:17,600 --> 01:35:18,880
all right here we go

1502
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:21,119
so we're gonna go

1503
01:35:21,119 --> 01:35:22,320
all right go

1504
01:35:22,320 --> 01:35:23,119
go

1505
01:35:23,119 --> 01:35:24,719
make it go all right we'll just do that

1506
01:35:24,719 --> 01:35:26,840
no countdown no countdown this

1507
01:35:26,840 --> 01:35:30,320
time so we're going refresh the pages we

1508
01:35:30,320 --> 01:35:32,080
should be able to see them there we go

1509
01:35:32,080 --> 01:35:33,679
download challenge download challenge

1510
01:35:33,679 --> 01:35:36,080
okay so not a

1511
01:35:36,080 --> 01:35:38,719
little less fanfare than last time

1512
01:35:38,719 --> 01:35:40,080
but hopefully we are going to be live

1513
01:35:40,080 --> 01:35:43,040
this challenge uh is specifically called

1514
01:35:43,040 --> 01:35:46,159
open to interpretation

1515
01:35:46,159 --> 01:35:47,520
we're not sure if all of our challenges

1516
01:35:47,520 --> 01:35:49,440
are the right difficulty what we are

1517
01:35:49,440 --> 01:35:50,719
sure is they all have greatness no you

1518
01:35:50,719 --> 01:35:52,639
didn't sorry uh this is the wrong one

1519
01:35:52,639 --> 01:35:54,719
you didn't replace the handouts oh okay

1520
01:35:54,719 --> 01:35:56,400
go tell them tell them go to them all

1521
01:35:56,400 --> 01:35:58,560
right sorry technical glitch

1522
01:35:58,560 --> 01:35:59,920
all right so we gotta warn them this is

1523
01:35:59,920 --> 01:36:01,600
not the right challenge

1524
01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:03,760
one second okay so

1525
01:36:03,760 --> 01:36:05,199
this was still the old challenge there's

1526
01:36:05,199 --> 01:36:06,320
there's a couple of like management

1527
01:36:06,320 --> 01:36:07,360
scripts this is our first time

1528
01:36:07,360 --> 01:36:09,440
transitioning from an early around

1529
01:36:09,440 --> 01:36:12,080
so real short intermission

1530
01:36:12,080 --> 01:36:14,480
and uh we should be back uh

1531
01:36:14,480 --> 01:36:16,719
unfortunately we're still seeing some i

1532
01:36:16,719 --> 01:36:18,159
think we've done terrible things to the

1533
01:36:18,159 --> 01:36:20,960
usb inputs on one of our laptops

1534
01:36:20,960 --> 01:36:23,440
and so uh we're we keep restarting that

1535
01:36:23,440 --> 01:36:25,520
capture card uh we do actually have a

1536
01:36:25,520 --> 01:36:27,040
spare capture card that's arriving uh

1537
01:36:27,040 --> 01:36:29,040
shortly as well so we can we can switch

1538
01:36:29,040 --> 01:36:30,320
to that

1539
01:36:30,320 --> 01:36:32,000
if this um

1540
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:35,280
it ends up not working so

1541
01:36:35,280 --> 01:36:36,719
okay we've told them to try again

1542
01:36:36,719 --> 01:36:38,239
they're to download a new challenge and

1543
01:36:38,239 --> 01:36:41,280
let's take a look at

1544
01:36:41,280 --> 01:36:44,159
a new binary

1545
01:36:44,400 --> 01:36:46,880
all right let's take a look at that

1546
01:36:46,880 --> 01:36:49,280
challenge it's just called challenge

1547
01:36:49,280 --> 01:36:50,400
we should have named the challenge of

1548
01:36:50,400 --> 01:36:52,239
the actual uh challenge name yeah in

1549
01:36:52,239 --> 01:36:53,600
hindsight you know you learn all the

1550
01:36:53,600 --> 01:36:55,040
lessons learned

1551
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:59,440
all right so we've got an ida is this

1552
01:36:59,840 --> 01:37:01,840
give me a program okay all right so we

1553
01:37:01,840 --> 01:37:03,600
are on the right challenge now

1554
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:05,119
um it looks like we're having some

1555
01:37:05,119 --> 01:37:06,639
difficulty with our one capture card

1556
01:37:06,639 --> 01:37:08,080
unfortunately

1557
01:37:08,080 --> 01:37:09,679
yeah this one is problematic we swapped

1558
01:37:09,679 --> 01:37:10,400
out

1559
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:11,600
adapters

1560
01:37:11,600 --> 01:37:12,560
cars

1561
01:37:12,560 --> 01:37:13,760
we'll figure it out we have backups for

1562
01:37:13,760 --> 01:37:15,520
everything yeah we'll uh we'll have our

1563
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:17,520
production uh look into that while we uh

1564
01:37:17,520 --> 01:37:19,440
continue the

1565
01:37:19,440 --> 01:37:20,800
commentary and when we say production we

1566
01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:22,560
mean glenn yes we have we have but you

1567
01:37:22,560 --> 01:37:23,920
know it sounds more professional when

1568
01:37:23,920 --> 01:37:25,520
you're oh no like production like we'll

1569
01:37:25,520 --> 01:37:26,800
have we'll have back of house yeah

1570
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:28,719
production crew look into it and uh let

1571
01:37:28,719 --> 01:37:31,280
us know how it's going yeah

1572
01:37:31,280 --> 01:37:33,440
yeah so we've got uh our second

1573
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:36,239
challenge they're at least going um

1574
01:37:36,239 --> 01:37:39,760
uh let's go ahead and look at adjust um

1575
01:37:39,760 --> 01:37:41,840
team slash v slash whatever uh look at

1576
01:37:41,840 --> 01:37:43,040
their desktop while we've got that

1577
01:37:43,040 --> 01:37:45,840
working yeah um and then we'll we'll

1578
01:37:45,840 --> 01:37:46,960
we'll keep an eye on the other one so it

1579
01:37:46,960 --> 01:37:50,000
comes back up we will see if worst case

1580
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:50,880
if we're not looking at one of the

1581
01:37:50,880 --> 01:37:52,880
screens we'll still see winner so if we

1582
01:37:52,880 --> 01:37:53,920
see a winner and we didn't just like

1583
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:54,880
last time we were looking at the wrong

1584
01:37:54,880 --> 01:37:57,119
one yes shouldn't be a problem

1585
01:37:57,119 --> 01:37:59,040
we should still be able to see that

1586
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:00,400
that's happened

1587
01:38:00,400 --> 01:38:01,840
all the challenges will be available to

1588
01:38:01,840 --> 01:38:03,040
download yeah we're gonna we're gonna

1589
01:38:03,040 --> 01:38:04,960
release them uh we don't have a specific

1590
01:38:04,960 --> 01:38:06,400
plan so we'll probably wait till just

1591
01:38:06,400 --> 01:38:08,320
after we've recuperated a little bit um

1592
01:38:08,320 --> 01:38:10,400
after we get back from defcon

1593
01:38:10,400 --> 01:38:12,480
but we do plan to release them

1594
01:38:12,480 --> 01:38:15,040
uh i like uh i like that you're guessing

1595
01:38:15,040 --> 01:38:17,119
uh about what type of challenge it might

1596
01:38:17,119 --> 01:38:19,520
be so open to interpretation is it a

1597
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:20,800
polyglot

1598
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:22,880
um i think it's more of a play on words

1599
01:38:22,880 --> 01:38:25,440
of interpreter yes yes right

1600
01:38:25,440 --> 01:38:26,719
i think it's uh

1601
01:38:26,719 --> 01:38:29,199
uh we're not that clever with uh you

1602
01:38:29,199 --> 01:38:30,639
know uh

1603
01:38:30,639 --> 01:38:32,400
we're only moderately clever with the

1604
01:38:32,400 --> 01:38:34,320
naming here right so yeah i think that's

1605
01:38:34,320 --> 01:38:36,239
something like this yes so we can see

1606
01:38:36,239 --> 01:38:38,480
here see here um

1607
01:38:38,480 --> 01:38:40,400
looking at them looking at the program

1608
01:38:40,400 --> 01:38:41,679
in the

1609
01:38:41,679 --> 01:38:42,800
item

1610
01:38:42,800 --> 01:38:46,239
and starting to uh build up a uh simple

1611
01:38:46,239 --> 01:38:49,760
uh phone tools script uh so ptr lib

1612
01:38:49,760 --> 01:38:52,719
actually i saw ptrlib um that's a good

1613
01:38:52,719 --> 01:38:54,320
question i'm not actually sure the name

1614
01:38:54,320 --> 01:38:56,239
of the individual players that we've got

1615
01:38:56,239 --> 01:38:58,400
if you all saw a home

1616
01:38:58,400 --> 01:39:00,960
oh yeah ptr it is uh ptr

1617
01:39:00,960 --> 01:39:02,800
uh and that makes sense that ptr libs so

1618
01:39:02,800 --> 01:39:04,719
this is their like they're throwing

1619
01:39:04,719 --> 01:39:06,000
script library so i think we're not

1620
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:07,600
looking at a

1621
01:39:07,600 --> 01:39:08,960
uh opponent tools i think we're looking

1622
01:39:08,960 --> 01:39:12,159
at an actual like custom oh nice yeah

1623
01:39:12,159 --> 01:39:14,400
yeah from ptrlib and poor star i i see

1624
01:39:14,400 --> 01:39:16,239
yeah some people some players prefer to

1625
01:39:16,239 --> 01:39:18,560
like build their own little uh thing uh

1626
01:39:18,560 --> 01:39:20,239
i mean pawn tools has a million things

1627
01:39:20,239 --> 01:39:21,920
but also it has a millionaire yeah yeah

1628
01:39:21,920 --> 01:39:23,600
and so it's like

1629
01:39:23,600 --> 01:39:25,679
getting that whole box of stuff when you

1630
01:39:25,679 --> 01:39:28,000
only need like the screwdriver yeah yeah

1631
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:29,600
so there's certainly an argument uh

1632
01:39:29,600 --> 01:39:31,600
there's also mpone which is anotherness

1633
01:39:31,600 --> 01:39:33,520
one uh it's meant to be a little simpler

1634
01:39:33,520 --> 01:39:36,320
kind of more standalone yeah uh but uh

1635
01:39:36,320 --> 01:39:37,760
so let's let's talk about the the

1636
01:39:37,760 --> 01:39:39,280
problem we can see

1637
01:39:39,280 --> 01:39:42,719
um this is explicitly i believe a custom

1638
01:39:42,719 --> 01:39:45,520
situation we've got a question mark an a

1639
01:39:45,520 --> 01:39:47,119
so we saw that yeah that that little

1640
01:39:47,119 --> 01:39:48,800
switch statement there

1641
01:39:48,800 --> 01:39:50,880
uh again with the name open to

1642
01:39:50,880 --> 01:39:52,320
interpretation and we think it's kind of

1643
01:39:52,320 --> 01:39:54,560
like an interpreter yeah some sort of

1644
01:39:54,560 --> 01:39:55,760
little virtual machine or some sort of

1645
01:39:55,760 --> 01:39:57,119
interpreter that's going to make some

1646
01:39:57,119 --> 01:39:59,280
some simple changes

1647
01:39:59,280 --> 01:40:00,960
i do love people people know this is

1648
01:40:00,960 --> 01:40:03,360
like uh a live ctf because they they

1649
01:40:03,360 --> 01:40:04,719
start their throwing script like

1650
01:40:04,719 --> 01:40:06,719
immediately right like like they just

1651
01:40:06,719 --> 01:40:08,639
immediately start uh start building that

1652
01:40:08,639 --> 01:40:09,440
up

1653
01:40:09,440 --> 01:40:11,119
uh so i think that's also kind of a good

1654
01:40:11,119 --> 01:40:14,320
way to um in in a sense uh document your

1655
01:40:14,320 --> 01:40:16,159
understanding of the problem so far like

1656
01:40:16,159 --> 01:40:17,760
writing down like the interactions yeah

1657
01:40:17,760 --> 01:40:19,119
different things and so you don't forget

1658
01:40:19,119 --> 01:40:20,560
things and you kind of like as you like

1659
01:40:20,560 --> 01:40:21,840
you'll oftentimes you'll put to do's

1660
01:40:21,840 --> 01:40:23,119
right like you know you do this part but

1661
01:40:23,119 --> 01:40:24,159
like i need to do this later but at

1662
01:40:24,159 --> 01:40:26,239
least i'll remember it because that's my

1663
01:40:26,239 --> 01:40:27,679
yeah i think you're right i think people

1664
01:40:27,679 --> 01:40:29,679
use their little uh throwing script

1665
01:40:29,679 --> 01:40:31,119
almost as a

1666
01:40:31,119 --> 01:40:32,320
um

1667
01:40:32,320 --> 01:40:34,719
a stand-in for like a you know like no

1668
01:40:34,719 --> 01:40:36,639
yeah exactly notes or task tracking or

1669
01:40:36,639 --> 01:40:38,400
like we can see some debugging going on

1670
01:40:38,400 --> 01:40:41,119
now as well um

1671
01:40:41,119 --> 01:40:42,560
we're yeah we're not going to interrupt

1672
01:40:42,560 --> 01:40:45,440
uh his his uh his throwing that's uh you

1673
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:48,239
know in the interest of of fairness

1674
01:40:48,239 --> 01:40:49,040
um

1675
01:40:49,040 --> 01:40:50,639
we're not sure why we're we're having

1676
01:40:50,639 --> 01:40:51,920
glitches on our one capture

1677
01:40:51,920 --> 01:40:53,119
unfortunately so we'll resolve it uh

1678
01:40:53,119 --> 01:40:54,480
before the next round but we're not

1679
01:40:54,480 --> 01:40:56,480
gonna once we've started we need to let

1680
01:40:56,480 --> 01:40:57,840
him go until the first the first yeah

1681
01:40:57,840 --> 01:40:59,199
because this is so hectic like the

1682
01:40:59,199 --> 01:41:00,719
margins like as we saw in the previous

1683
01:41:00,719 --> 01:41:02,719
match for those who watched like

1684
01:41:02,719 --> 01:41:05,040
the yeah the seconds matter

1685
01:41:05,040 --> 01:41:07,199
absolutely like literally there was

1686
01:41:07,199 --> 01:41:10,480
like seven key strokes but like between

1687
01:41:10,480 --> 01:41:12,480
the play i don't think we will see

1688
01:41:12,480 --> 01:41:13,840
a tighter match i mean i will be

1689
01:41:13,840 --> 01:41:15,600
surprised i can't see a tight turn i

1690
01:41:15,600 --> 01:41:17,119
would be really surprised yeah we would

1691
01:41:17,119 --> 01:41:19,280
have to go down to like you know

1692
01:41:19,280 --> 01:41:21,600
uh recording

1693
01:41:21,600 --> 01:41:23,199
yeah and so exactly we're seeing uh

1694
01:41:23,199 --> 01:41:25,840
phone dbg uh instead of

1695
01:41:25,840 --> 01:41:27,199
yeah these what is your preference on

1696
01:41:27,199 --> 01:41:28,960
debugging libraries have you like guest

1697
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:30,000
versus

1698
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,560
so i used to be a uh

1699
01:41:32,560 --> 01:41:34,880
uh pawn debug uh user but i have

1700
01:41:34,880 --> 01:41:36,400
switched to

1701
01:41:36,400 --> 01:41:37,760
jeff yeah

1702
01:41:37,760 --> 01:41:40,159
uh i mean long time ago i was a

1703
01:41:40,159 --> 01:41:44,320
peda uh user yeah um but then uh

1704
01:41:44,320 --> 01:41:46,400
that kind of just stopped developing for

1705
01:41:46,400 --> 01:41:48,480
a bit or something anyway i switched to

1706
01:41:48,480 --> 01:41:50,480
pond debug then i went to jeff

1707
01:41:50,480 --> 01:41:51,520
um

1708
01:41:51,520 --> 01:41:53,520
yeah it's my current preference so you

1709
01:41:53,520 --> 01:41:56,480
can you can see i think just over uh the

1710
01:41:56,480 --> 01:41:58,480
shoulder here uh some of the some of the

1711
01:41:58,480 --> 01:42:00,239
players so the the people in chat that

1712
01:42:00,239 --> 01:42:01,920
are wondering kind of depends on where

1713
01:42:01,920 --> 01:42:04,239
we lean if we're like yeah we're letting

1714
01:42:04,239 --> 01:42:06,000
him in but we're also trying to kind of

1715
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,239
we have to block off uh the their

1716
01:42:08,239 --> 01:42:10,080
opponent's screen here right so because

1717
01:42:10,080 --> 01:42:11,520
we have well at least one of the one of

1718
01:42:11,520 --> 01:42:14,239
the teams now uh visible on our little

1719
01:42:14,239 --> 01:42:15,760
monitors in front of us

1720
01:42:15,760 --> 01:42:17,840
um and we've intentionally kind of like

1721
01:42:17,840 --> 01:42:19,360
laid it out so that you can't see your

1722
01:42:19,360 --> 01:42:21,920
opponent's you know uh monitor over here

1723
01:42:21,920 --> 01:42:23,520
that we're using to to see them so we

1724
01:42:23,520 --> 01:42:25,199
kind of got them angled down a little

1725
01:42:25,199 --> 01:42:26,400
bit lower

1726
01:42:26,400 --> 01:42:27,679
um

1727
01:42:27,679 --> 01:42:28,960
yeah honestly they're all better than

1728
01:42:28,960 --> 01:42:30,960
like stock gdb although like you know

1729
01:42:30,960 --> 01:42:33,760
tui is not the worst thing it's it's at

1730
01:42:33,760 --> 01:42:35,840
least better i feel like

1731
01:42:35,840 --> 01:42:36,880
um

1732
01:42:36,880 --> 01:42:38,800
than than like you know stock command

1733
01:42:38,800 --> 01:42:40,400
line

1734
01:42:40,400 --> 01:42:42,880
yeah i used to roll with like you know

1735
01:42:42,880 --> 01:42:44,560
display slash whatever and like build up

1736
01:42:44,560 --> 01:42:46,719
my own little kind of custom props but

1737
01:42:46,719 --> 01:42:47,840
i don't think i never really learned

1738
01:42:47,840 --> 01:42:49,760
that i i went like directly from the

1739
01:42:49,760 --> 01:42:51,760
vanilla honestly that's the right choice

1740
01:42:51,760 --> 01:42:54,080
yeah to a real tool jeff or yeah yeah

1741
01:42:54,080 --> 01:42:56,560
one of those okay so we're back in ida

1742
01:42:56,560 --> 01:42:57,600
and it's interesting too because we

1743
01:42:57,600 --> 01:43:00,239
started in in x-rays in the decompiler

1744
01:43:00,239 --> 01:43:01,760
uh and now we're just looking at actual

1745
01:43:01,760 --> 01:43:04,159
offsets here right so we've got

1746
01:43:04,159 --> 01:43:05,040
um

1747
01:43:05,040 --> 01:43:06,960
so some kind of uh overflow situation

1748
01:43:06,960 --> 01:43:08,800
here going on oh okay yeah we've already

1749
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:11,760
so we already see somebody writing d's

1750
01:43:11,760 --> 01:43:15,600
uh which were if we go back to that uh

1751
01:43:15,600 --> 01:43:17,920
uh oh man

1752
01:43:17,920 --> 01:43:19,280
all right you know what we might do i

1753
01:43:19,280 --> 01:43:21,360
might actually have if you go

1754
01:43:21,360 --> 01:43:22,880
look over the shoulder and just to give

1755
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:24,320
us an update come back and give us an

1756
01:43:24,320 --> 01:43:26,480
update and see how uh

1757
01:43:26,480 --> 01:43:29,440
on the starbucks side and let us

1758
01:43:29,440 --> 01:43:31,840
if i'm doing this right yeah so yeah

1759
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:33,600
we'll um

1760
01:43:33,600 --> 01:43:34,880
we'll go yeah you go check it out yeah

1761
01:43:34,880 --> 01:43:35,760
i'll go check it out and then you can

1762
01:43:35,760 --> 01:43:36,960
come back and give us a report and let

1763
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:38,320
us know what kind of looks like where

1764
01:43:38,320 --> 01:43:41,920
we're at so apologies for this um

1765
01:43:41,920 --> 01:43:43,440
this is going to be a wild and crazy

1766
01:43:43,440 --> 01:43:46,000
weekend we're going to have a lot of uh

1767
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:47,520
a lot of stuff so hopefully this is the

1768
01:43:47,520 --> 01:43:49,600
the only real issue is we've got to

1769
01:43:49,600 --> 01:43:51,040
figure out our

1770
01:43:51,040 --> 01:43:53,199
wire capture card is is freaking out we

1771
01:43:53,199 --> 01:43:54,400
actually do have another capture card

1772
01:43:54,400 --> 01:43:56,239
we'll we'll we'll bring in

1773
01:43:56,239 --> 01:43:58,159
uh and we'll get working in the break so

1774
01:43:58,159 --> 01:43:59,280
hopefully

1775
01:43:59,280 --> 01:44:00,719
especially if this is a really fast

1776
01:44:00,719 --> 01:44:03,119
match uh that'll be really easy

1777
01:44:03,119 --> 01:44:05,199
uh we will we'll bring this in okay so

1778
01:44:05,199 --> 01:44:06,800
yeah there we go we can see the uh the

1779
01:44:06,800 --> 01:44:08,080
switch statement

1780
01:44:08,080 --> 01:44:10,239
um with the different options question a

1781
01:44:10,239 --> 01:44:12,560
d s w

1782
01:44:12,560 --> 01:44:15,199
and we notice that there's some uh yup

1783
01:44:15,199 --> 01:44:17,040
exactly so there's

1784
01:44:17,040 --> 01:44:18,880
uh that comparison there right was

1785
01:44:18,880 --> 01:44:21,119
checking to zero at checking 128.

1786
01:44:21,119 --> 01:44:22,800
but you'll notice i think this is

1787
01:44:22,800 --> 01:44:24,800
actually why earlier

1788
01:44:24,800 --> 01:44:26,719
we saw a ptr

1789
01:44:26,719 --> 01:44:29,520
looking uh looking at the disassembly is

1790
01:44:29,520 --> 01:44:30,800
because in

1791
01:44:30,800 --> 01:44:32,639
x-rays you don't always see the signs is

1792
01:44:32,639 --> 01:44:34,400
the comparison signed or unsigned

1793
01:44:34,400 --> 01:44:36,960
right and so i i suspect that's what we

1794
01:44:36,960 --> 01:44:38,320
were seeing before

1795
01:44:38,320 --> 01:44:40,639
is uh the switch over to disassembly was

1796
01:44:40,639 --> 01:44:42,159
saying well wait a minute is this

1797
01:44:42,159 --> 01:44:43,840
comparison sign comparison or unsigned

1798
01:44:43,840 --> 01:44:46,840
because i think you can mouse over

1799
01:44:46,840 --> 01:44:50,000
the tooltip the the comparison uh

1800
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,159
operator and it will say if i don't uh

1801
01:44:52,159 --> 01:44:55,119
misremember yeah but yes it's still like

1802
01:44:55,119 --> 01:44:57,040
to get the exact details you might have

1803
01:44:57,040 --> 01:44:58,960
to go down to this i mean you could use

1804
01:44:58,960 --> 01:45:00,880
binary ninja oh right and in high level

1805
01:45:00,880 --> 01:45:02,800
il where it just it tells you signed a

1806
01:45:02,800 --> 01:45:05,280
run side comparison but i promise okay

1807
01:45:05,280 --> 01:45:06,639
okay i'll be good

1808
01:45:06,639 --> 01:45:08,960
i'll be good uh i won't do that and i

1809
01:45:08,960 --> 01:45:11,040
will say me with binder ninja would not

1810
01:45:11,040 --> 01:45:13,199
beat these these folks with with idot

1811
01:45:13,199 --> 01:45:15,119
right so like i'm not claiming that uh

1812
01:45:15,119 --> 01:45:16,960
yeah it would make me uh infinitely

1813
01:45:16,960 --> 01:45:18,960
better so to give a bit of an update

1814
01:45:18,960 --> 01:45:21,280
then on starbucks uh it's actually

1815
01:45:21,280 --> 01:45:24,480
very similar to the situation for uh the

1816
01:45:24,480 --> 01:45:26,639
what how do you choose to promote a home

1817
01:45:26,639 --> 01:45:29,119
homer like yeah homer bin

1818
01:45:29,119 --> 01:45:31,520
that's now what we call these uh i've

1819
01:45:31,520 --> 01:45:32,880
been saying slash

1820
01:45:32,880 --> 01:45:35,520
slash slash okay yes how are we how do

1821
01:45:35,520 --> 01:45:38,159
we do it yep yes uh anyway so the uh

1822
01:45:38,159 --> 01:45:40,000
starbucks uh they were in a similar

1823
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,320
situation uh they have like

1824
01:45:42,320 --> 01:45:44,000
done some analysis they started out a

1825
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:45,840
small exploit script

1826
01:45:45,840 --> 01:45:46,960
not

1827
01:45:46,960 --> 01:45:49,040
quite as fleshed out yet as as the one

1828
01:45:49,040 --> 01:45:51,440
like they're you know a bit shorter uh

1829
01:45:51,440 --> 01:45:53,040
doing some debugging looking at uh like

1830
01:45:53,040 --> 01:45:54,639
registry values just making sure that

1831
01:45:54,639 --> 01:45:55,920
they're completely understanding what's

1832
01:45:55,920 --> 01:45:57,679
going on so they're i would say at this

1833
01:45:57,679 --> 01:45:59,040
point it seemed like they're fairly

1834
01:45:59,040 --> 01:46:01,679
similar progress uh between the players

1835
01:46:01,679 --> 01:46:04,960
um i i will say at least looking so i

1836
01:46:04,960 --> 01:46:06,719
actually have not seen like an official

1837
01:46:06,719 --> 01:46:08,239
solution for this one yet so some of the

1838
01:46:08,239 --> 01:46:09,600
challenges

1839
01:46:09,600 --> 01:46:11,040
we wrote some of them other of our

1840
01:46:11,040 --> 01:46:12,560
teammates wrote some of them we know the

1841
01:46:12,560 --> 01:46:13,840
exploits and we tested them and some of

1842
01:46:13,840 --> 01:46:15,280
them we don't

1843
01:46:15,280 --> 01:46:16,960
just knowing kind of generally what's

1844
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:18,960
what's going on here uh and looking at

1845
01:46:18,960 --> 01:46:20,400
those comparisons

1846
01:46:20,400 --> 01:46:22,239
uh i'm wondering where are i mean we're

1847
01:46:22,239 --> 01:46:24,400
already this looks like intention

1848
01:46:24,400 --> 01:46:26,000
right it looks like we're seeing like i

1849
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:27,600
have an idea of what we're doing we've

1850
01:46:27,600 --> 01:46:29,440
already contacted like yeah like this

1851
01:46:29,440 --> 01:46:31,600
looks like really good progress

1852
01:46:31,600 --> 01:46:33,520
only several minutes in like if you'd

1853
01:46:33,520 --> 01:46:34,960
asked me now do we need a hint i'm going

1854
01:46:34,960 --> 01:46:36,719
to say like doesn't look like it like

1855
01:46:36,719 --> 01:46:39,440
you never really know yeah um but

1856
01:46:39,440 --> 01:46:41,600
you can see here they're doing a leak uh

1857
01:46:41,600 --> 01:46:43,520
you see this uh line starting with like

1858
01:46:43,520 --> 01:46:46,480
glib c bass uh if it's readable so they

1859
01:46:46,480 --> 01:46:48,480
are reading eight bytes out from the

1860
01:46:48,480 --> 01:46:50,080
program and then they're subtracting the

1861
01:46:50,080 --> 01:46:52,000
offset of the putchar

1862
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,239
address and then unlike a bit more as

1863
01:46:54,239 --> 01:46:56,400
well so from this they're calculating

1864
01:46:56,400 --> 01:46:59,840
the the base address of the deliverances

1865
01:46:59,840 --> 01:47:01,600
of the libsy

1866
01:47:01,600 --> 01:47:05,119
library uh which then can be used to

1867
01:47:05,119 --> 01:47:06,400
calculate the addresses of other

1868
01:47:06,400 --> 01:47:08,719
functions you might want such as system

1869
01:47:08,719 --> 01:47:11,199
uh which is maybe like the go to usually

1870
01:47:11,199 --> 01:47:13,040
usually the choice right and so like you

1871
01:47:13,040 --> 01:47:14,239
know before

1872
01:47:14,239 --> 01:47:16,159
uh we were talking about exec ve for the

1873
01:47:16,159 --> 01:47:17,679
syscall challenge the last one and

1874
01:47:17,679 --> 01:47:19,360
that's just gonna be the raw assist call

1875
01:47:19,360 --> 01:47:20,719
uh system's even better though right

1876
01:47:20,719 --> 01:47:21,520
like what's you know what's the

1877
01:47:21,520 --> 01:47:22,400
advantage of the system over in

1878
01:47:22,400 --> 01:47:24,560
executive e i mean just so for the

1879
01:47:24,560 --> 01:47:26,000
system you just give it like you give it

1880
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:27,760
one string argument which is like the

1881
01:47:27,760 --> 01:47:29,520
the thing you want to execute uh and

1882
01:47:29,520 --> 01:47:31,040
that's it you don't need to care about

1883
01:47:31,040 --> 01:47:32,960
like uh splitting up like the command

1884
01:47:32,960 --> 01:47:35,040
line arguments into like an array or all

1885
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:37,520
that stuff it's just like i wonder if

1886
01:47:37,520 --> 01:47:39,679
we'll see somebody's system straight to

1887
01:47:39,679 --> 01:47:40,880
the payload or if they're going to get a

1888
01:47:40,880 --> 01:47:42,560
shell first and then run for the payload

1889
01:47:42,560 --> 01:47:43,920
like they could kind of go either way

1890
01:47:43,920 --> 01:47:45,600
yeah i mean personally

1891
01:47:45,600 --> 01:47:47,440
even though this is again like do you

1892
01:47:47,440 --> 01:47:48,840
take it like slow and

1893
01:47:48,840 --> 01:47:50,159
methodically yeah and be able to debug

1894
01:47:50,159 --> 01:47:52,320
it along the way yeah so i would just go

1895
01:47:52,320 --> 01:47:53,600
for the shell

1896
01:47:53,600 --> 01:47:55,440
uh because then the same solution also

1897
01:47:55,440 --> 01:47:57,520
works out of the box locally as well as

1898
01:47:57,520 --> 01:47:58,800
remotely otherwise they would that's

1899
01:47:58,800 --> 01:48:00,239
true well if you you get an error

1900
01:48:00,239 --> 01:48:01,199
message it would say fall on the

1901
01:48:01,199 --> 01:48:03,040
foundation

1902
01:48:03,040 --> 01:48:04,639
i would still feel more comfortable

1903
01:48:04,639 --> 01:48:07,119
doing like launching a shell and then

1904
01:48:07,119 --> 01:48:08,639
going with that i you know i think

1905
01:48:08,639 --> 01:48:10,080
that's interesting because again though

1906
01:48:10,080 --> 01:48:11,199
last round

1907
01:48:11,199 --> 01:48:13,040
literally seconds mattered if one team

1908
01:48:13,040 --> 01:48:14,400
went one way and one with the other and

1909
01:48:14,400 --> 01:48:16,400
they were that close yes the team that

1910
01:48:16,400 --> 01:48:18,800
threw the the straight to the the

1911
01:48:18,800 --> 01:48:20,880
submitter yes would win so that's

1912
01:48:20,880 --> 01:48:21,840
correct

1913
01:48:21,840 --> 01:48:24,400
we will see um we'll see i i don't

1914
01:48:24,400 --> 01:48:26,800
expect it to match uh i don't expect it

1915
01:48:26,800 --> 01:48:28,639
to be that close this time there is like

1916
01:48:28,639 --> 01:48:30,000
a small

1917
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,639
catch to that though because they don't

1918
01:48:32,639 --> 01:48:34,480
know the like you need to add an

1919
01:48:34,480 --> 01:48:36,159
absolute address for

1920
01:48:36,159 --> 01:48:38,560
xsec right or

1921
01:48:38,560 --> 01:48:40,719
a exec ve does have to have the full

1922
01:48:40,719 --> 01:48:42,320
path exactly and they don't know the

1923
01:48:42,320 --> 01:48:43,119
current

1924
01:48:43,119 --> 01:48:44,719
where the current working directory so

1925
01:48:44,719 --> 01:48:46,400
they don't know the full path of the

1926
01:48:46,400 --> 01:48:47,679
submitter right but if they're calling

1927
01:48:47,679 --> 01:48:48,800
system in this case if they're just

1928
01:48:48,800 --> 01:48:50,239
finding systems right exactly but i'm

1929
01:48:50,239 --> 01:48:51,920
just that oh no no yeah true true you're

1930
01:48:51,920 --> 01:48:53,199
correct yes right like on this one

1931
01:48:53,199 --> 01:48:54,800
you're right last round yeah they could

1932
01:48:54,800 --> 01:48:55,840
not have done that they could have not

1933
01:48:55,840 --> 01:48:57,360
done that nearly as easily right but

1934
01:48:57,360 --> 01:48:59,440
whereas this one yes uh yeah because

1935
01:48:59,440 --> 01:49:00,960
because the relative path thing only

1936
01:49:00,960 --> 01:49:02,560
works because of your shell essentially

1937
01:49:02,560 --> 01:49:04,159
which if you're going to call system

1938
01:49:04,159 --> 01:49:06,239
it's going to run the shell for you okay

1939
01:49:06,239 --> 01:49:07,920
and and thank you for the for the the

1940
01:49:07,920 --> 01:49:09,440
the kind words appreciate it grandma

1941
01:49:09,440 --> 01:49:11,520
bullet uh you guys in chat we're

1942
01:49:11,520 --> 01:49:13,440
definitely keeping an eye on it and

1943
01:49:13,440 --> 01:49:15,679
happy if you guys have questions and i

1944
01:49:15,679 --> 01:49:17,679
expect y'all will be seeing stuff that

1945
01:49:17,679 --> 01:49:18,960
we miss because we're kind of trying to

1946
01:49:18,960 --> 01:49:20,000
like juggle around and look a lot of

1947
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:21,040
different things

1948
01:49:21,040 --> 01:49:22,320
in fact i even talked to one of the

1949
01:49:22,320 --> 01:49:23,679
competitors and

1950
01:49:23,679 --> 01:49:25,440
in the room watching the stream in the

1951
01:49:25,440 --> 01:49:26,880
last round

1952
01:49:26,880 --> 01:49:28,080
and he was like why didn't they use the

1953
01:49:28,080 --> 01:49:29,440
brakes this call why didn't they they

1954
01:49:29,440 --> 01:49:30,800
were all watching like you know they're

1955
01:49:30,800 --> 01:49:33,040
doing the regular ctf but they were also

1956
01:49:33,040 --> 01:49:34,800
you know checking out the competition

1957
01:49:34,800 --> 01:49:35,920
seeing what the challenges are looking

1958
01:49:35,920 --> 01:49:38,480
like wisely preparing for future rounds

1959
01:49:38,480 --> 01:49:40,080
uh and they were they were you know

1960
01:49:40,080 --> 01:49:42,000
commenting on better approaches so i

1961
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,159
imagine we'll have people in chat here

1962
01:49:44,159 --> 01:49:46,560
uh that have feedback and have ideas on

1963
01:49:46,560 --> 01:49:48,239
things that they can do i mean you also

1964
01:49:48,239 --> 01:49:50,400
should keep in mind that like this is

1965
01:49:50,400 --> 01:49:53,040
this is not your average uh ctf

1966
01:49:53,040 --> 01:49:55,520
environment do we have it back ah it's

1967
01:49:55,520 --> 01:49:57,599
teasing us no yeah it's teasing us

1968
01:49:57,599 --> 01:49:59,040
unfortunately this is not your average

1969
01:49:59,040 --> 01:50:01,199
ctf environment right this is much more

1970
01:50:01,199 --> 01:50:03,599
stressful for the players uh

1971
01:50:03,599 --> 01:50:06,320
like uh most of them are not used to

1972
01:50:06,320 --> 01:50:08,000
like you know live stream when they're

1973
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:09,679
yeah and even if you are even if you've

1974
01:50:09,679 --> 01:50:11,599
done a lot of streaming yeah it still is

1975
01:50:11,599 --> 01:50:14,239
harder it's just 100 always harder

1976
01:50:14,239 --> 01:50:15,520
there's people watching you're thinking

1977
01:50:15,520 --> 01:50:17,440
oh did i clean up my desktop do i need

1978
01:50:17,440 --> 01:50:19,440
to like right is this my vm setup or you

1979
01:50:19,440 --> 01:50:20,719
know there's just a lot more on your

1980
01:50:20,719 --> 01:50:22,000
mind and it's also kind of like an all

1981
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:23,280
or nothing situation right and the

1982
01:50:23,280 --> 01:50:26,080
normal ctf usually uh

1983
01:50:26,080 --> 01:50:27,760
because we kind of moved away from the

1984
01:50:27,760 --> 01:50:29,920
tradition of uh first blood points this

1985
01:50:29,920 --> 01:50:31,920
is true nowadays it's all about total

1986
01:50:31,920 --> 01:50:33,679
score total numbers it doesn't matter

1987
01:50:33,679 --> 01:50:35,040
when it doesn't matter if you solve the

1988
01:50:35,040 --> 01:50:36,400
challenge like five minutes into the

1989
01:50:36,400 --> 01:50:37,679
competition or five when it's five

1990
01:50:37,679 --> 01:50:39,679
minutes left of the competition right uh

1991
01:50:39,679 --> 01:50:42,400
here it's it's everything like either

1992
01:50:42,400 --> 01:50:43,280
you

1993
01:50:43,280 --> 01:50:45,679
win or you don't uh we're we might be

1994
01:50:45,679 --> 01:50:47,440
getting pretty close here because i am

1995
01:50:47,440 --> 01:50:49,119
seeing

1996
01:50:49,119 --> 01:50:51,280
uh i did see it looked like we had maybe

1997
01:50:51,280 --> 01:50:53,119
even had a system leak or we're close to

1998
01:50:53,119 --> 01:50:54,800
a system leak

1999
01:50:54,800 --> 01:50:56,960
uh so let's watch so we're looking at

2000
01:50:56,960 --> 01:50:59,760
system provider

2001
01:50:59,760 --> 01:51:01,119
so they've we've already got a

2002
01:51:01,119 --> 01:51:03,040
convenient call again there's a call to

2003
01:51:03,040 --> 01:51:05,119
system already in the binary oh and

2004
01:51:05,119 --> 01:51:07,760
starbug is

2005
01:51:07,760 --> 01:51:09,040
yeah yeah yeah why don't we go ahead and

2006
01:51:09,040 --> 01:51:11,040
do another check carl on starbug yeah

2007
01:51:11,040 --> 01:51:14,239
i'm gonna go with them

2008
01:51:14,239 --> 01:51:17,440
uh no we don't actually worry about uh

2009
01:51:17,440 --> 01:51:19,280
past people learning things for new ones

2010
01:51:19,280 --> 01:51:20,639
because again the challenges are totally

2011
01:51:20,639 --> 01:51:22,480
different every match is a different

2012
01:51:22,480 --> 01:51:23,520
challenge

2013
01:51:23,520 --> 01:51:25,280
uh exactly so we so we don't have to

2014
01:51:25,280 --> 01:51:27,440
worry about that uh the general setup

2015
01:51:27,440 --> 01:51:29,040
well the way that we would compensate by

2016
01:51:29,040 --> 01:51:30,960
that is i will say

2017
01:51:30,960 --> 01:51:33,440
we specifically put all the easiest

2018
01:51:33,440 --> 01:51:36,400
things that we knew were easiest first

2019
01:51:36,400 --> 01:51:38,080
just because we wanted to be guaranteed

2020
01:51:38,080 --> 01:51:40,320
that they would get solved in time so

2021
01:51:40,320 --> 01:51:41,599
the teams they go first had less

2022
01:51:41,599 --> 01:51:43,119
information they knew less about the

2023
01:51:43,119 --> 01:51:44,480
environment and what was going to happen

2024
01:51:44,480 --> 01:51:45,599
and maybe

2025
01:51:45,599 --> 01:51:47,599
but it i don't know it depends on the

2026
01:51:47,599 --> 01:51:49,040
player i think for some people going

2027
01:51:49,040 --> 01:51:51,199
first is actually significantly better

2028
01:51:51,199 --> 01:51:52,320
you just get it out of the way and

2029
01:51:52,320 --> 01:51:54,239
you're kind of your nerves are over and

2030
01:51:54,239 --> 01:51:55,440
some people though they really want to

2031
01:51:55,440 --> 01:51:57,440
like see what's happening and know so

2032
01:51:57,440 --> 01:51:59,040
it's hard to say it was totally a random

2033
01:51:59,040 --> 01:52:00,560
selection in terms of which round

2034
01:52:00,560 --> 01:52:03,360
happened when so we'll see what it is

2035
01:52:03,360 --> 01:52:05,280
and yes everyone not only has to use a

2036
01:52:05,280 --> 01:52:07,599
laptop so one of the differences uh is

2037
01:52:07,599 --> 01:52:09,040
that they're not only using a laptop but

2038
01:52:09,040 --> 01:52:12,080
we plug in our video capture cards and

2039
01:52:12,080 --> 01:52:15,040
those cards force a specific aspect

2040
01:52:15,040 --> 01:52:16,320
ratio so the font sizes can be a little

2041
01:52:16,320 --> 01:52:18,800
bit off so we are handicapping them

2042
01:52:18,800 --> 01:52:20,719
unintentionally uh a little bit that way

2043
01:52:20,719 --> 01:52:22,560
as well too so how's it how's it going

2044
01:52:22,560 --> 01:52:25,599
with starbucks yeah so uh they have some

2045
01:52:25,599 --> 01:52:26,880
good progress i saw them looking at the

2046
01:52:26,880 --> 01:52:28,880
debugger i think they were looking at

2047
01:52:28,880 --> 01:52:31,840
like uh the got

2048
01:52:31,840 --> 01:52:33,520
so maybe a similar approach there with

2049
01:52:33,520 --> 01:52:35,920
like overwriting or leaking

2050
01:52:35,920 --> 01:52:37,520
uh addresses

2051
01:52:37,520 --> 01:52:39,920
um

2052
01:52:40,159 --> 01:52:41,840
i mean very fast to find the bug i think

2053
01:52:41,840 --> 01:52:44,400
both teams right pretty i mean again

2054
01:52:44,400 --> 01:52:46,639
this is meant to be an easy bug to find

2055
01:52:46,639 --> 01:52:48,400
it's even just wiring it all up putting

2056
01:52:48,400 --> 01:52:49,760
it all together building building the

2057
01:52:49,760 --> 01:52:51,599
payload yes avoiding all the mistakes

2058
01:52:51,599 --> 01:52:53,620
like yeah when you do these things like

2059
01:52:53,620 --> 01:52:54,880
[Music]

2060
01:52:54,880 --> 01:52:56,880
it's very unforgiving like the smallest

2061
01:52:56,880 --> 01:52:58,400
little like you you like you're off by

2062
01:52:58,400 --> 01:53:00,320
one somewhere and things just don't work

2063
01:53:00,320 --> 01:53:02,480
and like it will it won't give you like

2064
01:53:02,480 --> 01:53:04,159
any meaningful error messages or

2065
01:53:04,159 --> 01:53:05,440
something that's like

2066
01:53:05,440 --> 01:53:06,719
you know as you would get when you're

2067
01:53:06,719 --> 01:53:08,239
developing normal

2068
01:53:08,239 --> 01:53:09,920
uh software i love that we're getting

2069
01:53:09,920 --> 01:53:11,199
we're getting debug information so we've

2070
01:53:11,199 --> 01:53:12,639
got a logger info you know they're

2071
01:53:12,639 --> 01:53:14,320
actually printing out their variables

2072
01:53:14,320 --> 01:53:15,199
and stuff

2073
01:53:15,199 --> 01:53:18,239
thank you as a as a caster and as a

2074
01:53:18,239 --> 01:53:20,400
commentator it does make it easy when we

2075
01:53:20,400 --> 01:53:22,320
can uh you know see what your your

2076
01:53:22,320 --> 01:53:23,760
intentions are kind of and kind of what

2077
01:53:23,760 --> 01:53:25,920
you're doing i i also do like when i

2078
01:53:25,920 --> 01:53:28,000
write my exploit scripts i'm

2079
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,639
i'm definitely more like on the cautious

2080
01:53:30,639 --> 01:53:33,199
and structured site like i name all my

2081
01:53:33,199 --> 01:53:35,199
variables properly i have like logging

2082
01:53:35,199 --> 01:53:37,360
statements you put type type hints do

2083
01:53:37,360 --> 01:53:39,119
you actually put python three types is

2084
01:53:39,119 --> 01:53:40,960
there you that level of

2085
01:53:40,960 --> 01:53:43,360
no it's that's a that's a bridge too far

2086
01:53:43,360 --> 01:53:46,320
for ctf but this happened but no no

2087
01:53:46,320 --> 01:53:48,320
generally not well as i am the opposite

2088
01:53:48,320 --> 01:53:50,320
i think by by nature i was always quick

2089
01:53:50,320 --> 01:53:52,080
and dirty and i mean i wrote a lot of

2090
01:53:52,080 --> 01:53:53,440
exploits with bash like i would

2091
01:53:53,440 --> 01:53:54,639
literally just shove raw bites in the

2092
01:53:54,639 --> 01:53:56,000
bash and like

2093
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:57,599
if it works it's faster but when it

2094
01:53:57,599 --> 01:54:00,000
fails it fails miserably yes because

2095
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,800
you're way behind when it fails

2096
01:54:02,800 --> 01:54:05,119
you have not it fails and you have not

2097
01:54:05,119 --> 01:54:07,040
gained any ground like you're like it

2098
01:54:07,040 --> 01:54:08,960
fails and you're kind of like still it's

2099
01:54:08,960 --> 01:54:10,480
zero well

2100
01:54:10,480 --> 01:54:12,480
the slow methodical like it can fail but

2101
01:54:12,480 --> 01:54:14,000
it's like a very local and it's easier

2102
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:15,360
to measure progress potentially you can

2103
01:54:15,360 --> 01:54:16,400
instrument a little bit better and see

2104
01:54:16,400 --> 01:54:18,320
kind of where you're at yes but then it

2105
01:54:18,320 --> 01:54:20,960
comes at this additional cost

2106
01:54:20,960 --> 01:54:22,480
so

2107
01:54:22,480 --> 01:54:25,119
i'm trying to see what they're doing so

2108
01:54:25,119 --> 01:54:26,560
there's question here every team sends

2109
01:54:26,560 --> 01:54:28,880
only one player yes correct so for each

2110
01:54:28,880 --> 01:54:30,960
match that the team chooses so they will

2111
01:54:30,960 --> 01:54:32,320
get to know

2112
01:54:32,320 --> 01:54:34,159
uh what type of challenge it is so we

2113
01:54:34,159 --> 01:54:36,800
might say like this is an x86 uh 64-bit

2114
01:54:36,800 --> 01:54:38,159
punable challenge

2115
01:54:38,159 --> 01:54:39,280
and

2116
01:54:39,280 --> 01:54:41,920
they choose a player to send uh they do

2117
01:54:41,920 --> 01:54:43,760
not have to pick the same player if they

2118
01:54:43,760 --> 01:54:44,960
win the match and advance them next

2119
01:54:44,960 --> 01:54:46,480
round they can swap out for another

2120
01:54:46,480 --> 01:54:47,360
player

2121
01:54:47,360 --> 01:54:49,280
but for one for if we for example

2122
01:54:49,280 --> 01:54:50,880
switched up the architecture or made it

2123
01:54:50,880 --> 01:54:53,040
reverse engineering versus ponable or

2124
01:54:53,040 --> 01:54:54,800
you know whatever other things we did uh

2125
01:54:54,800 --> 01:54:56,400
they have a chance to swap it out so

2126
01:54:56,400 --> 01:54:57,599
it's supposed to be

2127
01:54:57,599 --> 01:55:00,400
the best person from that team for that

2128
01:55:00,400 --> 01:55:03,040
style of challenge and for

2129
01:55:03,040 --> 01:55:04,560
the stress of being on camera because

2130
01:55:04,560 --> 01:55:06,480
some people are are maybe better

2131
01:55:06,480 --> 01:55:08,800
exploiters but really nervous about

2132
01:55:08,800 --> 01:55:10,320
sitting in a room which is it's a

2133
01:55:10,320 --> 01:55:12,880
totally different experience yeah

2134
01:55:12,880 --> 01:55:14,719
and they are not allowed to get help

2135
01:55:14,719 --> 01:55:16,239
from uh

2136
01:55:16,239 --> 01:55:17,679
their teammates

2137
01:55:17,679 --> 01:55:19,040
yep they could but they can look on the

2138
01:55:19,040 --> 01:55:20,880
internet they can have

2139
01:55:20,880 --> 01:55:22,080
all these resources although i think

2140
01:55:22,080 --> 01:55:24,000
we've seen either one of these they just

2141
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:25,119
they knew what they were doing they went

2142
01:55:25,119 --> 01:55:26,400
straight in they found the bug they

2143
01:55:26,400 --> 01:55:27,840
reverse engineered it and they they're

2144
01:55:27,840 --> 01:55:29,440
writing their exploits uh but for

2145
01:55:29,440 --> 01:55:30,560
example the last one was a little bit

2146
01:55:30,560 --> 01:55:31,599
different when they were building

2147
01:55:31,599 --> 01:55:33,760
syscall payloads and so we did see both

2148
01:55:33,760 --> 01:55:35,040
of them looking up you know list of

2149
01:55:35,040 --> 01:55:37,440
syscalls and the parameters yeah so if

2150
01:55:37,440 --> 01:55:39,040
we have another look here and see uh

2151
01:55:39,040 --> 01:55:40,719
what they're doing uh you see they're

2152
01:55:40,719 --> 01:55:42,480
trying to exploit script

2153
01:55:42,480 --> 01:55:43,920
uh doing some debugging here you know

2154
01:55:43,920 --> 01:55:45,440
they're checking the output of the

2155
01:55:45,440 --> 01:55:47,360
script uh comparing it to the debugger

2156
01:55:47,360 --> 01:55:48,960
itself to see if the address is lined up

2157
01:55:48,960 --> 01:55:50,480
sure like you have your offsets and your

2158
01:55:50,480 --> 01:55:52,719
links uh correct

2159
01:55:52,719 --> 01:55:53,840
um

2160
01:55:53,840 --> 01:55:56,239
so it's all good again i'm not super

2161
01:55:56,239 --> 01:55:58,719
familiar i think there's like a some

2162
01:55:58,719 --> 01:56:01,520
kind of integer over underflow uh

2163
01:56:01,520 --> 01:56:04,800
business going on in this uh challenge

2164
01:56:04,800 --> 01:56:07,280
um actually i'm curious if uh the

2165
01:56:07,280 --> 01:56:08,960
challenge author who was in chat last

2166
01:56:08,960 --> 01:56:10,880
time is in now

2167
01:56:10,880 --> 01:56:13,920
um feel free to drop hints uh just for

2168
01:56:13,920 --> 01:56:15,280
our youtube chat

2169
01:56:15,280 --> 01:56:17,679
uh and uh we'll uh

2170
01:56:17,679 --> 01:56:19,679
we'll see if um

2171
01:56:19,679 --> 01:56:22,320
we'll see if negasaurus still around

2172
01:56:22,320 --> 01:56:23,840
so

2173
01:56:23,840 --> 01:56:26,400
okay so we've got it looks like an uh a

2174
01:56:26,400 --> 01:56:28,000
right payload a right primitive because

2175
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:30,159
we've got a target for an overwrite

2176
01:56:30,159 --> 01:56:32,080
yeah oh they're not going to take one

2177
01:56:32,080 --> 01:56:33,440
looking for one gadget they want to

2178
01:56:33,440 --> 01:56:35,520
figure out is there one now

2179
01:56:35,520 --> 01:56:36,880
so to explain a little bit here one

2180
01:56:36,880 --> 01:56:40,080
gadget is uh it's both like a concept

2181
01:56:40,080 --> 01:56:44,320
and a tool so uh it turns out that uh

2182
01:56:44,320 --> 01:56:46,639
in various places in libsy

2183
01:56:46,639 --> 01:56:49,599
if you jump to that address you will uh

2184
01:56:49,599 --> 01:56:51,360
execute the shell just get a shell like

2185
01:56:51,360 --> 01:56:52,480
it's going to call a system with bin

2186
01:56:52,480 --> 01:56:55,520
bins h or b so uh some

2187
01:56:55,520 --> 01:56:57,199
person or people have created this tool

2188
01:56:57,199 --> 01:56:59,840
which will take a lib c uh version and

2189
01:56:59,840 --> 01:57:02,480
list what these addresses are some of

2190
01:57:02,480 --> 01:57:04,239
them have like conditions like oh this

2191
01:57:04,239 --> 01:57:07,199
register cannot be not a zero or you

2192
01:57:07,199 --> 01:57:09,840
know several years ago like 1804 ubuntu

2193
01:57:09,840 --> 01:57:11,360
or standard installs that was less

2194
01:57:11,360 --> 01:57:13,520
common it would just tend to just work

2195
01:57:13,520 --> 01:57:15,119
unconditionally there was just addresses

2196
01:57:15,119 --> 01:57:16,400
that were that was why it was called one

2197
01:57:16,400 --> 01:57:18,560
gadget because there was only one place

2198
01:57:18,560 --> 01:57:20,719
you go you jumped there all you needed

2199
01:57:20,719 --> 01:57:22,000
was control of instruction pointer and

2200
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:24,000
that would be all you got right now

2201
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:25,280
we're actually looking for roppers so

2202
01:57:25,280 --> 01:57:27,199
we're actually looking for rop

2203
01:57:27,199 --> 01:57:30,080
uh gadgets uh to see how those work i'm

2204
01:57:30,080 --> 01:57:31,280
actually gonna go check in on starbug i

2205
01:57:31,280 --> 01:57:33,119
want a little get uh get a hit there yes

2206
01:57:33,119 --> 01:57:34,560
so i'll leave you on the stream and uh

2207
01:57:34,560 --> 01:57:35,679
i'll be right back with an update

2208
01:57:35,679 --> 01:57:37,599
definitely i hope jordan comes back with

2209
01:57:37,599 --> 01:57:39,199
some nice updates there

2210
01:57:39,199 --> 01:57:41,040
um i'm gonna lean over a little bit to

2211
01:57:41,040 --> 01:57:42,880
see better uh this so

2212
01:57:42,880 --> 01:57:46,239
uh a ropper uh one of uh several tools

2213
01:57:46,239 --> 01:57:49,599
to find uh rob gadgets in a program so

2214
01:57:49,599 --> 01:57:50,880
they're running this on the on the

2215
01:57:50,880 --> 01:57:52,639
program to

2216
01:57:52,639 --> 01:57:54,639
find what gadgets are available to you

2217
01:57:54,639 --> 01:57:57,280
then use them to build up the rob chain

2218
01:57:57,280 --> 01:58:00,480
so return oriented programming

2219
01:58:00,480 --> 01:58:02,000
and

2220
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:04,560
it can be a bit tricky as we see here it

2221
01:58:04,560 --> 01:58:05,840
didn't look that they had a lot of

2222
01:58:05,840 --> 01:58:07,199
things to choose i didn't see if there

2223
01:58:07,199 --> 01:58:08,800
was like any filter or anything going on

2224
01:58:08,800 --> 01:58:11,280
there but regardless uh so they were

2225
01:58:11,280 --> 01:58:12,800
looking for specific

2226
01:58:12,800 --> 01:58:15,520
uh gadgets with specific properties um

2227
01:58:15,520 --> 01:58:19,040
like a call instruction i think there

2228
01:58:19,199 --> 01:58:20,880
to be able to put this into the rock

2229
01:58:20,880 --> 01:58:24,000
chain uh and then use that developer

2230
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:25,840
exploit

2231
01:58:25,840 --> 01:58:27,119
um

2232
01:58:27,119 --> 01:58:30,159
yeah so

2233
01:58:30,400 --> 01:58:32,400
again we see them looking at

2234
01:58:32,400 --> 01:58:33,599
uh

2235
01:58:33,599 --> 01:58:35,119
either a little bit double checking what

2236
01:58:35,119 --> 01:58:36,400
they're doing

2237
01:58:36,400 --> 01:58:38,159
um

2238
01:58:38,159 --> 01:58:39,599
we can see that they're rewriting a part

2239
01:58:39,599 --> 01:58:40,880
of their exploit there's some kind of

2240
01:58:40,880 --> 01:58:42,719
address that they're going to trying to

2241
01:58:42,719 --> 01:58:44,239
figure out what's what's the appropriate

2242
01:58:44,239 --> 01:58:47,040
address so here they're going for libsy

2243
01:58:47,040 --> 01:58:48,800
bass plus an offset so they're trying to

2244
01:58:48,800 --> 01:58:52,960
go into one of these one gadgets i think

2245
01:58:52,960 --> 01:58:53,920
and

2246
01:58:53,920 --> 01:58:55,520
we'll see so they're just trying them

2247
01:58:55,520 --> 01:58:57,840
one by one

2248
01:58:57,840 --> 01:58:59,840
to just see if any of them works and if

2249
01:58:59,840 --> 01:59:01,280
they have the

2250
01:59:01,280 --> 01:59:03,679
constraints uh satisfied for for them to

2251
01:59:03,679 --> 01:59:05,119
be able to do this

2252
01:59:05,119 --> 01:59:07,199
uh but it doesn't seem like it's working

2253
01:59:07,199 --> 01:59:09,760
quite yet uh yeah

2254
01:59:09,760 --> 01:59:11,679
so what do you have uh jordan all right

2255
01:59:11,679 --> 01:59:13,840
so the update on starbucks i would just

2256
01:59:13,840 --> 01:59:16,000
say starbucks looks like they're still

2257
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:17,920
kind of like thinking about the problem

2258
01:59:17,920 --> 01:59:19,760
i i kind of get the impression that that

2259
01:59:19,760 --> 01:59:21,199
um

2260
01:59:21,199 --> 01:59:22,080
uh

2261
01:59:22,080 --> 01:59:24,639
the the slash visa home has has more of

2262
01:59:24,639 --> 01:59:26,880
a sense of where they're going yeah and

2263
01:59:26,880 --> 01:59:27,679
they're kind of getting the building

2264
01:59:27,679 --> 01:59:29,599
blocks there uh could be wrong though

2265
01:59:29,599 --> 01:59:31,440
again it can be really hard to kind of

2266
01:59:31,440 --> 01:59:32,639
get a sense of where people are at in

2267
01:59:32,639 --> 01:59:34,400
their head we're just trying to kind of

2268
01:59:34,400 --> 01:59:35,920
watch and gain understanding but i

2269
01:59:35,920 --> 01:59:37,440
definitely saw some more

2270
01:59:37,440 --> 01:59:39,679
uh just kind of poking around uh it is

2271
01:59:39,679 --> 01:59:41,599
interesting we did see a true pwntools

2272
01:59:41,599 --> 01:59:43,920
user right so it was uh pwn tools coming

2273
01:59:43,920 --> 01:59:47,920
in from starbuck versus uh the custom uh

2274
01:59:47,920 --> 01:59:51,679
ptr uh lib uh that we're seeing here

2275
01:59:51,679 --> 01:59:53,520
and uh

2276
01:59:53,520 --> 01:59:56,480
uh gef jeff i don't know is it do we is

2277
01:59:56,480 --> 01:59:58,719
there like a canonical pronunciation i i

2278
01:59:58,719 --> 02:00:00,880
just kind of guessed because gdb but

2279
02:00:00,880 --> 02:00:02,560
yeah i mean

2280
02:00:02,560 --> 02:00:05,199
i i've heard both

2281
02:00:05,199 --> 02:00:08,480
i agree with like the the gdb being a

2282
02:00:08,480 --> 02:00:09,520
guest

2283
02:00:09,520 --> 02:00:11,920
but i think it's funny i think this can

2284
02:00:11,920 --> 02:00:14,159
only call it i think

2285
02:00:14,159 --> 02:00:15,760
like could work because it's like it's

2286
02:00:15,760 --> 02:00:17,280
like the name jeff

2287
02:00:17,280 --> 02:00:18,960
uh yeah

2288
02:00:18,960 --> 02:00:19,840
um

2289
02:00:19,840 --> 02:00:21,119
so

2290
02:00:21,119 --> 02:00:22,880
so we've definitely got some fans people

2291
02:00:22,880 --> 02:00:24,480
are excited to see to see both their

2292
02:00:24,480 --> 02:00:28,080
favorite players um and uh yeah

2293
02:00:28,080 --> 02:00:30,159
fabio it depends some of these these

2294
02:00:30,159 --> 02:00:31,679
challenges there are absolutely things

2295
02:00:31,679 --> 02:00:33,040
that you want to look up

2296
02:00:33,040 --> 02:00:34,560
you might be looking up a bug in the

2297
02:00:34,560 --> 02:00:36,719
tool or something you're doing this

2298
02:00:36,719 --> 02:00:38,080
particular one

2299
02:00:38,080 --> 02:00:40,639
is is kind of very classic i feel like

2300
02:00:40,639 --> 02:00:41,840
that that

2301
02:00:41,840 --> 02:00:43,920
that there's they know their tools they

2302
02:00:43,920 --> 02:00:45,280
know you know what they're doing they've

2303
02:00:45,280 --> 02:00:47,119
got they're not looking up the help for

2304
02:00:47,119 --> 02:00:48,639
for pwntools because they're using

2305
02:00:48,639 --> 02:00:49,920
features that they've used a lot yeah

2306
02:00:49,920 --> 02:00:51,040
yeah they're not looking up to help for

2307
02:00:51,040 --> 02:00:53,040
these um you know these things just

2308
02:00:53,040 --> 02:00:55,199
because they're more familiar with it

2309
02:00:55,199 --> 02:00:56,560
all right so

2310
02:00:56,560 --> 02:00:59,440
we're trying so we've got like it seems

2311
02:00:59,440 --> 02:01:00,880
like we've got code execution right if

2312
02:01:00,880 --> 02:01:02,239
they're already looking for gadgets

2313
02:01:02,239 --> 02:01:03,360
they've got code execution they're

2314
02:01:03,360 --> 02:01:05,280
really just trying to redirect

2315
02:01:05,280 --> 02:01:07,520
exactly gif or jif jeffrey geff i love

2316
02:01:07,520 --> 02:01:08,719
it

2317
02:01:08,719 --> 02:01:09,760
exactly

2318
02:01:09,760 --> 02:01:12,800
yes so we're trying to kind of pivot

2319
02:01:12,800 --> 02:01:14,800
get us a gadget

2320
02:01:14,800 --> 02:01:16,639
that gets us uh

2321
02:01:16,639 --> 02:01:18,400
closer to our one gadget right so they

2322
02:01:18,400 --> 02:01:20,400
need to see that they were looking for a

2323
02:01:20,400 --> 02:01:23,840
move rsp gadget so they want to pivot

2324
02:01:23,840 --> 02:01:26,159
the stack uh

2325
02:01:26,159 --> 02:01:29,040
and uh potentially to use that to have a

2326
02:01:29,040 --> 02:01:30,320
like a longer drop change yeah

2327
02:01:30,320 --> 02:01:33,119
eventually yep

2328
02:01:33,440 --> 02:01:34,639
another technique they might have used

2329
02:01:34,639 --> 02:01:35,760
to get along with rock chain 2 is

2330
02:01:35,760 --> 02:01:37,840
sometimes you can just actually

2331
02:01:37,840 --> 02:01:39,840
pivot back into the same program right

2332
02:01:39,840 --> 02:01:41,040
into like another read or another

2333
02:01:41,040 --> 02:01:43,599
receiver depending on the program

2334
02:01:43,599 --> 02:01:44,880
so let's see we're looking at some

2335
02:01:44,880 --> 02:01:46,239
padding going down in here into the

2336
02:01:46,239 --> 02:01:48,639
payload

2337
02:01:48,639 --> 02:01:52,080
so they're just increasing it

2338
02:01:57,040 --> 02:01:58,800
and it is fun too because the speed at

2339
02:01:58,800 --> 02:02:02,159
which people uh operate at this tier

2340
02:02:02,159 --> 02:02:03,679
we're done we have a winner oh i'm so

2341
02:02:03,679 --> 02:02:05,119
sorry we didn't see it on screen but

2342
02:02:05,119 --> 02:02:07,040
congratulations

2343
02:02:07,040 --> 02:02:08,880
round two winner

2344
02:02:08,880 --> 02:02:10,719
very good i wish we had that one on

2345
02:02:10,719 --> 02:02:12,239
stream very sorry for the capture

2346
02:02:12,239 --> 02:02:13,599
problems yeah we're gonna make sure we

2347
02:02:13,599 --> 02:02:16,800
take this time and we're gonna swap out

2348
02:02:16,800 --> 02:02:19,840
uh our uh our capture card so that we

2349
02:02:19,840 --> 02:02:21,679
don't have that happen again uh but

2350
02:02:21,679 --> 02:02:22,800
thanks again for hanging with us we'll

2351
02:02:22,800 --> 02:02:24,639
be back with a better view of both team

2352
02:02:24,639 --> 02:02:26,000
screens this time

2353
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:28,080
and uh we'll see you just in a few

2354

02:29:36,560 --> 02:29:38,880
there we go okay so let's get up our our

2479
02:29:38,880 --> 02:29:41,200
team views and we're off we're back this

2480
02:29:41,200 --> 02:29:42,560
round with

2481
02:29:42,560 --> 02:29:44,960
maple mallard magistrates

2482
02:29:44,960 --> 02:29:46,720
which i mean i'm that's the mighty ducks

2483
02:29:46,720 --> 02:29:48,240
yes right like that's that's just i've

2484
02:29:48,240 --> 02:29:49,120
decided that's what we're gonna call

2485
02:29:49,120 --> 02:29:50,640
them we're gonna go to the mighty ducks

2486
02:29:50,640 --> 02:29:52,399
uh and they're competing against osu sec

2487
02:29:52,399 --> 02:29:55,359
or osu sec yep uh so you know who they

2488
02:29:55,359 --> 02:29:56,000
are

2489
02:29:56,000 --> 02:29:58,479
uh i believe they're from osu uh either

2490
02:29:58,479 --> 02:30:00,560
oklahoma state or it's uh i assume it's

2491
02:30:00,560 --> 02:30:02,560
a state university yeah i mean i would i

2492
02:30:02,560 --> 02:30:04,399
would guess but i don't know for certain

2493
02:30:04,399 --> 02:30:06,240
yeah i'm also super familiar with like

2494
02:30:06,240 --> 02:30:07,600
all the universities in the u.s and

2495
02:30:07,600 --> 02:30:08,880
stuff so yeah

2496
02:30:08,880 --> 02:30:11,920
um yes but that sounds uh very possible

2497
02:30:11,920 --> 02:30:14,000
um what do we have here uh on the

2498
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:15,840
competitors so we're looking we're

2499
02:30:15,840 --> 02:30:17,439
looking at source code so i guess we

2500
02:30:17,439 --> 02:30:19,840
gave a source code on this particular

2501
02:30:19,840 --> 02:30:21,280
challenge

2502
02:30:21,280 --> 02:30:23,280
uh because because nobody's got uh ida

2503
02:30:23,280 --> 02:30:24,560
or ninja open

2504
02:30:24,560 --> 02:30:26,720
they're just going straight to

2505
02:30:26,720 --> 02:30:29,600
uh so let's see we've got the handout

2506
02:30:29,600 --> 02:30:32,800
uh right that's some capstone uh library

2507
02:30:32,800 --> 02:30:34,240
calls right this is interesting we've

2508
02:30:34,240 --> 02:30:37,920
got okay so we've got capstone

2509
02:30:37,920 --> 02:30:39,359
and they're they're gonna just they're

2510
02:30:39,359 --> 02:30:40,720
gonna run they're gonna try it locally

2511
02:30:40,720 --> 02:30:41,760
and they're gonna see how it works now

2512
02:30:41,760 --> 02:30:44,560
this program it is challenged is called

2513
02:30:44,560 --> 02:30:48,240
knop coding okay so it's it's uh

2514
02:30:48,240 --> 02:30:51,840
not show oh do we lose oh no

2515
02:30:51,920 --> 02:30:54,000
we lost this did you lose that no we're

2516
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:55,920
it's back it's back okay but like did

2517
02:30:55,920 --> 02:30:57,120
you lose it on the capture because i

2518
02:30:57,120 --> 02:30:59,439
think it's just our power yeah yeah okay

2519
02:30:59,439 --> 02:31:00,800
we're fine so i think we're losing

2520
02:31:00,800 --> 02:31:02,560
there's power something power with this

2521
02:31:02,560 --> 02:31:04,640
is is causing trouble yeah

2522
02:31:04,640 --> 02:31:06,319
you know what bring the brightness way

2523
02:31:06,319 --> 02:31:07,680
down

2524
02:31:07,680 --> 02:31:10,160
yes uh let's try let's see if we can do

2525
02:31:10,160 --> 02:31:11,680
this

2526
02:31:11,680 --> 02:31:14,160
yes so someone's saying uh oregon state

2527
02:31:14,160 --> 02:31:15,920
university someone saying ohio state

2528
02:31:15,920 --> 02:31:18,000
university so uh they're all good

2529
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:20,000
guesses but yeah i don't know which it

2530
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:21,439
is uh yes

2531
02:31:21,439 --> 02:31:25,359
uh anyway uh while that's uh you know

2532
02:31:25,359 --> 02:31:28,000
sorted out we do have see if we decrease

2533
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:29,680
our power draw on our monitor here if

2534
02:31:29,680 --> 02:31:31,680
that'll uh

2535
02:31:31,680 --> 02:31:32,800
yeah

2536
02:31:32,800 --> 02:31:34,319
let's hope that that's better that's how

2537
02:31:34,319 --> 02:31:35,280
that works

2538
02:31:35,280 --> 02:31:37,040
okay anyway

2539
02:31:37,040 --> 02:31:38,240
uh

2540
02:31:38,240 --> 02:31:40,479
off to a bit of a rocky start again but

2541
02:31:40,479 --> 02:31:42,080
but hopefully we will recover new

2542
02:31:42,080 --> 02:31:44,080
challenges each uh each each time oh

2543
02:31:44,080 --> 02:31:45,840
there we go go be so is this actually

2544
02:31:45,840 --> 02:31:48,479
the beavers would be uh

2545
02:31:48,479 --> 02:31:49,840
be versus ducks well the ducks are

2546
02:31:49,840 --> 02:31:50,800
oregon

2547
02:31:50,800 --> 02:31:52,640
but ohio state no ohio state's the the

2548
02:31:52,640 --> 02:31:54,880
buckeyes it is oregon state okay all

2549
02:31:54,880 --> 02:31:57,280
right all right thank you

2550
02:31:57,280 --> 02:31:59,280
thank you chad for filling us in

2551
02:31:59,280 --> 02:32:01,280
can confirm so i apologize we should

2552
02:32:01,280 --> 02:32:02,000
have

2553
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:03,600
we're bad casters we should have had

2554
02:32:03,600 --> 02:32:06,479
better better uh you know intel on our

2555
02:32:06,479 --> 02:32:08,319
on our our teams but you know how they

2556
02:32:08,319 --> 02:32:10,720
say like the best way to get an answer

2557
02:32:10,720 --> 02:32:12,399
is to say a wrong one yeah yeah oh

2558
02:32:12,399 --> 02:32:13,760
that's how i like run a business it

2559
02:32:13,760 --> 02:32:15,280
works great i just you know i say

2560
02:32:15,280 --> 02:32:16,479
something and then my coworkers are like

2561
02:32:16,479 --> 02:32:17,680
no you're wrong i'm like okay but now i

2562
02:32:17,680 --> 02:32:19,760
know the right answer yeah yeah uh so we

2563
02:32:19,760 --> 02:32:21,120
can see here that

2564
02:32:21,120 --> 02:32:22,560
we should be streaming if we're not

2565
02:32:22,560 --> 02:32:26,000
streaming uh at 720p it is either

2566
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:27,680
youtube or it's just our bandwidth

2567
02:32:27,680 --> 02:32:29,200
because we should be streaming at 10

2568
02:32:29,200 --> 02:32:30,399
1080

2569
02:32:30,399 --> 02:32:32,160
and the vod that we're recording is also

2570
02:32:32,160 --> 02:32:34,080
going to be 1080 so if we need to upload

2571
02:32:34,080 --> 02:32:36,080
a higher quality afterwards

2572
02:32:36,080 --> 02:32:38,160
we will get that all right oh this is

2573
02:32:38,160 --> 02:32:40,160
interesting okay okay so wait a minute

2574
02:32:40,160 --> 02:32:42,319
i'm seeing engism over here on and so

2575
02:32:42,319 --> 02:32:43,840
remind me i've got

2576
02:32:43,840 --> 02:32:46,720
um maple mallet okay so i've got um

2577
02:32:46,720 --> 02:32:48,319
mighty ducks uh i've got the mighty

2578
02:32:48,319 --> 02:32:50,640
ducks over here and i'm already seeing

2579
02:32:50,640 --> 02:32:52,399
something really interesting this this

2580
02:32:52,399 --> 02:32:54,479
uh start your clocks this could actually

2581
02:32:54,479 --> 02:32:56,160
be fastest solve from what i'm seeing

2582
02:32:56,160 --> 02:32:58,160
over here okay so this challenge was

2583
02:32:58,160 --> 02:33:00,800
called not coding and what they're doing

2584
02:33:00,800 --> 02:33:02,560
is they're told

2585
02:33:02,560 --> 02:33:04,319
you must uh

2586
02:33:04,319 --> 02:33:05,600
get a shell

2587
02:33:05,600 --> 02:33:07,600
uh but everything that you run must be a

2588
02:33:07,600 --> 02:33:09,920
knop which kind of like makes doesn't

2589
02:33:09,920 --> 02:33:11,520
really make sense impossible yeah yeah

2590
02:33:11,520 --> 02:33:13,040
like knobs doesn't do anything but we

2591
02:33:13,040 --> 02:33:14,640
did we did give that we gave them a hint

2592
02:33:14,640 --> 02:33:17,200
actually right so if it's locked at 720

2593
02:33:17,200 --> 02:33:20,720
yeah we apologize it is our uh uh it is

2594
02:33:20,720 --> 02:33:21,840
probably just our stream bandwidth

2595
02:33:21,840 --> 02:33:23,520
because i believe we're we're streaming

2596
02:33:23,520 --> 02:33:24,960
at 1080p

2597
02:33:24,960 --> 02:33:26,720
um and actually let's go ahead and go

2598
02:33:26,720 --> 02:33:28,800
full screen to uh to one of the teams

2599
02:33:28,800 --> 02:33:30,479
we'll try to keep the full screen ones

2600
02:33:30,479 --> 02:33:32,240
uh let's do the one without the if we're

2601
02:33:32,240 --> 02:33:33,920
at 720 we want it to be like real full

2602
02:33:33,920 --> 02:33:36,000
screen so we'll get rid of all the the

2603
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:38,399
pretty artwork and we'll just do

2604
02:33:38,399 --> 02:33:40,000
let's do the bigger one that's clear

2605
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:41,520
without even that yeah so this will get

2606
02:33:41,520 --> 02:33:42,160
us

2607
02:33:42,160 --> 02:33:45,200
uh looking at uh oregon state

2608
02:33:45,200 --> 02:33:45,920
so

2609
02:33:45,920 --> 02:33:47,680
we're seeing the preload right so what

2610
02:33:47,680 --> 02:33:48,479
they're trying to do now is they're

2611
02:33:48,479 --> 02:33:51,359
going to run it with their capstone

2612
02:33:51,359 --> 02:33:52,399
yeah they're just trying to make the

2613
02:33:52,399 --> 02:33:54,560
binary work so that they can like debug

2614
02:33:54,560 --> 02:33:56,000
the stuff you see they do some ld

2615
02:33:56,000 --> 02:33:58,880
preload so they get the proper

2616
02:33:58,880 --> 02:34:00,319
libraries running

2617
02:34:00,319 --> 02:34:02,160
no these are not two local teams as far

2618
02:34:02,160 --> 02:34:04,640
as i know i don't believe uh it's funny

2619
02:34:04,640 --> 02:34:06,080
that they're a duck themed right so the

2620
02:34:06,080 --> 02:34:07,200
duck theme is

2621
02:34:07,200 --> 02:34:09,520
oh yeah we are we are making progress

2622
02:34:09,520 --> 02:34:10,880
right okay so what we're what we're

2623
02:34:10,880 --> 02:34:12,240
looking at here

2624
02:34:12,240 --> 02:34:15,040
is we've got a text file on the right

2625
02:34:15,040 --> 02:34:16,640
that is a knob right and we're

2626
02:34:16,640 --> 02:34:19,120
assembling it so it's test.s and this is

2627
02:34:19,120 --> 02:34:21,520
being created as a knob uh but when we

2628
02:34:21,520 --> 02:34:23,840
disassemble it now it's not a knob yeah

2629
02:34:23,840 --> 02:34:25,920
right so the reason why we're doing that

2630
02:34:25,920 --> 02:34:27,920
and we gave them a hint we told them

2631
02:34:27,920 --> 02:34:30,240
that the the binary they're given is a

2632
02:34:30,240 --> 02:34:32,319
32-bit binary on this particular i

2633
02:34:32,319 --> 02:34:34,479
believe the the point is that there's a

2634
02:34:34,479 --> 02:34:36,640
mismatch here like yeah it's being

2635
02:34:36,640 --> 02:34:38,960
disassembled as

2636
02:34:38,960 --> 02:34:41,439
32 bits but it's executed at 64. it's

2637
02:34:41,439 --> 02:34:43,840
going to be running

2638
02:34:44,240 --> 02:34:46,000
yeah it disassembled the 64-bit but

2639
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:48,080
executed this thing is 32-bit so if if

2640
02:34:48,080 --> 02:34:51,439
your bytes disassemble as an x64 knob

2641
02:34:51,439 --> 02:34:53,600
but run as a 32-bit

2642
02:34:53,600 --> 02:34:56,399
like actual instruction it will be run

2643
02:34:56,399 --> 02:34:58,479
and so yeah we are definitely i i can't

2644
02:34:58,479 --> 02:35:00,000
tell from this angle i don't have a good

2645
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:00,800
uh

2646
02:35:00,800 --> 02:35:02,720
view on uh they're looking at this field

2647
02:35:02,720 --> 02:35:07,040
here um clearly the the ducks are are i

2648
02:35:07,040 --> 02:35:09,680
would say in a strong like

2649
02:35:09,680 --> 02:35:10,720
running your knobs and they should have

2650
02:35:10,720 --> 02:35:12,800
like they they know they they completely

2651
02:35:12,800 --> 02:35:14,319
understand right this like i said this

2652
02:35:14,319 --> 02:35:15,439
could be

2653
02:35:15,439 --> 02:35:16,960
one of our faster solves because they

2654
02:35:16,960 --> 02:35:18,240
are absolutely

2655
02:35:18,240 --> 02:35:20,080
they get it now how long will it take

2656
02:35:20,080 --> 02:35:23,439
them to build a payload and can uh our

2657
02:35:23,439 --> 02:35:25,439
our beavers catch up

2658
02:35:25,439 --> 02:35:26,319
that's going to be that's going to be

2659
02:35:26,319 --> 02:35:27,760
the question we got we got to figure out

2660
02:35:27,760 --> 02:35:29,920
right you can see that they are uh

2661
02:35:29,920 --> 02:35:32,800
looking up the capstone uh

2662
02:35:32,800 --> 02:35:34,319
and that actually that is a good so that

2663
02:35:34,319 --> 02:35:35,439
is a good thing to do because a lot of

2664
02:35:35,439 --> 02:35:36,960
people that when we tested this

2665
02:35:36,960 --> 02:35:38,880
challenge just assumed it was

2666
02:35:38,880 --> 02:35:40,479
disassembling as the same architecture

2667
02:35:40,479 --> 02:35:42,319
width and so actually double checking

2668
02:35:42,319 --> 02:35:44,479
that call to capstone checking the

2669
02:35:44,479 --> 02:35:46,960
parameter checking that that information

2670
02:35:46,960 --> 02:35:48,720
is actually not a bad idea i just think

2671
02:35:48,720 --> 02:35:50,880
we're seeing we're seeing our our duck

2672
02:35:50,880 --> 02:35:52,960
over here um

2673
02:35:52,960 --> 02:35:54,640
make like they already they just they

2674
02:35:54,640 --> 02:35:55,920
looked at it and they just knew they're

2675
02:35:55,920 --> 02:35:57,680
like oh i get this i understand exactly

2676
02:35:57,680 --> 02:35:59,280
what this challenge is yeah i mean

2677
02:35:59,280 --> 02:36:01,200
sometimes you're just like on the same

2678
02:36:01,200 --> 02:36:02,960
kind of like frequency as the challenge

2679
02:36:02,960 --> 02:36:05,280
author and like i see i see where you're

2680
02:36:05,280 --> 02:36:07,280
going with this and then like you know

2681
02:36:07,280 --> 02:36:11,520
yeah yeah so so mmm and actually uh

2682
02:36:11,520 --> 02:36:16,080
mmm is a a very similar name to uh ppp

2683
02:36:16,080 --> 02:36:17,280
yeah

2684
02:36:17,280 --> 02:36:20,080
what a strange coincidence uh so we

2685
02:36:20,080 --> 02:36:21,359
mentioned earlier we're seeing a lot of

2686
02:36:21,359 --> 02:36:23,439
these teams kind of join together yeah

2687
02:36:23,439 --> 02:36:26,000
uh and certainly if we look over we can

2688
02:36:26,000 --> 02:36:28,160
see a opcode reference here which is

2689
02:36:28,160 --> 02:36:30,399
exactly what you want here like you want

2690
02:36:30,399 --> 02:36:32,880
to see like what's the uh

2691
02:36:32,880 --> 02:36:35,680
op codes that will uh disassemble into

2692
02:36:35,680 --> 02:36:36,800
the knobs

2693
02:36:36,800 --> 02:36:38,319
while at the same time have a different

2694
02:36:38,319 --> 02:36:41,200
meaning in the 32-bit context

2695
02:36:41,200 --> 02:36:43,600
now again though i wouldn't say that

2696
02:36:43,600 --> 02:36:45,439
there is sort of like

2697
02:36:45,439 --> 02:36:47,120
once you get the right one that works

2698
02:36:47,120 --> 02:36:49,120
the rest kind of flows pretty easily i

2699
02:36:49,120 --> 02:36:51,840
feel like um having having seen at least

2700
02:36:51,840 --> 02:36:53,200
a solution to this we expect there's

2701
02:36:53,200 --> 02:36:54,800
probably multiple but

2702
02:36:54,800 --> 02:36:56,160
one of them like once you kind of get

2703
02:36:56,160 --> 02:36:58,000
the right mismatch

2704
02:36:58,000 --> 02:36:59,280
you don't need you don't need to build

2705
02:36:59,280 --> 02:37:00,960
this really complicated payload it can

2706
02:37:00,960 --> 02:37:03,200
be relatively straightforward so i say

2707
02:37:03,200 --> 02:37:06,160
that to to mean that it could be i guess

2708
02:37:06,160 --> 02:37:07,520
not out of reach yet like while i

2709
02:37:07,520 --> 02:37:08,880
certainly if i if i you know we're in

2710
02:37:08,880 --> 02:37:10,720
vegas if i was going to make a bet i

2711
02:37:10,720 --> 02:37:14,160
might put it now on on uh on mmm yeah or

2712
02:37:14,160 --> 02:37:15,920
mighty ducks but

2713
02:37:15,920 --> 02:37:17,439
this is this is not out of reach there's

2714
02:37:17,439 --> 02:37:19,040
there's no question because if it's uh

2715
02:37:19,040 --> 02:37:20,720
okay right so they just find out for

2716
02:37:20,720 --> 02:37:22,479
example floating point knobs

2717
02:37:22,479 --> 02:37:23,760
are not considered knobs because it

2718
02:37:23,760 --> 02:37:25,520
actually says f-not all right so it's

2719
02:37:25,520 --> 02:37:26,880
phenom or however you know if you

2720
02:37:26,880 --> 02:37:29,040
actually pronounce it and i'm also kind

2721
02:37:29,040 --> 02:37:31,359
of wondering what the hell is uh

2722
02:37:31,359 --> 02:37:33,359
f in the first place

2723
02:37:33,359 --> 02:37:35,840
it's a knob that happens in the floating

2724
02:37:35,840 --> 02:37:38,080
point instruction space right but it's

2725
02:37:38,080 --> 02:37:40,399
like what

2726
02:37:40,399 --> 02:37:42,560
yeah yeah actually if memory serves it's

2727
02:37:42,560 --> 02:37:45,120
even a funny opcode i think it's d9d0

2728
02:37:45,120 --> 02:37:46,640
because you know 90

2729
02:37:46,640 --> 02:37:48,880
is the is the the regular knob and so i

2730
02:37:48,880 --> 02:37:50,560
believe let's

2731
02:37:50,560 --> 02:37:52,479
i'm not sure but like

2732
02:37:52,479 --> 02:37:54,080
somebody check me out chat

2733
02:37:54,080 --> 02:37:56,080
uh open up your binary ninja and type d9

2734
02:37:56,080 --> 02:37:58,960
d0 and hit you know p disassemble it

2735
02:37:58,960 --> 02:38:00,800
or we could look yeah we can look here

2736
02:38:00,800 --> 02:38:02,880
so we're seeing working over through the

2737
02:38:02,880 --> 02:38:05,439
knobs okay we're back in capstone

2738
02:38:05,439 --> 02:38:07,680
so have we found out the key yet so

2739
02:38:07,680 --> 02:38:09,359
let's see yeah they're looking at the

2740
02:38:09,359 --> 02:38:10,640
captain headers i think they're trying

2741
02:38:10,640 --> 02:38:12,240
to figure out exactly what the different

2742
02:38:12,240 --> 02:38:13,040
uh

2743
02:38:13,040 --> 02:38:14,640
constants mean like the different

2744
02:38:14,640 --> 02:38:17,280
arguments to uh the this

2745
02:38:17,280 --> 02:38:19,120
which is uh definitely the key to

2746
02:38:19,120 --> 02:38:21,439
understand this uh challenge then to

2747
02:38:21,439 --> 02:38:23,600
realize like exactly in in what way it's

2748
02:38:23,600 --> 02:38:25,120
disassembled now you can you could go

2749
02:38:25,120 --> 02:38:26,640
too far though right so like one of the

2750
02:38:26,640 --> 02:38:28,000
i think the most important things to

2751
02:38:28,000 --> 02:38:29,920
figure out is

2752
02:38:29,920 --> 02:38:32,479
how much do you spend into one sinkhole

2753
02:38:32,479 --> 02:38:34,560
before you move to another topic or how

2754
02:38:34,560 --> 02:38:36,080
are you going too deep especially in

2755
02:38:36,080 --> 02:38:37,040
this one

2756
02:38:37,040 --> 02:38:38,960
where you know there is a solution that

2757
02:38:38,960 --> 02:38:41,040
should be doable in 20 30 minutes right

2758
02:38:41,040 --> 02:38:42,399
right and this is kind of like a little

2759
02:38:42,399 --> 02:38:44,080
bit like a meta gaming thing but we just

2760
02:38:44,080 --> 02:38:45,680
saw it at if not over there as well too

2761
02:38:45,680 --> 02:38:48,720
on iosu so they're look they're

2762
02:38:48,720 --> 02:38:49,680
they're looking through the different

2763
02:38:49,680 --> 02:38:51,520
different operations yeah

2764
02:38:51,520 --> 02:38:52,880
but a little bit like a meta gaming

2765
02:38:52,880 --> 02:38:55,200
thing in the ctf like when

2766
02:38:55,200 --> 02:38:56,479
because you know that there is a

2767
02:38:56,479 --> 02:38:59,040
solution like it shapes how you approach

2768
02:38:59,040 --> 02:39:00,080
the

2769
02:39:00,080 --> 02:39:01,840
uh the problem and like you you start

2770
02:39:01,840 --> 02:39:03,760
thinking about like okay what what what

2771
02:39:03,760 --> 02:39:05,520
could the officer have been thinking

2772
02:39:05,520 --> 02:39:07,359
about and so on well and that's one more

2773
02:39:07,359 --> 02:39:10,000
again i feel like um you know we saw

2774
02:39:10,000 --> 02:39:12,960
immediately a 3264 mismatch coming out

2775
02:39:12,960 --> 02:39:14,880
of mmm so that was just somebody who who

2776
02:39:14,880 --> 02:39:16,640
looked at it and instantly thought if i

2777
02:39:16,640 --> 02:39:18,240
was making a challenge like this about

2778
02:39:18,240 --> 02:39:19,600
like this here's probably what happens

2779
02:39:19,600 --> 02:39:20,960
and then it just they tested it and it

2780
02:39:20,960 --> 02:39:21,920
worked

2781
02:39:21,920 --> 02:39:24,160
um and that's where like the experience

2782
02:39:24,160 --> 02:39:26,319
really uh comes into play

2783
02:39:26,319 --> 02:39:30,319
so iron we uh currently have uh mmm

2784
02:39:30,319 --> 02:39:32,160
which sounds suspicious like ppp uh

2785
02:39:32,160 --> 02:39:34,240
they're a duck themed team uh the full

2786
02:39:34,240 --> 02:39:35,359
name is

2787
02:39:35,359 --> 02:39:36,319
uh

2788
02:39:36,319 --> 02:39:38,880
maple mallard magistrates i call them

2789
02:39:38,880 --> 02:39:40,319
the mighty ducks

2790
02:39:40,319 --> 02:39:42,160
and they're playing against the osu

2791
02:39:42,160 --> 02:39:43,920
stack the oklahoma state university

2792
02:39:43,920 --> 02:39:46,160
beavers so we have a duck versus beaver

2793
02:39:46,160 --> 02:39:46,960
match

2794
02:39:46,960 --> 02:39:48,560
um

2795
02:39:48,560 --> 02:39:50,960
coincidentally uh and actually for

2796
02:39:50,960 --> 02:39:53,200
context the the the seating for these

2797
02:39:53,200 --> 02:39:55,040
challenges oh i do see our our stream

2798
02:39:55,040 --> 02:39:56,319
bit rate kind of going up and down so i

2799
02:39:56,319 --> 02:39:58,319
apologize for the 720

2800
02:39:58,319 --> 02:40:01,840
we are at the mercy of uh of the

2801
02:40:01,840 --> 02:40:02,960
the bandwidth that we've got here but

2802
02:40:02,960 --> 02:40:04,560
the good news is we have local feeds and

2803
02:40:04,560 --> 02:40:06,720
we will make sure that we put uh

2804
02:40:06,720 --> 02:40:07,760
um

2805
02:40:07,760 --> 02:40:08,960
upload the videos of this through the

2806
02:40:08,960 --> 02:40:10,960
recordings yeah yeah we'll we'll do the

2807
02:40:10,960 --> 02:40:12,960
good ones later so

2808
02:40:12,960 --> 02:40:13,840
um

2809
02:40:13,840 --> 02:40:15,040
there was a question here like they can

2810
02:40:15,040 --> 02:40:16,800
only use not in shell code and yes it's

2811
02:40:16,800 --> 02:40:19,120
like yes sorry no i said oklahoma did

2812
02:40:19,120 --> 02:40:20,640
not i'm in oregon thank you lucas i

2813
02:40:20,640 --> 02:40:22,560
apologize yes this is oregon state

2814
02:40:22,560 --> 02:40:24,000
university

2815
02:40:24,000 --> 02:40:26,000
we're not operating this is like the u.s

2816
02:40:26,000 --> 02:40:28,399
version of like sweden switzerland uh

2817
02:40:28,399 --> 02:40:30,479
oh there's there's lots of them i mean

2818
02:40:30,479 --> 02:40:31,680
it's just oh universities there's

2819
02:40:31,680 --> 02:40:33,439
oklahoma ohio

2820
02:40:33,439 --> 02:40:35,520
i know i know listen

2821
02:40:35,520 --> 02:40:37,920
we've we didn't sleep a whole lot the

2822
02:40:37,920 --> 02:40:39,840
last few days like we've been hard at

2823
02:40:39,840 --> 02:40:41,680
work getting this done so that i

2824
02:40:41,680 --> 02:40:43,600
guarantee you that's not the worst like

2825
02:40:43,600 --> 02:40:45,840
mix up that we're gonna have all right

2826
02:40:45,840 --> 02:40:48,640
so i'm starting to see

2827
02:40:48,640 --> 02:40:50,240
this is interesting okay so let's go

2828
02:40:50,240 --> 02:40:53,279
back over to the the ducks

2829
02:40:53,279 --> 02:40:55,040
and we've actually got like a payload

2830
02:40:55,040 --> 02:40:57,200
here so we're writing

2831
02:40:57,200 --> 02:41:01,520
uh we've got this as uh oxf0 and one f

2832
02:41:01,520 --> 02:41:05,840
or no x f is just zero f and one f

2833
02:41:07,279 --> 02:41:09,439
okay so we've got a bunch of knobs that

2834
02:41:09,439 --> 02:41:12,080
the behavior

2835
02:41:13,920 --> 02:41:15,439
oh i think they're just brute forcing

2836
02:41:15,439 --> 02:41:16,960
they're just trying

2837
02:41:16,960 --> 02:41:19,840
uh all different combinations of like uh

2838
02:41:19,840 --> 02:41:21,840
up codes to see

2839
02:41:21,840 --> 02:41:22,880
uh

2840
02:41:22,880 --> 02:41:25,040
i don't think so

2841
02:41:25,040 --> 02:41:26,880
this is this is a little different i

2842
02:41:26,880 --> 02:41:29,279
think what we're doing is we know

2843
02:41:29,279 --> 02:41:30,720
something is disassembled wrong and

2844
02:41:30,720 --> 02:41:31,760
we're just trying to either like

2845
02:41:31,760 --> 02:41:33,359
increment a pointer so this feels

2846
02:41:33,359 --> 02:41:35,680
further along to me oh you see that they

2847
02:41:35,680 --> 02:41:39,200
loop over all the 256 uh like uh oh

2848
02:41:39,200 --> 02:41:40,479
immediate values now you're right you're

2849
02:41:40,479 --> 02:41:42,319
right let's take that back

2850
02:41:42,319 --> 02:41:44,880
like exploring basically building up

2851
02:41:44,880 --> 02:41:45,920
like uh

2852
02:41:45,920 --> 02:41:47,760
a playbook i guess of like what they

2853
02:41:47,760 --> 02:41:50,640
have to work with uh

2854
02:41:50,640 --> 02:41:52,960
well i ar i will say

2855
02:41:52,960 --> 02:41:55,359
that uh of all the oh universities only

2856
02:41:55,359 --> 02:41:58,240
one is represented at defcon ctf so by

2857
02:41:58,240 --> 02:41:59,680
definition

2858
02:41:59,680 --> 02:42:01,279
i think you might be right i think

2859
02:42:01,279 --> 02:42:03,520
certainly in the the ctf community right

2860
02:42:03,520 --> 02:42:04,960
now anyway

2861
02:42:04,960 --> 02:42:07,359
uh oregon state does have uh does have

2862
02:42:07,359 --> 02:42:08,880
that edge on all of their other oh

2863
02:42:08,880 --> 02:42:10,960
universities so yeah

2864
02:42:10,960 --> 02:42:12,800
um

2865
02:42:12,800 --> 02:42:14,880
uh the other thing i i think is really

2866
02:42:14,880 --> 02:42:16,560
interesting i love looking at the

2867
02:42:16,560 --> 02:42:18,640
tooling yeah right like i love to see

2868
02:42:18,640 --> 02:42:20,720
like somebody's using bb edit with very

2869
02:42:20,720 --> 02:42:22,960
tight like indentation limits so you can

2870
02:42:22,960 --> 02:42:24,640
see a lot of code like this is sort of

2871
02:42:24,640 --> 02:42:26,160
personal preference and how people work

2872
02:42:26,160 --> 02:42:27,439
some people are using vim in the shell

2873
02:42:27,439 --> 02:42:29,040
and some people are using yeah you know

2874
02:42:29,040 --> 02:42:30,880
actual ides or some people just using

2875
02:42:30,880 --> 02:42:33,439
text editors yeah um

2876
02:42:33,439 --> 02:42:36,319
so i i'm really curious to see uh more

2877
02:42:36,319 --> 02:42:38,399
of that as well as we go and then uh

2878
02:42:38,399 --> 02:42:40,560
yeah hex fiend as well just to be able

2879
02:42:40,560 --> 02:42:43,439
to get a quick uh quick analysis in fact

2880
02:42:43,439 --> 02:42:45,520
when uh this challenge was being tested

2881
02:42:45,520 --> 02:42:46,640
one of the things i saw done that i

2882
02:42:46,640 --> 02:42:48,240
thought was really nifty was

2883
02:42:48,240 --> 02:42:50,640
open up the binary um and i think you

2884
02:42:50,640 --> 02:42:53,359
could do this in geter or ida or binja

2885
02:42:53,359 --> 02:42:54,479
it works really well in binge though to

2886
02:42:54,479 --> 02:42:56,080
be able to just like type a bunch of hex

2887
02:42:56,080 --> 02:42:58,080
bytes and having disassembled

2888
02:42:58,080 --> 02:43:00,560
simultaneously in each of the widths oh

2889
02:43:00,560 --> 02:43:02,080
nice right and so actually no you know i

2890
02:43:02,080 --> 02:43:03,439
take the back you can't actually have

2891
02:43:03,439 --> 02:43:05,439
overlapping architectures in either

2892
02:43:05,439 --> 02:43:07,120
guitar you would but you could easily

2893
02:43:07,120 --> 02:43:08,960
like wire up obj dump right do the same

2894
02:43:08,960 --> 02:43:10,880
thing just disassemble both side by side

2895
02:43:10,880 --> 02:43:12,800
let me fiddle with a bunch of bytes uh

2896
02:43:12,800 --> 02:43:14,800
and work from there so

2897
02:43:14,800 --> 02:43:17,039
uh

2898
02:43:17,600 --> 02:43:18,960
we're looking yeah we're looking through

2899
02:43:18,960 --> 02:43:21,920
a bunch of these i think once the right

2900
02:43:21,920 --> 02:43:24,399
one is found it'll go quickly right so

2901
02:43:24,399 --> 02:43:26,080
is there like one or two operations here

2902
02:43:26,080 --> 02:43:28,160
that are like key there's at least one

2903
02:43:28,160 --> 02:43:30,560
that that i when i saw it get done when

2904
02:43:30,560 --> 02:43:32,800
glenn was um was producing that the

2905
02:43:32,800 --> 02:43:35,680
answer for was definitely um

2906
02:43:35,680 --> 02:43:37,359
key and in fact

2907
02:43:37,359 --> 02:43:38,640
we've got plenty of time left but if we

2908
02:43:38,640 --> 02:43:40,640
hit like the 30 minute mark or the 25

2909
02:43:40,640 --> 02:43:42,479
minute mark what we'll probably do is go

2910
02:43:42,479 --> 02:43:43,600
tell them

2911
02:43:43,600 --> 02:43:45,279
a hint like the mnemonic that they

2912
02:43:45,279 --> 02:43:46,960
should be aiming for and that might help

2913
02:43:46,960 --> 02:43:48,240
them you know get a little bit further

2914
02:43:48,240 --> 02:43:50,240
along so we've talked before about what

2915
02:43:50,240 --> 02:43:52,240
happens if teams don't solve this in

2916
02:43:52,240 --> 02:43:54,399
time uh-oh oh that's a good-looking list

2917
02:43:54,399 --> 02:43:56,080
oh this is interesting

2918
02:43:56,080 --> 02:43:58,160
i see some inks and decks oh that's

2919
02:43:58,160 --> 02:44:00,560
useful yeah what what could you do

2920
02:44:00,560 --> 02:44:01,920
interesting if you could anchor deck a

2921
02:44:01,920 --> 02:44:03,600
pointer well now i expect we're going to

2922
02:44:03,600 --> 02:44:05,760
go back and look at um

2923
02:44:05,760 --> 02:44:07,439
no you need the actual disassembly at

2924
02:44:07,439 --> 02:44:08,560
this point though right like or a

2925
02:44:08,560 --> 02:44:10,160
debugger so there we go we're going to

2926
02:44:10,160 --> 02:44:11,760
see gear draw we're going to see

2927
02:44:11,760 --> 02:44:12,960
a debugger

2928
02:44:12,960 --> 02:44:15,120
i think we've got a gadget and now it's

2929
02:44:15,120 --> 02:44:16,560
a question of what can we do with it

2930
02:44:16,560 --> 02:44:17,600
yeah

2931
02:44:17,600 --> 02:44:20,080
it's like incrementing uh

2932
02:44:20,080 --> 02:44:22,560
very very useful to like

2933
02:44:22,560 --> 02:44:25,120
either do like self-modifying code or

2934
02:44:25,120 --> 02:44:26,800
just you know manipulate gestures

2935
02:44:26,800 --> 02:44:28,720
misalign some pointer at something else

2936
02:44:28,720 --> 02:44:30,080
right like what can we what can we point

2937
02:44:30,080 --> 02:44:32,720
it at so right yeah you have an esp

2938
02:44:32,720 --> 02:44:34,240
though for example there's and there's a

2939
02:44:34,240 --> 02:44:35,520
seg fault right so writing a bunch of

2940
02:44:35,520 --> 02:44:36,880
those so we know there's there's

2941
02:44:36,880 --> 02:44:39,120
something malicious happening right but

2942
02:44:39,120 --> 02:44:40,479
how do you show that so fabio to answer

2943
02:44:40,479 --> 02:44:41,840
your question about why they're using a

2944
02:44:41,840 --> 02:44:44,080
hex editor um they're usually going to

2945
02:44:44,080 --> 02:44:46,240
be using a hex center here because they

2946
02:44:46,240 --> 02:44:47,359
wanted to just enter a bunch of

2947
02:44:47,359 --> 02:44:48,880
different bytes in and see how they were

2948
02:44:48,880 --> 02:44:49,920
decoded

2949
02:44:49,920 --> 02:44:51,600
how are they disassembled as 64-bit and

2950
02:44:51,600 --> 02:44:54,080
32-bit disassembly because that's again

2951
02:44:54,080 --> 02:44:55,359
the sort of crux of this of this

2952
02:44:55,359 --> 02:44:56,240
challenge

2953
02:44:56,240 --> 02:44:57,600
is that

2954
02:44:57,600 --> 02:44:59,200
the program tells you it's only going to

2955
02:44:59,200 --> 02:45:00,720
run your shelf code if it only contains

2956
02:45:00,720 --> 02:45:02,720
all all knobs

2957
02:45:02,720 --> 02:45:03,680
um

2958
02:45:03,680 --> 02:45:05,439
but it's not actually true because it's

2959
02:45:05,439 --> 02:45:06,640
it's going to disassemble them from one

2960
02:45:06,640 --> 02:45:08,000
architecture and then run them for the

2961
02:45:08,000 --> 02:45:09,439
other and so that's what you're trying

2962
02:45:09,439 --> 02:45:11,359
to exploit let's double check back on

2963
02:45:11,359 --> 02:45:14,000
our oh man this is this is tempting but

2964
02:45:14,000 --> 02:45:15,120
let's go back over to the democrats

2965
02:45:15,120 --> 02:45:18,240
let's go back to uh osu and let's let's

2966
02:45:18,240 --> 02:45:19,840
see where we're at over here

2967
02:45:19,840 --> 02:45:22,560
um yes so they are also looking at an op

2968
02:45:22,560 --> 02:45:24,399
code reference and

2969
02:45:24,399 --> 02:45:26,960
started writing a script so like they're

2970
02:45:26,960 --> 02:45:28,640
you know on the same page but they if

2971
02:45:28,640 --> 02:45:30,399
they get that ink they're only a minute

2972
02:45:30,399 --> 02:45:31,920
behind yes right like on someone who's

2973
02:45:31,920 --> 02:45:34,399
gonna say honestly if you've got an ink

2974
02:45:34,399 --> 02:45:36,800
uh they've they've still got a shot

2975
02:45:36,800 --> 02:45:39,600
again ben mann i i still know as much to

2976
02:45:39,600 --> 02:45:41,120
where i put it so let's let's go keep

2977
02:45:41,120 --> 02:45:43,439
our eye on back on the the ducks

2978
02:45:43,439 --> 02:45:46,000
uh see where the mighty ducks are at

2979
02:45:46,000 --> 02:45:48,000
and we're already looking at memory maps

2980
02:45:48,000 --> 02:45:49,920
and uh if we we should we should keep a

2981
02:45:49,920 --> 02:45:51,600
vote of jeff versus

2982
02:45:51,600 --> 02:45:54,960
uh you know yeah uh phone bag or all the

2983
02:45:54,960 --> 02:45:56,399
different other options

2984
02:45:56,399 --> 02:45:58,160
so here we go so they're using gear as

2985
02:45:58,160 --> 02:46:00,160
well for the but like i'm waiting for

2986
02:46:00,160 --> 02:46:01,040
like

2987
02:46:01,040 --> 02:46:02,240
i think i think they're just so much

2988
02:46:02,240 --> 02:46:03,439
faster than me because they flip the

2989
02:46:03,439 --> 02:46:04,560
gear and they flip away immediately i

2990
02:46:04,560 --> 02:46:05,760
don't know if they just remember the

2991
02:46:05,760 --> 02:46:08,160
disassembly so much yeah um i mean to be

2992
02:46:08,160 --> 02:46:09,920
free he just wanted to you know double

2993
02:46:09,920 --> 02:46:11,439
check like one small detail like yeah

2994
02:46:11,439 --> 02:46:13,359
you have ones one question that you want

2995
02:46:13,359 --> 02:46:15,120
answered you just check it back back out

2996
02:46:15,120 --> 02:46:16,640
like what what was the size of that buff

2997
02:46:16,640 --> 02:46:18,720
so again we've got the choice here

2998
02:46:18,720 --> 02:46:20,080
between what register do we want to

2999
02:46:20,080 --> 02:46:22,080
increment and so that's the key question

3000
02:46:22,080 --> 02:46:23,680
right which one is most useful and i

3001
02:46:23,680 --> 02:46:25,600
will say a debugger also makes a lot of

3002
02:46:25,600 --> 02:46:27,760
sense here too

3003
02:46:27,760 --> 02:46:29,520
yeah yeah ar absolutely i think

3004
02:46:29,520 --> 02:46:31,279
everybody is impressed osu stack and in

3005
02:46:31,279 --> 02:46:33,439
particular the most impressive thing

3006
02:46:33,439 --> 02:46:34,880
about osu sec is that they're one of the

3007
02:46:34,880 --> 02:46:36,800
few teams that didn't like combo up with

3008
02:46:36,800 --> 02:46:38,479
a million other teams right because a

3009
02:46:38,479 --> 02:46:39,840
lot of these other teams yeah to our

3010
02:46:39,840 --> 02:46:42,080
knowledge they are like actually just

3011
02:46:42,080 --> 02:46:43,920
osu sec yeah and it sounds like we've

3012
02:46:43,920 --> 02:46:45,600
got a lot of their fans in the chat and

3013
02:46:45,600 --> 02:46:47,439
yeah that's that's super impressive you

3014
02:46:47,439 --> 02:46:49,520
definitely get like an underdog vibe

3015
02:46:49,520 --> 02:46:51,120
and you you want them to do well because

3016
02:46:51,120 --> 02:46:52,479
they're competing against these like ctf

3017
02:46:52,479 --> 02:46:53,920
giants that are around for 10 years and

3018
02:46:53,920 --> 02:46:55,439
they're combined before the teams going

3019
02:46:55,439 --> 02:46:57,840
up against like ppp plus friends like

3020
02:46:57,840 --> 02:46:59,920
that's uh that's right that's daunting

3021
02:46:59,920 --> 02:47:02,479
yeah i've lost a lot to ppp without

3022
02:47:02,479 --> 02:47:06,438
friends we all uh

3023
02:47:06,479 --> 02:47:08,560
over the years all right so

3024
02:47:08,560 --> 02:47:11,520
uh take a look in the debugger

3025
02:47:11,520 --> 02:47:13,200
it seems like there's some kind of

3026
02:47:13,200 --> 02:47:15,600
controlled values in there and some like

3027
02:47:15,600 --> 02:47:17,040
is that the stack they're looking yeah

3028
02:47:17,040 --> 02:47:17,920
it's

3029
02:47:17,920 --> 02:47:19,680
linking the stack pointer looking at the

3030
02:47:19,680 --> 02:47:21,200
memory maps

3031
02:47:21,200 --> 02:47:23,359
again looking at like disassembly what

3032
02:47:23,359 --> 02:47:25,760
rp os x64

3033
02:47:25,760 --> 02:47:28,000
uh i don't know that

3034
02:47:28,000 --> 02:47:30,080
no that's yeah that's rp plus plus uh

3035
02:47:30,080 --> 02:47:32,800
that's another uh rop

3036
02:47:32,800 --> 02:47:34,319
okay

3037
02:47:34,319 --> 02:47:36,319
uh i uh

3038
02:47:36,319 --> 02:47:39,279
tend to use that one uh i think

3039
02:47:39,279 --> 02:47:40,399
like

3040
02:47:40,399 --> 02:47:42,240
all the cool kids nowadays use ropper

3041
02:47:42,240 --> 02:47:44,960
but i think before before that uh rp

3042
02:47:44,960 --> 02:47:47,600
plus plus was like the good stuff so i'm

3043
02:47:47,600 --> 02:47:49,120
still kind of using that

3044
02:47:49,120 --> 02:47:50,560
um this is one of things i'm actually

3045
02:47:50,560 --> 02:47:52,720
excited about too right is is seeing the

3046
02:47:52,720 --> 02:47:55,200
new toys and tools

3047
02:47:55,200 --> 02:47:57,439
uh because i i don't actively oh we got

3048
02:47:57,439 --> 02:47:58,640
a little bit of a gear there oh there we

3049
02:47:58,640 --> 02:48:01,040
go so we were looking for um

3050
02:48:01,040 --> 02:48:02,640
uh like it looked like god entries maybe

3051
02:48:02,640 --> 02:48:04,560
uh we were i saw a bunch of a list of

3052
02:48:04,560 --> 02:48:05,920
function pointers

3053
02:48:05,920 --> 02:48:08,880
so i yeah i haven't actively played ctf

3054
02:48:08,880 --> 02:48:10,880
in several years now and so i i you know

3055
02:48:10,880 --> 02:48:11,760
i know

3056
02:48:11,760 --> 02:48:13,200
enough to maybe make a small challenge

3057
02:48:13,200 --> 02:48:14,800
easy challenge uh and i know that's

3058
02:48:14,800 --> 02:48:16,080
gonna get destroyed by really good

3059
02:48:16,080 --> 02:48:16,960
people

3060
02:48:16,960 --> 02:48:18,479
but it's fun to see what are the latest

3061
02:48:18,479 --> 02:48:20,160
tools what you know what have you know i

3062
02:48:20,160 --> 02:48:21,279
kind of missed out on and watching

3063
02:48:21,279 --> 02:48:22,560
people

3064
02:48:22,560 --> 02:48:24,720
watching people do that so

3065
02:48:24,720 --> 02:48:25,680
all right

3066
02:48:25,680 --> 02:48:27,520
to recap we're

3067
02:48:27,520 --> 02:48:32,800
19 minutes in and we've got uh

3068
02:48:32,800 --> 02:48:34,479
at least one team

3069
02:48:34,479 --> 02:48:35,600
under this energy we're already in the

3070
02:48:35,600 --> 02:48:37,600
double let's go take a take a look back

3071
02:48:37,600 --> 02:48:39,680
over actually at osu because we aren't

3072
02:48:39,680 --> 02:48:41,760
in debugger yes that might be a good

3073
02:48:41,760 --> 02:48:43,359
sign you can see them stepping through a

3074
02:48:43,359 --> 02:48:46,479
whole bunch of knobs which uh

3075
02:48:46,479 --> 02:48:48,080
doesn't really give them anything so far

3076
02:48:48,080 --> 02:48:49,600
so i guess they're well but it's going

3077
02:48:49,600 --> 02:48:51,760
to say knob whether it is or not well in

3078
02:48:51,760 --> 02:48:53,279
the output right did you see what they

3079
02:48:53,279 --> 02:48:57,040
sent in no but you see in the debugger

3080
02:48:57,040 --> 02:48:58,960
and also in the output to the left it's

3081
02:48:58,960 --> 02:49:00,640
listed as knobs so they haven't found

3082
02:49:00,640 --> 02:49:02,720
the key mismatch yet

3083
02:49:02,720 --> 02:49:04,240
correct or if they have them but they

3084
02:49:04,240 --> 02:49:06,399
haven't existed yes they're like yeah

3085
02:49:06,399 --> 02:49:08,960
actually taking advantage of it

3086
02:49:08,960 --> 02:49:12,080
however you can see uh here over at uh

3087
02:49:12,080 --> 02:49:14,880
mmm that's uh you have like a sequence

3088
02:49:14,880 --> 02:49:15,920
of uh

3089
02:49:15,920 --> 02:49:18,640
x values uh listed here in the exploit

3090
02:49:18,640 --> 02:49:19,680
script

3091
02:49:19,680 --> 02:49:22,160
uh so they're they looks like they are

3092
02:49:22,160 --> 02:49:24,160
like going somewhere putting together oh

3093
02:49:24,160 --> 02:49:25,439
i wonder if they're putting together a

3094
02:49:25,439 --> 02:49:27,920
shell code payload in these immediates

3095
02:49:27,920 --> 02:49:31,040
see it's called smuggle32 oh nice i like

3096
02:49:31,040 --> 02:49:33,439
that and also again nice with nice

3097
02:49:33,439 --> 02:49:35,120
naming of things uh we've yeah we've

3098
02:49:35,120 --> 02:49:37,359
gone boring now now it's just x32 uh so

3099
02:49:37,359 --> 02:49:38,640
we lost the

3100
02:49:38,640 --> 02:49:40,880
oh the more interesting name yeah i mean

3101
02:49:40,880 --> 02:49:42,399
smuggler32 i think oh there we go okay

3102
02:49:42,399 --> 02:49:44,880
so inky sp oh no no sorry not shellcode

3103
02:49:44,880 --> 02:49:46,720
pointers right clearly yeah executable

3104
02:49:46,720 --> 02:49:48,080
code yes so they're gonna they're gonna

3105
02:49:48,080 --> 02:49:50,720
have a uh this x32 which is gonna let

3106
02:49:50,720 --> 02:49:53,040
them them rot potentially

3107
02:49:53,040 --> 02:49:54,720
and they're going to be able to ink the

3108
02:49:54,720 --> 02:49:56,479
stack pointer this sounds like a great

3109
02:49:56,479 --> 02:49:58,080
technique yes

3110
02:49:58,080 --> 02:50:00,000
stack pointer overwrite the return

3111
02:50:00,000 --> 02:50:01,920
address maybe

3112
02:50:01,920 --> 02:50:04,000
and and and go from there yeah you've

3113
02:50:04,000 --> 02:50:05,680
got to end in maybe either one gadget or

3114
02:50:05,680 --> 02:50:07,359
multiple gadgets or like you've got a

3115
02:50:07,359 --> 02:50:09,760
sort of straightforward shot

3116
02:50:09,760 --> 02:50:11,680
oh there's a win function or or maybe

3117
02:50:11,680 --> 02:50:13,760
you could oh you know what though

3118
02:50:13,760 --> 02:50:15,359
if a team doesn't actually open this

3119
02:50:15,359 --> 02:50:16,800
thing up in a disassembler if they only

3120
02:50:16,800 --> 02:50:18,880
use a debugger they won't see when

3121
02:50:18,880 --> 02:50:20,160
well they have the source codes oh they

3122
02:50:20,160 --> 02:50:21,359
had the source code they have the source

3123
02:50:21,359 --> 02:50:22,720
code that's a good but

3124
02:50:22,720 --> 02:50:24,560
this is definitely the thing that you

3125
02:50:24,560 --> 02:50:26,640
can like you know because i think it's

3126
02:50:26,640 --> 02:50:28,479
maybe like at the top of the like it's a

3127
02:50:28,479 --> 02:50:30,160
small function at the top of the file

3128
02:50:30,160 --> 02:50:31,520
like you know if you just scroll past

3129
02:50:31,520 --> 02:50:32,880
that because like you don't notice

3130
02:50:32,880 --> 02:50:34,640
honestly and then you build your mental

3131
02:50:34,640 --> 02:50:36,880
model all around like you know a rock

3132
02:50:36,880 --> 02:50:38,720
chain or or something

3133
02:50:38,720 --> 02:50:39,840
it's the kind of thing that happens a

3134
02:50:39,840 --> 02:50:41,279
lot in this environment when you're

3135
02:50:41,279 --> 02:50:42,800
doing a live ctf and you're under

3136
02:50:42,800 --> 02:50:44,399
pressure in your other gun

3137
02:50:44,399 --> 02:50:46,319
or you remembered it but it's 20 minutes

3138
02:50:46,319 --> 02:50:48,319
later and now you've forgotten it right

3139
02:50:48,319 --> 02:50:50,640
so it's it's possible we see somebody

3140
02:50:50,640 --> 02:50:52,399
get tunnel vision and miss that so i

3141
02:50:52,399 --> 02:50:53,840
mean i've done that like in in several

3142
02:50:53,840 --> 02:50:56,080
ctfs where like oh there was actually

3143
02:50:56,080 --> 02:50:57,920
this memory region that was like

3144
02:50:57,920 --> 02:50:58,960
writable

3145
02:50:58,960 --> 02:51:00,319
or something like you didn't see it the

3146
02:51:00,319 --> 02:51:02,080
binary is actually executable if you

3147
02:51:02,080 --> 02:51:03,120
know because it's running an emulator or

3148
02:51:03,120 --> 02:51:04,240
something and you assumed that the

3149
02:51:04,240 --> 02:51:06,800
permissions were yeah perfect it's uh

3150
02:51:06,800 --> 02:51:08,399
you know it it can lose you a lot of

3151
02:51:08,399 --> 02:51:10,000
hours

3152
02:51:10,000 --> 02:51:11,439
all right so we've got our ink esp

3153
02:51:11,439 --> 02:51:13,760
pattern we've got our and we are using

3154
02:51:13,760 --> 02:51:15,040
phone tools right so we're seeing pawn

3155
02:51:15,040 --> 02:51:16,319
tools do we i don't think we have a

3156
02:51:16,319 --> 02:51:18,319
payload yet we've still got

3157
02:51:18,319 --> 02:51:20,319
unfortunately for osu i think we we

3158
02:51:20,319 --> 02:51:22,160
don't have

3159
02:51:22,160 --> 02:51:24,080
an understanding yet

3160
02:51:24,080 --> 02:51:25,439
right i think we're kind of lost in the

3161
02:51:25,439 --> 02:51:27,520
weeds so so this is this is not looking

3162
02:51:27,520 --> 02:51:28,720
good over there we're gonna we're gonna

3163
02:51:28,720 --> 02:51:30,880
keep it on um

3164
02:51:30,880 --> 02:51:33,120
keep it on on the ducks and and see if

3165
02:51:33,120 --> 02:51:34,479
we can

3166
02:51:34,479 --> 02:51:36,160
uh see if this will this this will come

3167
02:51:36,160 --> 02:51:37,120
in

3168
02:51:37,120 --> 02:51:38,640
right because this is i mean this is

3169
02:51:38,640 --> 02:51:39,840
looking really good right we've got the

3170
02:51:39,840 --> 02:51:41,520
ability we've got

3171
02:51:41,520 --> 02:51:42,880
the ability to misalign the stack which

3172
02:51:42,880 --> 02:51:44,560
gets us a return address overwrite which

3173
02:51:44,560 --> 02:51:46,399
gets us an instruction pointer and we've

3174
02:51:46,399 --> 02:51:48,160
got a win function right it looks like

3175
02:51:48,160 --> 02:51:49,920
we're here don't make this a file now we

3176
02:51:49,920 --> 02:51:51,680
have aslr do we need to know if it's

3177
02:51:51,680 --> 02:51:54,800
randomized or is it uh yeah this is uh i

3178
02:51:54,800 --> 02:51:56,800
believe if if the the source if they

3179
02:51:56,800 --> 02:51:58,640
pull up the source again the first line

3180
02:51:58,640 --> 02:52:00,000
of the source was the build instructions

3181
02:52:00,000 --> 02:52:02,080
that was used to compile that binary

3182
02:52:02,080 --> 02:52:03,760
so we would know if they flashed that

3183
02:52:03,760 --> 02:52:05,040
again real quick

3184
02:52:05,040 --> 02:52:06,560
um

3185
02:52:06,560 --> 02:52:08,880
we've got uh not coding.c so oh we're

3186
02:52:08,880 --> 02:52:10,080
one away it makes you want to like you

3187
02:52:10,080 --> 02:52:12,720
know yeah yeah we should have like um

3188
02:52:12,720 --> 02:52:14,160
some type of plug-in on their computer

3189
02:52:14,160 --> 02:52:15,279
yeah just like no no we need to look at

3190
02:52:15,279 --> 02:52:17,920
this wow really yeah the the later

3191
02:52:17,920 --> 02:52:19,520
iteration of this we're gonna have more

3192
02:52:19,520 --> 02:52:21,040
you know i think machines here but we're

3193
02:52:21,040 --> 02:52:22,800
already overloading the number of

3194
02:52:22,800 --> 02:52:24,640
available usb ports even with several

3195
02:52:24,640 --> 02:52:27,279
hubs yeah um so

3196
02:52:27,279 --> 02:52:31,120
i i'm curious i know there's a lot of uh

3197
02:52:31,120 --> 02:52:33,920
beaver fans in the uh in the chat

3198
02:52:33,920 --> 02:52:36,160
you all still got faith are you still

3199
02:52:36,160 --> 02:52:39,680
still not hope or are are you um

3200
02:52:39,680 --> 02:52:42,399
there we go see hanging so you've

3201
02:52:42,399 --> 02:52:44,720
there there are still the oregon fans

3202
02:52:44,720 --> 02:52:46,399
out there right oregon i said it right

3203
02:52:46,399 --> 02:52:48,000
this time okay good

3204
02:52:48,000 --> 02:52:49,359
i'll get it right all right you can just

3205
02:52:49,359 --> 02:52:50,960
keep rotating around like it's just

3206
02:52:50,960 --> 02:52:52,319
different hose each time i mean they

3207
02:52:52,319 --> 02:52:54,240
might get yeah

3208
02:52:54,240 --> 02:52:57,040
oregon to just all of them yeah all

3209
02:52:57,040 --> 02:52:59,359
right so

3210
02:52:59,359 --> 02:53:01,520
now you can see there again doing some

3211
02:53:01,520 --> 02:53:03,359
like brute force looking for something

3212
02:53:03,359 --> 02:53:05,600
else yeah so this to me is like is is

3213
02:53:05,600 --> 02:53:06,880
like somebody stepping back saying i'm

3214
02:53:06,880 --> 02:53:08,160
not sure i have all the guys like i

3215
02:53:08,160 --> 02:53:09,359
think that was all the gadgets they

3216
02:53:09,359 --> 02:53:10,560
needed

3217
02:53:10,560 --> 02:53:12,800
i think that was sufficient to win glenn

3218
02:53:12,800 --> 02:53:14,960
is that sufficient or is there more to

3219
02:53:14,960 --> 02:53:16,160
it

3220
02:53:16,160 --> 02:53:18,319
we're getting him mostly from glenn

3221
02:53:18,319 --> 02:53:20,240
yeah and i can't hear him at all i can't

3222
02:53:20,240 --> 02:53:21,680
hear you unfortunately

3223
02:53:21,680 --> 02:53:23,120
we're just gonna roll with it and say

3224
02:53:23,120 --> 02:53:24,800
that you know there might be if need a

3225
02:53:24,800 --> 02:53:26,399
few instructions but i mean you should

3226
02:53:26,399 --> 02:53:27,680
be able to

3227
02:53:27,680 --> 02:53:29,200
because you're sure you can increment

3228
02:53:29,200 --> 02:53:30,160
the stack pointer right but then you

3229
02:53:30,160 --> 02:53:31,760
need to actually modify the value so you

3230
02:53:31,760 --> 02:53:34,000
need one more thing to actually like no

3231
02:53:34,000 --> 02:53:36,560
no if your buffer is on the stack

3232
02:53:36,560 --> 02:53:39,279
then you don't need to do any such thing

3233
02:53:39,279 --> 02:53:41,040
you can just return when it points to

3234
02:53:41,040 --> 02:53:43,600
your uh if if your input that you send

3235
02:53:43,600 --> 02:53:45,840
in is is on the stack all right yes you

3236
02:53:45,840 --> 02:53:47,600
just yeah yeah yeah so you do okay of

3237
02:53:47,600 --> 02:53:50,640
course of course so i i think a variant

3238
02:53:50,640 --> 02:53:52,560
of that is possible right in this

3239
02:53:52,560 --> 02:53:54,960
particular binary so but your input is

3240
02:53:54,960 --> 02:53:56,000
still

3241
02:53:56,000 --> 02:53:59,359
slightly constrained then under like

3242
02:53:59,359 --> 02:54:00,800
let's say you would put you would put

3243
02:54:00,800 --> 02:54:03,200
like a return address or like a

3244
02:54:03,200 --> 02:54:05,439
something there i don't remember the the

3245
02:54:05,439 --> 02:54:08,080
source code if this was like uh string

3246
02:54:08,080 --> 02:54:09,439
operations if a null terminate will

3247
02:54:09,439 --> 02:54:12,240
break it or not that's that's i see okay

3248
02:54:12,240 --> 02:54:14,080
right yeah so you could potentially

3249
02:54:14,080 --> 02:54:16,160
smuggle it like behind the

3250
02:54:16,160 --> 02:54:18,319
other stuff but yeah

3251
02:54:18,319 --> 02:54:20,160
but no you give it binary because it

3252
02:54:20,160 --> 02:54:22,160
disassembles it it doesn't assemble your

3253
02:54:22,160 --> 02:54:23,279
that's right that's right you give it

3254
02:54:23,279 --> 02:54:25,200
the the hex and it's actually going to

3255
02:54:25,200 --> 02:54:27,040
you know put that buffer as those bytes

3256
02:54:27,040 --> 02:54:29,680
yeah yeah yes uh presumably do it

3257
02:54:29,680 --> 02:54:30,479
right

3258
02:54:30,479 --> 02:54:32,240
five minutes to a fresh start no no no

3259
02:54:32,240 --> 02:54:33,600
we have

3260
02:54:33,600 --> 02:54:35,920
so they they have plenty of time left

3261
02:54:35,920 --> 02:54:37,279
um well

3262
02:54:37,279 --> 02:54:38,880
so we are coming up on

3263
02:54:38,880 --> 02:54:40,960
this is the point where if neither team

3264
02:54:40,960 --> 02:54:42,720
had made progress we'd walk over to him

3265
02:54:42,720 --> 02:54:43,840
and we'd say

3266
02:54:43,840 --> 02:54:47,760
you need to misalign your your

3267
02:54:47,760 --> 02:54:49,040
and you need to find a gadget that's

3268
02:54:49,040 --> 02:54:51,920
going to let you uh get the payload

3269
02:54:51,920 --> 02:54:52,880
um

3270
02:54:52,880 --> 02:54:55,200
but because because we're already seeing

3271
02:54:55,200 --> 02:54:57,040
at least once at least one team has sort

3272
02:54:57,040 --> 02:54:59,439
of made it to that point yeah and

3273
02:54:59,439 --> 02:55:01,120
clearly that's the case which has been

3274
02:55:01,120 --> 02:55:03,279
for several several minutes now um we're

3275
02:55:03,279 --> 02:55:05,840
not going to now that said

3276
02:55:05,840 --> 02:55:08,319
if we come up on 45 minutes

3277
02:55:08,319 --> 02:55:10,080
we do hit sudden death mode and we will

3278
02:55:10,080 --> 02:55:12,720
swatch over so there is 20 minutes left

3279
02:55:12,720 --> 02:55:15,680
where if the duck doesn't successfully

3280
02:55:15,680 --> 02:55:17,279
finish this challenge

3281
02:55:17,279 --> 02:55:18,720
in the next 20 minutes there is still a

3282
02:55:18,720 --> 02:55:20,720
chance that we go to sudden death

3283
02:55:20,720 --> 02:55:22,560
and our beavers could have a chance yes

3284
02:55:22,560 --> 02:55:25,359
so that's that is absolutely possible

3285
02:55:25,359 --> 02:55:27,920
let's uh

3286
02:55:27,920 --> 02:55:29,200
all right i'm gonna just look for a

3287
02:55:29,200 --> 02:55:30,640
second and try to try to get caught up

3288
02:55:30,640 --> 02:55:32,720
here where we're at because

3289
02:55:32,720 --> 02:55:34,240
it's a little concerning when i see

3290
02:55:34,240 --> 02:55:36,000
going back to the well of trying to find

3291
02:55:36,000 --> 02:55:40,640
more gadgets right um and i'm wondering

3292
02:55:40,640 --> 02:55:41,920
we're still looking for more patterns

3293
02:55:41,920 --> 02:55:43,279
but as far as we know we think there's

3294
02:55:43,279 --> 02:55:44,800
enough gadgets uh we think there's

3295
02:55:44,800 --> 02:55:46,319
enough gadgets there

3296
02:55:46,319 --> 02:55:47,680
yep

3297
02:55:47,680 --> 02:55:50,080
uh i have actually not looked at our

3298
02:55:50,080 --> 02:55:52,800
reference solution for this so

3299
02:55:52,800 --> 02:55:54,560
i don't know exactly what instructions

3300
02:55:54,560 --> 02:55:56,080
it contains but

3301
02:55:56,080 --> 02:55:57,760
i thought it was an uh i thought it was

3302
02:55:57,760 --> 02:55:59,279
an ink esp actually or an anchor deck

3303
02:55:59,279 --> 02:56:01,120
esp one of the two to like misalign the

3304
02:56:01,120 --> 02:56:02,479
the stack pointer

3305
02:56:02,479 --> 02:56:04,960
uh into a buffer you controlled right so

3306
02:56:04,960 --> 02:56:06,000
we've got a question about the sun and

3307
02:56:06,000 --> 02:56:07,520
diff thing yeah so yeah we have this

3308
02:56:07,520 --> 02:56:09,520
phase so there's a time limit of uh 45

3309
02:56:09,520 --> 02:56:12,080
minutes so if they hit that we will stop

3310
02:56:12,080 --> 02:56:14,880
the challenge because then uh it was uh

3311
02:56:14,880 --> 02:56:16,960
well we don't want to drag this on for

3312
02:56:16,960 --> 02:56:18,960
too long so in particular the whole

3313
02:56:18,960 --> 02:56:21,760
match on every team versus team matchup

3314
02:56:21,760 --> 02:56:23,120
really needs to stay under an hour

3315
02:56:23,120 --> 02:56:24,479
otherwise the schedule starts slipping

3316
02:56:24,479 --> 02:56:25,840
and throws off all the other events

3317
02:56:25,840 --> 02:56:27,840
right so this

3318
02:56:27,840 --> 02:56:29,520
what's that

3319
02:56:29,520 --> 02:56:30,560
all right do you want it do you want to

3320
02:56:30,560 --> 02:56:32,000
get on the mic and do it or you just

3321
02:56:32,000 --> 02:56:33,840
want to like tell us from there

3322
02:56:33,840 --> 02:56:37,200
uh you have a mic over there you

3323
02:56:37,200 --> 02:56:39,680
actually that mic is even still live

3324
02:56:39,680 --> 02:56:41,359
so careful rubbing it on things but if

3325
02:56:41,359 --> 02:56:43,120
you talk into that mic

3326
02:56:43,120 --> 02:56:44,000
um

3327
02:56:44,000 --> 02:56:45,760
it might just be easier to hold it

3328
02:56:45,760 --> 02:56:47,120
and try to put it on it's up to you

3329
02:56:47,120 --> 02:56:48,960
there we go so i think we've got glenn

3330
02:56:48,960 --> 02:56:50,160
it looks like your levels are all right

3331
02:56:50,160 --> 02:56:51,920
let's see if this is our producer glenn

3332
02:56:51,920 --> 02:56:53,760
and challenge author glenn

3333
02:56:53,760 --> 02:56:55,520
is gonna come come here we'll tell you a

3334
02:56:55,520 --> 02:56:57,200
little bit more uh rakesh about sudden

3335
02:56:57,200 --> 02:56:58,880
death in a second let's let glenn talk a

3336
02:56:58,880 --> 02:57:00,479
little bit more about what the expected

3337
02:57:00,479 --> 02:57:02,479
solution is here all right so this is

3338
02:57:02,479 --> 02:57:04,399
why this is why the uh um the

3339
02:57:04,399 --> 02:57:05,840
competitors have those earmuffs on so

3340
02:57:05,840 --> 02:57:07,120
they can't hear us as we're talking

3341
02:57:07,120 --> 02:57:08,479
about all these details let me just make

3342
02:57:08,479 --> 02:57:10,880
sure the levels are actually working

3343
02:57:10,880 --> 02:57:13,040
all right so generally speaking the way

3344
02:57:13,040 --> 02:57:16,000
that this works is since you have the

3345
02:57:16,000 --> 02:57:19,600
difference between x86 32 and 64 bits

3346
02:57:19,600 --> 02:57:21,840
you can get what the mmm player has

3347
02:57:21,840 --> 02:57:25,760
found which is a like a rex w

3348
02:57:25,760 --> 02:57:28,399
knop which on

3349
02:57:28,399 --> 02:57:31,920
basically on x64 x8664 it disassembles

3350
02:57:31,920 --> 02:57:35,200
to a knob on 32-bit it disassembles to

3351
02:57:35,200 --> 02:57:37,279
decrement stack pointer

3352
02:57:37,279 --> 02:57:38,399
knob

3353
02:57:38,399 --> 02:57:40,399
from this you can gain control over the

3354
02:57:40,399 --> 02:57:42,399
stack pointer you can go either

3355
02:57:42,399 --> 02:57:45,840
direction but the way that the reference

3356
02:57:45,840 --> 02:57:48,399
solution works is it just

3357
02:57:48,399 --> 02:57:50,399
changes the stack pointer to point into

3358
02:57:50,399 --> 02:57:53,439
the buffer of knobs that you send to the

3359
02:57:53,439 --> 02:57:54,800
server

3360
02:57:54,800 --> 02:57:55,600
and

3361
02:57:55,600 --> 02:57:57,760
since the binary is not pi

3362
02:57:57,760 --> 02:57:59,920
and so the addresses are fixed and

3363
02:57:59,920 --> 02:58:01,600
there's a win function you should be

3364
02:58:01,600 --> 02:58:04,399
able to just get the stack pointer

3365
02:58:04,399 --> 02:58:06,479
such that when the function returns it

3366
02:58:06,479 --> 02:58:08,160
returns to the wind function i think we

3367
02:58:08,160 --> 02:58:09,520
need to give a hint and here's my

3368
02:58:09,520 --> 02:58:11,040
proposal here's here's the hit that i'm

3369
02:58:11,040 --> 02:58:13,600
going to give yeah i think mmm missed

3370
02:58:13,600 --> 02:58:16,479
the fact that this does not have pi okay

3371
02:58:16,479 --> 02:58:17,520
so they're looking for a more

3372
02:58:17,520 --> 02:58:19,279
complicated one but i also think that

3373
02:58:19,279 --> 02:58:22,160
osu has missed the 3464. we can give

3374
02:58:22,160 --> 02:58:24,319
them the same hints to both of them and

3375
02:58:24,319 --> 02:58:26,479
help them both out equally which is that

3376
02:58:26,479 --> 02:58:27,920
we can tell them

3377
02:58:27,920 --> 02:58:29,279
they need to double check how these

3378
02:58:29,279 --> 02:58:31,680
binaries were compiled

3379
02:58:31,680 --> 02:58:32,960
we need to tell them we need they need

3380
02:58:32,960 --> 02:58:34,319
to check the first line of source code

3381
02:58:34,319 --> 02:58:35,680
that tells them how the binary was

3382
02:58:35,680 --> 02:58:37,840
compiled yes that will tell them both

3383
02:58:37,840 --> 02:58:39,120
something useful to the state that

3384
02:58:39,120 --> 02:58:40,880
they're at yeah

3385
02:58:40,880 --> 02:58:42,319
all right so do you want to go again i

3386
02:58:42,319 --> 02:58:44,000
will go i'm going to go do that because

3387
02:58:44,000 --> 02:58:47,120
we did not um add like the messaging

3388
02:58:47,120 --> 02:58:49,200
thing so yeah yeah so i'll go tell them

3389
02:58:49,200 --> 02:58:51,279
so just write write a note out and then

3390
02:58:51,279 --> 02:58:52,560
just hand them to the note right where's

3391
02:58:52,560 --> 02:58:54,800
your notebook um there we go

3392
02:58:54,800 --> 02:58:56,720
and we'll do this we'll do this now so

3393
02:58:56,720 --> 02:58:57,920
we'll give them each that little bit

3394
02:58:57,920 --> 02:59:00,640
hint yeah uh and and to answer oh sorry

3395
02:59:00,640 --> 02:59:03,359
uh let glenn kill the

3396
02:59:03,359 --> 02:59:05,520
volume level on that third

3397
02:59:05,520 --> 02:59:06,479
yeah

3398
02:59:06,479 --> 02:59:07,600
mute that

3399
02:59:07,600 --> 02:59:09,200
sorry for the asmr there on the the

3400
02:59:09,200 --> 02:59:10,640
microphone as we set it down we got to

3401
02:59:10,640 --> 02:59:12,319
be like yeah

3402
02:59:12,319 --> 02:59:15,520
um i got you a pen yeah okay awesome i'm

3403
02:59:15,520 --> 02:59:16,720
tethered in because i wired my

3404
02:59:16,720 --> 02:59:18,319
microphone through my vest this last

3405
02:59:18,319 --> 02:59:19,760
time yeah i can't get it looking good

3406
02:59:19,760 --> 02:59:21,840
but uh you can explain some depth right

3407
02:59:21,840 --> 02:59:22,720
so

3408
02:59:22,720 --> 02:59:26,640
the the the sudden death plan

3409
02:59:26,720 --> 02:59:28,560
just keeping an eye on on on our duck

3410
02:59:28,560 --> 02:59:30,160
just to see if they've

3411
02:59:30,160 --> 02:59:31,600
got anything else the sudden death plan

3412
02:59:31,600 --> 02:59:32,880
is that if we get into a situation where

3413
02:59:32,880 --> 02:59:34,960
both teammates are stuck

3414
02:59:34,960 --> 02:59:36,960
neither one's making more progress

3415
02:59:36,960 --> 02:59:38,240
uh it's not looking like they're going

3416
02:59:38,240 --> 02:59:39,600
to solve at a time we have a totally

3417
02:59:39,600 --> 02:59:41,200
different challenge we have

3418
02:59:41,200 --> 02:59:44,160
an easier simpler quicker challenge that

3419
02:59:44,160 --> 02:59:45,920
we will field that is meant to just

3420
02:59:45,920 --> 02:59:47,439
break a tie essentially because we don't

3421
02:59:47,439 --> 02:59:48,720
want to have like something in where

3422
02:59:48,720 --> 02:59:51,279
neither one can solve it so if we get to

3423
02:59:51,279 --> 02:59:53,680
the point where we have so 15 more

3424
02:59:53,680 --> 02:59:56,800
minutes if we get to that point we will

3425
02:59:56,800 --> 02:59:59,439
uh deploy a sudden death challenge we'll

3426
02:59:59,439 --> 03:00:01,359
change it and say sorry uh you didn't

3427
03:00:01,359 --> 03:00:03,279
solve it in the 45 minutes here's

3428
03:00:03,279 --> 03:00:05,279
another challenge try that uh we haven't

3429
03:00:05,279 --> 03:00:06,800
figured out if that takes too long we

3430
03:00:06,800 --> 03:00:07,920
just gotta have to wait till that gets

3431
03:00:07,920 --> 03:00:08,720
done

3432
03:00:08,720 --> 03:00:10,319
um so hopefully those but those are

3433
03:00:10,319 --> 03:00:11,840
those are intended to be like

3434
03:00:11,840 --> 03:00:13,760
the easiest possible uh challenges that

3435
03:00:13,760 --> 03:00:15,600
we could do so that's what we're doing

3436
03:00:15,600 --> 03:00:16,720
with that we're writing out the same

3437
03:00:16,720 --> 03:00:19,120
hint to both teams

3438
03:00:19,120 --> 03:00:20,880
uh first line in this

3439
03:00:20,880 --> 03:00:22,960
first line of source code right so we're

3440
03:00:22,960 --> 03:00:24,479
to tell them that the they should they

3441
03:00:24,479 --> 03:00:26,000
should each double check how the binary

3442
03:00:26,000 --> 03:00:27,439
was compiled

3443
03:00:27,439 --> 03:00:29,200
i think that'll be nice both fair and

3444
03:00:29,200 --> 03:00:31,600
yet also useful to both of them so

3445
03:00:31,600 --> 03:00:33,600
we'll go ahead and do that

3446
03:00:33,600 --> 03:00:35,760
and uh get that to both the teams

3447
03:00:35,760 --> 03:00:36,960
because what's going to happen here is

3448
03:00:36,960 --> 03:00:38,800
again if if the duck can can finish this

3449
03:00:38,800 --> 03:00:40,000
out if they can actually successfully

3450
03:00:40,000 --> 03:00:41,359
solve this they have a shot at it but if

3451
03:00:41,359 --> 03:00:43,200
they don't um then they're going to

3452
03:00:43,200 --> 03:00:44,560
basically kind of be reset they're both

3453
03:00:44,560 --> 03:00:45,840
going back to zero

3454
03:00:45,840 --> 03:00:47,840
on this new challenge right so the new

3455
03:00:47,840 --> 03:00:50,640
challenge will

3456
03:00:51,520 --> 03:00:54,399
will uh be like fresh territory for both

3457
03:00:54,399 --> 03:00:55,439
of them so

3458
03:00:55,439 --> 03:00:57,200
uh let's let's

3459
03:00:57,200 --> 03:00:59,840
let's switch maybe to the uh

3460
03:00:59,840 --> 03:01:01,279
uh one of the other cameras and we can

3461
03:01:01,279 --> 03:01:03,600
see uh let's see in the background as uh

3462
03:01:03,600 --> 03:01:05,200
carl's gonna go deliver

3463
03:01:05,200 --> 03:01:07,680
our hints to both competitors

3464
03:01:07,680 --> 03:01:10,000
and uh we'll see if this has an impact

3465
03:01:10,000 --> 03:01:12,080
on them

3466
03:01:12,080 --> 03:01:14,000
and in the meantime

3467
03:01:14,000 --> 03:01:16,399
thank you thanks uh

3468
03:01:16,399 --> 03:01:18,319
is it down down or dawned on i forget i

3469
03:01:18,319 --> 03:01:19,359
feel like i should remember this because

3470
03:01:19,359 --> 03:01:21,439
i know i've seen the handle before

3471
03:01:21,439 --> 03:01:23,120
so that's a good question what is osu

3472
03:01:23,120 --> 03:01:24,479
sec up to let's i think we're just

3473
03:01:24,479 --> 03:01:25,920
looking at the source again it looks

3474
03:01:25,920 --> 03:01:26,800
like

3475
03:01:26,800 --> 03:01:28,000
um

3476
03:01:28,000 --> 03:01:30,399
so we have deployed the hint to both

3477
03:01:30,399 --> 03:01:31,680
players

3478
03:01:31,680 --> 03:01:32,960
um

3479
03:01:32,960 --> 03:01:34,960
and it's it's hard to tell because

3480
03:01:34,960 --> 03:01:37,359
they're just looking at the

3481
03:01:37,359 --> 03:01:39,120
yeah that's not a bad idea peter that

3482
03:01:39,120 --> 03:01:42,479
might need a bigger hint um we we could

3483
03:01:42,479 --> 03:01:43,920
we could give them both an explicit hint

3484
03:01:43,920 --> 03:01:45,760
of something like the binary is not

3485
03:01:45,760 --> 03:01:48,720
aslr'd and this is a 64 32-bit

3486
03:01:48,720 --> 03:01:50,880
misalignment um to get them both past

3487
03:01:50,880 --> 03:01:52,960
the next down thank you down down

3488
03:01:52,960 --> 03:01:55,200
um or maybe it was down dawn it could be

3489
03:01:55,200 --> 03:01:56,720
it could be one of each

3490
03:01:56,720 --> 03:02:00,479
so we do have uh

3491
03:02:00,560 --> 03:02:03,040
um a bigger hit we might have to give to

3492
03:02:03,040 --> 03:02:05,840
both of them we will see i i wouldn't i

3493
03:02:05,840 --> 03:02:07,760
would not be surprised and it's and it's

3494
03:02:07,760 --> 03:02:08,880
again this is one of those things where

3495
03:02:08,880 --> 03:02:10,319
if you're playing at home you look at

3496
03:02:10,319 --> 03:02:12,800
this and you think oh man

3497
03:02:12,800 --> 03:02:13,920
all you have to do is move the stack

3498
03:02:13,920 --> 03:02:15,520
pointer you should totally be able to

3499
03:02:15,520 --> 03:02:16,960
like finish this out

3500
03:02:16,960 --> 03:02:19,040
it is so different it's so different

3501
03:02:19,040 --> 03:02:21,040
when you are on the camera when you've

3502
03:02:21,040 --> 03:02:22,560
been stuck in the step for a while you

3503
03:02:22,560 --> 03:02:23,920
get kind of into rabbit holes you're

3504
03:02:23,920 --> 03:02:24,800
thinking

3505
03:02:24,800 --> 03:02:25,920
surely there's some other gadget that

3506
03:02:25,920 --> 03:02:26,960
i'm missing surely there's some other

3507
03:02:26,960 --> 03:02:28,479
thing that i need to find

3508
03:02:28,479 --> 03:02:30,160
um or if you feel like you just don't

3509
03:02:30,160 --> 03:02:32,720
even have a uh

3510
03:02:32,720 --> 03:02:33,680
have a way to do so let's go ahead and

3511
03:02:33,680 --> 03:02:35,439
prepare the next tint yup um that we'll

3512
03:02:35,439 --> 03:02:37,040
give them in a couple minutes if if one

3513
03:02:37,040 --> 03:02:38,080
of them starts to make more progress

3514
03:02:38,080 --> 03:02:39,920
maybe we'll we'll hold off

3515
03:02:39,920 --> 03:02:42,479
um and we'll see what happens

3516
03:02:42,479 --> 03:02:45,439
uh

3517
03:02:45,439 --> 03:02:47,200
i if we give them the op code we're

3518
03:02:47,200 --> 03:02:48,560
giving one team what the other one

3519
03:02:48,560 --> 03:02:50,319
already has

3520
03:02:50,319 --> 03:02:51,600
um

3521
03:02:51,600 --> 03:02:54,160
so i think this hint should say

3522
03:02:54,160 --> 03:02:56,479
um

3523
03:02:57,439 --> 03:03:00,000
yeah i mean maybe maybe we can

3524
03:03:00,000 --> 03:03:01,840
yeah let's think what what what's the

3525
03:03:01,840 --> 03:03:04,080
clock at yeah i think uh

3526
03:03:04,080 --> 03:03:07,680
sorry a few more minutes right and uh

3527
03:03:08,960 --> 03:03:10,880
so this is a question about how long so

3528
03:03:10,880 --> 03:03:13,120
the idea is that at 45 minutes we will

3529
03:03:13,120 --> 03:03:15,200
switch to the we start every match on

3530
03:03:15,200 --> 03:03:18,479
the hour so we started for us at 4 pm uh

3531
03:03:18,479 --> 03:03:21,279
pacific time so we're 34 minutes in so

3532
03:03:21,279 --> 03:03:23,120
we have 11 more minutes

3533
03:03:23,120 --> 03:03:26,800
uh before we

3534
03:03:26,800 --> 03:03:29,359
so we're uh are we brute forcing maybe

3535
03:03:29,359 --> 03:03:31,040
we're done brute forcing

3536
03:03:31,040 --> 03:03:33,120
yeah they've removed the for loop

3537
03:03:33,120 --> 03:03:35,040
okay so we're not putting some address

3538
03:03:35,040 --> 03:03:36,080
in there

3539
03:03:36,080 --> 03:03:39,800
uh this is test.pie

3540
03:03:42,319 --> 03:03:44,479
okay

3541
03:03:44,479 --> 03:03:45,439
so this

3542
03:03:45,439 --> 03:03:48,160
python quit unexpectedly nice

3543
03:03:48,160 --> 03:03:50,880
uh wait a minute

3544
03:03:50,880 --> 03:03:53,760
exactly launch

3545
03:03:53,760 --> 03:03:56,640
maybe we are close

3546
03:03:56,640 --> 03:04:01,760
yeah okay this is this is a good sign

3547
03:04:01,840 --> 03:04:05,120
okay yes oh look he's looking for system

3548
03:04:05,120 --> 03:04:07,279
okay okay

3549
03:04:07,279 --> 03:04:09,600
this looks positive i think i think the

3550
03:04:09,600 --> 03:04:12,880
the realization has been has stuck home

3551
03:04:12,880 --> 03:04:15,120
i think we're about to watch uh watch it

3552
03:04:15,120 --> 03:04:17,279
come with a home stretch i still don't

3553
03:04:17,279 --> 03:04:19,600
see osu's like unfortunately

3554
03:04:19,600 --> 03:04:22,960
coming up with that key 3264 insight

3555
03:04:22,960 --> 03:04:24,960
um even after they hinted the binary was

3556
03:04:24,960 --> 03:04:26,640
compiled for 32-bit but the disassembly

3557
03:04:26,640 --> 03:04:29,200
of 64-bit

3558
03:04:29,200 --> 03:04:30,800
so we're looking for a ben-sj string

3559
03:04:30,800 --> 03:04:32,240
we're going to pass it as an argument to

3560
03:04:32,240 --> 03:04:33,520
system right so they're going to skip

3561
03:04:33,520 --> 03:04:35,040
the win function they're going to just

3562
03:04:35,040 --> 03:04:38,080
uh put the but this is again

3563
03:04:38,080 --> 03:04:39,359
there's literally a win function yeah

3564
03:04:39,359 --> 03:04:40,560
they just need the address of that but

3565
03:04:40,560 --> 03:04:43,600
luckily this is 32-bit right so they can

3566
03:04:43,600 --> 03:04:45,279
just put the argument on the stack and

3567
03:04:45,279 --> 03:04:46,960
then i mean it's like exactly it's

3568
03:04:46,960 --> 03:04:49,680
marginally more difficult

3569
03:04:49,680 --> 03:04:50,960
addresses on this deck instead of one

3570
03:04:50,960 --> 03:04:52,160
address so

3571
03:04:52,160 --> 03:04:53,520
as long as there's room and i believe

3572
03:04:53,520 --> 03:04:54,880
there's there is plenty of room not a

3573
03:04:54,880 --> 03:04:56,960
huge loss but yeah definitely it could

3574
03:04:56,960 --> 03:04:59,680
have cost them okay this this is looking

3575
03:04:59,680 --> 03:05:01,359
real close we're getting the last

3576
03:05:01,359 --> 03:05:04,560
address in let's see if this does it uh

3577
03:05:04,560 --> 03:05:06,479
yeah again we predicted this earlier we

3578
03:05:06,479 --> 03:05:07,279
said

3579
03:05:07,279 --> 03:05:08,800
the wind function we gave them a source

3580
03:05:08,800 --> 03:05:12,160
it's very easy to miss you you 100

3581
03:05:12,160 --> 03:05:13,840
can get tunnel vision

3582
03:05:13,840 --> 03:05:15,279
and until either have forgotten about it

3583
03:05:15,279 --> 03:05:16,720
or never seen it in fact in this case i

3584
03:05:16,720 --> 03:05:18,720
wouldn't even be surprised never seen it

3585
03:05:18,720 --> 03:05:19,840
because there's not been a lot of poking

3586
03:05:19,840 --> 03:05:22,640
around in the uh no because it was so

3587
03:05:22,640 --> 03:05:24,640
quick at understanding like sort of what

3588
03:05:24,640 --> 03:05:26,000
the goal was yeah yeah exactly and

3589
03:05:26,000 --> 03:05:27,200
that's the thing then you build this

3590
03:05:27,200 --> 03:05:29,520
abstraction in your head mental model

3591
03:05:29,520 --> 03:05:32,880
like this this thing just doesn't exist

3592
03:05:32,880 --> 03:05:33,920
like

3593
03:05:33,920 --> 03:05:36,080
there it is congratulations

3594
03:05:36,080 --> 03:05:38,080
all right we have a win congratulations

3595
03:05:38,080 --> 03:05:39,439
to our ducks

3596
03:05:39,439 --> 03:05:40,720
i'm excited we didn't need a sudden

3597
03:05:40,720 --> 03:05:43,200
death that is our third round complete

3598
03:05:43,200 --> 03:05:47,800
we will see you all back here in about

3599
03:05:59,120 --> 03:06:00,080
we're done we're done we're done all

3600
03:06:00,080 --> 03:06:02,479
right congratulations okay we will see

3601
03:06:02,479 --> 03:06:04,479
everybody back here uh at the top of the

3602
03:06:04,479 --> 03:06:05,920
next hour

3603
03:06:05,920 --> 03:06:06,720
uh

3604
03:06:06,720 --> 03:06:08,720
very very fun match uh thanks to both

3605
03:06:08,720 --> 03:06:10,479

a bad cable one somewhere in our

03:39:59,439 --> 03:40:00,800
infrastructure is a bad cable and it's

3748
03:40:00,800 --> 03:40:02,399
causing one of our streams to have

3749
03:40:02,399 --> 03:40:03,279
issues

3750
03:40:03,279 --> 03:40:04,560
so we might have some intermittent

3751
03:40:04,560 --> 03:40:06,640
connectivity for one of our players uh

3752
03:40:06,640 --> 03:40:08,640

3754

3756
03:40:13,680 --> 03:40:15,040
let's go ahead and get a countdown of

3757
03:40:15,040 --> 03:40:16,080
five

3758
03:40:16,080 --> 03:40:16,960

3763
03:40:23,760 --> 03:40:25,120

3764
03:40:25,120 --> 03:40:27,040
uh we've already got the first one

3765
03:40:27,040 --> 03:40:28,800

3766
03:40:28,800 --> 03:40:29,840
actually can you grab me my notebook

3767
03:40:29,840 --> 03:40:32,640

this one we've got the new organizers

3769
03:40:36,080 --> 03:40:38,640
and i believe we've got team taiwan was

3770
03:40:38,640 --> 03:40:40,479
the name that they uh they requested

3771
03:40:40,479 --> 03:40:42,479
because it's again another one of these

3772
03:40:42,479 --> 03:40:44,160
these mega teams

3773
03:40:44,160 --> 03:40:46,560
that has a conglomeration of many

3774
03:40:46,560 --> 03:40:48,640
different uh different teams so we've

3775
03:40:48,640 --> 03:40:54,000
got team bulson team 217 team tsj.tw

3776
03:40:54,000 --> 03:40:55,439
uh and so there's another team that has

3777
03:40:55,439 --> 03:40:57,439
tw in the name that's tokyo westerns

3778
03:40:57,439 --> 03:40:59,199
right a japanese team but this is the

3779
03:40:59,199 --> 03:41:02,239
taiwanese team because it's tw right so

3780
03:41:02,239 --> 03:41:03,760
uh let's go ahead and mix up yeah let's

3781
03:41:03,760 --> 03:41:06,239
go ahead and take a look at a team i

3782
03:41:06,239 --> 03:41:07,760
think team balsam should be the one that

3783
03:41:07,760 --> 03:41:09,600
i've got over here on my monitor

3784
03:41:09,600 --> 03:41:11,520
and they are already off and they're in

3785
03:41:11,520 --> 03:41:13,359
ida looking at our challenge now again

3786
03:41:13,359 --> 03:41:14,560
you'll notice all of our challenges our

3787
03:41:14,560 --> 03:41:16,160
name challenge just the way that our

3788
03:41:16,160 --> 03:41:17,920
docker deployment kind of works the

3789
03:41:17,920 --> 03:41:19,840
official name of this challenge

3790
03:41:19,840 --> 03:41:20,960
is called

3791
03:41:20,960 --> 03:41:23,279
nerd sniped right

3792
03:41:23,279 --> 03:41:24,080
and

3793
03:41:24,080 --> 03:41:25,600
what are things you can get nerd sniped

3794
03:41:25,600 --> 03:41:28,399
by a lot of things but uh yeah

3795
03:41:28,399 --> 03:41:30,239
we'll see how i get nerve sniped by like

3796
03:41:30,239 --> 03:41:32,239
a rubik's cube yeah a good a good puzzle

3797
03:41:32,239 --> 03:41:34,000
maybe yeah a good puzzle you could see

3798
03:41:34,000 --> 03:41:36,479
maybe something like that that'll do it

3799
03:41:36,479 --> 03:41:38,720
uh so yeah so uh we got you 1080p

3800
03:41:38,720 --> 03:41:40,640
backing going hopefully we'll figure out

3801
03:41:40,640 --> 03:41:43,760
our uh our issue with our

3802
03:41:43,760 --> 03:41:46,479
our hdmi cable and we'll have uh much

3803
03:41:46,479 --> 03:41:47,920
better consistent capture across both

3804
03:41:47,920 --> 03:41:49,279
team members tomorrow

3805
03:41:49,279 --> 03:41:50,640
something about this cable is like it's

3806
03:41:50,640 --> 03:41:51,840
heating up or something cause the first

3807
03:41:51,840 --> 03:41:53,359
we had several hours of testing last

3808
03:41:53,359 --> 03:41:55,040
night with no problem

3809
03:41:55,040 --> 03:41:56,479
and something something's going on now

3810
03:41:56,479 --> 03:41:58,800
so we'll we'll give that a run

3811
03:41:58,800 --> 03:42:00,239
and sure enough i literally just saw a

3812
03:42:00,239 --> 03:42:02,640
rename solve puzzle so we've renamed

3813
03:42:02,640 --> 03:42:04,960
this function solve the puzzle

3814
03:42:04,960 --> 03:42:06,880
um so what they're looking for they know

3815
03:42:06,880 --> 03:42:08,720
it's a puzzle of some sort

3816
03:42:08,720 --> 03:42:10,800
i'm curious if we get uh someone just

3817
03:42:10,800 --> 03:42:12,560
kind of running it and interacting with

3818
03:42:12,560 --> 03:42:14,080
the binary or if we're doing more static

3819
03:42:14,080 --> 03:42:16,560
analysis

3820
03:42:16,560 --> 03:42:17,760
but actually yeah this should be should

3821
03:42:17,760 --> 03:42:19,120
be much higher quality with with a full

3822
03:42:19,120 --> 03:42:20,239
1080.

3823
03:42:20,239 --> 03:42:22,000
unfortunately we don't have even the

3824
03:42:22,000 --> 03:42:24,399
local recordings were also not

3825
03:42:24,399 --> 03:42:26,479
1080 they were only in 720 as well so i

3826
03:42:26,479 --> 03:42:28,720
apologize those first couple matches

3827
03:42:28,720 --> 03:42:30,399
we're not gonna have

3828
03:42:30,399 --> 03:42:33,520
uh we're not gonna have the the um

3829
03:42:33,520 --> 03:42:35,120
uh the higher quality video for those

3830
03:42:35,120 --> 03:42:36,319
either but

3831
03:42:36,319 --> 03:42:39,600
all 12 other matches from here on out

3832
03:42:39,600 --> 03:42:41,359
are gonna be in high def uh because we

3833
03:42:41,359 --> 03:42:43,040
have a lot of these to go so you'll see

3834
03:42:43,040 --> 03:42:44,239
your favorite players that won in the

3835
03:42:44,239 --> 03:42:45,920
first couple rounds they're gonna come

3836
03:42:45,920 --> 03:42:47,279
back we're gonna we're gonna see them

3837
03:42:47,279 --> 03:42:48,479
again

3838
03:42:48,479 --> 03:42:50,720
uh so oh no that was cool what was i

3839
03:42:50,720 --> 03:42:52,000
didn't i didn't notice that website have

3840
03:42:52,000 --> 03:42:53,840
you seen that one before

3841
03:42:53,840 --> 03:42:55,520
uh no i'm curious what that was so now

3842
03:42:55,520 --> 03:42:57,199
they're on the ubuntu repo

3843
03:42:57,199 --> 03:42:58,800
uh they're getting a particular g-lib c

3844
03:42:58,800 --> 03:43:00,720
version which makes sense

3845
03:43:00,720 --> 03:43:02,640
that's often common now i think for most

3846
03:43:02,640 --> 03:43:04,319
of these we like included the lib c if

3847
03:43:04,319 --> 03:43:06,960
we thought it was necessary yes um so

3848
03:43:06,960 --> 03:43:08,479
it's kind of a hit to the teams like if

3849
03:43:08,479 --> 03:43:10,239
we we we're we're trying to like give

3850
03:43:10,239 --> 03:43:11,600
out everything that we could

3851
03:43:11,600 --> 03:43:14,000
uh make it as self-contained as possible

3852
03:43:14,000 --> 03:43:17,120
and so we'll see uh we'll we'll see if

3853
03:43:17,120 --> 03:43:18,640
that one ends up ends up being useful

3854
03:43:18,640 --> 03:43:20,720
but we've got our binary challenge uh

3855
03:43:20,720 --> 03:43:23,520
this one is starting to to be a little

3856
03:43:23,520 --> 03:43:24,479
bit

3857
03:43:24,479 --> 03:43:25,920
more difficult though i would i would

3858
03:43:25,920 --> 03:43:27,600
say yeah our challenge difficulty is

3859
03:43:27,600 --> 03:43:30,160
cranking up yes a tiny bit

3860
03:43:30,160 --> 03:43:31,279
uh and we're going to see that kind of

3861
03:43:31,279 --> 03:43:32,560
trend throughout the whole the whole

3862
03:43:32,560 --> 03:43:33,920
rest of the weekend right i'm sure we'll

3863
03:43:33,920 --> 03:43:34,960
have some easier ones something somebody

3864
03:43:34,960 --> 03:43:36,880
finds an amazing solution too

3865
03:43:36,880 --> 03:43:38,560
solves it quickly yeah but on the topic

3866
03:43:38,560 --> 03:43:40,319
of like difficulty like

3867
03:43:40,319 --> 03:43:42,960
that's i mean we have an idea of like

3868
03:43:42,960 --> 03:43:44,479
what's more difficult and what's easier

3869
03:43:44,479 --> 03:43:46,000
and so on but

3870
03:43:46,000 --> 03:43:47,680
uh of course like we can be wrong like

3871
03:43:47,680 --> 03:43:49,520
people can have like different uh you

3872
03:43:49,520 --> 03:43:51,600
know specializations in their skill sets

3873
03:43:51,600 --> 03:43:54,080
and uh and so on so something that we

3874
03:43:54,080 --> 03:43:56,319
might think is in both directions right

3875
03:43:56,319 --> 03:43:58,000
right exactly yes so

3876
03:43:58,000 --> 03:44:00,239
uh something that we might think uh is

3877
03:44:00,239 --> 03:44:01,920
usually might be actually kind of tricky

3878
03:44:01,920 --> 03:44:03,520
and then the other way around so it's

3879
03:44:03,520 --> 03:44:05,279
going to be interesting to see what's

3880
03:44:05,279 --> 03:44:06,239
what's going on there's still some

3881
03:44:06,239 --> 03:44:07,680
reversing like the initial reverse

3882
03:44:07,680 --> 03:44:09,600
engineering going on of the

3883
03:44:09,600 --> 03:44:12,399
program for example this kind of step uh

3884
03:44:12,399 --> 03:44:13,920
was not really needed in the previous

3885
03:44:13,920 --> 03:44:14,960
challenge where we just gave them the

3886
03:44:14,960 --> 03:44:17,359
full source code yes with like names and

3887
03:44:17,359 --> 03:44:18,800
everything

3888
03:44:18,800 --> 03:44:19,600
um

3889
03:44:19,600 --> 03:44:22,479
and it is a uh yeah as an organizer you

3890
03:44:22,479 --> 03:44:24,239
have a lot of levers to pull you have a

3891
03:44:24,239 --> 03:44:25,680
lot it's ironic because we have the

3892
03:44:25,680 --> 03:44:27,120
organizers here uh playing on though

3893
03:44:27,120 --> 03:44:28,880
unfortunately they're on our non-capture

3894
03:44:28,880 --> 03:44:31,359
screen unfortunately um

3895
03:44:31,359 --> 03:44:32,800
i just had to make sure that we had them

3896
03:44:32,800 --> 03:44:33,840
lined up right i freaked out for a

3897
03:44:33,840 --> 03:44:35,279
second not realizing that yes they are

3898
03:44:35,279 --> 03:44:37,520
they are the right halves um

3899
03:44:37,520 --> 03:44:39,920
but uh the team organizers uh we're not

3900
03:44:39,920 --> 03:44:41,920
seeing them but as a challenge organizer

3901
03:44:41,920 --> 03:44:43,520
as somebody making challenges

3902
03:44:43,520 --> 03:44:45,279
you can strip a binder you cannot serve

3903
03:44:45,279 --> 03:44:46,960
a binder you can include debug symbols

3904
03:44:46,960 --> 03:44:48,080
you cannot have any you know so all

3905
03:44:48,080 --> 03:44:49,359
these yeah different levels of

3906
03:44:49,359 --> 03:44:51,760
optimizations yeah like because a lot of

3907
03:44:51,760 --> 03:44:53,680
optimization also kind of acts as a

3908
03:44:53,680 --> 03:44:55,359
slight like objection

3909
03:44:55,359 --> 03:44:58,160
obfuscation yeah yeah so um we've all

3910
03:44:58,160 --> 03:44:59,600
seen these like you know

3911
03:44:59,600 --> 03:45:01,760
optimized uh mem copies and everything

3912
03:45:01,760 --> 03:45:03,600
but you have all these like magic stuff

3913
03:45:03,600 --> 03:45:04,880
going on yeah

3914
03:45:04,880 --> 03:45:07,359
so yeah yeah you get vector operations

3915
03:45:07,359 --> 03:45:09,199
and you're in your mem copies

3916
03:45:09,199 --> 03:45:10,000
so

3917
03:45:10,000 --> 03:45:11,680
yeah and that's and that's where to some

3918
03:45:11,680 --> 03:45:13,439
degree you can make

3919
03:45:13,439 --> 03:45:15,120
uh an easy challenge hard with just

3920
03:45:15,120 --> 03:45:17,359
tedious things yeah so it is interesting

3921
03:45:17,359 --> 03:45:18,720
that you see a lot of sort of like i

3922
03:45:18,720 --> 03:45:20,319
would say cheap challenge design where

3923
03:45:20,319 --> 03:45:21,600
it's like yeah we just made it harder by

3924
03:45:21,600 --> 03:45:23,520
doing x right it didn't make it more

3925
03:45:23,520 --> 03:45:25,120
interesting it just made it like yeah

3926
03:45:25,120 --> 03:45:27,199
just slightly more annoying to do the

3927
03:45:27,199 --> 03:45:28,720
thing that you want so it's sometimes a

3928
03:45:28,720 --> 03:45:31,040
really good easy challenge is actually

3929
03:45:31,040 --> 03:45:32,720
like you're just really focusing on that

3930
03:45:32,720 --> 03:45:34,080
one core thing that you want you want to

3931
03:45:34,080 --> 03:45:36,399
do yeah which makes a lot of fun for for

3932
03:45:36,399 --> 03:45:38,960
what we're doing here so right

3933
03:45:38,960 --> 03:45:41,359
so still that's i'm reversing trying to

3934
03:45:41,359 --> 03:45:42,880
name different things we've seen like

3935
03:45:42,880 --> 03:45:44,640
the name the functions like soul puzzle

3936
03:45:44,640 --> 03:45:46,000
and you see some variables getting named

3937
03:45:46,000 --> 03:45:48,560
like the input

3938
03:45:48,560 --> 03:45:50,000
it's all trying to like get get an

3939
03:45:50,000 --> 03:45:51,600
understanding of

3940
03:45:51,600 --> 03:45:54,319
what is this program doing uh and there

3941
03:45:54,319 --> 03:45:56,080
are kind of like two parts to it like

3942
03:45:56,080 --> 03:45:58,000
first of all like what's the um

3943
03:45:58,000 --> 03:46:00,000
intended functionality of the program

3944
03:46:00,000 --> 03:46:01,520
and then from there you can start to

3945
03:46:01,520 --> 03:46:04,399
understand uh in in what way is it

3946
03:46:04,399 --> 03:46:06,399
acting uh not as intended like where's

3947
03:46:06,399 --> 03:46:08,560
the box or well in this case we're where

3948
03:46:08,560 --> 03:46:09,920
the

3949
03:46:09,920 --> 03:46:12,160
the author intended a bug right but in

3950
03:46:12,160 --> 03:46:13,439
the normal case where it's unintended

3951
03:46:13,439 --> 03:46:14,960
vulnerabilities yeah exactly or in this

3952
03:46:14,960 --> 03:46:17,120
case what's the surface level intended

3953
03:46:17,120 --> 03:46:18,479
what's it what's it claimed to be able

3954
03:46:18,479 --> 03:46:20,560
to do yes uh and then what is it what

3955
03:46:20,560 --> 03:46:22,000
does it actually do that maybe that may

3956
03:46:22,000 --> 03:46:24,160
be different right

3957
03:46:24,160 --> 03:46:26,640
so let's see uh what we're doing so and

3958
03:46:26,640 --> 03:46:27,760
this is nice too because we're actually

3959
03:46:27,760 --> 03:46:28,800
getting this is the first time we've

3960
03:46:28,800 --> 03:46:29,840
seen a little reverse engineering

3961
03:46:29,840 --> 03:46:31,840
workflow yes a lot of the other ones

3962
03:46:31,840 --> 03:46:34,080
have been like basically a quick glance

3963
03:46:34,080 --> 03:46:36,160
at the code or disassembly has kind of

3964
03:46:36,160 --> 03:46:38,640
like revealed what's going on yeah here

3965
03:46:38,640 --> 03:46:40,160
they actually need to kind of understand

3966
03:46:40,160 --> 03:46:42,000
what is going on

3967
03:46:42,000 --> 03:46:44,319
okay so we're still sort of starting our

3968
03:46:44,319 --> 03:46:46,800
framework for our our exploit here but i

3969
03:46:46,800 --> 03:46:48,160
think it's just

3970
03:46:48,160 --> 03:46:49,680
getting the menus and interacting with

3971
03:46:49,680 --> 03:46:51,120
it right and so we're looking oh okay so

3972
03:46:51,120 --> 03:46:53,120
there's a current puzzle state

3973
03:46:53,120 --> 03:46:54,479
all right so

3974
03:46:54,479 --> 03:46:55,840
puzzle that puzzle looked interesting

3975
03:46:55,840 --> 03:46:57,279
that looked like maybe like a nine by

3976
03:46:57,279 --> 03:46:59,520
nine grid yes of number numbers yeah it

3977
03:46:59,520 --> 03:47:01,680
could be uh maybe like a sudoku i i

3978
03:47:01,680 --> 03:47:03,600
think that's a great guess and of course

3979
03:47:03,600 --> 03:47:04,800
you know we're a little little spoiled

3980
03:47:04,800 --> 03:47:06,560
here a little tainted knowledge but this

3981
03:47:06,560 --> 03:47:09,120
is indeed a sudoku uh in fact when we

3982
03:47:09,120 --> 03:47:10,800
when when somebody was like

3983
03:47:10,800 --> 03:47:12,160
kind of play testing and validating this

3984
03:47:12,160 --> 03:47:13,760
challenge we sort of were like wait a

3985
03:47:13,760 --> 03:47:16,080
minute you just you just saw the sudoku

3986
03:47:16,080 --> 03:47:17,600
and that's it and the author was like no

3987
03:47:17,600 --> 03:47:19,199
no no no

3988
03:47:19,199 --> 03:47:20,880
that's not actually not actually

3989
03:47:20,880 --> 03:47:22,000
possible

3990
03:47:22,000 --> 03:47:23,600
so it is a little bit trickier than that

3991
03:47:23,600 --> 03:47:25,760
so we'll see as our teams discover

3992
03:47:25,760 --> 03:47:26,640
um

3993
03:47:26,640 --> 03:47:28,239
it's not just a straight put it into a

3994
03:47:28,239 --> 03:47:30,160
sudoku solver get a correct answer and

3995
03:47:30,160 --> 03:47:31,359
win

3996
03:47:31,359 --> 03:47:32,720
it is gonna be a little bit more tricky

3997
03:47:32,720 --> 03:47:34,160
and this is one

3998
03:47:34,160 --> 03:47:36,239
i i'm almost positive we're gonna need a

3999
03:47:36,239 --> 03:47:38,960
hint on right so i'm i'm gonna propose

4000
03:47:38,960 --> 03:47:41,199
at like 15 minutes in

4001
03:47:41,199 --> 03:47:43,199
if we don't see

4002
03:47:43,199 --> 03:47:45,600
um like progress progress and in fact

4003
03:47:45,600 --> 03:47:46,479
actually let's why don't you go ahead

4004
03:47:46,479 --> 03:47:47,680
and take a take a look at the organizers

4005
03:47:47,680 --> 03:47:49,840
maybe too i will do that and if we if

4006
03:47:49,840 --> 03:47:52,239
we're looking for them to to uh kind of

4007
03:47:52,239 --> 03:47:53,359
have a hint as to what they're doing

4008
03:47:53,359 --> 03:47:54,239
like indicate that they know what

4009
03:47:54,239 --> 03:47:55,840
they're doing

4010
03:47:55,840 --> 03:47:57,439
yeah yeah

4011
03:47:57,439 --> 03:47:59,279
oh does it come on occasionally okay

4012
03:47:59,279 --> 03:48:00,720
so it's apparently flickering in and out

4013
03:48:00,720 --> 03:48:02,560
occasionally we're getting getting our

4014
03:48:02,560 --> 03:48:03,600
video

4015
03:48:03,600 --> 03:48:05,439
we we swapped out the capture card that

4016
03:48:05,439 --> 03:48:07,520
worked for a while until it didn't uh

4017
03:48:07,520 --> 03:48:09,279
and then we swapped out the usb-c cable

4018
03:48:09,279 --> 03:48:10,319
and that would for a while until it

4019
03:48:10,319 --> 03:48:12,160
didn't and so now we're convinced that

4020
03:48:12,160 --> 03:48:14,479
it's just the hdmi cable itself

4021
03:48:14,479 --> 03:48:16,239
uh that is closing trouble and i think

4022
03:48:16,239 --> 03:48:17,600
this has been true even if we were

4023
03:48:17,600 --> 03:48:20,160
direct wired into the laptop so it's not

4024
03:48:20,160 --> 03:48:22,640
the capture on the other side

4025
03:48:22,640 --> 03:48:24,640
yes because we also did swap out the

4026
03:48:24,640 --> 03:48:27,279
usbc adapter once too so we've swapped

4027
03:48:27,279 --> 03:48:29,279
every component except the the hdmi

4028
03:48:29,279 --> 03:48:30,239
cable

4029
03:48:30,239 --> 03:48:31,439
uh

4030
03:48:31,439 --> 03:48:33,279
partly because they're like taped to the

4031
03:48:33,279 --> 03:48:34,560
floor and they're a 30 foot long cable

4032
03:48:34,560 --> 03:48:35,840
so we got to go and get some oh there we

4033
03:48:35,840 --> 03:48:37,040
go i saw

4034
03:48:37,040 --> 03:48:39,680
i did see a solver pop up briefly i saw

4035
03:48:39,680 --> 03:48:41,279
something i'm just gonna say also the

4036
03:48:41,279 --> 03:48:43,680
player from the organizers copy pasted

4037
03:48:43,680 --> 03:48:46,239
the uh current state of the puzzle into

4038
03:48:46,239 --> 03:48:48,720
and they googled for a sudoku solver

4039
03:48:48,720 --> 03:48:51,279
um so we'll see to what extent that will

4040
03:48:51,279 --> 03:48:52,399
help them

4041
03:48:52,399 --> 03:48:54,720
um it's i mean

4042
03:48:54,720 --> 03:48:56,960
again i'm not completely familiar with

4043
03:48:56,960 --> 03:48:57,840
the

4044
03:48:57,840 --> 03:49:00,000
intended solution here but

4045
03:49:00,000 --> 03:49:03,439
i would assume that it still involves

4046
03:49:03,439 --> 03:49:04,160
like

4047
03:49:04,160 --> 03:49:06,319
solving the sudoku but not only doing

4048
03:49:06,319 --> 03:49:09,040
that it is trickier than that

4049
03:49:09,040 --> 03:49:10,479
yeah that's right so

4050
03:49:10,479 --> 03:49:13,120
um i have a little bit more info um yeah

4051
03:49:13,120 --> 03:49:14,319
we're still seeing that that kind of

4052
03:49:14,319 --> 03:49:17,199
silver flash in and out occasionally

4053
03:49:17,199 --> 03:49:19,680
um on on the display

4054
03:49:19,680 --> 03:49:21,199
so uh

4055
03:49:21,199 --> 03:49:22,960
it it there's gonna be some memory

4056
03:49:22,960 --> 03:49:24,479
corruption here yeah there is indeed

4057
03:49:24,479 --> 03:49:26,720
this is not just now although i will say

4058
03:49:26,720 --> 03:49:29,359
it is actually a perfectly valid

4059
03:49:29,359 --> 03:49:31,120
category of challenge and a lot of ctfs

4060
03:49:31,120 --> 03:49:33,199
right where you would actually do have

4061
03:49:33,199 --> 03:49:35,680
a more programming challenge or a puzzle

4062
03:49:35,680 --> 03:49:37,359
that happens and i think

4063
03:49:37,359 --> 03:49:38,560
honestly even in moderation i think

4064
03:49:38,560 --> 03:49:40,560
those can be fun and enjoyable yes mixed

4065
03:49:40,560 --> 03:49:41,920
in amongst your traditional like happy

4066
03:49:41,920 --> 03:49:43,760
competition yeah typically they are

4067
03:49:43,760 --> 03:49:46,880
branded as uh ppc is the category in

4068
03:49:46,880 --> 03:49:49,199
normal uh ctfs which i think is like

4069
03:49:49,199 --> 03:49:51,040
professional programming challenge or

4070
03:49:51,040 --> 03:49:53,600
something like this uh people familiar

4071
03:49:53,600 --> 03:49:54,640
with like

4072
03:49:54,640 --> 03:49:57,760
you know icpc style uh algorithms

4073
03:49:57,760 --> 03:49:59,840
competitions or so might find although

4074
03:49:59,840 --> 03:50:02,160
usually they're kind of like framed uh

4075
03:50:02,160 --> 03:50:04,560
slightly differently yeah but it's kind

4076
03:50:04,560 --> 03:50:06,960
of like the same uh general idea there

4077
03:50:06,960 --> 03:50:08,720
yeah and there's there's no security

4078
03:50:08,720 --> 03:50:11,199
flaw there's really just rather solving

4079
03:50:11,199 --> 03:50:13,600
some hard mathematical problem with the

4080
03:50:13,600 --> 03:50:14,720
right algorithm or with the right

4081
03:50:14,720 --> 03:50:15,680
approach

4082
03:50:15,680 --> 03:50:18,319
uh to to kind of get it working so but

4083
03:50:18,319 --> 03:50:20,720
that's not the case here like there's

4084
03:50:20,720 --> 03:50:22,080
there's an aspect of that but that's not

4085
03:50:22,080 --> 03:50:23,680
enough we are doing right this is this

4086
03:50:23,680 --> 03:50:25,439
is truly a ponable there is memory

4087
03:50:25,439 --> 03:50:26,960
corruption involved

4088
03:50:26,960 --> 03:50:29,040
uh yeah although i will say and i'm

4089
03:50:29,040 --> 03:50:32,080
looking to see if somebody finds um

4090
03:50:32,080 --> 03:50:34,000
the the sort of like win function like

4091
03:50:34,000 --> 03:50:36,319
when you have a correct solve ct uh

4092
03:50:36,319 --> 03:50:39,279
correct cell sudoku um

4093
03:50:39,279 --> 03:50:40,560
i think we're gonna see like so this

4094
03:50:40,560 --> 03:50:42,880
this function here uh they've named it

4095
03:50:42,880 --> 03:50:43,760
check

4096
03:50:43,760 --> 03:50:45,199
returns right whether or not we've

4097
03:50:45,199 --> 03:50:49,359
successfully calculated the value um a

4098
03:50:49,359 --> 03:50:51,439
valid uh

4099
03:50:51,439 --> 03:50:52,560
solve

4100
03:50:52,560 --> 03:50:54,160
this uh

4101
03:50:54,160 --> 03:50:56,239
the result of that is going to determine

4102
03:50:56,239 --> 03:50:57,600
basically what you call a win function

4103
03:50:57,600 --> 03:50:59,120
so it is going to kind of do the win for

4104
03:50:59,120 --> 03:50:59,840
you

4105
03:50:59,840 --> 03:51:01,680
so you already sort of you know you have

4106
03:51:01,680 --> 03:51:03,680
to solve it right your just question is

4107
03:51:03,680 --> 03:51:05,680
okay what mechanic will actually get me

4108
03:51:05,680 --> 03:51:07,600
to solve it and can i cheat it do i have

4109
03:51:07,600 --> 03:51:09,279
to have a combination of a solver plus a

4110
03:51:09,279 --> 03:51:11,279
g like what what what is that that ratio

4111
03:51:11,279 --> 03:51:13,600
going to entail because at face value

4112
03:51:13,600 --> 03:51:15,199
it kind of looks like you just sold the

4113
03:51:15,199 --> 03:51:17,920
sudoku and you win yeah but but you know

4114
03:51:17,920 --> 03:51:20,560
like def con finals even even being a

4115
03:51:20,560 --> 03:51:22,239
sort of easy live ctf i would i would

4116
03:51:22,239 --> 03:51:23,600
think people would be like nah wait a

4117
03:51:23,600 --> 03:51:25,279
minute like there's there's something

4118
03:51:25,279 --> 03:51:27,680
here and i think if you can also

4119
03:51:27,680 --> 03:51:30,479
uh there's not a lot of uh

4120
03:51:30,479 --> 03:51:33,840
values here and so i don't know like

4121
03:51:33,840 --> 03:51:35,279
i think the idea is that this these are

4122
03:51:35,279 --> 03:51:36,640
just not

4123
03:51:36,640 --> 03:51:37,760
solvable because there's not enough

4124
03:51:37,760 --> 03:51:39,279
information in there like some sudoku

4125
03:51:39,279 --> 03:51:40,319
balls are very minimal but they're

4126
03:51:40,319 --> 03:51:42,160
designed to be solved right right made

4127
03:51:42,160 --> 03:51:43,760
to be solvable i think i remember that

4128
03:51:43,760 --> 03:51:46,560
like if you have 13 digits you're

4129
03:51:46,560 --> 03:51:48,479
guaranteed to have oh is that so here we

4130
03:51:48,479 --> 03:51:50,640
go

4131
03:51:53,840 --> 03:51:55,279
okay so this one definitely has more

4132
03:51:55,279 --> 03:51:56,560
than that but there's going to be some

4133
03:51:56,560 --> 03:51:57,359
other

4134
03:51:57,359 --> 03:51:59,439
issues with it still i'm not sure if my

4135
03:51:59,439 --> 03:52:01,920
trivia is is correct but i i vaguely

4136
03:52:01,920 --> 03:52:03,439
remember like if you have 13 digits you

4137
03:52:03,439 --> 03:52:05,199
have a unique solution you can have a

4138
03:52:05,199 --> 03:52:07,040
unique solution with fewer digits but

4139
03:52:07,040 --> 03:52:08,399
that's not guaranteed i don't know that

4140
03:52:08,399 --> 03:52:10,160
that's true because i can just give you

4141
03:52:10,160 --> 03:52:12,720
all of the ones for example and all of

4142
03:52:12,720 --> 03:52:14,160
this is nine

4143
03:52:14,160 --> 03:52:15,840
and i'll and all the twos

4144
03:52:15,840 --> 03:52:16,720
and that doesn't give you enough

4145
03:52:16,720 --> 03:52:17,600
information to know where all the

4146
03:52:17,600 --> 03:52:18,920
numbers other numbers are

4147
03:52:18,920 --> 03:52:22,560
[Music]

4148
03:52:22,560 --> 03:52:23,840
maybe maybe

4149
03:52:23,840 --> 03:52:25,279
because like you can no so it's high

4150
03:52:25,279 --> 03:52:27,760
it's maybe it's 21 or something then i

4151
03:52:27,760 --> 03:52:29,520
there is a number

4152
03:52:29,520 --> 03:52:30,960
i'm just you know where's where is our

4153
03:52:30,960 --> 03:52:33,199
cracking the cryptic uh

4154
03:52:33,199 --> 03:52:36,560
friends yes and go to the youtube stream

4155
03:52:36,560 --> 03:52:38,800
yeah great uh great channel so so here

4156
03:52:38,800 --> 03:52:41,199
we go we're seeing uh sudoku solver

4157
03:52:41,199 --> 03:52:42,640
python so we're we're seeing people

4158
03:52:42,640 --> 03:52:45,120
investigate that all right we are now 15

4159
03:52:45,120 --> 03:52:47,040
minutes in yes i think we should be

4160
03:52:47,040 --> 03:52:48,720
preparing our hint because i actually

4161
03:52:48,720 --> 03:52:50,640
think this one is a little too subtle

4162
03:52:50,640 --> 03:52:52,560
and we're going to have to point them

4163
03:52:52,560 --> 03:52:54,880
in the right direction yes uh without

4164
03:52:54,880 --> 03:52:56,479
actually giving to the thing so yeah we

4165
03:52:56,479 --> 03:52:57,920
should note this notice now that even

4166
03:52:57,920 --> 03:53:01,040
though uh the time is like 24 right five

4167
03:53:01,040 --> 03:53:03,040
point four we started seven days because

4168
03:53:03,040 --> 03:53:04,880
of technical difficulties so they are

4169
03:53:04,880 --> 03:53:06,479
only 15 minutes into the challenge

4170
03:53:06,479 --> 03:53:08,560
correct correct so we have we have more

4171
03:53:08,560 --> 03:53:10,160
more time than the clock looks like

4172
03:53:10,160 --> 03:53:11,199
compared to the other ones where we

4173
03:53:11,199 --> 03:53:12,960
started much closer to

4174
03:53:12,960 --> 03:53:15,760
uh to on time so

4175
03:53:15,760 --> 03:53:18,000
uh we're trying a solver again so so

4176
03:53:18,000 --> 03:53:20,160
trying a solver on here which is

4177
03:53:20,160 --> 03:53:22,239
not going to be sufficient so i think we

4178
03:53:22,239 --> 03:53:23,520
need to figure out if there is an

4179
03:53:23,520 --> 03:53:26,560
official hint from the challenge author

4180
03:53:26,560 --> 03:53:29,439
so we've got uh glenn over in in the

4181
03:53:29,439 --> 03:53:30,800
production booth

4182
03:53:30,800 --> 03:53:32,399
uh as it were which is otherwise known

4183
03:53:32,399 --> 03:53:34,399
as the other side of the table that

4184
03:53:34,399 --> 03:53:36,880
we're sitting at here yeah um

4185
03:53:36,880 --> 03:53:39,120
it's gonna is gonna reach out and see if

4186
03:53:39,120 --> 03:53:41,199
we have an official we have like three

4187
03:53:41,199 --> 03:53:43,040
times the number of computers compared

4188
03:53:43,040 --> 03:53:44,640
to the number of crew members for this

4189
03:53:44,640 --> 03:53:48,160
uh setup we have a lot of displays and i

4190
03:53:48,160 --> 03:53:49,120
mean

4191
03:53:49,120 --> 03:53:51,359
an order of magnitude more cables i

4192
03:53:51,359 --> 03:53:53,520
think than uh

4193
03:53:53,520 --> 03:53:55,600
yeah but it's uh

4194
03:53:55,600 --> 03:53:57,279
and once we once we find out what is

4195
03:53:57,279 --> 03:53:59,840
breaking our our secondary capture

4196
03:53:59,840 --> 03:54:01,520
uh and so actually speaking of which i'm

4197
03:54:01,520 --> 03:54:02,560
gonna go ahead and go take a look at

4198
03:54:02,560 --> 03:54:03,840
organizers i want to see if they're

4199
03:54:03,840 --> 03:54:06,000
making progress right uh while we figure

4200
03:54:06,000 --> 03:54:06,800
out

4201
03:54:06,800 --> 03:54:09,120
what we're doing with that uh with that

4202
03:54:09,120 --> 03:54:11,120
hint yeah if we're going to give it um

4203
03:54:11,120 --> 03:54:12,399
and if the chat if you guys have any

4204
03:54:12,399 --> 03:54:14,560
questions about where we're going uh let

4205
03:54:14,560 --> 03:54:15,920
us know

4206
03:54:15,920 --> 03:54:18,800
and i'll be back with update great

4207
03:54:18,800 --> 03:54:19,760
so

4208
03:54:19,760 --> 03:54:22,160
while uh jordan does that

4209
03:54:22,160 --> 03:54:24,319
uh we can try to

4210
03:54:24,319 --> 03:54:25,120
uh

4211
03:54:25,120 --> 03:54:26,880
see is

4212
03:54:26,880 --> 03:54:29,760
that uh we oh okay so i've just been

4213
03:54:29,760 --> 03:54:30,960
informed that

4214
03:54:30,960 --> 03:54:34,000
uh the puzzle that the uh that you are

4215
03:54:34,000 --> 03:54:35,040
given

4216
03:54:35,040 --> 03:54:37,520
is impossible to solve that's the kind

4217
03:54:37,520 --> 03:54:40,160
of the trick here so at face value

4218
03:54:40,160 --> 03:54:41,439
everything looks fine you just need to

4219
03:54:41,439 --> 03:54:43,279
solve this sudoku but actually there is

4220
03:54:43,279 --> 03:54:46,160
no solution this is a an invalid state

4221
03:54:46,160 --> 03:54:47,840
for the sudoku

4222
03:54:47,840 --> 03:54:49,199
so

4223
03:54:49,199 --> 03:54:51,120
once they and this is something that can

4224
03:54:51,120 --> 03:54:53,279
really throw you off right because if

4225
03:54:53,279 --> 03:54:55,359
you uh take this and like you put it

4226
03:54:55,359 --> 03:54:56,560
into a solver or something and the

4227
03:54:56,560 --> 03:54:58,800
solver says like nah there's no solution

4228
03:54:58,800 --> 03:55:00,239
you might be starting to think like

4229
03:55:00,239 --> 03:55:02,800
maybe the solver has a bug or like some

4230
03:55:02,800 --> 03:55:05,040
maybe my in the format of my input is is

4231
03:55:05,040 --> 03:55:06,560
wrong or something like this

4232
03:55:06,560 --> 03:55:07,920
um

4233
03:55:07,920 --> 03:55:08,720
and

4234
03:55:08,720 --> 03:55:11,040
only later you might question the like

4235
03:55:11,040 --> 03:55:14,560
the impossibility of the puzzle um so

4236
03:55:14,560 --> 03:55:17,199
this is where they have to then cheat to

4237
03:55:17,199 --> 03:55:18,720
solve the impossible

4238
03:55:18,720 --> 03:55:20,640
sudoku uh

4239
03:55:20,640 --> 03:55:21,439
to

4240
03:55:21,439 --> 03:55:24,000
then get this win function

4241
03:55:24,000 --> 03:55:25,279
um

4242
03:55:25,279 --> 03:55:27,279
we can see here on on the balsam screen

4243
03:55:27,279 --> 03:55:28,960
that uh

4244
03:55:28,960 --> 03:55:30,960
they are

4245
03:55:30,960 --> 03:55:33,600
looking still at the kind of uh

4246
03:55:33,600 --> 03:55:36,239
the compilation here um thinking hard

4247
03:55:36,239 --> 03:55:37,920
about this

4248
03:55:37,920 --> 03:55:39,040
uh

4249
03:55:39,040 --> 03:55:41,600
trying to figure out like what what is

4250
03:55:41,600 --> 03:55:43,279
going on here like why is this not

4251
03:55:43,279 --> 03:55:44,319
working

4252
03:55:44,319 --> 03:55:46,080
um

4253
03:55:46,080 --> 03:55:47,760
they have this it's it's this check

4254
03:55:47,760 --> 03:55:49,279
function right

4255
03:55:49,279 --> 03:55:51,600
uh so they're trying to think about like

4256
03:55:51,600 --> 03:55:53,840
what in what way does this function not

4257
03:55:53,840 --> 03:55:55,359
behave

4258
03:55:55,359 --> 03:55:57,760
correctly maybe maybe they have realized

4259
03:55:57,760 --> 03:56:00,080
that like you're given an impossible

4260
03:56:00,080 --> 03:56:01,439
uh puzzle

4261
03:56:01,439 --> 03:56:02,560
um

4262
03:56:02,560 --> 03:56:05,040
so let's see they're gonna try to

4263
03:56:05,040 --> 03:56:06,399
seems like they're writing like a small

4264
03:56:06,399 --> 03:56:08,479
like formatting uh function they're

4265
03:56:08,479 --> 03:56:09,680
looping through

4266
03:56:09,680 --> 03:56:12,160
like the x and y axis and and uh

4267
03:56:12,160 --> 03:56:15,040
printing uh something

4268
03:56:15,040 --> 03:56:17,040
um so yeah

4269
03:56:17,040 --> 03:56:19,359
um

4270
03:56:19,359 --> 03:56:21,359
still unsure exactly where they're going

4271
03:56:21,359 --> 03:56:22,960
with that but let's see here now they

4272
03:56:22,960 --> 03:56:25,920
run it so so okay so a quick update is

4273
03:56:25,920 --> 03:56:27,600
both teams are taking the sort of wrong

4274
03:56:27,600 --> 03:56:28,720
approach now and they're still looking

4275
03:56:28,720 --> 03:56:30,640
for solves so the hint they're both

4276
03:56:30,640 --> 03:56:32,080
going to get is you can't win you need

4277
03:56:32,080 --> 03:56:33,600
to cheat

4278
03:56:33,600 --> 03:56:35,199
right

4279
03:56:35,199 --> 03:56:36,960
which is uh

4280
03:56:36,960 --> 03:56:38,239
almost feel like there's some kind of

4281
03:56:38,239 --> 03:56:40,239
deeper philosophical

4282
03:56:40,239 --> 03:56:42,080
uh thing i mean it's it's a true life

4283
03:56:42,080 --> 03:56:43,760
statement yeah yeah

4284
03:56:43,760 --> 03:56:45,520
um

4285
03:56:45,520 --> 03:56:48,479
yeah it's uh

4286
03:56:48,880 --> 03:56:50,640
um

4287
03:56:50,640 --> 03:56:52,000
yeah i had a lot of thoughts about that

4288
03:56:52,000 --> 03:56:54,960
but let's not go too too deep

4289
03:56:54,960 --> 03:56:57,520
yeah um i you know so here's the other

4290
03:56:57,520 --> 03:56:58,640
question do we want to give them a

4291
03:56:58,640 --> 03:57:00,399
little bit more of a hint

4292
03:57:00,399 --> 03:57:01,920
um do we want to tell them exactly kind

4293
03:57:01,920 --> 03:57:03,439
of how like the more of a hint is to

4294
03:57:03,439 --> 03:57:04,319
what they want to achieve i think we

4295
03:57:04,319 --> 03:57:06,000
have time right now we have time uh

4296
03:57:06,000 --> 03:57:07,199
let's do that

4297
03:57:07,199 --> 03:57:08,720
and uh

4298
03:57:08,720 --> 03:57:10,239
yeah in fact

4299
03:57:10,239 --> 03:57:12,399
well that's too late now uh

4300
03:57:12,399 --> 03:57:14,319
i mean i was thinking in terms of like

4301
03:57:14,319 --> 03:57:17,279
since this is the last match of the day

4302
03:57:17,279 --> 03:57:19,040
we could have afforded like you know

4303
03:57:19,040 --> 03:57:20,720
extending the uh

4304
03:57:20,720 --> 03:57:22,560
standard game time but yeah i don't know

4305
03:57:22,560 --> 03:57:25,040
if it's fair to do that once we do it to

4306
03:57:25,040 --> 03:57:26,800
the same two players either way it's

4307
03:57:26,800 --> 03:57:29,120
it's only fair relative to each other

4308
03:57:29,120 --> 03:57:30,080
because every match is different

4309
03:57:30,080 --> 03:57:31,120
different challenges different

4310
03:57:31,120 --> 03:57:33,040
conditions and so to some degree right

4311
03:57:33,040 --> 03:57:35,199
so you could argue that it's fair but

4312
03:57:35,199 --> 03:57:36,319
let's see you can't win you need to

4313
03:57:36,319 --> 03:57:37,439
cheat

4314
03:57:37,439 --> 03:57:41,040
you need memory corruption yes

4315
03:57:43,680 --> 03:57:45,680
it's uh it's dangerous to go alone like

4316
03:57:45,680 --> 03:57:46,800
take this yeah

4317
03:57:46,800 --> 03:57:48,239
it's dangerous to go alone take this

4318
03:57:48,239 --> 03:57:51,359
memory corruption i love it

4319
03:57:51,840 --> 03:57:53,120
um

4320
03:57:53,120 --> 03:57:54,239
all right

4321
03:57:54,239 --> 03:57:57,199
here goes the first tents yes

4322
03:57:57,199 --> 03:57:58,800
we'll see if this gets them on the right

4323
03:57:58,800 --> 03:58:01,760
track again or if we need to uh

4324
03:58:01,760 --> 03:58:03,920
in the meantime i'm trying to decipher

4325
03:58:03,920 --> 03:58:06,800
what this uh script is doing they have a

4326
03:58:06,800 --> 03:58:08,720
sole function there which then will not

4327
03:58:08,720 --> 03:58:10,399
really help them since you can't solve

4328
03:58:10,399 --> 03:58:11,359
this

4329
03:58:11,359 --> 03:58:13,359
um

4330
03:58:13,359 --> 03:58:16,479
it's uh

4331
03:58:16,479 --> 03:58:18,720
yeah it's still like you know a little

4332
03:58:18,720 --> 03:58:20,479
bit unclear where the players are in

4333
03:58:20,479 --> 03:58:22,319
this unfortunately we can't read the

4334
03:58:22,319 --> 03:58:24,160
minds of the players that would be uh

4335
03:58:24,160 --> 03:58:25,760
immensely helpful uh when doing this

4336
03:58:25,760 --> 03:58:27,040
type of commentary we can just try to

4337
03:58:27,040 --> 03:58:28,479
guess based on what we're seeing on the

4338
03:58:28,479 --> 03:58:29,760
screen

4339
03:58:29,760 --> 03:58:30,479
so

4340
03:58:30,479 --> 03:58:32,479
and yeah again like if you have any uh

4341
03:58:32,479 --> 03:58:34,800
questions or comments from from

4342
03:58:34,800 --> 03:58:36,640
all of you watching this i got some

4343
03:58:36,640 --> 03:58:38,080
smiles i wish you all could have seen it

4344
03:58:38,080 --> 03:58:40,640
but there was like oh yeah of course

4345
03:58:40,640 --> 03:58:43,120
okay okay so they both they were both

4346
03:58:43,120 --> 03:58:45,439
you know going down the solver approach

4347
03:58:45,439 --> 03:58:46,880
so i i think we're gonna see a lot more

4348
03:58:46,880 --> 03:58:48,720
ida now right uh we're gonna see them

4349
03:58:48,720 --> 03:58:51,199
actually dig into the binary right uh

4350
03:58:51,199 --> 03:58:54,080
and follow it that way

4351
03:58:54,080 --> 03:58:55,840
so that's that's all that's nice to to

4352
03:58:55,840 --> 03:58:58,560
hear that like the the hint was uh

4353
03:58:58,560 --> 03:59:01,359
appropriately level then that it was uh

4354
03:59:01,359 --> 03:59:03,199
useful to the players yeah i think they

4355
03:59:03,199 --> 03:59:05,120
both they both were at a spot where it's

4356
03:59:05,120 --> 03:59:06,560
going to help both of them

4357
03:59:06,560 --> 03:59:08,319
we'll see if either one starts to starts

4358
03:59:08,319 --> 03:59:10,479
to uh take advantage of that or not okay

4359
03:59:10,479 --> 03:59:11,840
yeah so we're looking at checkset we're

4360
03:59:11,840 --> 03:59:13,439
looking at the binary properties seeing

4361
03:59:13,439 --> 03:59:15,279
is you know and that's actually a great

4362
03:59:15,279 --> 03:59:16,880
habit to be in too i really think that a

4363
03:59:16,880 --> 03:59:18,800
lot of people overlook that again we saw

4364
03:59:18,800 --> 03:59:20,880
that last one with the with a mallard

4365
03:59:20,880 --> 03:59:23,120
with the ducks where uh

4366
03:59:23,120 --> 03:59:25,359
like it not being randomized

4367
03:59:25,359 --> 03:59:26,800
i think add a little bit extra slow down

4368
03:59:26,800 --> 03:59:28,800
there right yes definitely because you

4369
03:59:28,800 --> 03:59:30,239
could have gone straight into uh you

4370
03:59:30,239 --> 03:59:33,120
know yeah this is i i think i i have

4371
03:59:33,120 --> 03:59:35,439
this as a pretty good habit like always

4372
03:59:35,439 --> 03:59:38,160
run file always run check sec

4373
03:59:38,160 --> 03:59:39,359
uh

4374
03:59:39,359 --> 03:59:40,880
yeah it's kind of like when you're doing

4375
03:59:40,880 --> 03:59:43,279
reversing uh reversing engineering

4376
03:59:43,279 --> 03:59:45,120
challenges always run straight strings

4377
03:59:45,120 --> 03:59:47,520
always been work yeah just like

4378
03:59:47,520 --> 03:59:48,960
just out of habit yeah just like the

4379
03:59:48,960 --> 03:59:51,040
things the things that you do

4380
03:59:51,040 --> 03:59:52,479
right all right so let's let's watch

4381
03:59:52,479 --> 03:59:54,800
this okay so now yeah now we're seeing

4382
03:59:54,800 --> 03:59:56,239
them actually where we want them now

4383
03:59:56,239 --> 03:59:58,080
they're back to reverse engineering

4384
03:59:58,080 --> 04:00:00,080
they're looking for vulnerabilities

4385
04:00:00,080 --> 04:00:03,040
uh and and what they're gonna do

4386
04:00:03,040 --> 04:00:04,399
is they're gonna use the vulnerability

4387
04:00:04,399 --> 04:00:06,160
to win they're gonna use the memory

4388
04:00:06,160 --> 04:00:07,439
corruption

4389
04:00:07,439 --> 04:00:09,120
uh to get to to

4390
04:00:09,120 --> 04:00:10,560
to not

4391
04:00:10,560 --> 04:00:13,040
code execution directly right but to the

4392
04:00:13,040 --> 04:00:14,080
win state so what they're gonna do is

4393
04:00:14,080 --> 04:00:15,760
they're gonna need to corrupt in such a

4394
04:00:15,760 --> 04:00:17,840
way that they can create a solved board

4395
04:00:17,840 --> 04:00:19,199
and they should hopefully still remember

4396
04:00:19,199 --> 04:00:20,800
this right because they know that the

4397
04:00:20,800 --> 04:00:22,560
point was to win they saw that they saw

4398
04:00:22,560 --> 04:00:24,239
the win they saw the win state they saw

4399
04:00:24,239 --> 04:00:25,439
that's why they were trying to solve the

4400
04:00:25,439 --> 04:00:26,479
puzzle

4401
04:00:26,479 --> 04:00:28,399
so i think they know that yeah the

4402
04:00:28,399 --> 04:00:29,760
question is

4403
04:00:29,760 --> 04:00:32,080
uh are they going to

4404
04:00:32,080 --> 04:00:32,960
uh

4405
04:00:32,960 --> 04:00:34,080
be able to figure out the memory

4406
04:00:34,080 --> 04:00:35,680
corruption in time so that's the

4407
04:00:35,680 --> 04:00:36,800
question that we're looking for and this

4408
04:00:36,800 --> 04:00:38,239
is kind of interesting i think uh this

4409
04:00:38,239 --> 04:00:39,760
type of ponable where like a lot of

4410
04:00:39,760 --> 04:00:41,359
pronables you have kind of this like

4411
04:00:41,359 --> 04:00:44,080
standard workflow where you try to uh

4412
04:00:44,080 --> 04:00:45,840
gain control of certain aspects of

4413
04:00:45,840 --> 04:00:47,279
memory yeah you're trying it's all it's

4414
04:00:47,279 --> 04:00:49,120
a pointer overwrite something that gets

4415
04:00:49,120 --> 04:00:50,640
you a memory right so you get a pointer

4416
04:00:50,640 --> 04:00:52,479
over right like do a rock chain to like

4417
04:00:52,479 --> 04:00:54,960
you know um but here you're just doing

4418
04:00:54,960 --> 04:00:56,560
kind of like maybe we called like a

4419
04:00:56,560 --> 04:00:58,399
local memory corruption you're just like

4420
04:00:58,399 --> 04:01:00,000
or or it's not quite a logic

4421
04:01:00,000 --> 04:01:01,279
vulnerability and that it is memory

4422
04:01:01,279 --> 04:01:03,439
corruption but it's not useful it's not

4423
04:01:03,439 --> 04:01:05,840
being used for control flow right

4424
04:01:05,840 --> 04:01:08,319
hijacking you're using it specifically

4425
04:01:08,319 --> 04:01:10,479
to just change the behavior of the state

4426
04:01:10,479 --> 04:01:11,760
and change the behavior yeah the

4427
04:01:11,760 --> 04:01:13,040
functionality through it's normal

4428
04:01:13,040 --> 04:01:14,479
legitimate means

4429
04:01:14,479 --> 04:01:16,080
but by entering a memory state that it

4430
04:01:16,080 --> 04:01:18,960
didn't intend for you to enter right so

4431
04:01:18,960 --> 04:01:20,239
in a lot of these cases for example like

4432
04:01:20,239 --> 04:01:22,560
the program wouldn't crash for example

4433
04:01:22,560 --> 04:01:24,000
with the like if the exploit is like

4434
04:01:24,000 --> 04:01:25,040
slightly

4435
04:01:25,040 --> 04:01:26,560
yeah you just you just fail to get a

4436
04:01:26,560 --> 04:01:27,680
correct puzzle it's just not solved

4437
04:01:27,680 --> 04:01:29,199
right yeah

4438
04:01:29,199 --> 04:01:31,040
it's not to say that they couldn't crash

4439
04:01:31,040 --> 04:01:32,560
with this vulnerability necessarily it

4440
04:01:32,560 --> 04:01:34,800
depends on how it's actually constructed

4441
04:01:34,800 --> 04:01:36,800
but there are there are certainly use

4442
04:01:36,800 --> 04:01:38,160
cases or there are cases where you know

4443
04:01:38,160 --> 04:01:39,760
an exploit

4444
04:01:39,760 --> 04:01:42,080
isn't actually exploitable in the in the

4445
04:01:42,080 --> 04:01:42,960
you know

4446
04:01:42,960 --> 04:01:45,120
direct code execution state it is rather

4447
04:01:45,120 --> 04:01:47,600
just by exercising some other

4448
04:01:47,600 --> 04:01:50,960
logical state of the program and i think

4449
04:01:50,960 --> 04:01:52,479
in general like what everything we say

4450
04:01:52,479 --> 04:01:54,319
here about like the you know ponables

4451
04:01:54,319 --> 04:01:56,560
and like general ideas there are a lot

4452
04:01:56,560 --> 04:01:58,720
of like if some bots and stuff like to

4453
04:01:58,720 --> 04:02:00,479
all of these exceptions but you know

4454
04:02:00,479 --> 04:02:02,560
we're trying to you know make some broad

4455
04:02:02,560 --> 04:02:04,000
strokes here about

4456
04:02:04,000 --> 04:02:06,960
different types of challenges

4457
04:02:06,960 --> 04:02:08,479
i'm a little nervous this one feels like

4458
04:02:08,479 --> 04:02:10,239
that we the first one we might have to

4459
04:02:10,239 --> 04:02:11,840
unleash the sudden death i'm hoping we

4460
04:02:11,840 --> 04:02:14,239
don't right um but and and i like the

4461
04:02:14,239 --> 04:02:15,760
challenge because like you know like

4462
04:02:15,760 --> 04:02:17,680
we're talking about i think it has that

4463
04:02:17,680 --> 04:02:19,840
that good twist that you're gonna not

4464
04:02:19,840 --> 04:02:20,880
get a

4465
04:02:20,880 --> 04:02:22,160
a pointer over right but you're gonna

4466
04:02:22,160 --> 04:02:23,920
like you know influence the state of the

4467
04:02:23,920 --> 04:02:25,120
binary so

4468
04:02:25,120 --> 04:02:27,439
i'm hoping and we've got we've seen

4469
04:02:27,439 --> 04:02:29,520
great work from all the teams so far so

4470
04:02:29,520 --> 04:02:32,160
we know we have high quality people

4471
04:02:32,160 --> 04:02:35,120
we'll see how it's going

4472
04:02:35,120 --> 04:02:37,120
this is also i say the one of the larger

4473
04:02:37,120 --> 04:02:39,199
binaries we all get very small binaries

4474
04:02:39,199 --> 04:02:41,120
very very self-contained this was a

4475
04:02:41,120 --> 04:02:42,640
little bigger it's still i think small

4476
04:02:42,640 --> 04:02:44,560
in the ctf scale of things which in ctf

4477
04:02:44,560 --> 04:02:46,800
is smaller than real world binaries oh

4478
04:02:46,800 --> 04:02:49,040
yeah but relative to the live ctf binary

4479
04:02:49,040 --> 04:02:51,040
is this is this is larger than some of

4480
04:02:51,040 --> 04:02:52,720
them

4481
04:02:52,720 --> 04:02:54,800
yeah luckily they don't have to like

4482
04:02:54,800 --> 04:02:57,840
sift through a 300 megabytes binary uh

4483
04:02:57,840 --> 04:03:00,399
what who doesn't love yeah

4484
04:03:00,399 --> 04:03:02,640
yeah sorting out uh massive binaries

4485
04:03:02,640 --> 04:03:04,880
yeah i think i remember

4486
04:03:04,880 --> 04:03:07,439
opening the minecraft binary in ida at

4487
04:03:07,439 --> 04:03:09,120
some point

4488
04:03:09,120 --> 04:03:11,840
then i went to bed and uh yeah continued

4489
04:03:11,840 --> 04:03:14,000
today yeah yeah no i think it was like

4490
04:03:14,000 --> 04:03:15,520
just barely finished but it took like

4491
04:03:15,520 --> 04:03:18,000
eight or nine hours to analyze that

4492
04:03:18,000 --> 04:03:18,800
yeah

4493
04:03:18,800 --> 04:03:20,640
big binary or even like obvious data

4494
04:03:20,640 --> 04:03:22,239
binders can

4495
04:03:22,239 --> 04:03:24,560
can take a long time to analyze for sure

4496
04:03:24,560 --> 04:03:26,160
yeah

4497
04:03:26,160 --> 04:03:27,520
all right here we go so let's look we're

4498
04:03:27,520 --> 04:03:31,199
seeing in 64 inch

4499
04:03:31,279 --> 04:03:32,080
so

4500
04:03:32,080 --> 04:03:35,040
making sure the types are correct that

4501
04:03:35,040 --> 04:03:38,319
is a that's that's good i think i think

4502
04:03:38,319 --> 04:03:40,000
uh

4503
04:03:40,000 --> 04:03:41,600
analyzing the types is useful although

4504
04:03:41,600 --> 04:03:43,840
what i will say is that just looking at

4505
04:03:43,840 --> 04:03:45,600
decompiled code

4506
04:03:45,600 --> 04:03:47,920
is maybe not the best way to analyze any

4507
04:03:47,920 --> 04:03:50,479
kind of type issues right no i think

4508
04:03:50,479 --> 04:03:53,600
it's like it's a good it's a good start

4509
04:03:53,600 --> 04:03:57,439
to give you the big picture uh and uh

4510
04:03:57,439 --> 04:03:58,880
but then at some point you might have to

4511
04:03:58,880 --> 04:04:00,880
drill down on things and i think this is

4512
04:04:00,880 --> 04:04:02,239
also kind of interesting again with like

4513
04:04:02,239 --> 04:04:04,720
different types of uh ponable challenges

4514
04:04:04,720 --> 04:04:07,120
like uh some portable challenges like

4515
04:04:07,120 --> 04:04:09,600
the bug is obvious and the exploitation

4516
04:04:09,600 --> 04:04:10,880
is difficult absolutely and then you

4517
04:04:10,880 --> 04:04:12,800
have these more like reversing heavy

4518
04:04:12,800 --> 04:04:14,800
pronables where like you have to figure

4519
04:04:14,800 --> 04:04:17,040
out like very complex data structure but

4520
04:04:17,040 --> 04:04:18,560
once you have kind of sorted everything

4521
04:04:18,560 --> 04:04:21,600
out the bug just like appears

4522
04:04:21,600 --> 04:04:23,439
and then from there it's typically not

4523
04:04:23,439 --> 04:04:25,760
that hard or yeah and i think our

4524
04:04:25,760 --> 04:04:27,520
previous examples several of our

4525
04:04:27,520 --> 04:04:28,800
previous challenges were more on the

4526
04:04:28,800 --> 04:04:30,000
side of like

4527
04:04:30,000 --> 04:04:32,080
it's obvious where the bug was but

4528
04:04:32,080 --> 04:04:33,840
actually landing it was was sort of the

4529
04:04:33,840 --> 04:04:36,000
trick like we just let you run syscalls

4530
04:04:36,000 --> 04:04:37,920
yes which ones that's the tricky part

4531
04:04:37,920 --> 04:04:39,359
right actually your payload the

4532
04:04:39,359 --> 04:04:41,199
execution same thing with like knob

4533
04:04:41,199 --> 04:04:42,800
coding like we just ran your bites sort

4534
04:04:42,800 --> 04:04:44,720
of you had to like do that it's i think

4535
04:04:44,720 --> 04:04:46,000
there's a sort of like shell coating

4536
04:04:46,000 --> 04:04:47,279
heavy and the sort of like concerning

4537
04:04:47,279 --> 04:04:48,479
environments are some of my favorite

4538
04:04:48,479 --> 04:04:50,800
challenges um probably because i'm just

4539
04:04:50,800 --> 04:04:52,640
bad at the like the more uh i know it's

4540
04:04:52,640 --> 04:04:55,040
a tedious but the more in-depth

4541
04:04:55,040 --> 04:04:58,000
right long-term reversal

4542
04:04:58,000 --> 04:04:59,680
so i mean i'm more of a reverse engineer

4543
04:04:59,680 --> 04:05:01,760
myself so like i like those things but

4544
04:05:01,760 --> 04:05:03,760
then for example when you get to these

4545
04:05:03,760 --> 04:05:05,359
like you know complex heap exploitation

4546
04:05:05,359 --> 04:05:07,520
things then i'm you know completely uh

4547
04:05:07,520 --> 04:05:08,720
you know out of luck there well there's

4548
04:05:08,720 --> 04:05:10,479
always just you know kind of familiarity

4549
04:05:10,479 --> 04:05:12,080
and and experience with it one of the

4550
04:05:12,080 --> 04:05:13,760
things i was going to mention um and and

4551
04:05:13,760 --> 04:05:15,760
i say this that i don't do the reversing

4552
04:05:15,760 --> 04:05:17,600
heavy ones as an author of a reverse

4553
04:05:17,600 --> 04:05:19,199
engineering tool well maybe that's why

4554
04:05:19,199 --> 04:05:20,720
you built the tool but then well it's

4555
04:05:20,720 --> 04:05:22,160
also why i have co-workers who are much

4556
04:05:22,160 --> 04:05:23,760
better than i am that's the other i

4557
04:05:23,760 --> 04:05:26,560
highly recommend that approach um

4558
04:05:26,560 --> 04:05:28,880
so the but one of the things that i was

4559
04:05:28,880 --> 04:05:30,960
going to comment on is that i like one

4560
04:05:30,960 --> 04:05:32,239
of the things that gedra i think really

4561
04:05:32,239 --> 04:05:33,359
does well

4562
04:05:33,359 --> 04:05:36,560
that a lot of uh

4563
04:05:37,840 --> 04:05:39,920
both ida and binja have actually changed

4564
04:05:39,920 --> 04:05:42,160
as a result is their side-by-side view

4565
04:05:42,160 --> 04:05:44,080
having the synchronized side-by-side

4566
04:05:44,080 --> 04:05:46,160
decompilation with this assembly i think

4567
04:05:46,160 --> 04:05:47,920
was a really important improvement and

4568
04:05:47,920 --> 04:05:49,840
kind of like the standard workflow and

4569
04:05:49,840 --> 04:05:51,600
so now you'll see ida and ninja both

4570
04:05:51,600 --> 04:05:53,359
have much better split pane

4571
04:05:53,359 --> 04:05:55,279
synchronization those kind of workflows

4572
04:05:55,279 --> 04:05:57,040
very much inspire i mean you know

4573
04:05:57,040 --> 04:05:59,439
i assume ilfaq also was was inspired and

4574
04:05:59,439 --> 04:06:00,960
was like oh yeah that's a you know yeah

4575
04:06:00,960 --> 04:06:02,800
i like the way they does that too but i

4576
04:06:02,800 --> 04:06:04,239
certainly from from bingham's

4577
04:06:04,239 --> 04:06:05,600
perspective like we definitely did that

4578
04:06:05,600 --> 04:06:08,160
as well yeah um so i think it's good

4579
04:06:08,160 --> 04:06:09,600
seeing difference oh here we go we've

4580
04:06:09,600 --> 04:06:11,040
got uh

4581
04:06:11,040 --> 04:06:12,239
i don't know is that the same that's

4582
04:06:12,239 --> 04:06:13,680
just the same screen

4583
04:06:13,680 --> 04:06:16,319
um but we are so they're looking at

4584
04:06:16,319 --> 04:06:19,040
libsy uh

4585
04:06:19,040 --> 04:06:20,880
uh trying to download like the

4586
04:06:20,880 --> 04:06:23,439
appropriate limc version right yeah so

4587
04:06:23,439 --> 04:06:25,439
they're using this um

4588
04:06:25,439 --> 04:06:28,000
web page where you can like put in uh

4589
04:06:28,000 --> 04:06:31,520
offsets for uh different

4590
04:06:31,520 --> 04:06:34,399
uh functions to like uh to match up with

4591
04:06:34,399 --> 04:06:36,880
like fingerprint uh the libc version and

4592
04:06:36,880 --> 04:06:39,279
then download it so uh most of the times

4593
04:06:39,279 --> 04:06:41,600
i think you need like two offsets and

4594
04:06:41,600 --> 04:06:43,600
then it will match to uh which version

4595
04:06:43,600 --> 04:06:46,560
of limc is running so again

4596
04:06:46,560 --> 04:06:48,560
when we're building these challenges

4597
04:06:48,560 --> 04:06:51,279
if we don't think they need

4598
04:06:51,279 --> 04:06:53,120
libsy we're not providing it no that's

4599
04:06:53,120 --> 04:06:54,960
not true in all competitions though so

4600
04:06:54,960 --> 04:06:57,840
you know they may not yes just us yet i

4601
04:06:57,840 --> 04:06:59,760
think this is like

4602
04:06:59,760 --> 04:07:01,840
it is a convention among i would say

4603
04:07:01,840 --> 04:07:02,560
like

4604
04:07:02,560 --> 04:07:05,600
experienced uh organizers within this

4605
04:07:05,600 --> 04:07:08,560
right because why make that an extra

4606
04:07:08,560 --> 04:07:10,720
tedious step that it's just it's just

4607
04:07:10,720 --> 04:07:12,319
mechanical and you just go to the we all

4608
04:07:12,319 --> 04:07:13,359
know about the website we all know how

4609
04:07:13,359 --> 04:07:15,680
you would do it however

4610
04:07:15,680 --> 04:07:17,359
if you come up with a solution that's

4611
04:07:17,359 --> 04:07:19,359
different than the intended one you

4612
04:07:19,359 --> 04:07:21,279
might have a solution which does require

4613
04:07:21,279 --> 04:07:22,880
absolutely and then you might go this

4614
04:07:22,880 --> 04:07:24,720
way anyway yeah

4615
04:07:24,720 --> 04:07:27,040
yeah so it's not necessarily bad it is

4616
04:07:27,040 --> 04:07:28,720
just it should be a hint that maybe

4617
04:07:28,720 --> 04:07:30,319
you're not taking the intended route

4618
04:07:30,319 --> 04:07:32,080
right yeah doesn't mean that you're

4619
04:07:32,080 --> 04:07:34,399
wrong but you might be venturing into

4620
04:07:34,399 --> 04:07:36,000
like unknown territory all right so

4621
04:07:36,000 --> 04:07:37,199
let's be thinking about our next tent

4622
04:07:37,199 --> 04:07:38,880
because like i said i'm a little

4623
04:07:38,880 --> 04:07:40,319
concerned we might need to do a

4624
04:07:40,319 --> 04:07:41,439
different one

4625
04:07:41,439 --> 04:07:43,760
um oh no triple tap control and get the

4626
04:07:43,760 --> 04:07:44,560
uh

4627
04:07:44,560 --> 04:07:46,960
get the spoken dictation pop up

4628
04:07:46,960 --> 04:07:47,920
um

4629
04:07:47,920 --> 04:07:49,520
i'm gonna go

4630
04:07:49,520 --> 04:07:50,800
oh nope nope just somebody else in the

4631
04:07:50,800 --> 04:07:52,159
background excited about something yeah

4632
04:07:52,159 --> 04:07:54,080
i thought for a second we had a surprise

4633
04:07:54,080 --> 04:07:56,640
win off screen uh i'm gonna go ahead and

4634
04:07:56,640 --> 04:07:59,279
check in with uh

4635
04:07:59,279 --> 04:08:02,840
or was it organizers is

4636
04:08:02,840 --> 04:08:04,560
organizers this is unfortunately not

4637
04:08:04,560 --> 04:08:06,080
being captured

4638
04:08:06,080 --> 04:08:08,080
so we're kind of in the dark there uh so

4639
04:08:08,080 --> 04:08:09,040
i'm gonna see if i get a little bit more

4640
04:08:09,040 --> 04:08:10,000
of an insight hopefully we're making

4641
04:08:10,000 --> 04:08:11,120
good progress there and i can come back

4642
04:08:11,120 --> 04:08:13,439
with a little bit of an update yep

4643
04:08:13,439 --> 04:08:15,680
um and then maybe then go ahead with

4644
04:08:15,680 --> 04:08:18,960
some hint and based on current status uh

4645
04:08:18,960 --> 04:08:20,319
so um

4646
04:08:20,319 --> 04:08:24,239
yeah again they're looking at like um

4647
04:08:24,239 --> 04:08:26,159
figuring out like glimspy versions or

4648
04:08:26,159 --> 04:08:28,000
downloading uh

4649
04:08:28,000 --> 04:08:30,720
like an ubuntu image i'm not entirely

4650
04:08:30,720 --> 04:08:32,479
sure what's going on there

4651
04:08:32,479 --> 04:08:33,600
uh but

4652
04:08:33,600 --> 04:08:35,920
yeah

4653
04:08:36,159 --> 04:08:38,159
we'll we'll see if we can manage to kind

4654
04:08:38,159 --> 04:08:39,600
of like see what in what direction

4655
04:08:39,600 --> 04:08:42,239
they're going with with this

4656
04:08:42,239 --> 04:08:44,560
um

4657
04:08:45,520 --> 04:08:48,640
but yeah i uh

4658
04:08:51,920 --> 04:08:53,760
it's it would be very interesting to see

4659
04:08:53,760 --> 04:08:55,279
like if they have

4660
04:08:55,279 --> 04:08:57,359
kind of figure out where

4661
04:08:57,359 --> 04:08:59,840
uh where this check function is going on

4662
04:08:59,840 --> 04:09:01,520
uh unfortunately i don't have like the

4663
04:09:01,520 --> 04:09:03,920
reference solution so i'm not like

4664
04:09:03,920 --> 04:09:05,600
super familiar with exactly where it's

4665
04:09:05,600 --> 04:09:07,600
where like where it's doing something

4666
04:09:07,600 --> 04:09:08,720
incorrect

4667
04:09:08,720 --> 04:09:11,359
but um

4668
04:09:11,359 --> 04:09:13,199
yeah it's uh

4669
04:09:13,199 --> 04:09:14,319
also going to be interesting to hear

4670
04:09:14,319 --> 04:09:16,880
than what what the organizers are

4671
04:09:16,880 --> 04:09:18,720
up to if they have good progress so

4672
04:09:18,720 --> 04:09:20,000
we're also kind of a little bit in the

4673
04:09:20,000 --> 04:09:23,760
in the dark uh on that but um

4674
04:09:23,760 --> 04:09:25,600
hopefully

4675
04:09:25,600 --> 04:09:26,880
um

4676
04:09:26,880 --> 04:09:28,800
we i think we are going to give them a

4677
04:09:28,800 --> 04:09:32,479
hint that i see uh jordan and uh ben are

4678
04:09:32,479 --> 04:09:33,840
discussing a little bit but what's the

4679
04:09:33,840 --> 04:09:35,600
exact hint that we want to give them

4680
04:09:35,600 --> 04:09:37,040
here to to you know

4681
04:09:37,040 --> 04:09:40,720
uh point them in the right direction

4682
04:09:40,840 --> 04:09:42,640
uh

4683
04:09:42,640 --> 04:09:44,560
it's

4684
04:09:44,560 --> 04:09:47,520
yeah you can see here in the uh

4685
04:09:47,520 --> 04:09:50,080
uh lower lower corner here we have from

4686
04:09:50,080 --> 04:09:52,720
time to time we have uh the organizer's

4687
04:09:52,720 --> 04:09:54,880
screen like flickering in and out uh

4688
04:09:54,880 --> 04:09:57,359
unfortunately that's the tech situation

4689
04:09:57,359 --> 04:09:59,279
right now

4690
04:09:59,279 --> 04:10:00,640
and uh

4691
04:10:00,640 --> 04:10:01,840
in the meantime i can give you a little

4692
04:10:01,840 --> 04:10:03,840
bit of an update on the

4693
04:10:03,840 --> 04:10:05,439
combined scoreboard for the for the

4694
04:10:05,439 --> 04:10:08,560
defcon ctf we have

4695
04:10:08,560 --> 04:10:11,120
still like a fairly tight race uh we

4696
04:10:11,120 --> 04:10:13,199
have a span of

4697
04:10:13,199 --> 04:10:15,040
about 18 000

4698
04:10:15,040 --> 04:10:17,920
points for the the leaders katzebin down

4699
04:10:17,920 --> 04:10:19,600
to 14

4700
04:10:19,600 --> 04:10:22,960
000 points for the team in 16th place so

4701
04:10:22,960 --> 04:10:25,120
definitely still like everyone is

4702
04:10:25,120 --> 04:10:26,960
definitely still in the game

4703
04:10:26,960 --> 04:10:30,399
uh with top three being katsubin uh mmm

4704
04:10:30,399 --> 04:10:32,399
and perfect roots and they are all

4705
04:10:32,399 --> 04:10:34,080
within like

4706
04:10:34,080 --> 04:10:36,479
you know less than uh

4707
04:10:36,479 --> 04:10:39,439
some percent or so of each other so it's

4708
04:10:39,439 --> 04:10:40,560
it's uh

4709
04:10:40,560 --> 04:10:42,800
or maybe like ten percent uh each other

4710
04:10:42,800 --> 04:10:43,760
so

4711
04:10:43,760 --> 04:10:46,560
yeah definitely a good uh

4712
04:10:46,560 --> 04:10:49,520
good competition there um

4713
04:10:49,520 --> 04:10:51,600
so um

4714
04:10:51,600 --> 04:10:53,520
jordan is coming back here so what's the

4715
04:10:53,520 --> 04:10:55,600
status what's uh organizers doing uh

4716
04:10:55,600 --> 04:10:56,720
we're gonna need some hints they're

4717
04:10:56,720 --> 04:10:58,159
they're both still looking i don't see

4718
04:10:58,159 --> 04:10:59,520
any kind of progress so we're gonna

4719
04:10:59,520 --> 04:11:01,920
we're gonna drop a hint yes um the hint

4720
04:11:01,920 --> 04:11:02,800
that we're gonna there's a couple of

4721
04:11:02,800 --> 04:11:04,000
hits we considered one is have you

4722
04:11:04,000 --> 04:11:05,520
considered fuzzing

4723
04:11:05,520 --> 04:11:06,880
because literally just sending in a

4724
04:11:06,880 --> 04:11:09,520
bunch of a bunch of bytes will actually

4725
04:11:09,520 --> 04:11:13,359
um cause overwrite your your uh

4726
04:11:13,359 --> 04:11:15,439
your your game state yes right so that's

4727
04:11:15,439 --> 04:11:16,399
the key thing that they need to figure

4728
04:11:16,399 --> 04:11:18,319
out that if they send in just a too big

4729
04:11:18,319 --> 04:11:20,399
of a solution it will actually corrupt

4730
04:11:20,399 --> 04:11:22,319
the the state and they'll get weird

4731
04:11:22,319 --> 04:11:23,840
boards boards and then it's a matter of

4732
04:11:23,840 --> 04:11:25,920
oh okay how do i now create a board that

4733
04:11:25,920 --> 04:11:28,319
would be solvable right so one that we

4734
04:11:28,319 --> 04:11:31,439
considered the other one was um

4735
04:11:31,439 --> 04:11:34,239
don't let yourself be boxed in to your

4736
04:11:34,239 --> 04:11:35,760
solution it's a sudoku puzzle that's a

4737
04:11:35,760 --> 04:11:38,159
little probably more obscure so yeah i

4738
04:11:38,159 --> 04:11:40,560
think we're going to go with just um

4739
04:11:40,560 --> 04:11:42,560
how big how like how big is your

4740
04:11:42,560 --> 04:11:44,159
solution again question mark or how many

4741
04:11:44,159 --> 04:11:46,239
bytes is your solution question mark

4742
04:11:46,239 --> 04:11:47,680
as our as our next tent and i think

4743
04:11:47,680 --> 04:11:48,479
we're going to give them that because

4744
04:11:48,479 --> 04:11:50,319
there's still some work to be done right

4745
04:11:50,319 --> 04:11:52,080
um and we want to to give them both a

4746
04:11:52,080 --> 04:11:53,439
shot at getting it

4747
04:11:53,439 --> 04:11:54,319
otherwise we're going to go to our

4748
04:11:54,319 --> 04:11:55,840
sudden death so that's the hint we're

4749
04:11:55,840 --> 04:11:57,760
going to go with anytime i had a comment

4750
04:11:57,760 --> 04:12:00,239
here from from kgf uh

4751
04:12:00,239 --> 04:12:01,840
these seems interesting c challenges i

4752
04:12:01,840 --> 04:12:02,960
think i would try them all but i'm sure

4753
04:12:02,960 --> 04:12:04,720
i would take a lot longer i would too

4754
04:12:04,720 --> 04:12:07,439
yeah so that's okay but it is uh like a

4755
04:12:07,439 --> 04:12:10,640
good idea uh i mean in general for ctfs

4756
04:12:10,640 --> 04:12:11,920
to like uh

4757
04:12:11,920 --> 04:12:13,760
try out challenges after they've been

4758
04:12:13,760 --> 04:12:15,760
solved uh normally for a lot of

4759
04:12:15,760 --> 04:12:18,479
ctfs people publish uh write-ups

4760
04:12:18,479 --> 04:12:20,479
so you can like try the challenges uh

4761
04:12:20,479 --> 04:12:22,399
that you didn't manage to solve

4762
04:12:22,399 --> 04:12:23,920
and then kind of use like a write-up or

4763
04:12:23,920 --> 04:12:26,159
so as a reference and then and guide

4764
04:12:26,159 --> 04:12:29,439
your attempts as well to learn more

4765
04:12:29,439 --> 04:12:31,920
um i think the idea is that we are

4766
04:12:31,920 --> 04:12:34,080
releasing all the challenges it might uh

4767
04:12:34,080 --> 04:12:35,920
take a few days for us to uh recover

4768
04:12:35,920 --> 04:12:38,479
from this uh weekend we have

4769
04:12:38,479 --> 04:12:40,800
15 matches so

4770
04:12:40,800 --> 04:12:44,319
another 11 matches to go after this one

4771
04:12:44,319 --> 04:12:46,560
uh but yeah we'll we will definitely

4772
04:12:46,560 --> 04:12:47,600
publish them

4773
04:12:47,600 --> 04:12:49,920
uh and then uh yeah you can even like

4774
04:12:49,920 --> 04:12:52,640
you know organize your own like mini uh

4775
04:12:52,640 --> 04:12:54,640
uh tournament in your own uh you know

4776
04:12:54,640 --> 04:12:56,640
ctf team or uh

4777
04:12:56,640 --> 04:12:59,279
you know hacker space uh

4778
04:12:59,279 --> 04:13:02,960
uh i know that i heard from before the

4779
04:13:02,960 --> 04:13:05,359
competition that uh shellfish actually

4780
04:13:05,359 --> 04:13:07,920
did some practice uh for this tournament

4781
04:13:07,920 --> 04:13:10,479
uh by doing like a small

4782
04:13:10,479 --> 04:13:12,800
mini competition of their own within the

4783
04:13:12,800 --> 04:13:15,120
team which i think it paid off

4784
04:13:15,120 --> 04:13:17,520
at least it appears to pay off

4785
04:13:17,520 --> 04:13:19,359
one of the winning teams yeah we'll see

4786
04:13:19,359 --> 04:13:20,960
how far they can go

4787
04:13:20,960 --> 04:13:22,399
um

4788
04:13:22,399 --> 04:13:24,800
so we have the hints prepared jordan is

4789
04:13:24,800 --> 04:13:26,319
going to go and hand that off to the

4790
04:13:26,319 --> 04:13:27,520
players

4791
04:13:27,520 --> 04:13:31,520
uh we are what's the clock at so we are

4792
04:13:31,520 --> 04:13:34,880
so 5 45 so we are 35 minutes into the

4793
04:13:34,880 --> 04:13:37,439
game which is mean that we are running

4794
04:13:37,439 --> 04:13:39,760
uh up bank against the sudden death uh

4795
04:13:39,760 --> 04:13:42,000
clock here uh let's see if they can

4796
04:13:42,000 --> 04:13:43,840
manage to figure out this on the other

4797
04:13:43,840 --> 04:13:45,199
hand this is also kind of a similar

4798
04:13:45,199 --> 04:13:46,640
situation to

4799
04:13:46,640 --> 04:13:48,640
the previous challenge where we were 35

4800
04:13:48,640 --> 04:13:51,279
minutes into the game and then uh it

4801
04:13:51,279 --> 04:13:52,960
kind of just like clicked for one of the

4802
04:13:52,960 --> 04:13:54,720
players and they managed to go all the

4803
04:13:54,720 --> 04:13:56,479
way so uh

4804
04:13:56,479 --> 04:13:58,159
it's gonna be really exciting to see

4805
04:13:58,159 --> 04:14:00,640
what's going on still a bit

4806
04:14:00,640 --> 04:14:04,000
difficult to kind of like get a read on

4807
04:14:04,000 --> 04:14:05,920
uh balsam's progress or like their

4808
04:14:05,920 --> 04:14:07,359
understanding of that they're kind of

4809
04:14:07,359 --> 04:14:08,720
like looking at the code probably

4810
04:14:08,720 --> 04:14:10,000
thinking very hard about you can see

4811
04:14:10,000 --> 04:14:11,760
like the mouse moving around

4812
04:14:11,760 --> 04:14:13,359
trying to build this mental model of

4813
04:14:13,359 --> 04:14:14,720
what's what's going on you're like kind

4814
04:14:14,720 --> 04:14:16,880
of like running the code in your head

4815
04:14:16,880 --> 04:14:18,560
you know what if this has this value

4816
04:14:18,560 --> 04:14:20,159
like how this is it's probably the least

4817
04:14:20,159 --> 04:14:21,680
interesting part of a live ctf right

4818
04:14:21,680 --> 04:14:22,800
that's the only downside when you have a

4819
04:14:22,800 --> 04:14:24,720
more reverse engineering heavy challenge

4820
04:14:24,720 --> 04:14:26,239
yes is that you're just seeing people

4821
04:14:26,239 --> 04:14:28,000
like maybe name stuff if you're lucky or

4822
04:14:28,000 --> 04:14:29,520
add comments but most of the time it's

4823
04:14:29,520 --> 04:14:31,680
just looking at it right and what we you

4824
04:14:31,680 --> 04:14:32,960
know when you know you're getting closer

4825
04:14:32,960 --> 04:14:34,080
when you start seeing a crash in a

4826
04:14:34,080 --> 04:14:35,840
debugger and a payload being written

4827
04:14:35,840 --> 04:14:37,439
yeah and we don't have it yet i'm gonna

4828
04:14:37,439 --> 04:14:39,199
go ahead and keep an eye on uh the

4829
04:14:39,199 --> 04:14:41,359
organizers just briefly yeah and see if

4830
04:14:41,359 --> 04:14:42,960
we get any kind of that similar product

4831
04:14:42,960 --> 04:14:44,080
progress

4832
04:14:44,080 --> 04:14:47,120
right so we have um

4833
04:14:47,120 --> 04:14:48,880
oh okay we did have a comment somebody

4834
04:14:48,880 --> 04:14:49,760
else pointed out thank you for

4835
04:14:49,760 --> 04:14:52,319
clarifying um the reason that that

4836
04:14:52,319 --> 04:14:53,439
somebody was looking for the lipstick

4837
04:14:53,439 --> 04:14:54,800
was to actually run it because if you

4838
04:14:54,800 --> 04:14:56,560
don't have the same vm

4839
04:14:56,560 --> 04:14:59,359
uh handy you can't run that uh lipstick

4840
04:14:59,359 --> 04:15:00,560
so you can just grab the lipstick from

4841
04:15:00,560 --> 04:15:03,040
another another version of linux to be

4842
04:15:03,040 --> 04:15:04,080
able to run the binary so that is

4843
04:15:04,080 --> 04:15:06,080
another a completely valid reason that

4844
04:15:06,080 --> 04:15:08,560
you might do that um yes probably just

4845
04:15:08,560 --> 04:15:10,319
easier to maybe look at a previous

4846
04:15:10,319 --> 04:15:12,640
stream or i have we actually i don't

4847
04:15:12,640 --> 04:15:14,080
think we've told people

4848
04:15:14,080 --> 04:15:15,279
what platform that most of our

4849
04:15:15,279 --> 04:15:16,319
challenges all of our challenges were

4850
04:15:16,319 --> 04:15:18,399
created on that's actually a good note

4851
04:15:18,399 --> 04:15:20,399
yeah so for future for future things we

4852
04:15:20,399 --> 04:15:22,000
should because that's again

4853
04:15:22,000 --> 04:15:23,920
normal and a ctf happens all the time

4854
04:15:23,920 --> 04:15:25,680
you have to figure out the os that it

4855
04:15:25,680 --> 04:15:27,040
was created for match version

4856
04:15:27,040 --> 04:15:28,399
information and whatnot

4857
04:15:28,399 --> 04:15:29,680
not our intention to make that part of

4858
04:15:29,680 --> 04:15:31,199
the challenge here and it's the thing

4859
04:15:31,199 --> 04:15:34,880
it's like ubuntu 22 was recent somewhat

4860
04:15:34,880 --> 04:15:37,760
recently went in like lts release and a

4861
04:15:37,760 --> 04:15:39,279
lot of people haven't

4862
04:15:39,279 --> 04:15:43,199
uh updated to that yet um i um you know

4863
04:15:43,199 --> 04:15:45,920
i will accept like shared responsibility

4864
04:15:45,920 --> 04:15:47,520
on this because like you know update

4865
04:15:47,520 --> 04:15:51,439
your computer's people uh but 2004 2204

4866
04:15:51,439 --> 04:15:53,040
would probably be the ubuntu it's the

4867
04:15:53,040 --> 04:15:55,680
most you know common or debian yeah uh

4868
04:15:55,680 --> 04:15:57,040
certainly it's it's frequently but all

4869
04:15:57,040 --> 04:15:57,840
right let me go and take a look at the

4870
04:15:57,840 --> 04:15:59,199
audiences i'll be back and we'll see how

4871
04:15:59,199 --> 04:16:00,640
it's going awesome

4872
04:16:00,640 --> 04:16:02,159
so um

4873
04:16:02,159 --> 04:16:03,279
i was

4874
04:16:03,279 --> 04:16:06,319
talking about something um

4875
04:16:06,319 --> 04:16:08,319
when it comes to these challenges

4876
04:16:08,319 --> 04:16:09,680
um

4877
04:16:09,680 --> 04:16:12,159
trying to get back on you know my train

4878
04:16:12,159 --> 04:16:14,800
of thought there

4879
04:16:14,800 --> 04:16:17,119
with

4880
04:16:18,399 --> 04:16:19,920
oh yes so

4881
04:16:19,920 --> 04:16:22,080
you know with this like

4882
04:16:22,080 --> 04:16:23,920
looking at another player looking at

4883
04:16:23,920 --> 04:16:26,080
code trying to figure things out

4884
04:16:26,080 --> 04:16:28,800
a lot of times when i talk to people um

4885
04:16:28,800 --> 04:16:30,560
who are you know not experienced ctf

4886
04:16:30,560 --> 04:16:32,640
players or don't know what ctfs are

4887
04:16:32,640 --> 04:16:34,080
uh you often get the question it was

4888
04:16:34,080 --> 04:16:35,760
like oh is this some kind of like

4889
04:16:35,760 --> 04:16:37,920
esports thing or like could you could

4890
04:16:37,920 --> 04:16:39,600
you make this into some kind of like

4891
04:16:39,600 --> 04:16:41,840
uh esports thing and to an extent this

4892
04:16:41,840 --> 04:16:43,680
is kind of what we're trying to do

4893
04:16:43,680 --> 04:16:44,479
here

4894
04:16:44,479 --> 04:16:45,840
uh but

4895
04:16:45,840 --> 04:16:48,239
of course it has its shortcomings that

4896
04:16:48,239 --> 04:16:52,720
like some aspects of ctf um is

4897
04:16:52,720 --> 04:16:54,479
kind of like watching someone else take

4898
04:16:54,479 --> 04:16:57,040
a maths exam uh it's you know

4899
04:16:57,040 --> 04:16:59,359
occasionally not the most exciting so

4900
04:16:59,359 --> 04:17:01,600
we're uh really trying to by adding this

4901
04:17:01,600 --> 04:17:03,040
commentary and trying to understand what

4902
04:17:03,040 --> 04:17:04,319
the players are doing we're trying to

4903
04:17:04,319 --> 04:17:06,399
make this an interesting and educational

4904
04:17:06,399 --> 04:17:08,880
experience for all of you um

4905
04:17:08,880 --> 04:17:10,640
viewers uh there

4906
04:17:10,640 --> 04:17:15,120
um so i i hope you uh do

4907
04:17:15,120 --> 04:17:16,880
uh enjoy this and then you're gonna have

4908
04:17:16,880 --> 04:17:19,040
some takeaways and definitely check out

4909
04:17:19,040 --> 04:17:21,520
the challenges uh afterwards

4910
04:17:21,520 --> 04:17:24,960
uh to also kind of get a feel for

4911
04:17:24,960 --> 04:17:27,120
oh that's you know it might some of

4912
04:17:27,120 --> 04:17:28,640
these might seem simple but when you're

4913
04:17:28,640 --> 04:17:30,080
sitting here and actually trying to do

4914
04:17:30,080 --> 04:17:32,399
it you have to

4915
04:17:32,399 --> 04:17:33,920
consider and take into account all these

4916
04:17:33,920 --> 04:17:36,319
like small little details like

4917
04:17:36,319 --> 04:17:38,159
if you're just out off by one like a

4918
04:17:38,159 --> 04:17:40,800
small bit somewhere like the whole thing

4919
04:17:40,800 --> 04:17:42,880
uh doesn't work you need to do all this

4920
04:17:42,880 --> 04:17:44,640
troubleshooting debugging

4921
04:17:44,640 --> 04:17:46,399
uh and uh

4922
04:17:46,399 --> 04:17:48,239
i think i mentioned it earlier but like

4923
04:17:48,239 --> 04:17:51,680
when you're writing exploits you are

4924
04:17:51,680 --> 04:17:53,040
essentially it's like software

4925
04:17:53,040 --> 04:17:55,040
development but with your like hands

4926
04:17:55,040 --> 04:17:56,880
tied behind your back you don't get like

4927
04:17:56,880 --> 04:17:58,080
all the nice

4928
04:17:58,080 --> 04:17:59,840
tools and helps and error messages that

4929
04:17:59,840 --> 04:18:01,600
you get like during normal software

4930
04:18:01,600 --> 04:18:04,159
development uh processes where you know

4931
04:18:04,159 --> 04:18:06,319
you have all of these modern uh tools to

4932
04:18:06,319 --> 04:18:08,239
help you but here you're kind of like

4933
04:18:08,239 --> 04:18:10,880
you're trying to bend something in in a

4934
04:18:10,880 --> 04:18:12,479
way that was not

4935
04:18:12,479 --> 04:18:14,960
like intended to be used you're

4936
04:18:14,960 --> 04:18:17,760
messing with the state of memory um and

4937
04:18:17,760 --> 04:18:18,840
so on

4938
04:18:18,840 --> 04:18:21,920
so it's you really have like everything

4939
04:18:21,920 --> 04:18:23,199
stacked

4940
04:18:23,199 --> 04:18:26,239
uh against you and uh that is like a big

4941
04:18:26,239 --> 04:18:27,760
part of the challenge when doing these

4942
04:18:27,760 --> 04:18:30,399
uh ponables these memory corruption uh

4943
04:18:30,399 --> 04:18:31,840
challenges

4944
04:18:31,840 --> 04:18:32,720
um

4945
04:18:32,720 --> 04:18:34,800
looking here at the code here we can see

4946
04:18:34,800 --> 04:18:36,159
that

4947
04:18:36,159 --> 04:18:38,399
uh the balsam player is writing some

4948
04:18:38,399 --> 04:18:39,920
small helper function here to send the

4949
04:18:39,920 --> 04:18:40,960
number

4950
04:18:40,960 --> 04:18:43,279
uh maybe they're gonna try to you know

4951
04:18:43,279 --> 04:18:45,439
use this to try to send different num

4952
04:18:45,439 --> 04:18:47,600
amounts different number of numbers

4953
04:18:47,600 --> 04:18:49,439
and uh you know see if they get a kind

4954
04:18:49,439 --> 04:18:51,199
of any kind of reaction

4955
04:18:51,199 --> 04:18:52,800
out of that

4956
04:18:52,800 --> 04:18:54,239
um

4957
04:18:54,239 --> 04:18:57,520
haven't really seen yet what

4958
04:18:57,520 --> 04:18:59,040
oh so now they're gonna send like a

4959
04:18:59,040 --> 04:19:02,000
thousand zeros that's that's interesting

4960
04:19:02,000 --> 04:19:04,080
um

4961
04:19:04,080 --> 04:19:05,439
so we comment here like yeah it's

4962
04:19:05,439 --> 04:19:07,439
unsolvable yeah like the sudoku itself

4963
04:19:07,439 --> 04:19:09,359
is unsolvable and that's kind of like

4964
04:19:09,359 --> 04:19:11,520
the twist of this whole thing that uh

4965
04:19:11,520 --> 04:19:13,199
you know at face value just a solar

4966
04:19:13,199 --> 04:19:15,199
sudoku can win but then it's it's

4967
04:19:15,199 --> 04:19:16,560
unsolvable so

4968
04:19:16,560 --> 04:19:18,080
uh yeah that's kind of like the recap

4969
04:19:18,080 --> 04:19:20,159
for for people just recently tuning in

4970
04:19:20,159 --> 04:19:21,040
and

4971
04:19:21,040 --> 04:19:23,040
speaking of recap

4972
04:19:23,040 --> 04:19:24,239
just to tell you again a little bit

4973
04:19:24,239 --> 04:19:26,319
about what we're doing here so we're

4974
04:19:26,319 --> 04:19:29,920
here in vegas uh on site at defcon so

4975
04:19:29,920 --> 04:19:33,199
organizing this live cdf as part of the

4976
04:19:33,199 --> 04:19:36,239
um official defcon cdf so this is kind

4977
04:19:36,239 --> 04:19:38,239
of like a sub event where all the 16 uh

4978
04:19:38,239 --> 04:19:39,840
participating teams

4979
04:19:39,840 --> 04:19:42,080
uh participate in this like single

4980
04:19:42,080 --> 04:19:44,399
elimination knockout tournament where in

4981
04:19:44,399 --> 04:19:46,479
each match uh the team send one player

4982
04:19:46,479 --> 04:19:47,359
to go

4983
04:19:47,359 --> 04:19:50,000
uh head to head against the other team

4984
04:19:50,000 --> 04:19:52,399
to be the first one to solve a

4985
04:19:52,399 --> 04:19:55,840
relatively simple uh ctf uh challenge

4986
04:19:55,840 --> 04:19:58,479
i mean relatively is relative yes yes

4987
04:19:58,479 --> 04:20:00,239
and that's i really want to stress

4988
04:20:00,239 --> 04:20:01,920
relatively and i want to be clear i

4989
04:20:01,920 --> 04:20:03,199
wouldn't personally solve half of the

4990
04:20:03,199 --> 04:20:04,640
ones that were fielding in the allotted

4991
04:20:04,640 --> 04:20:05,600
time

4992
04:20:05,600 --> 04:20:07,279
uh i we you know tried some of them and

4993
04:20:07,279 --> 04:20:08,880
it you know i could get them but maybe

4994
04:20:08,880 --> 04:20:11,439
take a little bit a little bit longer so

4995
04:20:11,439 --> 04:20:12,640
i have a lot of respect for these people

4996
04:20:12,640 --> 04:20:14,640
they're all very very good

4997
04:20:14,640 --> 04:20:15,760
and they're dealing with the pressure

4998
04:20:15,760 --> 04:20:17,120
being on camera

4999
04:20:17,120 --> 04:20:18,800
there's a crowd standing around them

5000
04:20:18,800 --> 04:20:20,399
watching them

5001
04:20:20,399 --> 04:20:22,720
it is uh it can be

5002
04:20:22,720 --> 04:20:24,960
it can be pretty nerve-wracking so uh

5003
04:20:24,960 --> 04:20:28,319
i'm predicting oh that is

5004
04:20:28,319 --> 04:20:30,960
quite the visual effect there yeah uh

5005
04:20:30,960 --> 04:20:32,080
you know the

5006
04:20:32,080 --> 04:20:34,720
photo sensitivity warnings here uh i

5007
04:20:34,720 --> 04:20:35,920
think it's only on our monitor i don't

5008
04:20:35,920 --> 04:20:37,359
see it no no no no it's it's it's on

5009
04:20:37,359 --> 04:20:39,359
stream as well yes we have some yeah so

5010
04:20:39,359 --> 04:20:41,279
switching not sure what that's about uh

5011
04:20:41,279 --> 04:20:42,720
feels like our whole uh infrastructure

5012
04:20:42,720 --> 04:20:44,880
is slowly melting uh so we'll know it's

5013
04:20:44,880 --> 04:20:48,000
fine it's everything wow that is

5014
04:20:48,000 --> 04:20:50,479
that is unusual yup um maybe we're

5015
04:20:50,479 --> 04:20:52,319
getting hacked by the players like

5016
04:20:52,319 --> 04:20:53,359
through the

5017
04:20:53,359 --> 04:20:55,199
hdmi cable they're playing the other

5018
04:20:55,199 --> 04:20:57,760
game the other the other ctf challenge i

5019
04:20:57,760 --> 04:20:58,479
mean

5020
04:20:58,479 --> 04:21:00,399
we would be lying if we would say that

5021
04:21:00,399 --> 04:21:02,960
we did not have a discussion about like

5022
04:21:02,960 --> 04:21:04,960
what shenanigans could the team try to

5023
04:21:04,960 --> 04:21:06,800
pull off and how we would yeah measure

5024
04:21:06,800 --> 04:21:08,560
against it or what we would do so doing

5025
04:21:08,560 --> 04:21:10,239
that kind of like fret uh threat

5026
04:21:10,239 --> 04:21:13,120
analysis uh or uh threat modeling uh

5027
04:21:13,120 --> 04:21:15,199
against yeah three more minutes

5028
04:21:15,199 --> 04:21:17,359
wow three more minutes until it's gone

5029
04:21:17,359 --> 04:21:19,840
this has been a very fast 45 minutes

5030
04:21:19,840 --> 04:21:22,560
it's looking unlikely um uh that either

5031
04:21:22,560 --> 04:21:24,800
one i did see some some debugger action

5032
04:21:24,800 --> 04:21:27,760
yes um i'm gonna make one last pass if

5033
04:21:27,760 --> 04:21:29,359
we see somebody very close so they're

5034
04:21:29,359 --> 04:21:30,880
making progress we might be able to give

5035
04:21:30,880 --> 04:21:32,080
them just a little bit extra but

5036
04:21:32,080 --> 04:21:36,520
basically we're about ready to deploy

5037
04:21:37,040 --> 04:21:39,600
or if they obviously want to extend it

5038
04:21:39,600 --> 04:21:41,199
um that's not a bad idea we can both ask

5039
04:21:41,199 --> 04:21:42,319
both if they both say they want to

5040
04:21:42,319 --> 04:21:43,600
extend it we'll let them go because

5041
04:21:43,600 --> 04:21:45,520
they're the last one yeah and if

5042
04:21:45,520 --> 04:21:47,520
so the rules are if one of them says

5043
04:21:47,520 --> 04:21:48,840
they don't like they want to go sudden

5044
04:21:48,840 --> 04:21:50,800
death if both of them won't extend it

5045
04:21:50,800 --> 04:21:52,319
then it's fine exactly right i will see

5046
04:21:52,319 --> 04:21:55,920
what they say but ask them like you know

5047
04:21:55,920 --> 04:21:57,120
independent like

5048
04:21:57,120 --> 04:21:59,520
you know one-on-one like to not give any

5049
04:21:59,520 --> 04:22:01,199
like pressure

5050
04:22:01,199 --> 04:22:02,880
yeah i mean it would it would be cool to

5051
04:22:02,880 --> 04:22:05,840
see a solution on this and i think we do

5052
04:22:05,840 --> 04:22:07,359
since we have been keeping up with the

5053
04:22:07,359 --> 04:22:10,880
schedule we do have that kind of time

5054
04:22:10,880 --> 04:22:13,680
but again the uh yeah it's it's

5055
04:22:13,680 --> 04:22:15,760
difficult to to to say what the players

5056
04:22:15,760 --> 04:22:17,199
want like this those kind of like kind

5057
04:22:17,199 --> 04:22:18,960
of game theory thing like do you want to

5058
04:22:18,960 --> 04:22:21,279
go to sudden depth or not like it's a

5059
04:22:21,279 --> 04:22:23,600
high-risk uh environment right when

5060
04:22:23,600 --> 04:22:25,520
you're gonna do this super fast

5061
04:22:25,520 --> 04:22:27,520
do you think that you also you don't

5062
04:22:27,520 --> 04:22:29,520
know the progress of the other player

5063
04:22:29,520 --> 04:22:31,120
like do you think you have better

5064
04:22:31,120 --> 04:22:32,720
progress than the other player in this

5065
04:22:32,720 --> 04:22:35,040
challenge right now and

5066
04:22:35,040 --> 04:22:37,199
if you don't do you think you have a

5067
04:22:37,199 --> 04:22:38,479
better chance of beating them in the

5068
04:22:38,479 --> 04:22:40,880
sudden death one versus catching up with

5069
04:22:40,880 --> 04:22:43,520
them in the current challenge it's uh

5070
04:22:43,520 --> 04:22:46,479
definitely not an easy uh decision uh to

5071
04:22:46,479 --> 04:22:48,399
make by the players

5072
04:22:48,399 --> 04:22:51,120
so uh what's uh what's the verdict what

5073
04:22:51,120 --> 04:22:52,319
do you think

5074
04:22:52,319 --> 04:22:54,000
what would you if you're in their shoes

5075
04:22:54,000 --> 04:22:55,760
oh no i would say extended absolutely

5076
04:22:55,760 --> 04:22:57,920
yes okay so nice so we have a game here

5077
04:22:57,920 --> 04:22:58,880
yeah so

5078
04:22:58,880 --> 04:23:00,720
i'm i'm happy with this because i don't

5079
04:23:00,720 --> 04:23:02,080
want to change the rules in a way that

5080
04:23:02,080 --> 04:23:04,080
they're unhappy with but they both want

5081
04:23:04,080 --> 04:23:05,760
to solve it i mean nobody wants to give

5082
04:23:05,760 --> 04:23:07,680
up on it no no no no no no that you've

5083
04:23:07,680 --> 04:23:09,279
been working hard that you started

5084
04:23:09,279 --> 04:23:11,120
you're having a little bit of an idea

5085
04:23:11,120 --> 04:23:12,720
i'm glad i really want to see them see

5086
04:23:12,720 --> 04:23:14,239
this through we'll let them go it's the

5087
04:23:14,239 --> 04:23:16,080
last one of the day so we're not running

5088
04:23:16,080 --> 04:23:17,439
over anything else

5089
04:23:17,439 --> 04:23:18,239
um

5090
04:23:18,239 --> 04:23:19,920
i'm actually kind of excited no 100 i

5091
04:23:19,920 --> 04:23:21,359
saw a

5092
04:23:21,359 --> 04:23:23,760
story related to that so i was playing

5093
04:23:23,760 --> 04:23:26,319
in the qualifiers for the defcon ctf

5094
04:23:26,319 --> 04:23:29,600
with our scandinavian uh team norse code

5095
04:23:29,600 --> 04:23:32,159
and i was basically sitting all weekend

5096
04:23:32,159 --> 04:23:34,720
with one challenge uh so i mean i took

5097
04:23:34,720 --> 04:23:35,920
breaks and met some friends and stuff

5098
04:23:35,920 --> 04:23:36,640
but

5099
04:23:36,640 --> 04:23:38,319
there was a lot of hours this is perry's

5100
04:23:38,319 --> 04:23:39,600
challenge there was this was perry's

5101
04:23:39,600 --> 04:23:41,760
challenge it was the uh crypto ponable

5102
04:23:41,760 --> 04:23:43,840
thing uh so after i don't know if i

5103
04:23:43,840 --> 04:23:45,920
spent uh if i don't remember it was like

5104
04:23:45,920 --> 04:23:48,880
10 20 or 30 hours on this but regardless

5105
04:23:48,880 --> 04:23:51,840
i uh solved it like two minutes after

5106
04:23:51,840 --> 04:23:55,439
the ctf ended yep and that uh yeah i

5107
04:23:55,439 --> 04:23:57,120
mean on the one hand it's crushing and

5108
04:23:57,120 --> 04:23:58,960
on the other hand though you still

5109
04:23:58,960 --> 04:24:01,120
solved it you still solved it and that's

5110
04:24:01,120 --> 04:24:02,800
the thing like

5111
04:24:02,800 --> 04:24:03,680
when

5112
04:24:03,680 --> 04:24:05,840
when the time ran out like i could have

5113
04:24:05,840 --> 04:24:08,800
just stopped because like

5114
04:24:08,800 --> 04:24:10,080
it doesn't matter anymore like we're not

5115
04:24:10,080 --> 04:24:12,399
gonna get any points but i i was so

5116
04:24:12,399 --> 04:24:14,399
close i did want not want to stop there

5117
04:24:14,399 --> 04:24:15,520
yeah yeah

5118
04:24:15,520 --> 04:24:17,359
so the only kind of like

5119
04:24:17,359 --> 04:24:18,560
um

5120
04:24:18,560 --> 04:24:19,520
saving

5121
04:24:19,520 --> 04:24:21,120
grace for or you want to call it for

5122
04:24:21,120 --> 04:24:23,199
that was that in the end

5123
04:24:23,199 --> 04:24:24,880
solving that challenge or not would not

5124
04:24:24,880 --> 04:24:26,319
have affected whether we qualified or

5125
04:24:26,319 --> 04:24:28,239
not that that would have been crushing

5126
04:24:28,239 --> 04:24:29,760
that's a little demoralizing yeah when

5127
04:24:29,760 --> 04:24:30,640
it would have been it would have been

5128
04:24:30,640 --> 04:24:32,000
the difference luckily even if with

5129
04:24:32,000 --> 04:24:33,439
those points we wouldn't we would have

5130
04:24:33,439 --> 04:24:35,840
been just below the qualifying limits so

5131
04:24:35,840 --> 04:24:37,520
at least at least you had clarity there

5132
04:24:37,520 --> 04:24:39,199
there either way yeah i i was

5133
04:24:39,199 --> 04:24:40,640
comfortable with that that was fine and

5134
04:24:40,640 --> 04:24:42,960
also that means that you know i could uh

5135
04:24:42,960 --> 04:24:45,920
uh be part of this uh without having to

5136
04:24:45,920 --> 04:24:49,520
like uh betray uh the team right so uh

5137
04:24:49,520 --> 04:24:53,120
yeah all right okay so

5138
04:24:53,120 --> 04:24:55,760
we are

5139
04:24:55,920 --> 04:24:57,600
there's a question here about whether it

5140
04:24:57,600 --> 04:25:00,000
was ncat no this was the uh

5141
04:25:00,000 --> 04:25:03,920
it was a crypto ponable uh challenge uh

5142
04:25:03,920 --> 04:25:05,600
it was about like a function closure

5143
04:25:05,600 --> 04:25:07,840
thing yeah c plus plus we could go ask

5144
04:25:07,840 --> 04:25:09,520
yeah perry she's somewhere so she was

5145
04:25:09,520 --> 04:25:11,199
she just was in the room she just left

5146
04:25:11,199 --> 04:25:13,439
right um but yeah i've heard a number of

5147
04:25:13,439 --> 04:25:15,279
people that that worked on that it was a

5148
04:25:15,279 --> 04:25:17,840
great challenge like i i enjoyed it a

5149
04:25:17,840 --> 04:25:19,520
lot

5150
04:25:19,520 --> 04:25:22,399
but it was tough okay so

5151
04:25:22,399 --> 04:25:24,399
we we don't have a hard time but now now

5152
04:25:24,399 --> 04:25:25,600
it's basically we're just going to let

5153
04:25:25,600 --> 04:25:27,920
it go until either we are convinced it's

5154
04:25:27,920 --> 04:25:30,640
going to take way too long or uh

5155
04:25:30,640 --> 04:25:31,439
you know

5156
04:25:31,439 --> 04:25:32,880
we'll we'll we'll see at this point but

5157
04:25:32,880 --> 04:25:35,520
they both want to keep going i would

5158
04:25:35,520 --> 04:25:37,120
love for one of them to get it it not

5159
04:25:37,120 --> 04:25:38,479
only means we get to save one of our

5160
04:25:38,479 --> 04:25:40,239
sudden deaths um but i think it's just

5161
04:25:40,239 --> 04:25:42,000
way more fulfilling for them and for the

5162
04:25:42,000 --> 04:25:43,920
audience to see kind of like the yes the

5163
04:25:43,920 --> 04:25:45,439
hard one the hard one solves so we're

5164
04:25:45,439 --> 04:25:46,880
looking forward to it

5165
04:25:46,880 --> 04:25:49,680
um it is interesting that we've got rop

5166
04:25:49,680 --> 04:25:51,439
gadget address just kind of coming out

5167
04:25:51,439 --> 04:25:52,880
it looks like it looks like a template i

5168
04:25:52,880 --> 04:25:54,479
think that this existed because yeah

5169
04:25:54,479 --> 04:25:57,279
hopefully they have an idea that that is

5170
04:25:57,279 --> 04:25:58,800
but we are seeing like someone is

5171
04:25:58,800 --> 04:26:00,560
writing something very deliberate here

5172
04:26:00,560 --> 04:26:03,199
right this is like a to print out

5173
04:26:03,199 --> 04:26:06,720
the board somehow but um

5174
04:26:06,720 --> 04:26:07,880
let's see they are

5175
04:26:07,880 --> 04:26:10,939
[Music]

5176
04:26:10,960 --> 04:26:12,399
trying to see i mean this this like

5177
04:26:12,399 --> 04:26:14,000
double loop there is to print out some

5178
04:26:14,000 --> 04:26:16,720
state but that part above

5179
04:26:16,720 --> 04:26:18,080
you see something where they're like

5180
04:26:18,080 --> 04:26:21,760
cutting off they're swapping

5181
04:26:23,120 --> 04:26:25,279
all right

5182
04:26:25,279 --> 04:26:26,960
oh is this just to

5183
04:26:26,960 --> 04:26:29,600
generate a valid generate a solution

5184
04:26:29,600 --> 04:26:31,199
that they i mean i would just search the

5185
04:26:31,199 --> 04:26:33,279
internet for sudoku board and copy and

5186
04:26:33,279 --> 04:26:35,040
paste it but but if that is what they're

5187
04:26:35,040 --> 04:26:36,399
doing that would that would be valid too

5188
04:26:36,399 --> 04:26:38,159
right so the idea is that you want to

5189
04:26:38,159 --> 04:26:39,600
kind of like overflow and stuff to like

5190
04:26:39,600 --> 04:26:42,319
basically insert

5191
04:26:42,319 --> 04:26:44,080
to modify the state into something

5192
04:26:44,080 --> 04:26:45,199
that's either

5193
04:26:45,199 --> 04:26:47,600
solvable or already solved

5194
04:26:47,600 --> 04:26:50,479
uh and uh so they they need to have that

5195
04:26:50,479 --> 04:26:52,080
okay so we're seeing we're seeing

5196
04:26:52,080 --> 04:26:53,600
interesting we're seeing calculations

5197
04:26:53,600 --> 04:26:56,840
we're seeing uh length

5198
04:26:56,840 --> 04:26:59,120
calculations uh unfortunately i was

5199
04:26:59,120 --> 04:27:02,080
hoping we'd get some more uh

5200
04:27:02,080 --> 04:27:03,680
video from the new organizer up it came

5201
04:27:03,680 --> 04:27:05,840
in briefly yes

5202
04:27:05,840 --> 04:27:08,640
with some debugger output there right

5203
04:27:08,640 --> 04:27:10,319
yeah yeah we'll leave it up for a second

5204
04:27:10,319 --> 04:27:11,439
and just kind of show them both and we

5205
04:27:11,439 --> 04:27:13,040
might be able to see a little bit yeah

5206
04:27:13,040 --> 04:27:14,880
see there it's coming on

5207
04:27:14,880 --> 04:27:17,120
man that's tantalizing that's so mean

5208
04:27:17,120 --> 04:27:20,640
yeah this this cable is has been yeah we

5209
04:27:20,640 --> 04:27:22,720
might have to do some shopping oh there

5210
04:27:22,720 --> 04:27:24,560
is definitely a shopping run tonight so

5211
04:27:24,560 --> 04:27:26,479
we should be able to have this solved uh

5212
04:27:26,479 --> 04:27:28,399
and out of the way and that way we got a

5213
04:27:28,399 --> 04:27:30,239
long day eight hours tomorrow of

5214
04:27:30,239 --> 04:27:32,880
hopefully uninterrupted stream

5215
04:27:32,880 --> 04:27:34,399
yeah we'll see we'll see if that if that

5216
04:27:34,399 --> 04:27:35,600
turns out to be the case i mean given

5217
04:27:35,600 --> 04:27:37,520
that it's only been

5218
04:27:37,520 --> 04:27:39,520
we've swapped out the capture card the

5219
04:27:39,520 --> 04:27:41,040
usbc cable

5220
04:27:41,040 --> 04:27:42,319
the hdmi is the only thing we haven't

5221
04:27:42,319 --> 04:27:44,000
swapped out but it's been that same side

5222
04:27:44,000 --> 04:27:45,920
of the table consistently

5223
04:27:45,920 --> 04:27:48,239
yes that's been having these problems

5224
04:27:48,239 --> 04:27:49,600
it makes me think that yeah we've just

5225
04:27:49,600 --> 04:27:52,159
got an hdmi cable that

5226
04:27:52,159 --> 04:27:55,199
is suspicious uh so

5227
04:27:55,199 --> 04:27:56,479
we'll see if we can we can get that

5228
04:27:56,479 --> 04:27:58,319
going all right um

5229
04:27:58,319 --> 04:27:59,359
actually let me i'm gonna go ahead and

5230
04:27:59,359 --> 04:28:01,279
do another in person look i'm gonna go

5231
04:28:01,279 --> 04:28:03,120
and take a look at new organizers

5232
04:28:03,120 --> 04:28:04,560
um we'll be back with an update shortly

5233
04:28:04,560 --> 04:28:05,520
because i

5234
04:28:05,520 --> 04:28:08,080
debuggers generally a good sign yes i

5235
04:28:08,080 --> 04:28:10,399
just wanted to wait

5236
04:28:10,399 --> 04:28:12,880
uh i saw like a bin bash string in the

5237
04:28:12,880 --> 04:28:16,239
debugger there somehow

5238
04:28:16,239 --> 04:28:18,080
but that doesn't really make sense right

5239
04:28:18,080 --> 04:28:20,080
because well i mean with the intended

5240
04:28:20,080 --> 04:28:21,279
solution that doesn't mean they're not

5241
04:28:21,279 --> 04:28:23,680
going to do oh no yeah and there also is

5242
04:28:23,680 --> 04:28:25,120
the

5243
04:28:25,120 --> 04:28:26,560
so i'm trying to remember how the wind

5244
04:28:26,560 --> 04:28:27,680
function

5245
04:28:27,680 --> 04:28:29,359
runs it may just show it may be from the

5246
04:28:29,359 --> 04:28:30,640
wind function

5247
04:28:30,640 --> 04:28:32,080
on the stack as well too i don't

5248
04:28:32,080 --> 04:28:33,279
remember but no they shouldn't be

5249
04:28:33,279 --> 04:28:34,880
getting to that

5250
04:28:34,880 --> 04:28:37,840
yes let's see i don't see the

5251
04:28:37,840 --> 04:28:39,520
in in the meantime i wanted to take like

5252
04:28:39,520 --> 04:28:40,239
the

5253
04:28:40,239 --> 04:28:43,199
like just ask people who are uh watching

5254
04:28:43,199 --> 04:28:45,600
whether you are like uh and is it anyone

5255
04:28:45,600 --> 04:28:47,040
here in uh

5256
04:28:47,040 --> 04:28:49,279
in vegas attending devcon or are you

5257
04:28:49,279 --> 04:28:50,880
watching from uh

5258
04:28:50,880 --> 04:28:52,640
all over the world like

5259
04:28:52,640 --> 04:28:54,399
who do we have here we saw someone from

5260
04:28:54,399 --> 04:28:56,560
kenya even uh chimed in earlier oh wow

5261
04:28:56,560 --> 04:28:58,239
they were watching so we know we do have

5262
04:28:58,239 --> 04:28:59,760
yeah uh some world wide webs it's

5263
04:28:59,760 --> 04:29:01,439
interesting to go and see those like

5264
04:29:01,439 --> 04:29:03,120
analytics afterwards see uh who's

5265
04:29:03,120 --> 04:29:04,960
watching um

5266
04:29:04,960 --> 04:29:06,960
but yeah it's uh do we have any people

5267
04:29:06,960 --> 04:29:10,399
so and by the way like if you are um

5268
04:29:10,399 --> 04:29:12,720
if you are here at defcon uh you know

5269
04:29:12,720 --> 04:29:15,760
feel free to come by in the the ctf

5270
04:29:15,760 --> 04:29:16,880
area

5271
04:29:16,880 --> 04:29:19,040
uh we probably won't be able to talk a

5272
04:29:19,040 --> 04:29:20,880
ton but uh hopefully yeah like if you

5273
04:29:20,880 --> 04:29:22,319
come if you come during matches you can

5274
04:29:22,319 --> 04:29:23,600
watch the matches if you come between

5275
04:29:23,600 --> 04:29:25,520
matches uh you can uh you know have a

5276
04:29:25,520 --> 04:29:27,680
chat with us hopefully if we're not

5277
04:29:27,680 --> 04:29:28,960
panicking

5278
04:29:28,960 --> 04:29:31,439
uh yeah someone's watching from the ctf

5279
04:29:31,439 --> 04:29:34,399
floor okay nice and also from europe in

5280
04:29:34,399 --> 04:29:36,239
the hotel room giving your feet a break

5281
04:29:36,239 --> 04:29:38,800
yeah that's a wise decision i think i'm

5282
04:29:38,800 --> 04:29:42,080
ready for my my feet my throat like

5283
04:29:42,080 --> 04:29:43,600
several parts of me to break oh yeah

5284
04:29:43,600 --> 04:29:45,359
yeah i mean we've been talking here for

5285
04:29:45,359 --> 04:29:47,040
like okay so there's this is interesting

5286
04:29:47,040 --> 04:29:48,880
these these uh those ascii values are

5287
04:29:48,880 --> 04:29:51,279
being converted to integers on

5288
04:29:51,279 --> 04:29:52,640
on this so we we're looking at a

5289
04:29:52,640 --> 04:29:54,880
debugger dump of the game stage right so

5290
04:29:54,880 --> 04:29:56,000
we can see

5291
04:29:56,000 --> 04:29:58,000
we do see the the game state the zero

5292
04:29:58,000 --> 04:29:59,279
you know it's really obvious to see

5293
04:29:59,279 --> 04:30:00,880
those those numbers

5294
04:30:00,880 --> 04:30:03,680
cool um

5295
04:30:03,680 --> 04:30:05,760
yeah and you can see

5296
04:30:05,760 --> 04:30:08,159
look at that bass uh thing there you

5297
04:30:08,159 --> 04:30:09,920
have like generating a list of integers

5298
04:30:09,920 --> 04:30:12,560
from 0 to 96 which is

5299
04:30:12,560 --> 04:30:14,560
interesting is that

5300
04:30:14,560 --> 04:30:15,680
um

5301
04:30:15,680 --> 04:30:16,479
yeah

5302
04:30:16,479 --> 04:30:18,880
we have watchers from estonia and brazil

5303
04:30:18,880 --> 04:30:20,239
people who are saying they they want to

5304
04:30:20,239 --> 04:30:22,479
go visit defcon in the future yeah i

5305
04:30:22,479 --> 04:30:24,080
think uh defcon is like it's a cool

5306
04:30:24,080 --> 04:30:26,479
event to to visit it's uh i think

5307
04:30:26,479 --> 04:30:27,840
they're trying to increase them on a

5308
04:30:27,840 --> 04:30:29,279
streaming and online presence as well

5309
04:30:29,279 --> 04:30:30,800
too so you probably will be able to find

5310
04:30:30,800 --> 04:30:31,840
other

5311
04:30:31,840 --> 04:30:33,600
streams i think there's even some webcam

5312
04:30:33,600 --> 04:30:35,359
like 360 degree webcam virtual cameras

5313
04:30:35,359 --> 04:30:36,399
they're putting up in a couple of rooms

5314
04:30:36,399 --> 04:30:38,479
where you can watch what's going on so

5315
04:30:38,479 --> 04:30:40,560
trying to improve like the accessibility

5316
04:30:40,560 --> 04:30:42,560
i mean i'm certainly with with kovid

5317
04:30:42,560 --> 04:30:44,560
in general most conferences have tried

5318
04:30:44,560 --> 04:30:46,560
to adapt better for okay we have

5319
04:30:46,560 --> 04:30:47,600
somebody

5320
04:30:47,600 --> 04:30:49,279
watching right next to our camera let's

5321
04:30:49,279 --> 04:30:52,720
hope they don't bump it um

5322
04:30:53,520 --> 04:30:56,800
but anyway again checking the code here

5323
04:30:56,800 --> 04:30:59,520
they're writing um i'm trying to get a

5324
04:30:59,520 --> 04:31:02,080
better feel for what they're doing like

5325
04:31:02,080 --> 04:31:04,080
again they're generating like a list of

5326
04:31:04,080 --> 04:31:07,439
numbers uh okay oh so they need to find

5327
04:31:07,439 --> 04:31:10,399
like the right uh offset overflow this

5328
04:31:10,399 --> 04:31:12,000
actually looks really good yes this

5329
04:31:12,000 --> 04:31:13,359
actually does look really good because

5330
04:31:13,359 --> 04:31:15,520
like once they finish this yeah yeah if

5331
04:31:15,520 --> 04:31:17,040
they get the right offset let me go look

5332
04:31:17,040 --> 04:31:18,479
at the other one we might be closing in

5333
04:31:18,479 --> 04:31:20,720
yes

5334
04:31:22,880 --> 04:31:24,560
so that's that's really cool like we can

5335
04:31:24,560 --> 04:31:26,000
like it once they get that thing it's

5336
04:31:26,000 --> 04:31:27,760
going to be real quick like we are

5337
04:31:27,760 --> 04:31:29,520
probably going to miss

5338
04:31:29,520 --> 04:31:30,800
there's a big risk we're going to miss

5339
04:31:30,800 --> 04:31:33,600
like the moment but so basically if i'm

5340
04:31:33,600 --> 04:31:34,960
reading this correctly what i'm trying

5341
04:31:34,960 --> 04:31:37,199
to do is like find the offset in memory

5342
04:31:37,199 --> 04:31:39,680
like they're overflowing something and

5343
04:31:39,680 --> 04:31:42,560
then like how far into this do they want

5344
04:31:42,560 --> 04:31:44,720
to put uh whatever they are placing

5345
04:31:44,720 --> 04:31:46,560
there which should be the the solved or

5346
04:31:46,560 --> 04:31:47,680
solvable

5347
04:31:47,680 --> 04:31:49,920
uh state

5348
04:31:49,920 --> 04:31:51,680
um so

5349
04:31:51,680 --> 04:31:53,600
yeah they they might definitely be on to

5350
04:31:53,600 --> 04:31:55,359
something they're switching the numbers

5351
04:31:55,359 --> 04:31:57,920
around a little bit maybe it's that they

5352
04:31:57,920 --> 04:32:00,640
so they switched the zeros to a one

5353
04:32:00,640 --> 04:32:01,520
uh

5354
04:32:01,520 --> 04:32:04,560
which seemed to have crashed the program

5355
04:32:04,560 --> 04:32:06,720
and then

5356
04:32:06,720 --> 04:32:08,640
checking why this is happening

5357
04:32:08,640 --> 04:32:10,880
um yeah we have someone from morocco as

5358
04:32:10,880 --> 04:32:12,720
well cool

5359
04:32:12,720 --> 04:32:15,120
uh that's uh it's cool to see we have

5360
04:32:15,120 --> 04:32:16,399
people all over

5361
04:32:16,399 --> 04:32:17,439
uh

5362
04:32:17,439 --> 04:32:21,040
i guess the i'm trying to like

5363
04:32:21,040 --> 04:32:22,800
work out like what what time it is

5364
04:32:22,800 --> 04:32:25,520
across the world at the moment uh

5365
04:32:25,520 --> 04:32:28,159
but uh wait what's the people watching

5366
04:32:28,159 --> 04:32:29,840
from europe it's like in the middle of

5367
04:32:29,840 --> 04:32:33,439
the night there uh so let's uh

5368
04:32:33,439 --> 04:32:35,439
dedication

5369
04:32:35,439 --> 04:32:37,760
uh i hope you're enjoying it

5370
04:32:37,760 --> 04:32:39,520
uh trying to see here that they're just

5371
04:32:39,520 --> 04:32:42,159
quickly looking at the disassembly again

5372
04:32:42,159 --> 04:32:43,600
uh

5373
04:32:43,600 --> 04:32:46,000
trying to

5374
04:32:46,000 --> 04:32:48,080
maybe looking for some specific offsets

5375
04:32:48,080 --> 04:32:49,040
or so

5376
04:32:49,040 --> 04:32:51,359
um

5377
04:32:51,760 --> 04:32:54,159
yes they did get some specific effect

5378
04:32:54,159 --> 04:32:57,279
offset to to put a breakpoint uh

5379
04:32:57,279 --> 04:32:58,720
there right and then they're also

5380
04:32:58,720 --> 04:33:01,760
looking at the base

5381
04:33:01,760 --> 04:33:02,960
oh yeah to make the breakpoint in the

5382
04:33:02,960 --> 04:33:05,599
car or maybe not the breakpoint or the

5383
04:33:05,599 --> 04:33:06,561
um

5384
04:33:06,561 --> 04:33:07,599
the the

5385
04:33:07,599 --> 04:33:11,118
offset where to inspect the memory

5386
04:33:11,359 --> 04:33:12,958
oh yeah

5387
04:33:12,958 --> 04:33:14,320
oh yeah people saying they're watching

5388
04:33:14,320 --> 04:33:15,599
from like yeah definitely middle of the

5389
04:33:15,599 --> 04:33:17,199
night um

5390
04:33:17,199 --> 04:33:18,270
you know

5391
04:33:18,270 --> 04:33:21,349
[Music]

5392
04:33:22,561 --> 04:33:25,039
awesome netherlands represented as well

5393
04:33:25,039 --> 04:33:25,759
so

5394
04:33:25,759 --> 04:33:27,359
i i'm seeing some interesting stuff

5395
04:33:27,359 --> 04:33:28,719
there but uh

5396
04:33:28,719 --> 04:33:31,278
what did you see uh

5397
04:33:31,278 --> 04:33:32,400
from your adventures and from the

5398
04:33:32,400 --> 04:33:34,719
organizers yeah so the i

5399
04:33:34,719 --> 04:33:35,520
i mean

5400
04:33:35,520 --> 04:33:37,438
i hate to take bets yeah because i've

5401
04:33:37,438 --> 04:33:40,240
lost a lot of money at this table so far

5402
04:33:40,240 --> 04:33:43,278
if uh if uh if this was a gambling

5403
04:33:43,278 --> 04:33:44,719
arrangement i would i would not be doing

5404
04:33:44,719 --> 04:33:45,680
so well

5405
04:33:45,680 --> 04:33:46,719
but

5406
04:33:46,719 --> 04:33:48,719
i will i also feel like i tend to favor

5407
04:33:48,719 --> 04:33:50,160
my side of the table yeah and then we've

5408
04:33:50,160 --> 04:33:51,520
had all these surprise victories from

5409
04:33:51,520 --> 04:33:53,520
the other ones yeah pop up several times

5410
04:33:53,520 --> 04:33:54,719
but

5411
04:33:54,719 --> 04:33:58,320
all that said i do think team taiwan has

5412
04:33:58,320 --> 04:33:59,599
a little bit of a leap so looking at the

5413
04:33:59,599 --> 04:34:00,958
new organizers

5414
04:34:00,958 --> 04:34:03,520
we've got a script uh it has a bunch of

5415
04:34:03,520 --> 04:34:05,599
it's some a mixture of gdb some phone

5416
04:34:05,599 --> 04:34:06,719
tools and then as well as you know

5417
04:34:06,719 --> 04:34:09,199
sending inputs and kind of breaking in

5418
04:34:09,199 --> 04:34:11,118
i didn't get the sense that they they

5419
04:34:11,118 --> 04:34:15,039
had an overall plan for what to do

5420
04:34:15,039 --> 04:34:17,039
right but again i

5421
04:34:17,039 --> 04:34:18,080
definitely the one thing i've learned is

5422
04:34:18,080 --> 04:34:20,000
that i don't know what i'm doing anyways

5423
04:34:20,000 --> 04:34:21,438
like it's it is really hard to

5424
04:34:21,438 --> 04:34:22,719
understand exactly what's going on their

5425
04:34:22,719 --> 04:34:25,840
head and so you're not always right

5426
04:34:25,840 --> 04:34:28,799
whereas i will say

5427
04:34:31,039 --> 04:34:32,719
it certainly looks like with that offset

5428
04:34:32,719 --> 04:34:34,958
right with it we were seeing a a valid

5429
04:34:34,958 --> 04:34:36,561
solved sudoku

5430
04:34:36,561 --> 04:34:38,000
trying to find the right offset to line

5431
04:34:38,000 --> 04:34:39,118
it up which

5432
04:34:39,118 --> 04:34:41,118
sounds like from what i understand of it

5433
04:34:41,118 --> 04:34:43,118
is is the intended solution

5434
04:34:43,118 --> 04:34:44,240
um

5435
04:34:44,240 --> 04:34:45,759
so

5436
04:34:45,759 --> 04:34:48,239
we'll see

5437
04:34:48,320 --> 04:34:50,639
yep

5438
04:34:52,400 --> 04:34:54,879
can we can we get some some confirmation

5439
04:34:54,879 --> 04:34:56,879
is the the solution if is it just

5440
04:34:56,879 --> 04:34:58,320
misaligning the correct board the

5441
04:34:58,320 --> 04:34:59,359
certain number of bytes will that

5442
04:34:59,359 --> 04:35:02,480
trigger it essentially

5443
04:35:02,480 --> 04:35:04,240
any credit board at the right offset so

5444
04:35:04,240 --> 04:35:05,199
just put the right amount of padding

5445
04:35:05,199 --> 04:35:06,561
bytes in and then it will override it

5446
04:35:06,561 --> 04:35:09,719
the right

5447
04:35:16,080 --> 04:35:19,080
sagan

5448
04:35:23,680 --> 04:35:24,799
yep

5449
04:35:24,799 --> 04:35:26,879
uh

5450
04:35:26,879 --> 04:35:31,000
then you mark it as salt yeah

5451
04:35:36,160 --> 04:35:37,680
oh just send anything and it will just

5452
04:35:37,680 --> 04:35:39,118
mark it us up

5453
04:35:39,118 --> 04:35:40,719
right

5454
04:35:40,719 --> 04:35:43,759
okay so what uh our producer there said

5455
04:35:43,759 --> 04:35:45,359
was that um

5456
04:35:45,359 --> 04:35:47,118
you first you send

5457
04:35:47,118 --> 04:35:51,278
a solvable state you overwrite the uh

5458
04:35:51,278 --> 04:35:52,799
the thing the states with the solvable

5459
04:35:52,799 --> 04:35:54,400
one and then you just send something to

5460
04:35:54,400 --> 04:35:56,719
like trigger to recheck and like have it

5461
04:35:56,719 --> 04:35:59,359
be uh solved and you get the win uh

5462
04:35:59,359 --> 04:36:01,600
there

5463
04:36:02,719 --> 04:36:04,480
we can see here

5464
04:36:04,480 --> 04:36:06,320
they are like working out in a text

5465
04:36:06,320 --> 04:36:07,840
editor i think yeah it still looks like

5466
04:36:07,840 --> 04:36:09,520
they're trying to solve the state as it

5467
04:36:09,520 --> 04:36:12,879
exists not overwrite

5468
04:36:12,879 --> 04:36:15,359
the the state with their solve like so

5469
04:36:15,359 --> 04:36:18,799
what i saw i wonder i'm a little afraid

5470
04:36:18,799 --> 04:36:20,160
they got the overwrite but if their

5471
04:36:20,160 --> 04:36:22,160
exploit didn't try to like send another

5472
04:36:22,160 --> 04:36:24,080
round for validation

5473
04:36:24,080 --> 04:36:25,840
it like overwrote it

5474
04:36:25,840 --> 04:36:28,799
but then never oh oh wow that would be

5475
04:36:28,799 --> 04:36:31,278
uh that wasn't terrible um so it is

5476
04:36:31,278 --> 04:36:32,799
possible that they've essentially had

5477
04:36:32,799 --> 04:36:35,278
the right solution no that's just didn't

5478
04:36:35,278 --> 04:36:37,438
re-trigger it to be able to actually get

5479
04:36:37,438 --> 04:36:39,840
to the win function um

5480
04:36:39,840 --> 04:36:41,919
so

5481
04:36:41,919 --> 04:36:44,240
we will we will see

5482
04:36:44,240 --> 04:36:45,438
uh we're only a little bit late

5483
04:36:45,438 --> 04:36:46,958
especially actually we technically we

5484
04:36:46,958 --> 04:36:47,919
have two more minutes before the

5485
04:36:47,919 --> 04:36:49,599
original length of this uh and we're

5486
04:36:49,599 --> 04:36:51,278
letting it run long just because of the

5487
04:36:51,278 --> 04:36:52,879
the last one of the day

5488
04:36:52,879 --> 04:36:54,000
um

5489
04:36:54,000 --> 04:36:55,438
and we prefer they have a chance to if

5490
04:36:55,438 --> 04:36:58,080
they can but there will our voices will

5491
04:36:58,080 --> 04:36:59,919
give out it will be some point which we

5492
04:36:59,919 --> 04:37:00,879
say

5493
04:37:00,879 --> 04:37:02,879
sorry we're cutting you off uh but none

5494
04:37:02,879 --> 04:37:05,039
of us want that to happen so

5495
04:37:05,039 --> 04:37:06,879
so we'll see yeah we're checking uh

5496
04:37:06,879 --> 04:37:09,278
we're taking a bet here and uh

5497
04:37:09,278 --> 04:37:12,160
hoping this will work

5498
04:37:12,240 --> 04:37:13,919
we're also about to lose power on our

5499
04:37:13,919 --> 04:37:16,958
our chats yes tunisia excellent welcome

5500
04:37:16,958 --> 04:37:19,278
yeah i've been to tunisia for a ctf

5501
04:37:19,278 --> 04:37:21,278
competition have you really i actually i

5502
04:37:21,278 --> 04:37:22,561
think i got invited to speak there one

5503
04:37:22,561 --> 04:37:24,240
time at a conference then yeah there we

5504
04:37:24,240 --> 04:37:25,680
go um so

5505
04:37:25,680 --> 04:37:27,199
let's see if that actually powers it i

5506
04:37:27,199 --> 04:37:28,240
don't know what this is played into at

5507
04:37:28,240 --> 04:37:29,438
this point

5508
04:37:29,438 --> 04:37:31,359
yeah power on our one of our screen

5509
04:37:31,359 --> 04:37:33,039
servers all right good and that one we

5510
04:37:33,039 --> 04:37:35,919
also have like a graphical glitch on the

5511
04:37:35,919 --> 04:37:37,520
about some screen but it's just it's

5512
04:37:37,520 --> 04:37:38,958
just blocking the ads so i'm okay with

5513
04:37:38,958 --> 04:37:40,400
it that sounds great that's okay i wish

5514
04:37:40,400 --> 04:37:42,160
i wish all of my graphics glitches just

5515
04:37:42,160 --> 04:37:44,958
blocked out ads as i surfed oh yeah webb

5516
04:37:44,958 --> 04:37:47,840
so uh as an employee of a big ad tech

5517
04:37:47,840 --> 04:37:50,719
company i will have to uh a large tech

5518
04:37:50,719 --> 04:37:52,561
company whose revenue might depend

5519
04:37:52,561 --> 04:37:54,240
heavily on ad yeah

5520
04:37:54,240 --> 04:37:57,039
uh you know

5521
04:37:57,039 --> 04:37:58,879
yeah are you allowed to ruin adblockers

5522
04:37:58,879 --> 04:38:00,240
no i'm not giving a taco work i'm not

5523
04:38:00,240 --> 04:38:01,599
going to take it work all right all

5524
04:38:01,599 --> 04:38:03,359
right i'm not going to do that

5525
04:38:03,359 --> 04:38:06,799
all right so here we go

5526
04:38:08,719 --> 04:38:11,039
so i s this

5527
04:38:11,039 --> 04:38:12,480
still feels like we're trying to solve

5528
04:38:12,480 --> 04:38:13,599
it

5529
04:38:13,599 --> 04:38:16,160
i don't i don't see

5530
04:38:16,160 --> 04:38:20,160
i don't see the the uh

5531
04:38:20,799 --> 04:38:22,320
the exploit like i don't see them

5532
04:38:22,320 --> 04:38:23,840
actually like

5533
04:38:23,840 --> 04:38:25,840
exploiting that well i mean

5534
04:38:25,840 --> 04:38:26,958
this

5535
04:38:26,958 --> 04:38:29,039
might still work like if their idea is

5536
04:38:29,039 --> 04:38:31,680
to just like overwrite a couple of

5537
04:38:31,680 --> 04:38:33,438
values and make it solvable and then put

5538
04:38:33,438 --> 04:38:34,799
it into solution like but they're gonna

5539
04:38:34,799 --> 04:38:35,840
be a fast solution they're gonna

5540
04:38:35,840 --> 04:38:36,958
inherently have to overwrite the whole

5541
04:38:36,958 --> 04:38:38,240
thing though right because they're just

5542
04:38:38,240 --> 04:38:40,480
linearly well i mean it might be that

5543
04:38:40,480 --> 04:38:42,080
they think that they can only overwrite

5544
04:38:42,080 --> 04:38:43,599
like the beginning of it or something

5545
04:38:43,599 --> 04:38:45,118
like this you're still gonna have a null

5546
04:38:45,118 --> 04:38:47,199
at the end so no no no necessarily

5547
04:38:47,199 --> 04:38:48,320
because it's gonna convert in written

5548
04:38:48,320 --> 04:38:50,080
yeah no that's okay that's fair i mean

5549
04:38:50,080 --> 04:38:51,840
it could it could work like it's not the

5550
04:38:51,840 --> 04:38:54,400
not not the intended play but uh it

5551
04:38:54,400 --> 04:38:56,400
could probably work

5552
04:38:56,400 --> 04:38:58,240
so yeah

5553
04:38:58,240 --> 04:38:59,520
unless there's a question mark at the

5554
04:38:59,520 --> 04:39:00,799
very end of the puzzle if there's an

5555
04:39:00,799 --> 04:39:03,840
unallocated one at the very end that

5556
04:39:03,840 --> 04:39:06,160
would have to be

5557
04:39:06,160 --> 04:39:07,520
well we'll see

5558
04:39:07,520 --> 04:39:10,400
yeah we'll see all right

5559
04:39:10,400 --> 04:39:13,199
a few more few few more bits

5560
04:39:13,199 --> 04:39:14,400
thanks everybody for hanging with us

5561
04:39:14,400 --> 04:39:15,520
this has been

5562
04:39:15,520 --> 04:39:17,759
like just utterly exhausting and super

5563
04:39:17,759 --> 04:39:18,879
exciting

5564
04:39:18,879 --> 04:39:20,958
um just as a quick recap you know from

5565
04:39:20,958 --> 04:39:24,080
our from our earlier games we had uh a

5566
04:39:24,080 --> 04:39:25,840
nail biter of a finish at the very

5567
04:39:25,840 --> 04:39:28,240
beginning from uh shellfish versus ptb

5568
04:39:28,240 --> 04:39:30,639
wtl oh yeah like they were

5569
04:39:30,639 --> 04:39:32,799
i think within a few key strokes of each

5570
04:39:32,799 --> 04:39:34,639
other like you can't get a tighter match

5571
04:39:34,639 --> 04:39:36,400
like i know we were looking at one

5572
04:39:36,400 --> 04:39:37,760
screen

5573
04:39:37,760 --> 04:39:39,280
to declare a winner yeah and then the

5574
04:39:39,280 --> 04:39:41,440
other one popped it just was so quick

5575
04:39:41,440 --> 04:39:43,280
yeah so that was fantastic make sure you

5576
04:39:43,280 --> 04:39:45,200
go back and check the uh the replay on

5577
04:39:45,200 --> 04:39:46,160
that one

5578
04:39:46,160 --> 04:39:48,400
uh we're gonna end the stream today when

5579
04:39:48,400 --> 04:39:49,760
we're done with this particular

5580
04:39:49,760 --> 04:39:50,718
challenge

5581
04:39:50,718 --> 04:39:52,400
um oops sorry about that i hit the

5582
04:39:52,400 --> 04:39:54,160
microphone uh we're gonna end the stream

5583
04:39:54,160 --> 04:39:56,638
today uh once we're we're done with this

5584
04:39:56,638 --> 04:39:57,600
challenge

5585
04:39:57,600 --> 04:39:59,440
and we wrap it up

5586
04:39:59,440 --> 04:40:02,000
but uh we will be back tomorrow a long

5587
04:40:02,000 --> 04:40:03,280
day tomorrow so the stream is going to

5588
04:40:03,280 --> 04:40:05,360
run for eight hours straight uh actually

5589
04:40:05,360 --> 04:40:07,680
i guess nine at least because we've got

5590
04:40:07,680 --> 04:40:09,360
eight challenges no no that's right

5591
04:40:09,360 --> 04:40:10,958
eight total hours this one's a one-hour

5592
04:40:10,958 --> 04:40:12,240
thing

5593
04:40:12,240 --> 04:40:13,920
we'll see we may end up needing a break

5594
04:40:13,920 --> 04:40:15,120
well we're gonna try to get breaks by

5595
04:40:15,120 --> 04:40:16,798
taking trading off you're gonna see some

5596
04:40:16,798 --> 04:40:18,240
guest uh commentators we're gonna have

5597
04:40:18,240 --> 04:40:19,760
some other people come in and fill out

5598
04:40:19,760 --> 04:40:21,760
different roles should we uh i think it

5599
04:40:21,760 --> 04:40:23,600
was already written on twitter but uh

5600
04:40:23,600 --> 04:40:26,798
the idea is to have uh we have a a live

5601
04:40:26,798 --> 04:40:30,718
overflow uh hopefully joining in and uh

5602
04:40:30,718 --> 04:40:33,680
kim also yeah brandon falck

5603
04:40:33,680 --> 04:40:35,280
so two uh

5604
04:40:35,280 --> 04:40:38,320
popular uh people in like the uh

5605
04:40:38,320 --> 04:40:41,360
security uh like content creation the

5606
04:40:41,360 --> 04:40:44,718
space yeah yeah i'm i'm excited uh

5607
04:40:44,718 --> 04:40:46,638
looking forward to chatting with both of

5608
04:40:46,638 --> 04:40:47,440
them

5609
04:40:47,440 --> 04:40:48,718
uh and i'm also looking forward to have

5610
04:40:48,718 --> 04:40:51,200
a break and as we each get to

5611
04:40:51,200 --> 04:40:53,120
maybe maybe alternate uh every other

5612
04:40:53,120 --> 04:40:55,040
round so one of us will we'll take a

5613
04:40:55,040 --> 04:40:56,320
rest and also

5614
04:40:56,320 --> 04:40:58,560
make sure we give our producer glenn a

5615
04:40:58,560 --> 04:41:00,878
break as well so yeah we'll be cycling

5616
04:41:00,878 --> 04:41:01,920
through that

5617
04:41:01,920 --> 04:41:03,120
um

5618
04:41:03,120 --> 04:41:04,878
we've got a variety of different

5619
04:41:04,878 --> 04:41:07,360
challenges um maybe for any of the teams

5620
04:41:07,360 --> 04:41:08,878
that happen to be listening

5621
04:41:08,878 --> 04:41:11,120
we want to talk about like the overall

5622
04:41:11,120 --> 04:41:13,040
types of challenges that we have no no

5623
04:41:13,040 --> 04:41:15,280
no super spoilers but like i will say i

5624
04:41:15,280 --> 04:41:17,040
think we're pretty representative right

5625
04:41:17,040 --> 04:41:18,718
right there's a

5626
04:41:18,718 --> 04:41:21,440
heavy focus a little bit of re yes

5627
04:41:21,440 --> 04:41:23,760
there's um

5628
04:41:23,760 --> 04:41:25,360
certainly a little bit like shell coding

5629
04:41:25,360 --> 04:41:27,520
or constrained exploitation

5630
04:41:27,520 --> 04:41:29,920
um

5631
04:41:30,878 --> 04:41:33,040
solution quick look here again yeah

5632
04:41:33,040 --> 04:41:35,760
trying to get caught back up

5633
04:41:35,760 --> 04:41:37,440
oh man so they have a solution there

5634
04:41:37,440 --> 04:41:39,040
right so their soul screen this is i

5635
04:41:39,040 --> 04:41:41,120
mean it's they haven't solved solution

5636
04:41:41,120 --> 04:41:42,480
but

5637
04:41:42,480 --> 04:41:45,440
yeah there's a hashtag free jordan glenn

5638
04:41:45,440 --> 04:41:47,360
and cala uh yes

5639
04:41:47,360 --> 04:41:49,600
uh so yeah just to clarify that's my uh

5640
04:41:49,600 --> 04:41:53,280
nickname or like uh and then so yeah

5641
04:41:53,280 --> 04:41:55,280
and and and and that jack harder thank

5642
04:41:55,280 --> 04:41:58,878
you yes i mean if thank you uh nega soro

5643
04:41:58,878 --> 04:42:00,240
this random person who showed up in our

5644
04:42:00,240 --> 04:42:02,240
chat certainly not the author of this

5645
04:42:02,240 --> 04:42:04,718
particular challenge that has uh

5646
04:42:04,718 --> 04:42:07,360
stymied our opponents for so long so

5647
04:42:07,360 --> 04:42:09,920
right yeah but but uh you're not wrong

5648
04:42:09,920 --> 04:42:11,760
it's if they just would hack harder we

5649
04:42:11,760 --> 04:42:14,000
could we could take a break and we could

5650
04:42:14,000 --> 04:42:16,240
yeah we could get some dinner so

5651
04:42:16,240 --> 04:42:18,480
let's let us consider it is i would say

5652
04:42:18,480 --> 04:42:19,760
we are going to have to hit sudden death

5653
04:42:19,760 --> 04:42:20,798
pretty soon because we're looking

5654
04:42:20,798 --> 04:42:22,560
another several minutes of sudden death

5655
04:42:22,560 --> 04:42:24,240
as well so

5656
04:42:24,240 --> 04:42:26,480
um

5657
04:42:26,480 --> 04:42:28,240
we'll uh we'll we'll take a look maybe

5658
04:42:28,240 --> 04:42:29,360
i'll take one more pass at new

5659
04:42:29,360 --> 04:42:33,120
organizers we'll talk about having a uh

5660
04:42:33,120 --> 04:42:34,718
you know queuing up a sudden death what

5661
04:42:34,718 --> 04:42:36,798
kind of consider what we want to go

5662
04:42:36,798 --> 04:42:38,560
um yeah

5663
04:42:38,560 --> 04:42:40,240
i'll uh i'll go ahead and give a bit of

5664
04:42:40,240 --> 04:42:42,958
a oh just use a data glove that's a what

5665
04:42:42,958 --> 04:42:44,320
is the data glove that's a reference i

5666
04:42:44,320 --> 04:42:46,798
don't get uh isn't that the uh

5667
04:42:46,798 --> 04:42:47,680
the

5668
04:42:47,680 --> 04:42:49,520
the game controller thing the no that's

5669
04:42:49,520 --> 04:42:50,958
the power that's a powerful paragraph

5670
04:42:50,958 --> 04:42:52,400
yeah yeah oh the child of the 80s of

5671
04:42:52,400 --> 04:42:54,080
course like yeah yeah yeah no no i mean

5672
04:42:54,080 --> 04:42:55,600
yes that's the thing from before i was

5673
04:42:55,600 --> 04:42:57,680
born sam no trolling no trouble please

5674

5676
04:43:02,080 --> 04:43:04,000
remember this no we don't we don't talk

5677
04:43:04,000 --> 04:43:05,840
like that that's uh yeah yeah don't use

5678
04:43:05,840 --> 04:43:06,958
it yeah it's actually going to be asking

5679
04:43:06,958 --> 04:43:08,878
for for network forensics or something

5680
04:43:08,878 --> 04:43:10,718
something crazy yeah we might call the

5681
04:43:10,718 --> 04:43:12,400
goons yeah have them take you out of the

5682
04:43:12,400 --> 04:43:13,520
room yeah all right i'll go check out

5683
04:43:13,520 --> 04:43:15,200
new organizers and we'll be back i'll

5684
04:43:15,200 --> 04:43:17,120
give an update on the

5685
04:43:17,120 --> 04:43:20,000
defcon ctf scoreboard uh in the meantime

5686
04:43:20,000 --> 04:43:22,160
um so

5687
04:43:22,160 --> 04:43:22,958
we

5688
04:43:22,958 --> 04:43:25,840
have like a slightly larger spread now

5689
04:43:25,840 --> 04:43:29,280
uh with uh like spanning from just below

5690
04:43:29,280 --> 04:43:31,680
14 000 up to uh

5691
04:43:31,680 --> 04:43:34,240
just above 18 000 points

5692
04:43:34,240 --> 04:43:36,400
between the 16th and the first place

5693
04:43:36,400 --> 04:43:39,840
with uh katsubin in first place mmm in

5694
04:43:39,840 --> 04:43:41,600
second place and perfect root in third

5695
04:43:41,600 --> 04:43:45,040
place and if i'm not misremembering i

5696
04:43:45,040 --> 04:43:47,440
think uh last year we did have like a

5697
04:43:47,440 --> 04:43:51,440
top fight between katzebin and uh ppp

5698
04:43:51,440 --> 04:43:53,680
as well they have kind of

5699
04:43:53,680 --> 04:43:55,520
pulled ahead those two teams and created

5700
04:43:55,520 --> 04:43:58,560
like a slight gap down to third place so

5701
04:43:58,560 --> 04:44:02,480
i do think this uh like mirrors uh some

5702
04:44:02,480 --> 04:44:04,878
of what we saw last year uh when with uh

5703
04:44:04,878 --> 04:44:07,520
regards to like the standings but

5704
04:44:07,520 --> 04:44:09,200
this is only the first day of the defcon

5705
04:44:09,200 --> 04:44:11,840
ctf a lot of stuff can happen

5706
04:44:11,840 --> 04:44:14,560
uh this is like far from over uh so

5707
04:44:14,560 --> 04:44:16,160
we're gonna be

5708
04:44:16,160 --> 04:44:18,160
keeping uh

5709
04:44:18,160 --> 04:44:20,400
an eye on that um

5710
04:44:20,400 --> 04:44:21,840
throughout the weekend and give you

5711
04:44:21,840 --> 04:44:23,920
updates

5712
04:44:23,920 --> 04:44:26,000
it's uh yeah i mean if you're here in

5713
04:44:26,000 --> 04:44:28,638
the the ctf room you can see this really

5714
04:44:28,638 --> 04:44:31,280
uh funny uh visualization that the

5715
04:44:31,280 --> 04:44:33,440
nautilus institute have put up it's like

5716
04:44:33,440 --> 04:44:35,760
some 3d animation of like a bunch of

5717
04:44:35,760 --> 04:44:37,760
weird uh

5718
04:44:37,760 --> 04:44:38,798
machines

5719
04:44:38,798 --> 04:44:41,040
one for each team like spitting random

5720
04:44:41,040 --> 04:44:43,440
objects at the other teams like showing

5721
04:44:43,440 --> 04:44:44,638
i guess it's showing like who is

5722
04:44:44,638 --> 04:44:47,520
attacking whom uh possibly there's like

5723
04:44:47,520 --> 04:44:50,000
seashells and stuff uh flying around

5724
04:44:50,000 --> 04:44:51,840
uh you know i guess there's some joke

5725
04:44:51,840 --> 04:44:53,280
about there about like shells and

5726
04:44:53,280 --> 04:44:56,798
seashells and you know that um but again

5727
04:44:56,798 --> 04:44:58,798
taking a look at

5728
04:44:58,798 --> 04:45:00,000
the

5729
04:45:00,000 --> 04:45:02,560
screen of balsam here

5730
04:45:02,560 --> 04:45:04,798
i'm i'm still not entirely sure they

5731
04:45:04,798 --> 04:45:06,000
have this like

5732
04:45:06,000 --> 04:45:07,680
partial solution or like a solution

5733
04:45:07,680 --> 04:45:09,440
they've split up the solution into two

5734
04:45:09,440 --> 04:45:12,399
parts and then

5735
04:45:12,480 --> 04:45:15,600
trying to send some like they're sending

5736
04:45:15,600 --> 04:45:17,360
some data and then they're sending the

5737
04:45:17,360 --> 04:45:19,200
other solution still not exactly sure

5738
04:45:19,200 --> 04:45:21,280
what's going on

5739
04:45:21,280 --> 04:45:23,200
uh

5740
04:45:23,200 --> 04:45:25,440
so we have explanation data handler

5741
04:45:25,440 --> 04:45:27,360
crazy keyboards yeah i will have to look

5742
04:45:27,360 --> 04:45:29,040
that up uh

5743
04:45:29,040 --> 04:45:32,240
afterwards uh but uh yeah i still think

5744
04:45:32,240 --> 04:45:34,320
uh i'm still thinking power gloves would

5745
04:45:34,320 --> 04:45:35,440
uh you know

5746
04:45:35,440 --> 04:45:37,840
really help out in this situation uh

5747
04:45:37,840 --> 04:45:39,200
maybe you could have them like you know

5748
04:45:39,200 --> 04:45:40,798
different like rob gadgets and stuff

5749
04:45:40,798 --> 04:45:42,080
mapped to the

5750
04:45:42,080 --> 04:45:43,840
different buttons and stuff that's uh

5751
04:45:43,840 --> 04:45:46,160
you know the way to go

5752
04:45:46,160 --> 04:45:48,240
anyway you can see uh them like in the

5753
04:45:48,240 --> 04:45:50,160
debugger here inspecting the memory

5754
04:45:50,160 --> 04:45:52,320
there a little bit uh so i'm looking at

5755
04:45:52,320 --> 04:45:53,680
the global variables you can see you

5756
04:45:53,680 --> 04:45:55,200
have the standard in the standard out

5757
04:45:55,200 --> 04:45:57,360
object and then further down

5758
04:45:57,360 --> 04:45:58,718
they have these objects and you can see

5759
04:45:58,718 --> 04:46:00,080
you can the

5760
04:46:00,080 --> 04:46:02,400
byte values there in the like the middle

5761
04:46:02,400 --> 04:46:05,120
of the of the printed out block with the

5762
04:46:05,120 --> 04:46:08,798
different digits of the sudoku solution

5763
04:46:08,798 --> 04:46:11,120
um

5764
04:46:11,200 --> 04:46:15,440
yeah it like it feels like they are

5765
04:46:15,440 --> 04:46:18,320
very close to getting it but still like

5766
04:46:18,320 --> 04:46:21,440
a bit unsure exactly what's going on

5767
04:46:21,440 --> 04:46:23,600
um

5768
04:46:23,600 --> 04:46:25,440
so um

5769
04:46:25,440 --> 04:46:27,040
yeah we have uh jordan coming back here

5770
04:46:27,040 --> 04:46:29,520
now so we'll get an update on where we

5771
04:46:29,520 --> 04:46:31,280
are we are gonna give them a sudden

5772
04:46:31,280 --> 04:46:33,200
death hint we're gonna give them a hint

5773
04:46:33,200 --> 04:46:34,958
that is just because here's here's the

5774
04:46:34,958 --> 04:46:36,958
the thing that we have missed talking

5775
04:46:36,958 --> 04:46:38,320
about it so far i was looking back over

5776
04:46:38,320 --> 04:46:41,200
with the the example solution

5777
04:46:41,200 --> 04:46:44,480
and the the the nuance here

5778
04:46:44,480 --> 04:46:46,160
is that there's a length check that that

5779
04:46:46,160 --> 04:46:47,440
we've been that has been kind of showing

5780
04:46:47,440 --> 04:46:48,480
up a little bit now length check

5781
04:46:48,480 --> 04:46:49,600
basically

5782
04:46:49,600 --> 04:46:51,600
um prevents you from even if you

5783
04:46:51,600 --> 04:46:53,760
overwrite it with a fully solved board

5784
04:46:53,760 --> 04:46:55,200
from actually

5785
04:46:55,200 --> 04:46:57,200
solving it on that throw okay so you

5786
04:46:57,200 --> 04:46:59,200
overwrite the state of the board all but

5787
04:46:59,200 --> 04:47:00,798
the last one

5788
04:47:00,798 --> 04:47:02,480
right and the last one you leave empty

5789
04:47:02,480 --> 04:47:03,920
and then you can just solve it by

5790
04:47:03,920 --> 04:47:06,718
overwriting the correct last answer i

5791
04:47:06,718 --> 04:47:07,840
see so

5792
04:47:07,840 --> 04:47:09,280
it's a little bit along the lines that

5793
04:47:09,280 --> 04:47:11,040
we've been talking about but

5794
04:47:11,040 --> 04:47:12,958
it seems that they've done like a weaker

5795
04:47:12,958 --> 04:47:14,878
variant of that where

5796
04:47:14,878 --> 04:47:16,160
uh

5797
04:47:16,160 --> 04:47:17,520
they didn't have like as good of a

5798
04:47:17,520 --> 04:47:18,718
solution

5799
04:47:18,718 --> 04:47:20,638
there was a question chat here about uh

5800
04:47:20,638 --> 04:47:22,320
is there anywhere that explains the ctf

5801
04:47:22,320 --> 04:47:24,160
format there's an 80 going on as well as

5802
04:47:24,160 --> 04:47:27,120
these ones yes so kind of like the main

5803
04:47:27,120 --> 04:47:30,718
uh the main ctf the defcon ctf is the

5804
04:47:30,718 --> 04:47:32,240
uh traditional

5805
04:47:32,240 --> 04:47:34,798
defcon attack defense that you know we

5806
04:47:34,798 --> 04:47:36,320
all know and love

5807
04:47:36,320 --> 04:47:38,000
uh although you know there's been like

5808
04:47:38,000 --> 04:47:40,160
variants and twists to it uh over the

5809
04:47:40,160 --> 04:47:42,240
years

5810
04:47:42,240 --> 04:47:43,120
men

5811
04:47:43,120 --> 04:47:45,600
within this competition this live ctf is

5812
04:47:45,600 --> 04:47:48,320
like a sub event where

5813
04:47:48,320 --> 04:47:50,160
it's running parallel to the attack

5814
04:47:50,160 --> 04:47:52,958
defense aspect of this so each team

5815
04:47:52,958 --> 04:47:55,600
sends uh one player for each match

5816
04:47:55,600 --> 04:47:57,200
and then we play this knockout

5817
04:47:57,200 --> 04:47:58,958
tournament and at the end this will

5818
04:47:58,958 --> 04:48:00,878
generate the ranking

5819
04:48:00,878 --> 04:48:03,760
from the nokia tournament which is then

5820
04:48:03,760 --> 04:48:06,638
fed back in and will uh

5821
04:48:06,638 --> 04:48:09,360
affect the scores of the main ctf

5822
04:48:09,360 --> 04:48:10,958
event so

5823
04:48:10,958 --> 04:48:12,400
uh this

5824
04:48:12,400 --> 04:48:15,360
will be valuable and might definitely

5825
04:48:15,360 --> 04:48:17,440
affect the final standings of the

5826
04:48:17,440 --> 04:48:19,920
development ctf i'm not completely aware

5827
04:48:19,920 --> 04:48:21,600
of like

5828
04:48:21,600 --> 04:48:23,680
what like the weighting factor is like

5829
04:48:23,680 --> 04:48:27,760
how the scoring model works for for the

5830
04:48:27,760 --> 04:48:28,798
ctf

5831
04:48:28,798 --> 04:48:29,840
um

5832
04:48:29,840 --> 04:48:32,798
and uh so so i i couldn't tell you like

5833
04:48:32,798 --> 04:48:35,760
exactly how valuable it is to win the

5834
04:48:35,760 --> 04:48:37,600
tournament versus getting second place

5835
04:48:37,600 --> 04:48:40,000
but we've been trying to find a balance

5836
04:48:40,000 --> 04:48:40,958
where

5837
04:48:40,958 --> 04:48:42,798
uh the teams can definitely help you

5838
04:48:42,798 --> 04:48:45,600
i'll tell you in a second but yes uh

5839
04:48:45,600 --> 04:48:47,520
first i'm gonna deliver the hints and

5840
04:48:47,520 --> 04:48:49,520
i'll be right back and we'll see if we

5841
04:48:49,520 --> 04:48:50,240
can

5842
04:48:50,240 --> 04:48:52,240
we can bring this one home right can you

5843
04:48:52,240 --> 04:48:54,160
just read me the hints here first here

5844
04:48:54,160 --> 04:48:55,120
we go

5845
04:48:55,120 --> 04:48:57,440
first attempt overwrite almost all

5846
04:48:57,440 --> 04:48:59,360
second attempt solves due to length

5847
04:48:59,360 --> 04:49:01,600
check yes

5848
04:49:01,600 --> 04:49:03,360
and we will see if this does it yeah

5849
04:49:03,360 --> 04:49:04,480
this is

5850
04:49:04,480 --> 04:49:07,040
almost like a straight up solution like

5851
04:49:07,040 --> 04:49:08,958
this could always be like a write-up for

5852
04:49:08,958 --> 04:49:10,000
the uh

5853
04:49:10,000 --> 04:49:11,040
you have to understand what the program

5854
04:49:11,040 --> 04:49:12,240
does and that that's the state that

5855
04:49:12,240 --> 04:49:13,600
they've they've got yeah but they have

5856
04:49:13,600 --> 04:49:15,680
that

5857
04:49:16,000 --> 04:49:18,320
so now we're going to give them like the

5858
04:49:18,320 --> 04:49:20,560
the final hopefully final hint here that

5859
04:49:20,560 --> 04:49:22,958
we'll just like hopefully blow this case

5860
04:49:22,958 --> 04:49:25,120
wide open and uh you know may have them

5861
04:49:25,120 --> 04:49:29,200
solve it from there uh did we get any uh

5862
04:49:29,200 --> 04:49:31,200
reaction from the players on that i was

5863
04:49:31,200 --> 04:49:32,638
too busy coming back i should have i

5864
04:49:32,638 --> 04:49:34,798
should have watched okay okay i see yeah

5865
04:49:34,798 --> 04:49:36,958
we got we got some forehead touching

5866
04:49:36,958 --> 04:49:40,160
okay uh says says our producer yes

5867
04:49:40,160 --> 04:49:41,120
um

5868
04:49:41,120 --> 04:49:43,840
so we'll see will it i i think this was

5869
04:49:43,840 --> 04:49:45,760
this one i think is on us yeah i think

5870
04:49:45,760 --> 04:49:47,680
this was a little too subtle for what

5871
04:49:47,680 --> 04:49:49,440
we're kind of aiming for and again being

5872
04:49:49,440 --> 04:49:51,440
in a high pressure thing

5873
04:49:51,440 --> 04:49:53,120
it's just not to say that these are not

5874
04:49:53,120 --> 04:49:54,638
excellent exploiters it is just very

5875
04:49:54,638 --> 04:49:56,480
hard and there's this was a little bit

5876
04:49:56,480 --> 04:49:58,000
of a little bit nuance a little subtle

5877
04:49:58,000 --> 04:50:00,240
nuance oh yeah because of the the way

5878
04:50:00,240 --> 04:50:01,920
that the length check happens in the

5879
04:50:01,920 --> 04:50:04,480
binary you can't actually

5880
04:50:04,480 --> 04:50:05,840
fully overwrite and expect to do it it

5881
04:50:05,840 --> 04:50:07,440
will already know that it's an invalid

5882
04:50:07,440 --> 04:50:09,520
attempt and so it's not solvable but

5883
04:50:09,520 --> 04:50:11,040
then you have overwritten the the

5884
04:50:11,040 --> 04:50:13,360
correct state such that you can then

5885
04:50:13,360 --> 04:50:14,798
solve it because you moved it from an

5886
04:50:14,798 --> 04:50:17,120
insolvable state to a solvable state

5887
04:50:17,120 --> 04:50:18,000
right and

5888
04:50:18,000 --> 04:50:19,200
somebody else might have got it you

5889
04:50:19,200 --> 04:50:21,280
don't know but it's definitely this is

5890
04:50:21,280 --> 04:50:22,160
definitely a little harder it's

5891
04:50:22,160 --> 04:50:23,600
certainly it's it's more subtle than

5892
04:50:23,600 --> 04:50:25,600
some of our previous challenges

5893
04:50:25,600 --> 04:50:27,920
um but but we'll see we'll do our best

5894
04:50:27,920 --> 04:50:29,360
to keep keep dialing in the the

5895
04:50:29,360 --> 04:50:31,040
difficulty and

5896
04:50:31,040 --> 04:50:33,280
