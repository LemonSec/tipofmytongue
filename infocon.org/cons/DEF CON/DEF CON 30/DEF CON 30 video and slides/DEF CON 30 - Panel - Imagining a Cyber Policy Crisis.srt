1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:00,983
- All right, hi everyone.

2
00:00:00,983 --> 00:00:02,280
My name's Safa Shahwan Edwards,

3
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:03,240
and I'm a Deputy Director

4
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:04,740
with the Cyber Statecraft Initiative

5
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:05,790
at the Atlantic Council.

6
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:08,640
We're a foreign policy think
tank based in Washington, D.C.,

7
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:09,510
and my program works

8
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,435
at the Nexus of Geopolitics
and Cybersecurity.

9
00:00:12,435 --> 00:00:14,550
This morning's discussion is imagining

10
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:17,190
a cyber policy crisis,
where we're gonna examine

11
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:18,930
how storytelling, simulations,

12
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:21,840
and war games can help
individuals better understand

13
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,450
cybersecurity concepts and challenges.

14
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:25,980
A few announcements before we begin,

15
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,500
first off, cell phones as
a courtesy to our speakers,

16
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,310
please ensure that your
cell phones are on silent.

17
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:33,210
The other part of this is,

18
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:34,980
we have some microphones
scattered around the room.

19
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:36,940
As you have questions,
please feel free to relocate

20
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:39,390
and direct your questions
into the microphones.

21
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:40,980
As you can hear, the
acoustics in this room's

22
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:43,580
a little funky, so microphones
are our friends here.

23
00:00:45,647 --> 00:00:48,450
Last, so this is good, photo policy.

24
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:49,736
This prohibits anyone from taking pictures

25
00:00:49,736 --> 00:00:52,740
without the explicit
permission of anyone in frame.

26
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:54,363
And please keep your mask on at all times

27
00:00:54,363 --> 00:00:56,460
with the exception of us speaking, eating,

28
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:57,573
drinking, et cetera.

29
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,390
I think that might be it,

30
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:01,920
so I think we're gonna kick off here.

31
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,524
So with the discussion today,

32
00:01:03,524 --> 00:01:05,883
what we're hoping to do
is examine how do stories,

33
00:01:05,883 --> 00:01:08,940
simulations, crisis simulations,

34
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:12,210
and war games aid in
learning and training.

35
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:13,260
A little bit about myself,

36
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,030
I've organized simulations
for college students.

37
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:17,010
This is our Cyber 9/12 Strategy Challenge

38
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:18,973
where we develop these.

39
00:01:18,973 --> 00:01:20,940
(moderator speaking faintly)

40
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:22,593
Yeah, I'll get closer, thank you.

41
00:01:23,872 --> 00:01:25,470
Should I adjust this?

42
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:27,630
Okay, thank you.

43
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:29,850
So I've organized simulations
for college students.

44
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:31,600
This is part of our Cyber
9/12 Strategy Challenge,

45
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,238
where we develop a three
part cyber crisis scenario

46
00:01:34,238 --> 00:01:36,966
that examines a technical vulnerability

47
00:01:36,966 --> 00:01:39,469
or an incident that has
reaching implications

48
00:01:39,469 --> 00:01:43,662
on national security,
public policy, et cetera.

49
00:01:43,662 --> 00:01:46,620
And I am joined today
by my colleagues here.

50
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:47,730
We got Winnona DeSombre.

51
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:50,490
She is a fellow with the
Cyber Statecraft Initiative,

52
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:52,680
but also with the Belfer
Center at Harvard.

53
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,360
We are also joined by Sarah Powazek.

54
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,000
She is a consultant at CrowdStrike.

55
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,010
So before we kick-off with the discussion

56
00:01:59,010 --> 00:01:59,940
and some of the questions,

57
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:02,010
the Cyber Statecraft team
at the Atlantic Council,

58
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:04,560
we always like to ask
speakers some fun questions

59
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,420
to get to know them a little bit better.

60
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:09,030
So the first one is what
is your favorite beverage?

61
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:11,115
This can be alcoholic or otherwise.

62
00:02:11,115 --> 00:02:14,130
Your favorite book,
favorite musical artist,

63
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:16,830
and if you could have one
superpower, what would it be?

64
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:17,970
Sarah is taking notes,

65
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:19,264
'cause these are really good questions.

66
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,097
- It's a lot of questions.

67
00:02:20,097 --> 00:02:20,992
(panelists laughing)

68
00:02:20,992 --> 00:02:21,900
- Winnona, you know us better,

69
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,310
so I'll get over to you.

70
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,330
- Yeah, all right.

71
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:25,163
Hi, everyone.

72
00:02:25,163 --> 00:02:26,100
So I'm Winnona, I'm a fellow.

73
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,080
I also used to work in
Cyber Threat Intelligence.

74
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,515
So while I was a fellow doing think tank

75
00:02:30,515 --> 00:02:32,220
and fun cyber war gaming stuff,

76
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:35,373
I also did in-depth
detection response research.

77
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:39,390
My favorite drink, my
husband and I got really

78
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:41,970
into making elaborate
cocktails during the pandemic,

79
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:44,405
as I'm sure many of us may have also done.

80
00:02:44,405 --> 00:02:45,388
(Winnona laughing)

81
00:02:45,388 --> 00:02:47,640
But we made this cocktail
called the five eyes,

82
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,230
which is a muddled Kiwi,

83
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:51,420
apologies to our New Zealand friends,

84
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,820
Bundaberg ginger beer from Australia,

85
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:56,640
a shot of scotch, a shot of bourbon,

86
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,320
and a shot of Canadian whiskey.

87
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,700
So highly recommend it.

88
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:00,553
It's very good.

89
00:03:00,553 --> 00:03:01,980
(Winnona laughing)

90
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:02,813
Superpower?

91
00:03:02,813 --> 00:03:04,230
I don't know, invisibility?

92
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:05,670
I feel like any person

93
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:07,096
in the intel space might wanna say that.

94
00:03:07,096 --> 00:03:09,891
(panelists and audience laughing)

95
00:03:09,891 --> 00:03:13,020
- Okay, I think I got all
four of the questions.

96
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:13,853
So hi, folks.

97
00:03:13,853 --> 00:03:14,686
My name's Sarah Powazek.

98
00:03:14,686 --> 00:03:15,519
I work for CrowdStrike.

99
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:16,968
I run our tabletop exercises.

100
00:03:16,968 --> 00:03:19,400
We have a bunch of
clients, major enterprises,

101
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,820
small businesses.

102
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:23,040
So I feel like we run
the gambit of the sorts

103
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,830
of folks that we walk
through these exercises.

104
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,510
My favorite drink, I'm a big tea drinker.

105
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:28,560
I don't know if I'm the only one.

106
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,936
Any coffee, tea, anybody?

107
00:03:30,936 --> 00:03:31,769
Tea?

108
00:03:31,769 --> 00:03:33,156
A couple, yeah.

109
00:03:33,156 --> 00:03:33,989
(Sarah laughing)

110
00:03:33,989 --> 00:03:35,430
So I'm a big fan of loose leaf tea.

111
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:37,170
I have a bunch of weird
flavors like cupcake

112
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:39,540
and banana bread, and
sort of substitute it

113
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,890
for any sort of dessert
that you feel like, so.

114
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:46,440
Superpower, definitely talking to animals.

115
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,367
I have two really cute cats at home.

116
00:03:48,367 --> 00:03:50,460
Musical artist...

117
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:52,380
I don't know if you guys
have heard of Still Woozy,

118
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:54,360
sort of like a funky electronic.

119
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,193
Yeah, I didn't think so.

120
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:56,726
(panelists and audience laughing)

121
00:03:56,726 --> 00:03:58,076
But yeah, happy to be here.

122
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:01,260
- Awesome, thank you for that.

123
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,187
So to kick off this conversation,

124
00:04:03,187 --> 00:04:05,670
can you tell me about a
time that a simulation

125
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:09,240
or a tabletop that you put
together helped either you

126
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,293
or a partner or a client better understand

127
00:04:11,293 --> 00:04:13,953
a cybersecurity challenge or concept?

128
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,133
- I can go first, yeah.

129
00:04:16,133 --> 00:04:19,500
I mean, so I probably
can't share too much,

130
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,240
but the way that we do tabletop exercises

131
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,150
is that we actually find
a viable attack path

132
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:24,983
for our client.

133
00:04:24,983 --> 00:04:26,550
And so we'll either do
a technical tabletop

134
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:28,650
or a management or executive tabletop,

135
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:30,705
but we'll spend a good amount
of time talking to someone

136
00:04:30,705 --> 00:04:33,510
on their security team.

137
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:35,004
You know, what's your MFA coverage?

138
00:04:35,004 --> 00:04:36,807
What does your network look like?

139
00:04:36,807 --> 00:04:37,800
And we actually try

140
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:42,800
and find a current exploitable
vulnerability or attack path.

141
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:44,250
Like for example, we've been doing a lot

142
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,371
of ESXi ransomware lately.

143
00:04:45,371 --> 00:04:48,990
'Cause that's very popular
that that could happen

144
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:51,750
on their network, so that we
can come up with questions

145
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,570
that they would actually need
to answer during an attack.

146
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:56,670
And so that's been pretty
successful, I think.

147
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:58,728
We'll walk a technical team through,

148
00:04:58,728 --> 00:05:00,900
we'll have them look at
machine names for example,

149
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:01,890
and they say, "Oh my God!

150
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:03,900
We have 20 service accounts.

151
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,280
That's not good."

152
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,730
So that sort of realism in the exercise,

153
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:10,620
I think, really helps folks take away,

154
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:13,050
not just what sort of
processes they need to improve,

155
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:15,120
but what sorts of gaps
they have in their maturity

156
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,360
that they're gonna need
to work on in the future.

157
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,250
- So instead of answering
this question first,

158
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:22,110
I actually wanna make a gauge of the room.

159
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:27,110
How many people first off know
what a tabletop exercise is?

160
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:27,953
Excellent.

161
00:05:27,953 --> 00:05:30,810
How many people have participated
in a tabletop exercise?

162
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:31,643
Great.

163
00:05:31,643 --> 00:05:32,940
- Great.

164
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:35,850
- Raise your hand if the
tabletop exercise was primarily

165
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:39,360
geared towards higher
level decision makers?

166
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,440
Okay.

167
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,450
And then raise your hand if...

168
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:43,380
So it's about half the room

169
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,599
for the people on the livestream.

170
00:05:44,599 --> 00:05:45,432
(Winnona laughing)

171
00:05:45,432 --> 00:05:48,150
Raise your hand if the
tabletop was designed more

172
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:49,713
for technical practitioners.

173
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,350
Okay, so the other half.

174
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:55,740
So at least for me, I've
done tabletop exercises

175
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:58,530
that kind of run that entire gamut, right?

176
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:00,240
So you have the more technical side

177
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,710
where you're actually
going through a simulation,

178
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:03,210
maybe a red team exercise.

179
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:06,750
You also have the more
policy oriented stuff.

180
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:10,047
I've done a decent amount
of work for the Cyber 9/12,

181
00:06:10,047 --> 00:06:12,450
building that kind of policy, or process,

182
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:13,980
or people muscle within people

183
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:15,480
who want to get into cyber policy,

184
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:18,150
who may not have briefed
high level principles

185
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:19,050
and things like that.

186
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:21,630
And then there's also
the tabletop exercises

187
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:23,130
that are helpful when doing

188
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:24,390
more international conversations.

189
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:26,894
So I've done a track two dialogue

190
00:06:26,894 --> 00:06:28,440
through the Harvard Belfer Center

191
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,770
with a Chinese PLA think
tank, which was a wild time.

192
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:32,850
And so going through

193
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,950
the American delegation crisis simulation

194
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:36,900
and then looking at
the Chinese counterpart

195
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,480
is also an interesting
set of ways to determine

196
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,100
how that process is going to work out

197
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,930
when stuff hits the fan.

198
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:45,360
And so, (laughs) at least for me,

199
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,580
the thing that has been
particularly interesting

200
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:51,240
and I honestly would love to
hear more from our audience,

201
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,703
as well as not just having
all of us rattling on.

202
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,090
But frankly, going through

203
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:59,970
and learning about how
the other side is thinking

204
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:02,250
when you're especially
doing cross team exercises,

205
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:03,630
I've found to be the most useful,

206
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:06,187
as well as exercising
the aspects of your job

207
00:07:06,187 --> 00:07:07,680
that may come up in a crisis

208
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,760
that you don't do in your day to day.

209
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,319
So for me, at least from
a technical perspective,

210
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:14,250
Cyber 9/12 way back in
the day, like maybe what?

211
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:15,083
Five, six years ago.

212
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:15,916
(Winnona laughing)

213
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:18,750
When I first participated
and then also became a judge,

214
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:21,420
you see a lot of...

215
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:24,060
There's a wide variety where
you see technical students

216
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:25,380
who are participating in this challenge,

217
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:27,150
learning how to do bottom line up front,

218
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:27,983
briefing a principle,

219
00:07:27,983 --> 00:07:30,240
making sure that they get
the main points across.

220
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,560
You see West Point Cadets,

221
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,660
Naval Academy Cadets who are
used to this sort of briefing,

222
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,220
but may not have the technical expertise,

223
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,600
so doing that sort of in-depth reading

224
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,010
and in terms of the scenario.

225
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:39,630
And so those cross team,

226
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:42,780
as well as cross discipline
perspectives, I think,

227
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:46,173
is really what makes the tabletop
really, really impactful.

228
00:07:47,124 --> 00:07:48,090
- Thanks for that, Winnona.

229
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:49,620
I think you raise a
really excellent point.

230
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:51,960
It's like one thing I'd
like to highlight is so,

231
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:56,160
while we created Cyber 9/12
initially to serve more like...

232
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,830
We saw lots of hackathons and
capture the fly competitions

233
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:00,150
and that can add a lot of value

234
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:03,090
to help students develop
their technical understanding.

235
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:05,400
On the other hand, those
sorts of events focus

236
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,830
around the how as opposed to the why.

237
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:08,850
So there was a real gap there

238
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:10,920
where we wanted to create
an opportunity for students

239
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,320
to focus on the why behind
these cyber incidents

240
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:16,202
and understand why do adversaries
engage in certain ways?

241
00:08:16,202 --> 00:08:19,650
What are the priorities of
different actors in this space?

242
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:22,170
I think one thing I'd
like to dig in on is like,

243
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:26,001
how do we identify how
we wanna challenge folks?

244
00:08:26,001 --> 00:08:28,440
I know one thing that we've thought about

245
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,320
with Cyber 9/12 in our
scenarios is we want students

246
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,750
to dig into attribution.

247
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,187
Ideally, Winnona's cracking up

248
00:08:35,187 --> 00:08:37,521
because attribution takes time.

249
00:08:37,521 --> 00:08:39,390
And she made a really
good meme about this,

250
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:40,950
or I think you retweeted
a meme about this,

251
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:42,699
where one student was trying to explain,

252
00:08:42,699 --> 00:08:44,880
I don't have an answer for you right now

253
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,500
because we're still working through this.

254
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,696
These things take time.

255
00:08:47,696 --> 00:08:50,220
Another part of the
scenario that we focused

256
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:53,130
on has been the vulnerabilities
equities process.

257
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:56,067
Yes, you have a vulnerability,
but does the owner

258
00:08:56,067 --> 00:08:59,100
of that proprietary software
actually know that it exists?

259
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,810
Are they engaging with
the security researcher?

260
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:02,760
What does that process look like?

261
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,273
Does it have a national
security implication?

262
00:09:05,273 --> 00:09:10,001
Or when intelligence operations go awry,

263
00:09:10,001 --> 00:09:12,750
how do we ensure that nation states engage

264
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,898
in certain activities
to collect intelligence?

265
00:09:14,898 --> 00:09:16,860
Sometimes this has implications

266
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:20,516
on broader cybersecurity
policy challenges,

267
00:09:20,516 --> 00:09:22,830
but not sure if you guys wanna
chime in on any of those;

268
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:25,830
if you've ever identified a specific thing

269
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:28,740
that you wanted to challenge
a client, or a partner,

270
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:29,627
or yourself with.

271
00:09:29,627 --> 00:09:31,593
- Yeah, I love this question.

272
00:09:31,593 --> 00:09:34,079
How do we make, is this on still?

273
00:09:34,079 --> 00:09:34,912
Okay, great.

274
00:09:34,912 --> 00:09:38,250
How do we make tabletop
exercises the most uncomfortable

275
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,630
for people in the room?

276
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:40,470
How do we scare them?

277
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:42,540
I think that I try and do that.

278
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,899
'Cause I think the more
realistic an exercise,

279
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:50,167
the more that we can get an
actual threat actor behind it,

280
00:09:50,167 --> 00:09:51,690
the more they get out of it.

281
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:52,890
So I love ratcheting up the pressure.

282
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:53,905
I think one way we do that,

283
00:09:53,905 --> 00:09:55,315
I like doing this with ransomware

284
00:09:55,315 --> 00:09:57,360
'cause a lot of clients
want to see some sort

285
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,420
of ransomware exercise, see
if they're prepared for it.

286
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:01,890
We try and pick a ransom amount

287
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:05,550
that's like a decent chunk
of their yearly revenue.

288
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:07,500
We actually try and find the right number

289
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:11,160
that will scare them enough,
that it's a lot of money

290
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,080
and their insurance might not cover it.

291
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,955
But it's just enough that we
think that they can afford it.

292
00:10:16,955 --> 00:10:21,810
And we also try and figure out
what their crown jewels are.

293
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:24,360
So what sort of data, if it was stolen,

294
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:28,350
would really hurt the
company or the customers,

295
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:30,627
or would raise pretty significant legal

296
00:10:30,627 --> 00:10:32,700
and regulatory questions.

297
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,037
And then when we combine all of that

298
00:10:34,037 --> 00:10:35,480
into a sort of powder keg,

299
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,670
we get something that doesn't
shut them down, right?

300
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:42,090
If it's too scary, they
will say in this scenario,

301
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:45,213
the company would fold, and we
cannot do anything about it.

302
00:10:45,213 --> 00:10:47,667
So we wanna keep it within their reach,

303
00:10:47,667 --> 00:10:51,570
but we definitely wanna
make it stressful enough

304
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:54,780
that it really tests their processes.

305
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:57,161
So especially with ransomware,

306
00:10:57,161 --> 00:11:00,000
we like to ask a lot of the hard questions

307
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,190
that people might not
realize that they need.

308
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:03,990
You know, what's your insurance coverage?

309
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:05,940
How early do you need
to bring in your insurer

310
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:08,070
to make sure that they will
actually cover a cyber event?

311
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:09,690
A lot of folks at the end are like,

312
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:12,626
and then we would ask
insurance for $10 million.

313
00:11:12,626 --> 00:11:13,650
(panelists and audience laughing)

314
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:16,352
No, yeah, see people
are shaking their heads.

315
00:11:16,352 --> 00:11:20,611
But that nitty gritty stuff
is not self-explanatory.

316
00:11:20,611 --> 00:11:22,650
And it's really important to make sure

317
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:24,720
that people have those
nitty gritty processes down.

318
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,280
Do you have external legal counsil?

319
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:29,370
Does your external legal counsil
have any cyber expertise?

320
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:32,250
Would they actually understand
what's going on right now

321
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:33,810
and be able to advise you about

322
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:35,250
what sort of statement you should put out,

323
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,711
and whether we should use the word breach,

324
00:11:37,711 --> 00:11:42,711
or ransomware attack, or
disruption, service outage?

325
00:11:42,891 --> 00:11:45,150
Those sorts of things are
really, really important.

326
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:47,441
So to answer your question,

327
00:11:47,441 --> 00:11:49,560
trying to find the right ransom amount,

328
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,770
poking at specific processes,
especially with ransomware,

329
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:55,020
that might not be a self-explanatory

330
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:58,170
and making sure that the
pressure is high enough

331
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:00,030
that the exercise is useful to them,

332
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:03,450
but not so high that it
makes them disengage.

333
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:05,970
- Yeah, and I mean, even
on your point, Sarah,

334
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:08,760
I think that one of the things
that's been most beneficial,

335
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,800
at least for me when I
run some of these games,

336
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,090
is to be, you want to make
sure that they're learning,

337
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:16,500
but also to be a sounding board,

338
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,117
such that when they're doing
the after action, they go,

339
00:12:19,117 --> 00:12:21,240
"Oh crap, we don't actually
have a relationship

340
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,073
with our FBI."

341
00:12:22,073 --> 00:12:23,043
(Winnona laughing)

342
00:12:23,043 --> 00:12:24,037
(indistinct) and you're like,

343
00:12:24,037 --> 00:12:27,300
"Well, here's that local
office in your area.

344
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,470
Here's their contact."

345
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:30,600
And making sure that it's not just

346
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,040
about the technical aspect

347
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,420
and running through
the internal processes,

348
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,970
but making sure that you
have the external as well.

349
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,459
- I'd like to open this
up to our guests here.

350
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:42,420
If you have something you'd like to add,

351
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:44,310
if you've worked in a
war game with a partner

352
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:48,000
or with your organization, and
how you tried to kind of...

353
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,010
I think we've talked about
poking holes in processes,

354
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:51,426
trying to find those gaps.

355
00:12:51,426 --> 00:12:52,770
Please feel free to chime in.

356
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:53,940
I see some heads nodding,

357
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,185
and I don't wanna call
anybody out individually,

358
00:12:56,185 --> 00:12:57,960
but would love to hear
your thoughts as well.

359
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,820
Just because you do wanna
make, this is a round table.

360
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,143
We want folks to chime in.

361
00:13:03,371 --> 00:13:04,507
Yeah, please.

362
00:13:04,507 --> 00:13:06,360
- Yeah, you guys can pass the mics too.

363
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,431
- Yeah, just be gentle with them.

364
00:13:08,431 --> 00:13:10,680
- [Audience Member] Testing.

365
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:14,400
In your guys' experience,
what is the right way

366
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,710
for organizations to test their engagement

367
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:17,760
with law enforcement?

368
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,910
- You were just talking about FBI.

369
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:21,852
You wanna take it?

370
00:13:21,852 --> 00:13:22,685
(panelists laughing)

371
00:13:22,685 --> 00:13:23,850
- I mean, at least for me,

372
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:26,910
we've never run anything
jointly with the FBI.

373
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:30,953
I think making sure that, first off,

374
00:13:30,953 --> 00:13:33,750
I might not actually be
the best person to answer

375
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:34,583
because yeah.

376
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:35,903
- Okay, I can talk, yeah.

377
00:13:35,903 --> 00:13:37,710
I mean, I think the number one thing

378
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:39,480
is knowing your local field agents.

379
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,151
Do you who to call?

380
00:13:41,151 --> 00:13:42,990
A lot of people don't and
when you're in the middle

381
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:44,130
of a stressful situation,

382
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:46,620
trying to figure out that
information is very difficult.

383
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:47,940
So I think to the extent

384
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,170
that you can establish a relationship

385
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:50,940
with your local field office,

386
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,620
that you least have one
person in the company

387
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:54,686
that knows one person there that can call,

388
00:13:54,686 --> 00:13:56,455
hopefully multiple.

389
00:13:56,455 --> 00:13:58,620
But I think the other thing
that folks don't think about

390
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,450
with law enforcement is like,

391
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:01,920
when do you want to engage them?

392
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,330
Do you wanna engage them at the beginning,

393
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:05,283
before you really know what's going on?

394
00:14:05,283 --> 00:14:07,860
That might be a waste of their time.

395
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:10,830
Do you wanna engage them and
tell them that you're thinking

396
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:12,240
about paying a ransom?

397
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,727
I'm not sure.

398
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:17,550
I think it's, companies
don't really think about...

399
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:19,177
Some people that we talk to are like,

400
00:14:19,177 --> 00:14:23,640
"Absolutely, as soon as we
see any kind of ransomware,

401
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,410
we're talking to the FBI."

402
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:26,243
And then we ask,

403
00:14:26,243 --> 00:14:28,590
how do you think the FBI will help you?

404
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:30,180
'Cause I'm a big fan of the FBI,

405
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:35,180
but their priority sometimes
is these long term attacks

406
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,170
against threat actors, right?

407
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:40,557
They're not necessarily there
to be the fire department

408
00:14:40,557 --> 00:14:42,930
for any individual organization.

409
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:45,360
So I think setting those
sorts of expectations

410
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,040
for when you contact law enforcement,

411
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,590
are you expecting them
to come and fix things?

412
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:50,580
Some people are.

413
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:52,445
And I think it's important
to communicate to them,

414
00:14:52,445 --> 00:14:54,690
the engagement with law
enforcement is gonna be

415
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:56,730
about sharing information.

416
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:58,650
You may not get anything back.

417
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:01,413
You may not get anything back for a while.

418
00:15:01,413 --> 00:15:03,837
And that's important that
they have other folks

419
00:15:03,837 --> 00:15:05,589
that they're prepared to rely
on and that they don't think

420
00:15:05,589 --> 00:15:08,790
that law enforcement is gonna
come in and fix everything.

421
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:11,190
'Cause they just don't have
the capacity, and I also think

422
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:12,840
that it's just a slightly
different priority

423
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,283
than the organizations.

424
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,747
- Please.

425
00:15:17,747 --> 00:15:19,770
- [Audience Member] Well, my question,

426
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:22,500
I work in financial services,
and I've actually ran

427
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,080
and contributed to some
of these attack scenarios

428
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:28,680
under more of the BCP DR testing.

429
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:32,853
So I think my two questions
would be concentration risk.

430
00:15:32,853 --> 00:15:36,240
We talk about that a lot
in financial services.

431
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,850
A lot of time, marketing
people give up really,

432
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:40,470
really good information in OSN.

433
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:42,510
Oh, we have this strategic partnership

434
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:43,920
with X, Y, and Z vendor.

435
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,500
Me on the attacking side is
like, yeah, it's a good place

436
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,760
to start to go after them,

437
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,910
because that's gonna be my
pivot into the organization.

438
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:55,200
The other aspect is more
of what your thoughts

439
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:58,260
and feelings on bringing
that concentration risk

440
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,469
into your scenarios.

441
00:15:59,469 --> 00:16:02,460
The second side of it
is threat intelligence.

442
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:03,360
Who is attacking you?

443
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,980
How are they attacking you?

444
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:07,740
And how do you play
that into your scenario,

445
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,090
so that you know the (indistinct)?

446
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:13,419
It's basically doing a threat
model on your own scenario

447
00:16:13,419 --> 00:16:17,340
and what your thoughts and
feelings would be on that.

448
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:19,068
And then the follow on is,

449
00:16:19,068 --> 00:16:22,320
given what we're talking about here,

450
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,990
why aren't we having a
CTF in relation to it

451
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:26,220
in a future DEF CON?

452
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:29,310
'Cause I think that's a perfect outplay.

453
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:31,440
I think it would be
wonderful to have that.

454
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,790
So your thoughts, your feelings?

455
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:35,301
- So I can answer the
third and fourth question.

456
00:16:35,301 --> 00:16:38,787
And so the fourth, I'll do it backwards.

457
00:16:38,787 --> 00:16:41,700
We're not having a CTF for DEF CON policy,

458
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,948
because this is the first
time we've expanded so rapidly

459
00:16:43,948 --> 00:16:45,480
as DEF CON policy.

460
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,860
So we'll take that feedback,

461
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:49,750
and we'll see if we can do that next year.

462
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:52,800
As for the threat
intelligence aspect, I mean,

463
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,210
I think it depends on, A,

464
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:56,392
your relationship with your end customer.

465
00:16:56,392 --> 00:17:01,392
How much are you tailoring a
war game or tabletop exercise,

466
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,170
DTX, whatever you wanna
call it, to their needs?

467
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:06,960
Are they specifically asking
for a nation state threat

468
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,790
that is going to target them, right?

469
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:10,800
And then, how good is your relationship

470
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,590
as that war game planner
with someone who understands

471
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:15,150
that type of threat actor?

472
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:18,510
And finally, why do they
want this in the first place?

473
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:20,568
Is it like a bragging right?

474
00:17:20,568 --> 00:17:23,610
Can we successfully
defend against AVT attacks

475
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:26,485
or is it like a, we wanna be able to map

476
00:17:26,485 --> 00:17:29,310
how well we actually apply our defenses

477
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:30,690
to the minor attack framework?

478
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:33,000
And if that's the case, then
that might be a little bit

479
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,310
of an easier scenario, right?

480
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:39,391
But then, once you've figured
out which minor attack

481
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:43,920
killed chain whatever
model you wanna go for,

482
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,350
what threat actor
actually exists out there

483
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:47,820
that is going to map very neatly?

484
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:50,010
And it's never gonna be one to one.

485
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:52,290
And so setting those
expectations with the client,

486
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:53,750
making sure that they understand

487
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,830
if this is going to be this way,

488
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:59,433
it might not hit every minor
attack boss that they want.

489
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:02,280
And then also making sure

490
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,341
that they then have the internal processes

491
00:18:04,341 --> 00:18:07,233
to do that type of defense against an APT.

492
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:09,690
Do they have their own

493
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:11,520
internal threat intelligence capability?

494
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,450
What is that like?

495
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:15,630
How does that internal team interact

496
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:17,310
with the wider detection
and response board?

497
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:20,190
And that is a really good
muscle to test in my opinion,

498
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:23,340
when doing those sorts
of APT level attacks.

499
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,472
- [Audience Member] Thank you.

500
00:18:24,472 --> 00:18:26,850
- I echo what Winnona's saying about that.

501
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:28,866
We try and pick an actual
threat actor and say,

502
00:18:28,866 --> 00:18:31,590
these are the sort of
behaviors they exhibit.

503
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:33,090
We wanna make sure that
we're picking the right one

504
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:33,923
for the client.

505
00:18:33,923 --> 00:18:36,600
I don't want small businesses
worried about espionage.

506
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,360
That is not what they
should be concerned about.

507
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,304
And it's tough 'cause there
are all these tools out there

508
00:18:41,304 --> 00:18:43,500
and they all seem really useful,

509
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,240
but they're not all
useful for every company.

510
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,490
And so it's interesting
that we'll come into someone

511
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:50,430
in their environment and they
have all these fancy tools

512
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:52,170
about threat intelligence, which is great.

513
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:55,158
But they don't have MFA coverage.

514
00:18:55,158 --> 00:18:58,110
It's really interesting the
way that folks prioritize,

515
00:18:58,110 --> 00:18:59,550
and I'm not blaming them whatsoever.

516
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:01,860
But we wanna make sure that
we're picking a threat actor

517
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:04,020
that's actually going to attack
them, so they can prepare

518
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:06,168
for something that is
actually going to happen;

519
00:19:06,168 --> 00:19:09,900
that we can pick common entry points,

520
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,100
like fishing gets used a lot.

521
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,590
Obviously, it's very
boring, but it happens.

522
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:15,090
Are they ready for a fishing attack?

523
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:16,710
Do they even know what
that's gonna look like?

524
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:18,610
Would they even be able to catch that?

525
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:23,370
Another thing that we do
is we pick, like I said,

526
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:24,240
specific threat actors.

527
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,448
So we use Conti, for example.

528
00:19:25,448 --> 00:19:29,123
We use the same ransom note
that Conti actually sends out.

529
00:19:29,123 --> 00:19:31,770
It'll have sometimes their
name in it and we'll say,

530
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:32,880
Do you know Conti?

531
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,500
Do you know where they are?

532
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:37,140
Do you know what sorts
of tactics they're using?

533
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:39,420
Are you able to do any
research during this ex-

534
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,950
This is for technical teams obviously,

535
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:43,792
but is there anything
you can do research wise

536
00:19:43,792 --> 00:19:46,620
on this threat actor that
you can bring to leadership

537
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:49,620
and say, this is the
reputation that they have

538
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,210
as far as whether or not they leak data

539
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:52,500
after getting ransom paid;

540
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,793
like that sort of thing.

541
00:19:53,793 --> 00:19:56,070
Like I said, threat intelligence
is usually the last thing

542
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:58,710
that companies do on their maturity.

543
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:00,720
So usually, they're not
prepared for that sort of thing,

544
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,550
but there is a lot that they can do

545
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:04,590
just with the information
of the threat actor

546
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:05,460
from the ransom node.

547
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:08,070
So we try and encourage
them to do a little digging

548
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:10,380
and see if they can use that to help them

549
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:12,180
during the exercise.

550
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:14,344
- I want to foot stomp on the,

551
00:20:14,344 --> 00:20:15,440
(Sarah laughing)

552
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,270
like this company wants an APT war game,

553
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:21,270
even though they shouldn't
be worried about APTs.

554
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:24,000
Like threat intelligence,
yes, is important,

555
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,708
but only if it is relevant and actionable.

556
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:28,980
So otherwise, it's just threat news.

557
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,071
Like it's not...

558
00:20:30,071 --> 00:20:30,904
(Winnona laughing)

559
00:20:30,904 --> 00:20:32,550
- And also, I don't think we mentioned,

560
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:35,070
but the three of us are
all DEF CON policy goons

561
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:36,720
this year as well, so if
you have any questions

562
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,640
about DEF CON policy
afterwards, come and talk to us.

563
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,660
Like someone had a suggestion

564
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:42,090
for running a threat scenario next year.

565
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:44,430
We will actually take
that into consideration.

566
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:46,011
'Cause we're gonna be planning it, so.

567
00:20:46,011 --> 00:20:48,120
- If I could add two pieces
really, really quickly,

568
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,410
just on the CTF piece.

569
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:50,940
We've been talking for a while.

570
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,860
Trey and I have been talking for a while

571
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:55,427
about trying to find a way
to collaborate with CTFs,

572
00:20:55,427 --> 00:20:58,950
and hackathons, and have
the Cyber 9/12 storyline.

573
00:20:58,950 --> 00:20:59,970
Because it is a story,

574
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:02,100
it's a scenario, but there is a storyline,

575
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,630
there are characters,
and there are actors,

576
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:05,241
and there is an arch, et cetera.

577
00:21:05,241 --> 00:21:07,860
How can we collaborate
with CTFs and hackathons,

578
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:09,450
so we can create learning opportunities

579
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:11,130
that are multidisciplinary,

580
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:13,646
where you can learn to
analyze lots of information

581
00:21:13,646 --> 00:21:15,120
in a short period of time,

582
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,427
learn how to present
that to decision makers,

583
00:21:17,427 --> 00:21:19,530
but also learn the technical aspects of it

584
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:20,919
as well with your team.

585
00:21:20,919 --> 00:21:23,140
So if you have any feedback
on that, please let me know.

586
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:24,423
We'll really keen for that.

587
00:21:24,423 --> 00:21:26,520
The other piece, if I can add tiny bit

588
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:29,250
of contrast is sometimes,
in some of our simulations,

589
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:32,460
we try to lean away from
nation state threat actors,

590
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:34,257
just because it's easier for students.

591
00:21:34,257 --> 00:21:36,600
There is a policy framework
for how to engage.

592
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,220
There are diplomatic channels.

593
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:39,120
We wanna challenge them.

594
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,440
We want them to be uncomfortable.

595
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:43,010
So engaging with a non-state
actor often pushes them

596
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:45,600
in that direction of you just
can't call for sanctions.

597
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,250
It's not a thing.

598
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:48,180
So wherever we get...

599
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:49,980
And students like sanctions.

600
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,660
It's a very American thing.

601
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:53,730
So we like to make sure that
they're not just leaning

602
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:55,380
towards that first tool that's ready

603
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,240
and getting that knee jerk reaction.

604
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,633
But Chris, I saw you wanna lean in.

605
00:21:59,633 --> 00:22:01,230
- [Chris] Yeah, just a couple things.

606
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:03,570
One, on Sarah's point
about law enforcement,

607
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:04,920
I agree, they can't solve everything.

608
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,330
And they're not gonna
prioritize everything.

609
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:10,170
But I think the answer
in part is for entities

610
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:11,940
to have an incident response plan in place

611
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:13,980
that includes who they're
gonna call in law enforcement.

612
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:15,750
So in other words, it's not
just person relationships,

613
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:16,980
which are important.

614
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:19,610
But also having a plan in
place, so you're not scrambling

615
00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:20,910
when something happens.

616
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:23,506
And there's so many places
that don't have that still.

617
00:22:23,506 --> 00:22:25,950
It's amazing, so that that's important.

618
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:28,350
And law enforcement, and also
that relationship before,

619
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:31,223
I mean join things like
InfraGard and things like that.

620
00:22:31,223 --> 00:22:32,760
You know, just have that relationship,

621
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,500
so you're not just coming in cold.

622
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:38,700
On the idea of tabletops and
storytelling, two things.

623
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:42,180
One, I think kind of an unserved area is

624
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:44,070
at not the policy policy level,

625
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:46,440
but at the board level and
getting them to understand it.

626
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,085
And they're not gonna
understand the technology,

627
00:22:48,085 --> 00:22:50,930
but the side benefit of that
is getting the technical people

628
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:52,920
in a company like the CISO

629
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,570
to actually have some access to the board.

630
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:56,493
And so that thinking
about how you can do that

631
00:22:56,493 --> 00:22:58,410
in a good way, I think, is important.

632
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:00,389
And then, in all the tabletops I've done

633
00:23:00,389 --> 00:23:02,250
when I was in government and others,

634
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:04,920
the biggest mistake that I see made

635
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:07,274
all the time is breaking everything.

636
00:23:07,274 --> 00:23:09,660
So that you can't, it's
just hopeless, right?

637
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:12,720
So I remember all the
Cyber Storm exercises.

638
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,430
I remember when the government saying,

639
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:16,560
if I'm here for next year
Cyber Storm exercise,

640
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,393
please kill me.

641
00:23:17,393 --> 00:23:18,685
(audience and panelists laughing)

642
00:23:18,685 --> 00:23:20,483
Because every fricking year,

643
00:23:20,483 --> 00:23:22,980
the whoever designed
it wanted to be clever

644
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:23,813
and so broke everything.

645
00:23:23,813 --> 00:23:26,250
And so you don't learn anything
if everything is broken.

646
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:29,400
So focused exercise, I
think, are very important.

647
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,420
- Yeah, I a hundred percent agree.

648
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:32,940
And I, just to clarify,
don't wanna come off saying

649
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:34,410
that you shouldn't report
to law enforcement.

650
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:35,250
You absolutely should.

651
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:37,620
I'm, in my personal capacity,
very in favor of it.

652
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:40,357
It helps us, 'cause I do policy stuff too.

653
00:23:40,357 --> 00:23:43,950
It helps us get more data,
which helps us get more funding,

654
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:46,890
which helps us make more
nationwide decisions about stuff

655
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:48,330
like ransomware, ransomware threat actors.

656
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:50,250
So I do think that
contacting law enforcement...

657
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:51,083
I didn't mean to come off

658
00:23:51,083 --> 00:23:54,285
and say that you shouldn't
contact law enforcement, yeah.

659
00:23:54,285 --> 00:23:55,706
- [Audience Member] Counsel
wants us to tell people

660
00:23:55,706 --> 00:23:56,906
never call law enforcement.

661
00:23:56,906 --> 00:23:57,739
- Yeah, yeah.

662
00:23:57,739 --> 00:23:58,953
(audience member faintly speaking)

663
00:23:58,953 --> 00:24:01,050
Yeah, and the technical capacity thing,

664
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:02,160
I'll just say one thing really quick,

665
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,838
'cause I want more questions from people.

666
00:24:03,838 --> 00:24:07,140
I think that tabletops
are a really awesome

667
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:10,500
two to four hour way of
getting really good exposure

668
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:15,500
for your security teams,
getting executive support,

669
00:24:15,546 --> 00:24:18,863
teaching management, how
valuable the team is,

670
00:24:18,863 --> 00:24:21,780
helping them realize that
there is still maturity gaps,

671
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:23,580
even though the program is going well.

672
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:24,780
I think that's something that we try

673
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:26,760
and make sure that we highlight
the security team is doing

674
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:30,120
good things while still saying,
but they need more funding,

675
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,370
more resources, more people.

676
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:34,650
It's actually a very
quick way of being able

677
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:36,660
to get more exposure and more recognition.

678
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:38,010
And hopefully more buy in.

679
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:39,900
We often see after tabletop exercises

680
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:42,600
that executives will approve
another chunk of funding

681
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,910
for folks, because they
actually get to experience

682
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:46,370
what would be like if things went wrong

683
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:49,147
and don't want that to happen, so.

684
00:24:50,735 --> 00:24:52,460
- Excellent, I think we
see two people over here.

685
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:54,120
So you first and then you next.

686
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:54,953
Perfect.

687
00:24:54,953 --> 00:24:56,940
- [Audience Member] Well on the topic

688
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:59,451
of notifying law enforcement,

689
00:24:59,451 --> 00:25:02,550
we've got a rapidly changing

690
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:06,330
and shifting regulatory environment.

691
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:07,884
So to what extent is it important

692
00:25:07,884 --> 00:25:12,884
to work regulatory
compliance into the tabletop?

693
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,990
So you say that, all right,

694
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:18,878
we're coming up on a point at this hour,

695
00:25:18,878 --> 00:25:23,878
you must inform law
enforcement or relevant stock,

696
00:25:25,958 --> 00:25:27,840
that sort of thing.

697
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:31,141
So that these regulations
become forcing mechanisms

698
00:25:31,141 --> 00:25:33,003
on certain communications.

699
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:35,725
- Yes.

700
00:25:35,725 --> 00:25:37,694
(panelists and audience laughing)

701
00:25:37,694 --> 00:25:41,148
I mean, it's partially two things, right?

702
00:25:41,148 --> 00:25:44,040
The first is that because it's regulation,

703
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,810
you wanna make your war
game or your tabletop

704
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:46,890
as realistic as possible.

705
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:49,380
And so putting that in is not
only that forcing function

706
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:50,508
that the teams need.

707
00:25:50,508 --> 00:25:52,187
They might not even know.

708
00:25:52,187 --> 00:25:55,200
And so, it's always
fun to make that choice

709
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,760
of whether or not you wanna inform them

710
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,380
that this is the
parameter of the exercise.

711
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:02,763
And by the way, in 24
hours or at 23 hours,

712
00:26:02,763 --> 00:26:04,979
you can go in and go, by the way,

713
00:26:04,979 --> 00:26:08,502
have you thought about
your SEC obligations?

714
00:26:08,502 --> 00:26:09,660
(Winnona laughing)

715
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:12,388
And it's a choice that you
make when you're designing.

716
00:26:12,388 --> 00:26:14,510
But yeah, short answer, yes.

717
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:15,343
(Winnona laughing)

718
00:26:15,343 --> 00:26:17,070
- Yeah, there's an even easier way

719
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:20,760
to do that is what I like doing
is who's in charge of that?

720
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,290
Who's your data privacy officer?

721
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:23,613
Have you talked to them?

722
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:27,090
A lot of folks, at least recently,

723
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:29,610
I've asked about a breach
disclosure requirements

724
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:31,710
and someone a few weeks back was like,

725
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:33,060
well, it was an accident.

726
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:34,900
So we don't have to report to the breach.

727
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:35,733
(audience laughing)

728
00:26:35,733 --> 00:26:36,810
And I was like, oh my goodness.

729
00:26:36,810 --> 00:26:40,110
There really is a big
range of understanding,

730
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:41,850
both in management and technical folks

731
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,800
about what the implications
of losing data is.

732
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,633
That is the biggest,

733
00:26:44,633 --> 00:26:46,530
I know that there are lots of
cyber reporting requirements

734
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:48,090
that have sort of influx.

735
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:50,760
But even the state breach
reporting requirements have been

736
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:53,880
there for a while and many,
many states have them.

737
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,520
And so I'm asking who's
responsible for that,

738
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,540
and are they in the loop?

739
00:26:57,540 --> 00:27:00,000
And most often my answer is no.

740
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,610
And I write lots and lots

741
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:04,830
of recommendations about you need someone

742
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:07,110
who understands your
reporting requirements.

743
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:08,645
They need to be internal.

744
00:27:08,645 --> 00:27:09,930
A lot of folks are like,

745
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:12,990
yeah, well ask for
external counsel to do...

746
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:14,970
And I'm like, do you know
how long it's gonna take

747
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:16,440
for you to do that sort of thing?

748
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,660
Sometimes it takes months,

749
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:20,850
maybe even years for
really large organizations

750
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:22,120
that have lost a lot of data.

751
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:24,300
So I'm always checking to make sure

752
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:26,700
that they have an actual
resource with that knowledge.

753
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:28,560
Because I think maybe it's more useful

754
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,600
than me trying to track
every single requirement

755
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,160
and being like you're in
the state of New York.

756
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,450
And do you know that you have to report

757
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:34,950
to these entities
specifically in New York?

758
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:37,050
But I wanna make sure that they know that.

759
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,740
- Gentleman over here.

760
00:27:40,676 --> 00:27:42,090
You can use the microphone too.

761
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:44,910
- [Audience Member] I'll slide
in from the back bench here.

762
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:45,743
Hi.

763
00:27:45,743 --> 00:27:50,070
So to what extent do you think
we need to start modeling

764
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:54,925
cyber enabled long term
cognitive warfare campaigns

765
00:27:54,925 --> 00:27:58,297
that are being directed against
our social institutions?

766
00:27:58,297 --> 00:28:00,510
So that's something that, especially for

767
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:03,235
senior level national
security decision makers,

768
00:28:03,235 --> 00:28:08,235
they're very, very focused
on the in extremis sicker,

769
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:10,440
critical infrastructure attack

770
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,900
or financial institution attack.

771
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:15,145
But I don't think people are calculating

772
00:28:15,145 --> 00:28:18,450
in foreign adversaries using social media

773
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:20,940
over a long term to
create social disruption

774
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:23,100
and undermining institutions,

775
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:26,370
which create systemic problems.

776
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:28,080
Oh, thanks.

777
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:32,070
- So I love the vagueness of that question

778
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:35,250
in terms of long term information warfare,

779
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:36,933
combined with cyber, right?

780
00:28:39,267 --> 00:28:43,710
'Cause I'm headed into
cyber law at this point.

781
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:46,623
And so I'll give you the
lawyerly answer, and it depends.

782
00:28:46,623 --> 00:28:47,456
(Winnona laughing)

783
00:28:47,456 --> 00:28:51,150
But it depends on what
particular simulation

784
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:52,410
are you trying to emulate?

785
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:56,790
Are you trying to emulate a culmination

786
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:59,910
of a lot of internal
dissent that was fermented

787
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:01,680
by a foreign adversary over social media

788
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,780
in a long term campaign?

789
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:05,700
Are you looking at a shock and awe

790
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:08,400
in terms of here's a cyber enabled attack

791
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,560
that also comes with a follow on

792
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:14,190
of information, dissemination
that sows chaos?

793
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:16,380
And like I, personally,

794
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:19,200
from a threat intelligence perspective,

795
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,970
I think that the information domain,

796
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:23,730
as well as a cyber domain
are inextricably linked

797
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:25,200
and adversaries understand that.

798
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:29,940
That's why you see the IRA
alongside other Russian APTs

799
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:32,040
and it may not be entirely coordinated,

800
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,653
but having similar mission sets.

801
00:29:35,926 --> 00:29:39,630
And so I think that when you're
talking about the adversary,

802
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:42,600
when you're talking about
designing a war game

803
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,610
with a nation state level threat in mind,

804
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:46,080
you have to consider both.

805
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:50,730
However, that does depend
on your primary principle.

806
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:52,770
If you are designing a
war game specifically

807
00:29:52,770 --> 00:29:57,770
for just the technical boots
on the ground type IT defender,

808
00:29:58,260 --> 00:29:59,310
that's going to be outta the question.

809
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:02,070
If you're designing it
specifically for DOD policy,

810
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:05,210
someone a little bit
up the chain, then yes.

811
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:07,320
Because information space,

812
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:10,650
as well as cyberspace are
pretty (indistinct) linked.

813
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:13,560
The only caveat I would
say to that is it depends

814
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:16,800
on which adversary you
are trying to emulate.

815
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:19,980
Because while Russia
and China may understand

816
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:24,390
that they call it informationization,

817
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:29,223
intelligentization is the
new Chinese translation word.

818
00:30:31,147 --> 00:30:34,320
It's going to be different
if you're emulating an actor

819
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,390
from Iran, or an actor from North Korea,

820
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:38,009
or an actor from Vietnam.

821
00:30:38,009 --> 00:30:38,842
(Winnona laughing)

822
00:30:38,842 --> 00:30:40,860
So I think it depends on the principle,

823
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:43,260
it depends what area they're
particularly interested in,

824
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:47,250
and it depends on how long term

825
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:49,200
of a war game you're looking at.

826
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,420
- Yeah, and I defer to
Winnona on this one,

827
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:53,396
'cause she's the expert here on APTs.

828
00:30:53,396 --> 00:30:55,377
I'm not sure that the tabletops

829
00:30:55,377 --> 00:30:58,770
and war games are as well suited
to those sort of long term,

830
00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:00,120
more vague scenarios.

831
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,470
'Cause I think it's really important

832
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:03,960
that they're very targeted,

833
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,750
and they have takeaways
at the end of them.

834
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:09,030
And I think the more
vague the scenario gets

835
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:10,800
and when it gets to be on that scale,

836
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:13,562
you know, information
warfare on a national level,

837
00:31:13,562 --> 00:31:15,750
it's hard to walk away from that,

838
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:18,097
knowing what to do to fix it.

839
00:31:18,097 --> 00:31:21,270
And I don't want folks to sit
in the room for five hours

840
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:23,580
and say, well, that was
interesting, and then go home.

841
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:25,969
I want them to say, I know
what we need to do differently.

842
00:31:25,969 --> 00:31:27,930
And that's why I think they're so useful

843
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:31,290
for things like ransomware,
for even espionage campaigns,

844
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:32,694
data loss sort of campaigns,

845
00:31:32,694 --> 00:31:34,980
because you can walk
away with them and say,

846
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:36,420
I know what I need to fix.

847
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:38,370
I know what we need to
do better next time.

848
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:40,350
So not that they can't be done,

849
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:41,880
but I'm not sure that they're as suited

850
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,413
to those sorts of scenarios.

851
00:31:44,374 --> 00:31:45,780
- If I can-

852
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:46,689
Do you wanna jump in?

853
00:31:46,689 --> 00:31:48,170
Please.

854
00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:51,073
Okay, I'm just gonna add a
boring think tank perspective

855
00:31:51,073 --> 00:31:54,901
just because one, we can
make a cyber scenario,

856
00:31:54,901 --> 00:31:59,100
but our colleagues who handle
information programming

857
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:03,780
can really, really dig into
how is information manipulated

858
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:06,321
and used to achieve broader
geo-strategic goals?

859
00:32:06,321 --> 00:32:09,030
I think part of our job is making sure

860
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:10,950
that we are putting our heads
together with our colleagues

861
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:12,570
to make sure that we
are developing scenarios

862
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:14,460
that do examine those stickier issues

863
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:16,710
that we don't quite understand just yet.

864
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:18,180
That way we can create more challenging,

865
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:19,830
high quality scenarios that are beneficial

866
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:20,850
for our funds and government.

867
00:32:20,850 --> 00:32:22,353
The other part of that is that, one,

868
00:32:22,353 --> 00:32:23,670
that we make a scenario.

869
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:24,930
Students respond to it;

870
00:32:24,930 --> 00:32:27,180
folks from government
and industry or judges.

871
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:29,220
But after the fact, it's kind of our job

872
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:30,930
to make sure that we pull that scenario

873
00:32:30,930 --> 00:32:32,880
and the recommendations into a playbook,

874
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,695
and make that available to folks.

875
00:32:34,695 --> 00:32:37,140
Our goal really is to be
able to pass that on to folks

876
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:38,160
in government and industry,

877
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,170
and have them take that and
pass it along to somebody

878
00:32:40,170 --> 00:32:42,960
in their organization who
can run it internally,

879
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,190
and take some notes on,

880
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:46,170
this is how it rolled out in a scenario,

881
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:47,520
which was obviously fictional.

882
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:49,260
But how would we actually respond to this

883
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:51,369
if this were to happen tomorrow?

884
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:53,447
- Safa, I have a question.

885
00:32:53,447 --> 00:32:55,836
You have all, I think
everyone raised their hand

886
00:32:55,836 --> 00:32:58,590
when we asked who's been in a war game

887
00:32:58,590 --> 00:32:59,970
or in a tabletop exercise.

888
00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:03,540
Has anyone hated, does
anyone dislike them?

889
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:05,100
Have you been in a bad exercise

890
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,887
and what went wrong with that?

891
00:33:06,887 --> 00:33:08,970
'Cause I think a lot of folks hate them.

892
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:11,910
Insurance requires them these
days for a lot of companies.

893
00:33:11,910 --> 00:33:13,950
I'm curious if anyone
has had a bad experience

894
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:16,050
and what you think contributed to that.

895
00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:16,883
Yeah?

896
00:33:16,883 --> 00:33:18,740
- [Audience Member] It was
a budget tabletop exercise.

897
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:19,949
(panelists and audience laughing)

898
00:33:19,949 --> 00:33:21,019
- What does that mean?

899
00:33:21,019 --> 00:33:23,070
- [Audience Member] It
was trying to figure out

900
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:27,690
how US government would route
funding in a given situation

901
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:29,610
based on international trends.

902
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:30,810
It was delightful.

903
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:31,643
- So it was-

904
00:33:31,643 --> 00:33:33,360
- You mean like a tabletop
related to budget,

905
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,362
not a very cheaply made tabletop exercise?

906
00:33:35,362 --> 00:33:36,450
(panelists and audience laughing)

907
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:37,710
- [Audience Member] It
was not a poor man's,

908
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:39,390
poor person's tabletop.

909
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:40,223
No, no, no.

910
00:33:40,223 --> 00:33:42,450
It was very, a lot of high
level government people there.

911
00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:43,885
No, but it was focused on budgeting.

912
00:33:43,885 --> 00:33:44,718
- Okay.

913
00:33:44,718 --> 00:33:45,797
(panelists and audience laughing)

914
00:33:45,797 --> 00:33:46,817
Never heard of that before.

915
00:33:46,817 --> 00:33:49,803
- [Audience Member] I
haven't had a tabletop

916
00:33:49,803 --> 00:33:51,889
that I didn't enjoy doing.

917
00:33:51,889 --> 00:33:53,239
But working with clients,

918
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:54,978
the worst ones that I've had

919
00:33:54,978 --> 00:33:57,441
are where the client was very immature,

920
00:33:57,441 --> 00:33:59,819
maybe had never done a tabletop before.

921
00:33:59,819 --> 00:34:03,291
And they really wanted
to get fancy in some way,

922
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:05,370
and they weren't ready for it.

923
00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:06,360
Because they're still at the point

924
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:09,960
where they don't know who
to call to make a decision,

925
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,619
or to get information, or whatever.

926
00:34:11,619 --> 00:34:14,147
And if they're in a situation like that,

927
00:34:14,147 --> 00:34:16,830
and they're worried
about a nation state act,

928
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:19,847
or doing some sort of supply
chain attack or whatever,

929
00:34:19,847 --> 00:34:20,940
well, if that happens,

930
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:22,290
you're just gonna get run over, right?

931
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:24,450
Because you're no way prepared for that.

932
00:34:24,450 --> 00:34:25,710
And it would be much better

933
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:28,260
to just deal with a basic data breach

934
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:29,641
or a basic ransomware scenario.

935
00:34:29,641 --> 00:34:31,379
And once they've figured that out,

936
00:34:31,379 --> 00:34:34,350
and they actually know their own processes

937
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:35,730
and kind of iron things out,

938
00:34:35,730 --> 00:34:38,070
then they can start to think bigger

939
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:40,260
if it's relevant to them.

940
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:43,128
- Yeah, I'd love to hear both
of your opinions on this.

941
00:34:43,128 --> 00:34:44,943
But oh, sorry, go ahead, go ahead.

942
00:34:46,868 --> 00:34:48,510
- Use the mic if you don't mind.

943
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:50,252
- Yeah, so that the-
- Just so-

944
00:34:50,252 --> 00:34:52,258
- [Moderator] (faintly speaking)
the stream can hear you.

945
00:34:52,258 --> 00:34:53,091
And also-

946
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:55,606
- [Audience Member] So for...

947
00:34:55,606 --> 00:34:59,125
I helped run about 10 exercises

948
00:34:59,125 --> 00:35:04,125
and invariably, what would
happen is we'd have 20

949
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:05,730
to 50 people in the room.

950
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:07,620
These were multi-day events,

951
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:09,690
and they were told they had to be there.

952
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:11,610
This was for the DOD.

953
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:14,550
And invariably, when they show up

954
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:16,353
on the first day, it's this.

955
00:35:16,353 --> 00:35:19,988
(panelists and audience laughing)

956
00:35:19,988 --> 00:35:22,590
But by the end of the first day,

957
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:25,020
everyone's leaning forward,
elbows on the table,

958
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:26,640
they're all interacting.

959
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,710
And they were surprised.

960
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:32,121
This was the first tabletop
like this for anyone,

961
00:35:32,121 --> 00:35:34,347
even us in putting them on.

962
00:35:34,347 --> 00:35:35,820
But they were all surprised

963
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:38,280
at the value they got out of the exercise,

964
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:41,340
because it wasn't what they were used to

965
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:43,885
from a security type assessment.

966
00:35:43,885 --> 00:35:45,540
Yeah.

967
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:47,442
- And I see we got a question over here.

968
00:35:47,442 --> 00:35:50,477
- [Audience Member] Kinda
adding on that is the one

969
00:35:50,477 --> 00:35:53,010
that I worked on that
I really did not like,

970
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:56,280
was the element of they
knew that they were weak

971
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,690
in a very certain element.

972
00:35:57,690 --> 00:36:01,350
So they tried to put that
as outside of the rules

973
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:02,183
of engagement.

974
00:36:02,183 --> 00:36:03,930
It was like, but this
is the reason for it.

975
00:36:03,930 --> 00:36:05,612
And then it was the same element of,

976
00:36:05,612 --> 00:36:07,980
well, I don't want me to look bad

977
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:09,330
'cause I allowed this to happen.

978
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:13,260
So it's getting the
individuals that are in charge

979
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:16,680
to accept, hey, allow us to exploit

980
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:19,560
what we've already told you or
what you've already noticed.

981
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,068
Because if you notice it,

982
00:36:21,068 --> 00:36:25,023
then that means it was noticed
way before you noticed it.

983
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:28,800
So it's just that line where also,

984
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,480
you said you don't want to freak them out

985
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,130
to the point where they don't wanna do it.

986
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:34,980
Because they're like
fine, we'll just give up.

987
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:36,420
- I wanna lean into this a little bit

988
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:38,370
because this raises a really
interesting thing for us,

989
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:40,410
I think, to dig into is what do you do

990
00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:42,720
with an immature client
or an immature player?

991
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,730
And I wanna lean in on the player piece

992
00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:46,980
because like a war game,
or a simulation, or a TTX,

993
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:48,810
we're all players.

994
00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:50,100
I think we've seen this with students

995
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:54,393
where if they're an immature
player, they tend to,

996
00:36:54,393 --> 00:36:57,750
the knee jerk reaction is
like, it's Russia or China.

997
00:36:57,750 --> 00:36:59,740
The other thing that we see is sanctions.

998
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:02,520
The last thing that we
see is we want students

999
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,990
to come up with creative solutions,

1000
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:06,810
whether they be technical
or policy centric.

1001
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:08,370
We want them to be creative.

1002
00:37:08,370 --> 00:37:10,200
We want them to think outside the box.

1003
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,317
This is a tabletop exercise.

1004
00:37:11,317 --> 00:37:14,190
You know, you can lose,
but at the same time,

1005
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:15,390
losing is taking no action.

1006
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:17,880
So shoot your shot.

1007
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:20,910
Some students think
creativity equals escalation,

1008
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:23,820
which gets really
uncomfortable, really fast.

1009
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:26,670
You'd be surprised, the
military academies tend

1010
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:30,270
to not be as escalatory
as the civilian schools.

1011
00:37:30,270 --> 00:37:31,470
Some students will think that, you know,

1012
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:34,320
let's do a military operation
in this particular place

1013
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:37,560
because we wanna demonstrate
that we care about this thing

1014
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,393
and we're watching.

1015
00:37:38,393 --> 00:37:40,170
But it's like, is that actually, like sir,

1016
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:41,688
the lights are still off.

1017
00:37:41,688 --> 00:37:44,790
Please, actually respond
to the crisis at hand.

1018
00:37:44,790 --> 00:37:46,440
But would love to hear
from folks around the room.

1019
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,970
What do you do with an immature player?

1020
00:37:47,970 --> 00:37:51,330
How do you get them to
reevaluate their standing

1021
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:52,163
in the game?

1022
00:37:52,163 --> 00:37:55,520
- [Audience Member] Can
you define immature player?

1023
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,803
- Sorry, what was that?

1024
00:37:56,803 --> 00:37:59,183
- [Audience Member] Can
you define immature player?

1025
00:37:59,183 --> 00:38:00,510
- I guess an immature player,

1026
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:02,700
I guess the way I see it
is someone who is, one,

1027
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:05,850
maybe not familiar with
engaging in a tabletop,

1028
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:07,890
but at the same time, maybe not familiar

1029
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:09,870
or does not have a really strong grasp

1030
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:10,860
of what are they working with?

1031
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:12,060
What are the tools in their toolbox

1032
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:13,361
that is available at their disposal?

1033
00:38:13,361 --> 00:38:15,450
But I see that you leaned
into the microphone,

1034
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:16,413
please jump in.

1035
00:38:17,347 --> 00:38:18,540
- [Audience Member] So
to answer your question

1036
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:20,944
and also a follow up question to that,

1037
00:38:20,944 --> 00:38:24,180
in regards to immature organizations going

1038
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:27,000
through the exercise, one of the things

1039
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,340
that I found is very helpful
is taking a step back

1040
00:38:31,722 --> 00:38:35,520
and preparing, going
through the prep exercises

1041
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,690
before the TTX.

1042
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:41,690
So for example, examining and
developing the IR workflow,

1043
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:44,700
and looking at playbooks, and so on.

1044
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:49,635
So that there's some
sort of guiding standards

1045
00:38:49,635 --> 00:38:52,536
or guidelines and something
that they can refer back to

1046
00:38:52,536 --> 00:38:56,475
that's helpful to make
them not feel as fearful

1047
00:38:56,475 --> 00:38:58,883
or as intimidated by the exercise.

1048
00:38:58,883 --> 00:39:01,083
But I'd also like to hear your feedback

1049
00:39:01,083 --> 00:39:03,915
on what you think about, you know,

1050
00:39:03,915 --> 00:39:08,707
you have a client who's
requesting a war game or a TTX,

1051
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:11,550
and taking that step back and saying,

1052
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:14,787
why don't you look at
the preparatory exercises

1053
00:39:14,787 --> 00:39:16,230
before you get to that

1054
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:19,380
in order to increase the
effectiveness of a tabletop?

1055
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:20,930
What are your thoughts on that?

1056
00:39:22,962 --> 00:39:24,150
- Oh, okay.

1057
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:26,904
I don't know if I have a lot
of thoughts on that, actually.

1058
00:39:26,904 --> 00:39:29,190
I don't mind running tabletops with folks

1059
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:30,263
who've never done it before.

1060
00:39:30,263 --> 00:39:31,297
I think they learn a lot.

1061
00:39:31,297 --> 00:39:32,820
I think in particular,

1062
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:35,250
immature players like Safa was saying,

1063
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:38,253
vastly overestimate how good
they're going to be at it.

1064
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:42,360
That's like Sue was saying
that people wanna get fancy

1065
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:44,370
with it 'cause they think
they're gonna just do so well

1066
00:39:44,370 --> 00:39:45,907
that it's not gonna be useful to them.

1067
00:39:45,907 --> 00:39:47,340
And even folks who have done it

1068
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:50,310
a few times still have things to work on.

1069
00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:51,990
And they're mostly boring things,

1070
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:54,120
like folks will have these
incident response plans

1071
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,860
that are 180 pages long.

1072
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:56,693
They don't open them once.

1073
00:39:56,693 --> 00:39:58,323
They're totally useless to them.

1074
00:39:58,323 --> 00:40:00,000
It's very sad.

1075
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,010
But it's the really boring things

1076
00:40:02,010 --> 00:40:03,600
about not using your processes,

1077
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,070
not having any processes in place,

1078
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:06,785
not relying on your documentation,

1079
00:40:06,785 --> 00:40:10,101
not having communications, like
out of bound communications

1080
00:40:10,101 --> 00:40:12,861
in case your communications
are compromised.

1081
00:40:12,861 --> 00:40:15,510
It's sort of the same
things over and over again.

1082
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:18,000
And so mature players, immature players,

1083
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,030
everyone sort of overestimates
how good they're gonna be

1084
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:23,910
at it, but you can run a very
simple ransom or exercise.

1085
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:25,320
And if you ask the right questions,

1086
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:27,240
you'll still be able to find some gaps

1087
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:29,190
in the response there.

1088
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:30,780
I saw two hands up.

1089
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:32,783
- Well, I don't think we've
heard from you before.

1090
00:40:32,783 --> 00:40:34,380
- [Audience Member] So what I usually do

1091
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:39,380
with my immature players
is I start by asking for...

1092
00:40:40,590 --> 00:40:43,133
Well, during the scoping
of the entire thing,

1093
00:40:43,133 --> 00:40:46,110
I start going through all
their policies and procedures.

1094
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,806
And I'm not asking for them for me.

1095
00:40:47,806 --> 00:40:50,790
I'm just asking to see they have them.

1096
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:54,360
And with one of my most immature players,

1097
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,820
I actually just told 'em to step back

1098
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:58,980
from the tabletop completely.

1099
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:01,170
We switched the entire thing to,

1100
00:41:01,170 --> 00:41:03,072
we're gonna do micro exercises.

1101
00:41:03,072 --> 00:41:07,284
So that way we can go through
each of your policies first,

1102
00:41:07,284 --> 00:41:11,220
and then we're gonna go through
a larger tabletop exercise.

1103
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:14,610
Because I found that
they had gaps everywhere,

1104
00:41:14,610 --> 00:41:16,710
from communications to governance,

1105
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:20,664
to even just the technical
incident response team.

1106
00:41:20,664 --> 00:41:22,560
Everyone had gaps.

1107
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,908
So kind of like we do
with technical teams,

1108
00:41:24,908 --> 00:41:27,796
'cause this was supposed to
be a management exercise.

1109
00:41:27,796 --> 00:41:29,980
And we took it down into technical pieces,

1110
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:33,090
but technical at the
different policy levels

1111
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:34,290
to tear through different policies.

1112
00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:35,580
That's how we did it.

1113
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:36,540
- That's a really good point.

1114
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:37,877
I think there are things you can do

1115
00:41:37,877 --> 00:41:39,510
with a really immature client

1116
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:41,310
to sort hand hold them through it.

1117
00:41:41,310 --> 00:41:42,870
You can also run, we've done this before,

1118
00:41:42,870 --> 00:41:45,419
like tabletop exercises
that are more educational.

1119
00:41:45,419 --> 00:41:47,988
You bring them, you say,
here's a ransom note.

1120
00:41:47,988 --> 00:41:51,840
What happens now is that
you'll need to engage

1121
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,220
your ransomware negotiator.

1122
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:54,250
'Cause you don't wanna
be talking to this...

1123
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:57,510
We'll sort of teach them as we're going,

1124
00:41:57,510 --> 00:41:58,980
what they need to be thinking about

1125
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:00,360
versus expecting them to know it.

1126
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,377
Because we know that they don't know it,

1127
00:42:01,377 --> 00:42:03,360
and we don't want an empty, quiet room.

1128
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,830
- I think we have two fingers here

1129
00:42:04,830 --> 00:42:06,510
and then a comment over here.

1130
00:42:06,510 --> 00:42:08,490
- [Audience Member] Yeah, just
a quick follow up for that.

1131
00:42:08,490 --> 00:42:11,366
So we're talking about organizations

1132
00:42:11,366 --> 00:42:13,380
at a level of immaturity.

1133
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:15,660
So when we take a look broadly

1134
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:17,310
at a capability maturity model,

1135
00:42:17,310 --> 00:42:19,612
okay, if you're at a certain phase,

1136
00:42:19,612 --> 00:42:23,040
what organizational pieces
do you need to put in place

1137
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:26,579
as the building blocks to get
you to a more mature state?

1138
00:42:26,579 --> 00:42:29,430
And I don't think we have
that on a spectrum yet,

1139
00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:32,518
where we can kind of say,
okay, based on this exercise,

1140
00:42:32,518 --> 00:42:36,240
you're at this level of
maturity based on X, Y, and Z.

1141
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:39,750
Before the next exercise,
we need you to improve

1142
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:43,650
in X, Y, and Z to get to that
level two or that level three.

1143
00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:48,390
So an organization understands
throughout the organization,

1144
00:42:48,390 --> 00:42:51,240
what pieces need to be
worked on by which levels

1145
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:53,828
of the organization to
improve their capabilities,

1146
00:42:53,828 --> 00:42:56,400
to defend against these cyber threats.

1147
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:00,570
So I think it's really kind of
vertical going all the way up

1148
00:43:00,570 --> 00:43:04,230
to the board, because they're
on the hook for it also.

1149
00:43:04,230 --> 00:43:07,350
But once we get that
maturity model in this space,

1150
00:43:07,350 --> 00:43:10,020
I think that's a good guiding measurement.

1151
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:13,500
So I think that's another kind
of more enterprise takeaway.

1152
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:14,700
How do we measure maturity?

1153
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:17,280
Because you can't manage
it if you can't measure it,

1154
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:18,113
so that's...

1155
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:22,620
- And I think, if we can
get this gentleman over here

1156
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:23,880
and then we'll have your comment.

1157
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:25,263
So please.

1158
00:43:27,302 --> 00:43:30,300
- [Audience Member] To just
address a couple things,

1159
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:31,800
first of all, the one lady was talking

1160
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:33,690
about setting it up early

1161
00:43:33,690 --> 00:43:37,020
and kind of giving them some pre-advice.

1162
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:40,470
When it's a first time for a client,

1163
00:43:40,470 --> 00:43:42,690
I found that works extremely well.

1164
00:43:42,690 --> 00:43:44,160
'Cause they don't even know how to play.

1165
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:47,520
And you can put all the
documentation out there,

1166
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,530
but walk 'em through the basics.

1167
00:43:49,530 --> 00:43:54,530
And I also agree, if they do
not have any sort of IR plan,

1168
00:43:55,950 --> 00:43:57,480
have some pre-sessions.

1169
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:59,324
Help them at least create a straw man,

1170
00:43:59,324 --> 00:44:03,180
because what you're gonna
do is in many cases,

1171
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:05,092
you've got leadership in these calls,

1172
00:44:05,092 --> 00:44:06,900
along with the people that are supposed

1173
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:08,573
to be managing the incident.

1174
00:44:08,573 --> 00:44:12,420
And you really don't want
to put them in the position

1175
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:14,781
of looking extremely bad in
front of their leadership.

1176
00:44:14,781 --> 00:44:16,871
Or if you're doing it at the higher levels

1177
00:44:16,871 --> 00:44:20,610
where you've got directors
that are being watched over

1178
00:44:20,610 --> 00:44:23,730
by board members or executive officers,

1179
00:44:23,730 --> 00:44:25,170
and you don't wanna put 'em in that level.

1180
00:44:25,170 --> 00:44:27,270
You wanna kind of help them be successful.

1181
00:44:27,270 --> 00:44:30,900
The goal of, for me, the
goal of these is to learn,

1182
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:33,720
identify gaps, takeaways.

1183
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:35,540
You've all spoke to takeaways.

1184
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:37,410
If you walk out of one and you're like,

1185
00:44:37,410 --> 00:44:38,940
oh yeah, we did great.

1186
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:40,530
It wasn't scoped right.

1187
00:44:40,530 --> 00:44:41,363
Bottom line.

1188
00:44:41,363 --> 00:44:42,196
The scenario wasn't right,

1189
00:44:42,196 --> 00:44:43,530
and it wasn't scoped right.

1190
00:44:43,530 --> 00:44:46,530
Because the idea is to
find something to work on.

1191
00:44:46,530 --> 00:44:47,850
'Cause none of us are perfect.

1192
00:44:47,850 --> 00:44:50,250
Believe me, we've all
been in real incidents,

1193
00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:51,149
and we know that.

1194
00:44:51,149 --> 00:44:55,770
The other thing, I forget
who was talking about it.

1195
00:44:55,770 --> 00:44:59,040
We were talking about the
level of the incidents

1196
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:01,590
and who all's involved.

1197
00:45:01,590 --> 00:45:04,740
And so if you're starting with someone

1198
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:08,310
that's never done this before,
you start at the high levels,

1199
00:45:08,310 --> 00:45:09,810
you work through process stuff.

1200
00:45:09,810 --> 00:45:11,340
Don't go deeply technical.

1201
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:14,010
The scenario should have
technical aspect to it,

1202
00:45:14,010 --> 00:45:15,360
and it should be relevant.

1203
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:17,821
But that shouldn't be the key
focus when you don't even know

1204
00:45:17,821 --> 00:45:19,980
who to call, and what to do,

1205
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:22,053
and when to engage law enforcement.

1206
00:45:23,130 --> 00:45:26,460
My quick comment there is
get your legal involved

1207
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:28,410
before you call law enforcement.

1208
00:45:28,410 --> 00:45:30,683
That has to be a decision made by legal.

1209
00:45:30,683 --> 00:45:33,120
And if it's not in your
playbook to do it that way,

1210
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:34,830
you need to change your playbooks.

1211
00:45:34,830 --> 00:45:36,349
'Cause you need your legal involved.

1212
00:45:36,349 --> 00:45:38,837
Also data privacy, it should be involved

1213
00:45:38,837 --> 00:45:42,413
at step one throughout
your entire IR process.

1214
00:45:42,413 --> 00:45:44,565
And they should be
involved in your tabletops,

1215
00:45:44,565 --> 00:45:46,560
because they're gonna make decisions,

1216
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:47,550
and they're gonna give guidance

1217
00:45:47,550 --> 00:45:50,670
that's very important to actions you take.

1218
00:45:50,670 --> 00:45:52,590
Another quick thing, sorry.

1219
00:45:52,590 --> 00:45:55,308
But I've sat here for a long
time and not said a thing.

1220
00:45:55,308 --> 00:45:57,554
(panelists and audience laughing)

1221
00:45:57,554 --> 00:46:00,165
So I have done a lot of these

1222
00:46:00,165 --> 00:46:03,030
with a wide variety of clients.

1223
00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:05,130
And what I've found is that as you start

1224
00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:08,460
and then you start having
subsequent engagements,

1225
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:10,710
build a roadmap for that client,

1226
00:46:10,710 --> 00:46:12,969
let them understand at the
beginning at the very first one,

1227
00:46:12,969 --> 00:46:15,180
this one's gonna be relatively high level.

1228
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:16,509
It's not gonna be deeply technical.

1229
00:46:16,509 --> 00:46:18,780
We're gonna get the right
policy people involved,

1230
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:20,426
maybe some leadership involved.

1231
00:46:20,426 --> 00:46:22,660
Then as you progress,

1232
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:27,090
you can have many table tops
that are highly technical,

1233
00:46:27,090 --> 00:46:29,160
that are focused on a specific environment

1234
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:32,250
or focused solely on your
sock and their response.

1235
00:46:32,250 --> 00:46:35,276
And then you can build that
out into bigger ones later

1236
00:46:35,276 --> 00:46:37,500
where you can actually split it into

1237
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:39,960
where you've got leadership
in one room on a call;

1238
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:41,280
if it's physical, they're in a room,

1239
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:42,307
if not, they're on a call.

1240
00:46:42,307 --> 00:46:43,925
You've got technical on another

1241
00:46:43,925 --> 00:46:46,680
and now, you're managing
the way, typically,

1242
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:48,740
most organizations are
gonna manage it in real life

1243
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:51,643
where you've got multiple
different party engagements.

1244
00:46:51,643 --> 00:46:55,406
And they're not always
sitting on every room,

1245
00:46:55,406 --> 00:46:57,780
but you don't do that step one.

1246
00:46:57,780 --> 00:46:59,053
That's a roadmap.

1247
00:46:59,053 --> 00:47:00,780
That one gentleman who was talking

1248
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:03,535
about capability maturity,
and I totally agree with that.

1249
00:47:03,535 --> 00:47:06,900
And I don't know that there's
a model out there for it,

1250
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:10,020
but I will tell you the
clients that do this year

1251
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:12,480
after year, after year, twice a year,

1252
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:13,530
three or four times a year,

1253
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:15,330
they have mini engagements.

1254
00:47:15,330 --> 00:47:17,779
They're far more mature
in their incident response

1255
00:47:17,779 --> 00:47:20,010
than the ones that say
we're just gonna do it

1256
00:47:20,010 --> 00:47:23,040
to tick a check box, just to check a box.

1257
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:24,510
Just anyway, that was a lot.

1258
00:47:24,510 --> 00:47:25,343
I'm sorry.

1259
00:47:25,343 --> 00:47:26,691
- So you should be on this panel.

1260
00:47:26,691 --> 00:47:28,143
- That was great.

1261
00:47:29,073 --> 00:47:31,293
- Down there, you're gonna be next.

1262
00:47:31,293 --> 00:47:34,020
- [Audience Member] What
we did was transparency.

1263
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:36,521
We made sure that the participants

1264
00:47:36,521 --> 00:47:40,530
who were coming had the
opportunity to understand

1265
00:47:40,530 --> 00:47:42,480
what was going to happen
before they got there.

1266
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,610
And then we had the luxury of time,

1267
00:47:44,610 --> 00:47:46,194
because these were multi-day events.

1268
00:47:46,194 --> 00:47:49,283
So we'd spend the first
half day walking them

1269
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:50,970
through the process.

1270
00:47:50,970 --> 00:47:52,260
This is the process we use.

1271
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:53,940
This is what we're going to be doing.

1272
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:57,903
After we found, we said,
these are your threat actors.

1273
00:48:00,192 --> 00:48:03,830
And we did research open...

1274
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:07,250
We did research on the
systems we were attacking.

1275
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:11,880
Basically, the theory
was if it's unclassified,

1276
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:14,100
it's available to the attacker.

1277
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:17,550
And we would use that to come
up with the attack scenarios,

1278
00:48:17,550 --> 00:48:18,660
and we would tell them beforehand,

1279
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:21,120
these are the attack scenarios
we're going to be using.

1280
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:23,283
And this is how we're
going to determine risk

1281
00:48:23,283 --> 00:48:25,853
when we walked them
through the entire process,

1282
00:48:25,853 --> 00:48:28,860
all of this before lunch the first day.

1283
00:48:28,860 --> 00:48:31,920
And then when we got back from lunch,

1284
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:33,770
we'd go ahead and start on scenarios.

1285
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:36,053
- Thank you.

1286
00:48:36,053 --> 00:48:36,886
And I think we had the
gentleman over here,

1287
00:48:36,886 --> 00:48:37,719
if you could use the microphone,

1288
00:48:37,719 --> 00:48:40,710
and then pass it to this man
over here or to the right,

1289
00:48:40,710 --> 00:48:41,708
and then to the left.

1290
00:48:41,708 --> 00:48:44,375
(Safa laughing)

1291
00:48:45,806 --> 00:48:48,060
- [Audience Member] Hi.

1292
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:53,060
I had been involved recently
with a multi-agency tabletop,

1293
00:48:53,850 --> 00:48:56,070
and it's a fairly mature organization.

1294
00:48:56,070 --> 00:48:59,100
But it was a well scoped scenario

1295
00:48:59,100 --> 00:49:02,310
because it made all of
senior management realize

1296
00:49:02,310 --> 00:49:03,780
that they hadn't actually read

1297
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:05,910
those incident response plans.

1298
00:49:05,910 --> 00:49:07,890
And they sort of didn't know who to call.

1299
00:49:07,890 --> 00:49:10,620
And it was a little bit embarrassing,

1300
00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:13,590
and they felt a little bit
like the Keystone Cops.

1301
00:49:13,590 --> 00:49:14,910
So the point of this

1302
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:18,960
is that the important tabletop
exercise is the next one.

1303
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:22,350
Because I mean, like I said,
it was a mature organization

1304
00:49:22,350 --> 00:49:24,254
and I've seen a whole
lot more collaboration

1305
00:49:24,254 --> 00:49:25,750
between these organizations,

1306
00:49:25,750 --> 00:49:27,990
not just to prepare for incidents,

1307
00:49:27,990 --> 00:49:30,678
but they realized the
skills that each other had.

1308
00:49:30,678 --> 00:49:33,630
And now they're working
together in other ways,

1309
00:49:33,630 --> 00:49:35,940
not just for incident response.

1310
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:40,110
Second comment, we have
used in our technical TTXs,

1311
00:49:40,110 --> 00:49:43,410
we use a Dungeons and
Dragons type card game

1312
00:49:43,410 --> 00:49:45,213
called Back Doors and Breaches.

1313
00:49:48,475 --> 00:49:52,020
So there's gotta be a way
to put policy into that

1314
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:54,090
and we get so much engagement from that.

1315
00:49:54,090 --> 00:49:55,110
It's awesome.

1316
00:49:55,110 --> 00:49:57,630
- If I can add one thing on the D&D,

1317
00:49:57,630 --> 00:50:00,330
my team actually really
creatively put together

1318
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:04,410
a D&D style game where
folks navigate an incident

1319
00:50:04,410 --> 00:50:06,360
and are trying to pull the
information out little by little.

1320
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:08,400
But it was really, really exciting.

1321
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:10,934
But if you wouldn't mind
passing the microphone

1322
00:50:10,934 --> 00:50:12,017
to your left.

1323
00:50:13,311 --> 00:50:16,715
- How many people here
played Dungeons and Dragons?

1324
00:50:16,715 --> 00:50:18,420
Incredible!

1325
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:19,598
I knew there was an overlap.

1326
00:50:19,598 --> 00:50:20,431
(Winnona laughing)

1327
00:50:20,431 --> 00:50:21,350
- Half the room, yeah.

1328
00:50:22,210 --> 00:50:23,970
- [Audience Member] I just wanted

1329
00:50:23,970 --> 00:50:26,040
to give a kind of a free recommendation.

1330
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:28,320
'Cause I know we were talking
about immature players,

1331
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:29,883
and I think for a lot of organizations

1332
00:50:29,883 --> 00:50:31,320
that are just kind of getting started,

1333
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:32,670
don't have a lot of internal resources,

1334
00:50:32,670 --> 00:50:34,230
like an internal data privacy officer

1335
00:50:34,230 --> 00:50:36,575
or experienced legal counsel on inside.

1336
00:50:36,575 --> 00:50:38,366
It's been mentioned before,

1337
00:50:38,366 --> 00:50:40,020
but I just kinda wanna
flip stomp of the room

1338
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:42,750
that you should work with
your insurance carrier.

1339
00:50:42,750 --> 00:50:46,950
Your insurance carrier has
a board of outside council

1340
00:50:46,950 --> 00:50:47,783
that you should tap.

1341
00:50:47,783 --> 00:50:49,981
And I think everyone's very
familiar with vendor assessments

1342
00:50:49,981 --> 00:50:52,080
for their technical vendors.

1343
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:53,730
I think something that's
kind of overlooked

1344
00:50:53,730 --> 00:50:55,980
for new players is vendor assessments

1345
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:57,300
for your outside council.

1346
00:50:57,300 --> 00:50:58,680
If you really do wanna get prepared

1347
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:00,930
for dealing with a large scale breach

1348
00:51:00,930 --> 00:51:03,587
and your plan is just to
reach out to outside council,

1349
00:51:03,587 --> 00:51:05,880
I've seen so many clients that are like,

1350
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:07,170
yeah, we'll reach out to outside council,

1351
00:51:07,170 --> 00:51:08,267
and they time it right.

1352
00:51:08,267 --> 00:51:10,590
They give a right
threshold for reaching out,

1353
00:51:10,590 --> 00:51:11,730
but they don't know who.

1354
00:51:11,730 --> 00:51:13,050
But on the other hand, they'll know,

1355
00:51:13,050 --> 00:51:15,450
oh, if we need to negotiate,
we'll tap Covewear.

1356
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:17,880
Why do you know that you
need to tap Covewear,

1357
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:20,190
but you don't know who
your outside council is?

1358
00:51:20,190 --> 00:51:22,500
It's kind of like your
other big player, right?

1359
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:24,543
Probably bigger for most organizations.

1360
00:51:25,622 --> 00:51:29,738
I also wanted to ask, I think
for like on another thread,

1361
00:51:29,738 --> 00:51:33,356
for larger organizations,

1362
00:51:33,356 --> 00:51:36,443
how have people successfully scoped

1363
00:51:36,443 --> 00:51:41,244
for these large scale conglomerates
or giant tech companies

1364
00:51:41,244 --> 00:51:44,820
and figured out a way
to scope the exercise

1365
00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:48,900
so that it's not Microsoft
blows up and disappears,

1366
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:50,190
but is useful?

1367
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:51,480
But they're also gigantic,

1368
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:52,770
so it's difficult to make that scope.

1369
00:51:52,770 --> 00:51:55,020
I'm wondering how people
tackle that problem.

1370
00:51:57,720 --> 00:51:58,553
- Please.

1371
00:51:58,553 --> 00:51:59,820
- [Audience Member] It's
more kind of use case

1372
00:51:59,820 --> 00:52:02,430
to add to the, in terms of...

1373
00:52:02,430 --> 00:52:04,080
And this ties back to your question

1374
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:07,020
on can US national security
and that sort of thing;

1375
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:09,840
thinking about the
ecosystem in a given country

1376
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:11,453
where we have the US embassy,

1377
00:52:11,453 --> 00:52:16,260
the USAID mission, all
of our NGOs and partners

1378
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:17,610
that we fund that are collecting data

1379
00:52:17,610 --> 00:52:20,580
and doing work, all kind
of under the overall guise

1380
00:52:20,580 --> 00:52:22,979
of US national security and objectives.

1381
00:52:22,979 --> 00:52:27,150
Thinking about how tabletops include

1382
00:52:27,150 --> 00:52:30,210
or don't include all of
those diverse actors,

1383
00:52:30,210 --> 00:52:32,400
or if you just proxy them.

1384
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,850
And so that's really
interesting to me to see how

1385
00:52:36,337 --> 00:52:38,587
to either run a more
complex one or simplify.

1386
00:52:39,486 --> 00:52:44,486
- So this is less from a
policy oriented perspective

1387
00:52:44,820 --> 00:52:46,680
and more towards red
team engagements, right?

1388
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:49,500
But just to answer your question directly

1389
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:50,974
in terms of Microsoft blowing up,

1390
00:52:50,974 --> 00:52:54,360
(laughs) I did front intelligence

1391
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:56,460
at a fairly large tech
firm for a little bit.

1392
00:52:56,460 --> 00:52:59,370
And when we were running, not tabletops,

1393
00:52:59,370 --> 00:53:00,224
but red team engagements,

1394
00:53:00,224 --> 00:53:04,470
usually the red team gets carte blanche.

1395
00:53:04,470 --> 00:53:06,210
But they'll scope it, and they'll consult

1396
00:53:06,210 --> 00:53:08,670
with the organizations that
they're planning on targeting.

1397
00:53:08,670 --> 00:53:11,400
And so I think it's truly a conversation

1398
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:13,800
that you want to have with
your client and just say,

1399
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:16,440
listen, how is everything in scope?

1400
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:20,373
If that's the case, still
choosing a small subset.

1401
00:53:21,750 --> 00:53:23,670
At least from a designing perspective,

1402
00:53:23,670 --> 00:53:26,460
it gives you the creativity
to be able to work

1403
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:27,543
with what you have.

1404
00:53:28,410 --> 00:53:30,879
But it truly depends on, I guess,

1405
00:53:30,879 --> 00:53:33,390
going back to the maturity
model of that organization

1406
00:53:33,390 --> 00:53:36,738
and how closely knit those
disparate teams are already.

1407
00:53:36,738 --> 00:53:39,353
- On the, oh, go ahead.

1408
00:53:39,353 --> 00:53:40,803
Someone else has a question.

1409
00:53:41,658 --> 00:53:43,320
On the conglomerate thing,

1410
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:45,090
I think it gets really, really tricky

1411
00:53:45,090 --> 00:53:46,233
to run tabletop exercises

1412
00:53:46,233 --> 00:53:48,208
when you have like an
umbrella organization,

1413
00:53:48,208 --> 00:53:49,543
a bunch of small organizations,

1414
00:53:49,543 --> 00:53:51,359
there's a few different ways to do it.

1415
00:53:51,359 --> 00:53:54,833
We've done one where we
run management exercises

1416
00:53:54,833 --> 00:53:57,000
for both the umbrella organization

1417
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,490
in each of the subsidiaries

1418
00:53:59,490 --> 00:54:01,350
and ask each of the subsidiaries,

1419
00:54:01,350 --> 00:54:03,480
what are you expecting
from your parent company?

1420
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:05,400
And what do you think
you're supposed to be doing?

1421
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:08,040
And we usually get totally
different answers from all them.

1422
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:09,870
And then we run one with
the umbrella organization

1423
00:54:09,870 --> 00:54:12,300
and we're like, well,
what sort of information's

1424
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:14,040
coming down and what do
you expect to come back up?

1425
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:16,950
And then what we can do is
sort of map all of those

1426
00:54:16,950 --> 00:54:18,906
and produce an overall report that says

1427
00:54:18,906 --> 00:54:21,322
here's where the
communication is gonna break

1428
00:54:21,322 --> 00:54:23,010
during an exercise.

1429
00:54:23,010 --> 00:54:25,950
And here the subsidiaries
that are expecting you

1430
00:54:25,950 --> 00:54:27,420
to do all the work and
are gonna need your help

1431
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:28,530
and might need more resources

1432
00:54:28,530 --> 00:54:29,520
than they're currently being allotted.

1433
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:31,020
So it does get very complicated

1434
00:54:31,020 --> 00:54:33,060
when you're doing maybe 10 exercises

1435
00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:34,350
that are all sort of linked to each other,

1436
00:54:34,350 --> 00:54:35,970
but it can be done.

1437
00:54:35,970 --> 00:54:38,280
- I see two fingers here
and I'm gonna ask a question

1438
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:41,201
that might shift gears a tiny
bit, but defer to you all.

1439
00:54:41,201 --> 00:54:43,560
- [Audience Member]
Yeah, so the other aspect

1440
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:46,620
is taking a look at companies
that grow by mergers

1441
00:54:46,620 --> 00:54:49,860
and acquisitions, 'cause
there's a lot of inherent risk

1442
00:54:49,860 --> 00:54:51,210
with the company you're bringing on

1443
00:54:51,210 --> 00:54:53,938
and their risk profile and
what their capabilities are,

1444
00:54:53,938 --> 00:54:55,890
and who they may be connected to.

1445
00:54:55,890 --> 00:54:57,863
So we see this a lot out in industry

1446
00:54:57,863 --> 00:55:00,120
where companies are growing by M&A.

1447
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:02,400
But from an attacker perspective,

1448
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:03,570
that's a juicy target.

1449
00:55:03,570 --> 00:55:05,160
For simple fact, it's gonna be a lot

1450
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:09,060
of disjointed companies together that may

1451
00:55:09,060 --> 00:55:10,950
or may not have their act together.

1452
00:55:10,950 --> 00:55:12,930
In financial services, there's two things

1453
00:55:12,930 --> 00:55:14,520
that we've always concentrated on.

1454
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:16,241
Anything can effect the GL,

1455
00:55:16,241 --> 00:55:19,135
anything can stop
processing card information,

1456
00:55:19,135 --> 00:55:22,738
and anything can stop major
financial transactions

1457
00:55:22,738 --> 00:55:25,380
within the financial services organization

1458
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:28,230
as areas for scoping.

1459
00:55:28,230 --> 00:55:30,780
Because if you can't get
those three things right,

1460
00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:33,783
that's making your financial
service organization run,

1461
00:55:33,783 --> 00:55:36,542
or the question of how
do you make your money,

1462
00:55:36,542 --> 00:55:39,600
those are the areas that
we've concentrated on

1463
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:40,980
from a scope aspect.

1464
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:44,310
And then we've seen where
there's been breakdowns

1465
00:55:44,310 --> 00:55:46,980
in outlying or supporting functions

1466
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:50,310
or supporting vendor
organizations that integrate

1467
00:55:50,310 --> 00:55:51,480
with that supporting function.

1468
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:54,990
So you start to get into,
okay, vendor risk management,

1469
00:55:54,990 --> 00:55:58,394
either as a force multiplier
to your organization

1470
00:55:58,394 --> 00:56:01,770
or a detriment in your IR response,

1471
00:56:01,770 --> 00:56:02,670
and things of that nature.

1472
00:56:02,670 --> 00:56:04,860
So that's how we've kind of focused

1473
00:56:04,860 --> 00:56:07,860
in the financial services
from my experience.

1474
00:56:07,860 --> 00:56:09,180
Again, things may vary,

1475
00:56:09,180 --> 00:56:12,270
but that's just one area to scope aspect.

1476
00:56:12,270 --> 00:56:13,103
Thanks.

1477
00:56:13,103 --> 00:56:15,209
- I wanna tie that into
kind of the conversations,

1478
00:56:15,209 --> 00:56:16,980
like the subsidiary in the M&A

1479
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:18,510
with kind of the outside counselor,

1480
00:56:18,510 --> 00:56:19,920
outside vendor recommendation.

1481
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:22,170
I'm dying to see if
anyone has ever done this,

1482
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:26,760
a incident scenario in which
the attacker has started

1483
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:29,105
from the outside law
firm and moved inwards.

1484
00:56:29,105 --> 00:56:32,058
'Cause I think that that would
be kind of a beautiful tie in

1485
00:56:32,058 --> 00:56:34,320
to like, oh, we'll reach
out to outside counsel

1486
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:36,874
when they're the ones that
cause this whole thing, but.

1487
00:56:36,874 --> 00:56:38,105
(Winnona laughing)

1488
00:56:38,105 --> 00:56:38,938
- Anybody?

1489
00:56:40,438 --> 00:56:43,503
- [Audience Member] So
yeah, I just had a question.

1490
00:56:44,430 --> 00:56:46,980
So a lot of the conversation
has been about how

1491
00:56:46,980 --> 00:56:51,346
if you're scoping a tabletop
exercise that you succeed in,

1492
00:56:51,346 --> 00:56:53,594
it's the wrong scope.

1493
00:56:53,594 --> 00:56:56,223
In a lot of self-defense courses

1494
00:56:56,223 --> 00:56:58,736
or that kind of training curriculum,

1495
00:56:58,736 --> 00:57:01,140
one of the concepts is
you wanna lead the student

1496
00:57:01,140 --> 00:57:02,310
with the success at the end.

1497
00:57:02,310 --> 00:57:04,050
Because you want them to
have the self confidence

1498
00:57:04,050 --> 00:57:04,980
that they're able to do this.

1499
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:05,813
We've got this.

1500
00:57:05,813 --> 00:57:08,280
We're able to handle these sort of things.

1501
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:10,380
Is that something that we
should be incorporating

1502
00:57:10,380 --> 00:57:12,000
into our tabletops as well,

1503
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,009
that maybe we give them
an attaboy at the end

1504
00:57:15,009 --> 00:57:16,800
to give them that self confidence?

1505
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:20,883
Or are we just really
focusing on the negatives?

1506
00:57:23,370 --> 00:57:25,590
- I think delivering feedback
is such an important part

1507
00:57:25,590 --> 00:57:27,423
of tabletop exercises.

1508
00:57:27,423 --> 00:57:29,910
I think starting with what was done well

1509
00:57:29,910 --> 00:57:31,350
is always important.

1510
00:57:31,350 --> 00:57:35,070
But what we like to do
our practice is ask them

1511
00:57:35,070 --> 00:57:37,680
to say what they think
they could do better first,

1512
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:39,570
because it just sounds a
lot better coming from...

1513
00:57:39,570 --> 00:57:42,540
They're like, we really
didn't use our IR plan,

1514
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:45,723
than us saying you did
not use your IR plan, bad.

1515
00:57:45,723 --> 00:57:47,981
It makes a big difference, because then,

1516
00:57:47,981 --> 00:57:50,370
they'll all sort talk about it themselves

1517
00:57:50,370 --> 00:57:51,810
and we'll come in at
the end and we'll say,

1518
00:57:51,810 --> 00:57:52,909
we totally agree with this.

1519
00:57:52,909 --> 00:57:54,221
We'll add a couple things.

1520
00:57:54,221 --> 00:57:57,030
And then folks walk away
feeling like they've taught

1521
00:57:57,030 --> 00:57:59,730
each other something versus
us kind of bringing it down

1522
00:57:59,730 --> 00:58:01,650
upon them.

1523
00:58:01,650 --> 00:58:03,765
It's just sort of received a lot better,

1524
00:58:03,765 --> 00:58:06,630
but even with the sort of
reports that we're giving out,

1525
00:58:06,630 --> 00:58:08,070
it's always, here's what you did well.

1526
00:58:08,070 --> 00:58:09,060
Here's what you could work on.

1527
00:58:09,060 --> 00:58:12,390
Because if you just tell someone
everything they did wrong,

1528
00:58:12,390 --> 00:58:13,800
they just feel like a failure.

1529
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:14,633
So you're right.

1530
00:58:14,633 --> 00:58:16,837
You don't want them to feel
like they owned the exercise,

1531
00:58:16,837 --> 00:58:21,120
but they definitely need to
know what they're good at.

1532
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:23,220
- Or they shut down, and the next time,

1533
00:58:23,220 --> 00:58:25,265
that area is out of scope
for the next tabletop.

1534
00:58:25,265 --> 00:58:27,750
(panelists and audience laughing)

1535
00:58:27,750 --> 00:58:30,210
- I can jump in really quickly
just 'cause the feedback

1536
00:58:30,210 --> 00:58:32,280
and evaluation part is really interesting,

1537
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:34,080
especially because we work with students.

1538
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:36,540
So you wanna be extra
sensitive to the fact that,

1539
00:58:36,540 --> 00:58:37,560
hey, you're new here.

1540
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:38,618
It's okay to make mistakes.

1541
00:58:38,618 --> 00:58:40,196
This is how you improve for next time.

1542
00:58:40,196 --> 00:58:43,290
And we have a rubric that
we use for all the briefings

1543
00:58:43,290 --> 00:58:46,410
that they give, evaluating,
one, their presentation,

1544
00:58:46,410 --> 00:58:48,565
the policy recommendations they develop,

1545
00:58:48,565 --> 00:58:51,360
how they navigated working
with four different people,

1546
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:52,794
three to four different people on a team.

1547
00:58:52,794 --> 00:58:55,470
I think one thing that's been, I think,

1548
00:58:55,470 --> 00:58:57,090
challenging for us is,
one, making sure that

1549
00:58:57,090 --> 00:58:59,340
when they do present that,
they give that to a series

1550
00:58:59,340 --> 00:59:01,170
of judges who are from
industry and government

1551
00:59:01,170 --> 00:59:02,880
who are practitioners.

1552
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:05,160
We wanna make sure that that
feedback is valuable to them,

1553
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:07,260
but it's also constructive.

1554
00:59:07,260 --> 00:59:08,490
And that you deliver it in a way

1555
00:59:08,490 --> 00:59:09,660
that focuses on the positives,

1556
00:59:09,660 --> 00:59:11,590
but also identify as areas for growth.

1557
00:59:11,590 --> 00:59:13,500
And the growth part is interesting

1558
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:15,450
because you wanna make
sure that students use that

1559
00:59:15,450 --> 00:59:17,160
for the next year when
they do compete again,

1560
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:19,050
so they can continuously get better.

1561
00:59:19,050 --> 00:59:20,280
But one thing that we've had fun with

1562
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:21,300
in some events is like,

1563
00:59:21,300 --> 00:59:24,120
we'll let some students redo on day two.

1564
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:25,980
It's not competitive, so
they can't get points for it.

1565
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:27,743
But you can take the
feedback you got on day one,

1566
00:59:27,743 --> 00:59:29,670
redo your briefing on day two,

1567
00:59:29,670 --> 00:59:31,110
and get feedback a second time.

1568
00:59:31,110 --> 00:59:33,736
So how could you redo this
again in a safe setting,

1569
00:59:33,736 --> 00:59:36,780
using that feedback that
you got from people.

1570
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:39,164
But I did see some, please.

1571
00:59:39,164 --> 00:59:41,842
- [Audience Member] Parallel
with self-defense courses,

1572
00:59:41,842 --> 00:59:44,190
right, and those sorts of things.

1573
00:59:44,190 --> 00:59:45,660
It's basic instruction.

1574
00:59:45,660 --> 00:59:47,595
It's protect your head.

1575
00:59:47,595 --> 00:59:51,870
And how does that compare to
a much more complex tabletop

1576
00:59:51,870 --> 00:59:54,150
where the feedback or the solutions

1577
00:59:54,150 --> 00:59:56,257
that you're getting might be 180 pages

1578
00:59:56,257 --> 00:59:58,082
of this is what needs to
happen in case of a crisis.

1579
00:59:58,082 --> 01:00:01,756
And so how do you, not water it down,

1580
01:00:01,756 --> 01:00:05,130
but right size it in terms
of providing the people

1581
01:00:05,130 --> 01:00:07,362
who need the right steps and information,

1582
01:00:07,362 --> 01:00:10,260
give them the stories and
then the tools that they need

1583
01:00:10,260 --> 01:00:11,829
that are actually actionable?

1584
01:00:11,829 --> 01:00:15,030
- Too much feedback is
as good as no feedback

1585
01:00:15,030 --> 01:00:17,353
because you reach a point
where folks just can't do

1586
01:00:17,353 --> 01:00:18,706
that many things.

1587
01:00:18,706 --> 01:00:22,050
So you wanna pick out the
things that you think they need

1588
01:00:22,050 --> 01:00:22,883
to work on the most.

1589
01:00:22,883 --> 01:00:24,802
I usually pick formal processes.

1590
01:00:24,802 --> 01:00:27,420
What can you write down so
that you'll have it next time

1591
01:00:27,420 --> 01:00:29,220
so that you don't have to
think through it the way

1592
01:00:29,220 --> 01:00:30,600
that you had to do in this exercise?

1593
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:31,710
Because it's gonna waste time

1594
01:00:31,710 --> 01:00:33,200
and you don't have as much time.

1595
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:35,700
It's gonna take you 10 times
as long to get all the people

1596
01:00:35,700 --> 01:00:37,860
in the room that you
think it's gonna take.

1597
01:00:37,860 --> 01:00:39,420
So yeah, I like to keep it

1598
01:00:39,420 --> 01:00:42,393
to maybe less than 15
things they need to fix.

1599
01:00:43,740 --> 01:00:45,300
And at that point,

1600
01:00:45,300 --> 01:00:47,010
if you have more than 15 things to fix,

1601
01:00:47,010 --> 01:00:48,600
you sort of need to fix everything.

1602
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:50,940
And so you might as well
just keep it to the things

1603
01:00:50,940 --> 01:00:52,014
that they need to do first.

1604
01:00:52,014 --> 01:00:54,300
And so the next time they
come around the tabletop,

1605
01:00:54,300 --> 01:00:55,500
you can sort drill down deeper

1606
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:57,510
into the more complex processes

1607
01:00:57,510 --> 01:00:58,571
that they could figure out better,

1608
01:00:58,571 --> 01:01:01,099
but you wanna hit the things
that they can do first

1609
01:01:01,099 --> 01:01:02,223
though, that are easy.

1610
01:01:03,060 --> 01:01:04,290
- Also just to add on that.

1611
01:01:04,290 --> 01:01:07,740
I mean, when you're coming
back with pieces of feedback

1612
01:01:07,740 --> 01:01:09,120
and trying to narrow that list down,

1613
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:10,238
especially if it's a larger list,

1614
01:01:10,238 --> 01:01:12,900
at least for me, I focus on feasibility

1615
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:13,770
within the organization.

1616
01:01:13,770 --> 01:01:16,950
And when I say feasibility,
I don't just mean technical.

1617
01:01:16,950 --> 01:01:18,648
I mean political, process wise.

1618
01:01:18,648 --> 01:01:21,658
If you're going to tell someone
to fix their IT systems,

1619
01:01:21,658 --> 01:01:25,320
but you're a big company
with several mergers

1620
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:28,350
and acquisitions, and you're
like at this part of the org,

1621
01:01:28,350 --> 01:01:29,880
but the people that
handle it is this part.

1622
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:30,780
It makes no sense.

1623
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:33,330
And then also focusing on,

1624
01:01:33,330 --> 01:01:37,050
when you're looking at
your principal audience

1625
01:01:37,050 --> 01:01:39,510
or your principal feedback receiver,

1626
01:01:39,510 --> 01:01:42,420
tailoring that message
to more of a high level;

1627
01:01:42,420 --> 01:01:43,410
if it's an executive

1628
01:01:43,410 --> 01:01:45,438
versus here's all of the different lists

1629
01:01:45,438 --> 01:01:47,070
of things you need to do if you're more

1630
01:01:47,070 --> 01:01:49,140
of a technical practitioner.

1631
01:01:49,140 --> 01:01:50,603
- I think I saw a hand raised over here.

1632
01:01:50,603 --> 01:01:53,700
- [Audience Member] So
one of the things I'd like

1633
01:01:53,700 --> 01:01:55,014
to say too, is that for anybody

1634
01:01:55,014 --> 01:01:58,750
who's doing tabletop exercises
is to make sure that,

1635
01:01:58,750 --> 01:02:00,120
Winn, you said it a couple times,

1636
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:02,694
make sure that third
party council is involved.

1637
01:02:02,694 --> 01:02:06,299
Because what I found in a
few of the tabletop exercises

1638
01:02:06,299 --> 01:02:09,863
that I've done is that the company has

1639
01:02:10,860 --> 01:02:14,970
a incident response retainer
with one organization.

1640
01:02:14,970 --> 01:02:15,990
And that organization,

1641
01:02:15,990 --> 01:02:17,613
once third party council gets involved

1642
01:02:17,613 --> 01:02:20,130
and cyber insurance gets involved,

1643
01:02:20,130 --> 01:02:23,250
is not approved by the cyber insurer.

1644
01:02:23,250 --> 01:02:25,794
So now it's in a very
interesting position,

1645
01:02:25,794 --> 01:02:28,050
and we actually had to do this

1646
01:02:28,050 --> 01:02:30,240
as a live fire tabletop exercise,

1647
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:33,418
which if anybody's ever done,
I don't recommend ever doing.

1648
01:02:33,418 --> 01:02:35,730
(panelists and audience laughing)

1649
01:02:35,730 --> 01:02:38,760
And they had to work it out in real time.

1650
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:42,300
And there was conversations
that had never happened before

1651
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:46,260
about, okay, well we have
this company engaged already.

1652
01:02:46,260 --> 01:02:49,230
They're doing analysis, but
now our cyber insurers saying,

1653
01:02:49,230 --> 01:02:51,540
we have to go with this company over here.

1654
01:02:51,540 --> 01:02:53,130
What does that handoff look like?

1655
01:02:53,130 --> 01:02:55,740
And then what does the
future plan look like?

1656
01:02:55,740 --> 01:03:00,740
Because obviously, the company
has one response retainer

1657
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:02,310
that they choose.

1658
01:03:02,310 --> 01:03:04,260
They have one of choice
and now they have to work

1659
01:03:04,260 --> 01:03:06,540
into the process in the
future to get them approved

1660
01:03:06,540 --> 01:03:07,373
and that...

1661
01:03:07,373 --> 01:03:09,870
So highly recommend getting
third party council,

1662
01:03:09,870 --> 01:03:11,133
cyber insurance involved.

1663
01:03:13,707 --> 01:03:15,173
- Any other questions from you two?

1664
01:03:15,173 --> 01:03:17,130
I'd love to give you guys a chance

1665
01:03:17,130 --> 01:03:19,650
before I throw a wrench in
with some fun questions.

1666
01:03:19,650 --> 01:03:20,610
- Trey's got a question.

1667
01:03:20,610 --> 01:03:21,543
- Yeah, please.

1668
01:03:22,790 --> 01:03:24,370
- [Trey] So I'm a little bit cur-

1669
01:03:24,370 --> 01:03:25,980
We've talked a lot about the stakes

1670
01:03:25,980 --> 01:03:27,270
and mechanics of competitions,

1671
01:03:27,270 --> 01:03:28,868
a lot about adversaries and victims.

1672
01:03:28,868 --> 01:03:30,765
(indistinct)

1673
01:03:30,765 --> 01:03:31,730
- (speaking faintly) Mic, sorry.

1674
01:03:31,730 --> 01:03:32,880
- [Trey] So for you all,

1675
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:35,160
we've talked a lot about
the mechanics of the games

1676
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:36,720
and the adversaries.

1677
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:38,010
What have you found works best

1678
01:03:38,010 --> 01:03:41,910
to build the non-player
characters, the intermediaries?

1679
01:03:41,910 --> 01:03:43,260
'Cause so often, it's Cyber 9/12.

1680
01:03:43,260 --> 01:03:44,220
One of the things we run into

1681
01:03:44,220 --> 01:03:46,320
is students have trouble interacting

1682
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:48,120
with the third party company,

1683
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:50,763
the other insurer that'd
be the downstream vendor.

1684
01:03:50,763 --> 01:03:52,380
And so making them credible

1685
01:03:52,380 --> 01:03:54,690
and rich characters is really important

1686
01:03:54,690 --> 01:03:55,560
to the outcome of the scenario.

1687
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:57,477
I'm just curious for all of
you or for folks in the room,

1688
01:03:57,477 --> 01:03:59,070
what have you found works best

1689
01:03:59,070 --> 01:04:00,796
or what are trip falls to avoid

1690
01:04:00,796 --> 01:04:02,973
in building those intermediary characters?

1691
01:04:05,378 --> 01:04:08,669
- I mean, I don't think in
corporate tabletop exercises

1692
01:04:08,669 --> 01:04:10,083
versus the Cyber 9/12,

1693
01:04:10,083 --> 01:04:11,907
they really have the same
sort of rich characters.

1694
01:04:11,907 --> 01:04:12,740
But one of the things we'll do

1695
01:04:12,740 --> 01:04:15,240
is that if we're doing a
combined technical tabletop

1696
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:18,030
and management tabletop,
do the technical one first,

1697
01:04:18,030 --> 01:04:19,137
see what sorts of information

1698
01:04:19,137 --> 01:04:21,720
the technical team would
actually bring upwards.

1699
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:23,370
And then in the management tabletop,

1700
01:04:23,370 --> 01:04:25,260
we will pretend to be the technical team.

1701
01:04:25,260 --> 01:04:28,890
And we'll say the technical
team is saying this, this,

1702
01:04:28,890 --> 01:04:30,480
and this, and they're
asking this from you.

1703
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:33,000
So that we're actually sort
of creating that bridge

1704
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,445
between the executive
management, the security team.

1705
01:04:35,445 --> 01:04:38,100
And if they're saying, well,
we'd expect this from them.

1706
01:04:38,100 --> 01:04:40,380
And then we learn that there's
gonna be sort of a break

1707
01:04:40,380 --> 01:04:41,213
in that communication.

1708
01:04:41,213 --> 01:04:42,480
We don't have really separate characters,

1709
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:44,580
but we sort of play the intermediary

1710
01:04:44,580 --> 01:04:47,610
so that we can ask the
right questions there.

1711
01:04:47,610 --> 01:04:52,610
- Yeah, I don't think I've
built an NPC for my war games

1712
01:04:52,830 --> 01:04:55,623
aside from actual
Dungeon and Dragons games

1713
01:04:55,623 --> 01:04:56,883
that is a hobby.

1714
01:04:58,750 --> 01:05:01,350
But I think I'll take that question

1715
01:05:01,350 --> 01:05:04,920
and maybe pivot it into a
discussion about technical realism

1716
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:09,090
in policy war games.

1717
01:05:09,090 --> 01:05:14,040
And there have been times
where, especially when,

1718
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:15,870
I guess going back to Sarah's point,

1719
01:05:15,870 --> 01:05:17,070
one of the ways to do that is to have

1720
01:05:17,070 --> 01:05:19,170
that technical war game first.

1721
01:05:19,170 --> 01:05:23,400
But making sure if you
don't have that time,

1722
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:27,630
and I imagine, we're at
DEF CON, talking technical

1723
01:05:27,630 --> 01:05:32,630
to a war gaming panel is
not going to be a surprise.

1724
01:05:33,090 --> 01:05:35,970
But making sure that either
if you're not that expert,

1725
01:05:35,970 --> 01:05:38,220
making sure that you're checking
that all of the war games

1726
01:05:38,220 --> 01:05:39,648
from that perspective are realistic,

1727
01:05:39,648 --> 01:05:42,595
actionable, and current.

1728
01:05:42,595 --> 01:05:45,270
I think making sure that
you have someone there

1729
01:05:45,270 --> 01:05:47,243
that will do that checking is important.

1730
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:49,193
- Rapid fire?

1731
01:05:49,193 --> 01:05:50,280
Answer some questions?

1732
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:52,500
- Yeah, I saw a wave.

1733
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:54,455
I don't know if it was
a hand raise or a wave.

1734
01:05:54,455 --> 01:05:56,037
- [Audience Member] I
just wanted to chime in

1735
01:05:56,037 --> 01:05:59,702
and say that if you get your
IR provider to do the war game,

1736
01:05:59,702 --> 01:06:01,590
they work with the third party.

1737
01:06:01,590 --> 01:06:05,160
So it's easier to create
those kind of third party NPCs

1738
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:07,653
and simulate those interactions.

1739
01:06:08,495 --> 01:06:09,423
- Excellent.

1740
01:06:10,417 --> 01:06:12,777
One thing I wanted to
ask folks in the room,

1741
01:06:12,777 --> 01:06:15,120
was there ever a time that you

1742
01:06:15,120 --> 01:06:17,370
or somebody that you were
working with took an action

1743
01:06:17,370 --> 01:06:19,500
during a war game or a simulation

1744
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:21,660
that had really bad consequences?

1745
01:06:21,660 --> 01:06:24,261
And how did you navigate that with them?

1746
01:06:24,261 --> 01:06:27,060
Or did you just stand back
and watch the chaos happen

1747
01:06:27,060 --> 01:06:27,942
and just kind of smile?

1748
01:06:27,942 --> 01:06:29,462
- [Audience Member] More like that.

1749
01:06:29,462 --> 01:06:31,125
- You asking us or are
you asking the room?

1750
01:06:31,125 --> 01:06:33,300
- I'd love for you guys
to go first, and then-

1751
01:06:33,300 --> 01:06:35,716
- You're asking for on the
record horror stories, Safa?

1752
01:06:35,716 --> 01:06:36,581
(Winnona laughing)

1753
01:06:36,581 --> 01:06:37,531
- I mean, no names.

1754
01:06:40,039 --> 01:06:44,460
- I guess the one that I've had goes back

1755
01:06:44,460 --> 01:06:46,080
to setting expectations.

1756
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:47,730
And I think that one of the ways

1757
01:06:47,730 --> 01:06:50,790
that we did not set
expectations the right way

1758
01:06:50,790 --> 01:06:53,490
when doing a tabletop with this one set

1759
01:06:53,490 --> 01:06:57,090
of groups was just in terms of,
these were two organizations

1760
01:06:57,090 --> 01:06:59,520
that had never really
done a tabletop together.

1761
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:02,516
And due to that, due to
also cultural differences,

1762
01:07:02,516 --> 01:07:06,300
we came in with the scenario,
one team really went in

1763
01:07:06,300 --> 01:07:08,430
with the scenario and was very forthright.

1764
01:07:08,430 --> 01:07:10,020
And the other team shut it down.

1765
01:07:10,020 --> 01:07:12,072
And we're like, okay,
what are you going to do?

1766
01:07:12,072 --> 01:07:13,890
Oh, we'll just figure it
out when we get there,

1767
01:07:13,890 --> 01:07:16,954
or we will engage with our third parties.

1768
01:07:16,954 --> 01:07:19,502
And then making sure that...

1769
01:07:19,502 --> 01:07:21,573
And when you have one team

1770
01:07:21,573 --> 01:07:22,977
that really actually wants to engage

1771
01:07:22,977 --> 01:07:24,540
and is providing that information,

1772
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:25,950
you have another team
that's just taking it in

1773
01:07:25,950 --> 01:07:26,886
and providing nothing back,

1774
01:07:26,886 --> 01:07:28,860
making sure that both
of those teams come in

1775
01:07:28,860 --> 01:07:30,420
with the same type of
expectation, I think,

1776
01:07:30,420 --> 01:07:31,980
was something that we
really learned the hard way.

1777
01:07:31,980 --> 01:07:32,813
Yeah.

1778
01:07:34,410 --> 01:07:37,320
- I did an exercise with the C-suite

1779
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:41,309
and when we got to the
ransom repayment section,

1780
01:07:41,309 --> 01:07:44,130
unanimously and sort of led by the CEO,

1781
01:07:44,130 --> 01:07:47,730
the C-suite was like,
let them leak the data.

1782
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:50,494
No one cares about our company anyways.

1783
01:07:50,494 --> 01:07:53,850
They won't write news stories about us.

1784
01:07:53,850 --> 01:07:55,560
Let them do their worst.

1785
01:07:55,560 --> 01:07:58,620
And I'm not saying that they
should have paid the ransom,

1786
01:07:58,620 --> 01:08:03,620
but to me, it was such a mismatch
of understanding of risk,

1787
01:08:04,078 --> 01:08:06,660
which is something that
I sort of anticipated

1788
01:08:06,660 --> 01:08:09,210
that the C-suite would
have a better handle on.

1789
01:08:09,210 --> 01:08:11,558
So that was a weird exercise.

1790
01:08:11,558 --> 01:08:14,490
(Sarah laughing)

1791
01:08:14,490 --> 01:08:16,767
- [Audience Member] That
brings up a good question in,

1792
01:08:16,767 --> 01:08:20,229
and I agree to the question.

1793
01:08:20,229 --> 01:08:24,510
The original question is
that sometimes in my view,

1794
01:08:24,510 --> 01:08:26,910
as sometimes having created them,

1795
01:08:26,910 --> 01:08:28,710
having also facilitated them;

1796
01:08:28,710 --> 01:08:31,830
as a facilitator, I'll let
things play out a little bit.

1797
01:08:31,830 --> 01:08:33,930
But at some point, you
gotta get it back on track.

1798
01:08:33,930 --> 01:08:36,326
When a major decision was
made, that was incorrect,

1799
01:08:36,326 --> 01:08:38,160
you have to get it back on track.

1800
01:08:38,160 --> 01:08:39,414
But let it play out,

1801
01:08:39,414 --> 01:08:41,430
and then there are usually
some good action items

1802
01:08:41,430 --> 01:08:43,025
that can come out of that.

1803
01:08:43,025 --> 01:08:48,025
But to some of the other points was,

1804
01:08:48,270 --> 01:08:50,134
and I just lost my train of thought, so.

1805
01:08:50,134 --> 01:08:52,132
(audience and panelists laughing)

1806
01:08:52,132 --> 01:08:53,883
- No one noticed that, yeah.

1807
01:08:55,208 --> 01:08:57,750
- [Audience Member] It was around...

1808
01:08:57,750 --> 01:09:00,896
What were you talking about
right there at the end?

1809
01:09:00,896 --> 01:09:02,370
- Expectation?

1810
01:09:02,370 --> 01:09:04,717
Or Sarah was...

1811
01:09:04,717 --> 01:09:05,869
- [Audience Member] Oh, yeah.

1812
01:09:05,869 --> 01:09:09,063
The major decisions that are just crazy.

1813
01:09:10,212 --> 01:09:12,960
Again, sometimes that comes down to,

1814
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:15,390
and I've had that happen.

1815
01:09:15,390 --> 01:09:18,570
If it's an executive making that decision,

1816
01:09:18,570 --> 01:09:20,940
there's only so much you can do.

1817
01:09:20,940 --> 01:09:22,710
And it comes back to then,

1818
01:09:22,710 --> 01:09:27,060
maybe even having education
sessions privately

1819
01:09:27,060 --> 01:09:30,150
or making some
recommendations, not in public,

1820
01:09:30,150 --> 01:09:33,000
'cause you don't wanna shame
somebody at that level.

1821
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,710
But those are very critical things

1822
01:09:34,710 --> 01:09:36,900
that need to be addressed.

1823
01:09:36,900 --> 01:09:38,520
At least in my view as a facilitator,

1824
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:43,520
I hate to walk away and not
address that in some fashion.

1825
01:09:43,770 --> 01:09:45,750
And in some cases, some
of that doesn't make it

1826
01:09:45,750 --> 01:09:49,323
into the report, but it makes
it into a verbal conversation.

1827
01:09:53,730 --> 01:09:55,950
- Anyone else was looking to chime in

1828
01:09:55,950 --> 01:09:57,933
on bad actions, bad ideas?

1829
01:09:58,830 --> 01:10:00,240
No.

1830
01:10:00,240 --> 01:10:02,850
- I'll follow up on the
Cyber 9/12 side, Safa.

1831
01:10:02,850 --> 01:10:06,265
Again, going back to the student angle,

1832
01:10:06,265 --> 01:10:10,866
it's really great to see how
many percentage of students

1833
01:10:10,866 --> 01:10:12,870
in the Cyber 9/12 Challenge.

1834
01:10:12,870 --> 01:10:15,240
Because it's usually a shock
and awe type cyber attack,

1835
01:10:15,240 --> 01:10:17,790
the lights go off, something's gone wrong,

1836
01:10:17,790 --> 01:10:20,430
gotta brief the NSC in like 12 hours.

1837
01:10:20,430 --> 01:10:22,380
And there's always a team that goes,

1838
01:10:22,380 --> 01:10:25,410
it's trying to send carriers
into the Taiwanese Strait

1839
01:10:25,410 --> 01:10:28,563
or into the strait of the South China Sea.

1840
01:10:30,060 --> 01:10:34,140
And being able to walk that back, go okay,

1841
01:10:34,140 --> 01:10:35,880
using the guiding questions of like okay,

1842
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:39,150
what is the basis of your analysis?

1843
01:10:39,150 --> 01:10:41,940
How confident are you in your assessment?

1844
01:10:41,940 --> 01:10:44,100
Walking them through
the intelligence process

1845
01:10:44,100 --> 01:10:45,690
of here's all the things
that you need to have

1846
01:10:45,690 --> 01:10:46,950
in order to make that assessment,

1847
01:10:46,950 --> 01:10:48,515
and then making that
into a learning process

1848
01:10:48,515 --> 01:10:52,500
rather than that was bad
and you should feel bad.

1849
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:54,060
I think was definitely...

1850
01:10:54,060 --> 01:10:55,200
And it's been great.

1851
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:57,630
Cyber 9/12 has had fewer recommendations

1852
01:10:57,630 --> 01:11:00,408
about sending the Navy to defend

1853
01:11:00,408 --> 01:11:03,750
or to go into the South China
Sea for very little reason

1854
01:11:03,750 --> 01:11:05,373
since 2015, 2016.

1855
01:11:06,218 --> 01:11:07,087
(Winnona laughing)

1856
01:11:07,087 --> 01:11:08,460
(Safa speaking faintly)

1857
01:11:08,460 --> 01:11:10,440
- I mean, I think that's
a really good point.

1858
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:11,940
I think the escalation piece

1859
01:11:11,940 --> 01:11:15,180
of tabletop exercises is really important.

1860
01:11:15,180 --> 01:11:19,410
We'll get folks that the first
hint of maybe an incident,

1861
01:11:19,410 --> 01:11:23,400
they're like high severity
rating, ring the alarms,

1862
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:24,233
which is not good.

1863
01:11:24,233 --> 01:11:26,130
And then some folks will say,
yeah, I bet it's nothing.

1864
01:11:26,130 --> 01:11:27,113
Like you're in a tabletop exercise,

1865
01:11:27,113 --> 01:11:30,300
so you know it's gonna be something bad.

1866
01:11:30,300 --> 01:11:32,940
I think hitting the
sweet spot for escalation

1867
01:11:32,940 --> 01:11:35,430
where you're following
with the information

1868
01:11:35,430 --> 01:11:37,320
that you have at the time,

1869
01:11:37,320 --> 01:11:39,480
but you're not doing an all hands on deck

1870
01:11:39,480 --> 01:11:41,370
before you've done any sort of analysis.

1871
01:11:41,370 --> 01:11:43,380
And then, you can do something
useful with that information,

1872
01:11:43,380 --> 01:11:45,300
is very, very tricky.

1873
01:11:45,300 --> 01:11:48,120
And I think most folks
either over or under escalate

1874
01:11:48,120 --> 01:11:51,570
during that incident and aren't
able to hit that sweet spot.

1875
01:11:51,570 --> 01:11:53,248
Is that what you see in Cyber 9/12?

1876
01:11:53,248 --> 01:11:54,081
(Winnona laughing)

1877
01:11:54,081 --> 01:11:56,450
I mean, with the calling in
the Navy right away, you know?

1878
01:11:56,450 --> 01:11:59,160
- Yeah, calling the Navy
right away, sending a carrier.

1879
01:11:59,160 --> 01:12:02,100
Yeah, it's definitely,
you can get either side

1880
01:12:02,100 --> 01:12:03,660
where it's like, it's probably
nothing or it's everything.

1881
01:12:03,660 --> 01:12:05,234
And then I think that's a practice thing.

1882
01:12:05,234 --> 01:12:08,790
You'll figure out, based
off of what certain teams

1883
01:12:08,790 --> 01:12:10,470
are saying, moving it kind
of more into the corporate

1884
01:12:10,470 --> 01:12:12,540
or managerial aspect,
depending on what certain teams

1885
01:12:12,540 --> 01:12:14,340
are saying, listening to that

1886
01:12:14,340 --> 01:12:17,040
and understanding what
vocabulary means what

1887
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:19,734
on their this is messed up barometer.

1888
01:12:19,734 --> 01:12:20,567
(Winnona laughing)

1889
01:12:20,567 --> 01:12:21,750
- Yeah, and it also comes with,

1890
01:12:21,750 --> 01:12:23,280
how well do you know your network?

1891
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:25,650
How well do you know what
behavior is suspicious

1892
01:12:25,650 --> 01:12:27,599
versus what's probably
some sort of outage?

1893
01:12:27,599 --> 01:12:29,176
That's questions that we ask all.

1894
01:12:29,176 --> 01:12:31,080
Is this behavior normal on this system?

1895
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:32,805
And most often we get, I don't know,

1896
01:12:32,805 --> 01:12:34,616
We don't have a baseline for that.

1897
01:12:34,616 --> 01:12:35,449
(Winnona laughing)

1898
01:12:35,449 --> 01:12:36,282
Oh no, people.

1899
01:12:36,282 --> 01:12:37,115
I mean, that's okay.

1900
01:12:37,115 --> 01:12:38,040
It's hard.

1901
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:38,873
There's like a million things
that we've talked about today

1902
01:12:38,873 --> 01:12:40,110
that people have to know for these things.

1903
01:12:40,110 --> 01:12:41,130
And they're not intuitive,

1904
01:12:41,130 --> 01:12:43,590
and you have to learn them over time.

1905
01:12:43,590 --> 01:12:46,050
We only know this because
we run these all the time.

1906
01:12:46,050 --> 01:12:47,070
But on the other end of it,

1907
01:12:47,070 --> 01:12:48,672
it's not clear that
you're supposed to know

1908
01:12:48,672 --> 01:12:50,730
what the baseline is for
all these different systems

1909
01:12:50,730 --> 01:12:52,350
so that when you have an
alert come in, you can say,

1910
01:12:52,350 --> 01:12:54,420
that's definitely something
that we need to worry about

1911
01:12:54,420 --> 01:12:57,660
versus could be an IT
incident, we don't really know.

1912
01:12:57,660 --> 01:12:59,190
- I think you raised an
interesting point though

1913
01:12:59,190 --> 01:13:00,420
on human decision making.

1914
01:13:00,420 --> 01:13:02,564
And sometimes, someone makes
a recommendation or says,

1915
01:13:02,564 --> 01:13:04,110
I wanna take this action.

1916
01:13:04,110 --> 01:13:06,270
And it's helpful to walk that backwards.

1917
01:13:06,270 --> 01:13:08,160
One, what is your intended outcome?

1918
01:13:08,160 --> 01:13:10,230
What are you trying to achieve?

1919
01:13:10,230 --> 01:13:12,292
And then how does this help
you get closer to that?

1920
01:13:12,292 --> 01:13:14,130
And sometimes you see the gears churning

1921
01:13:14,130 --> 01:13:15,060
where people are like,

1922
01:13:15,060 --> 01:13:17,640
oh, my recommendation actually
doesn't help me get closer

1923
01:13:17,640 --> 01:13:19,500
to that, it's actually counterintuitive.

1924
01:13:19,500 --> 01:13:20,618
But I'm in a stressful situation.

1925
01:13:20,618 --> 01:13:21,916
I have limited information,

1926
01:13:21,916 --> 01:13:24,630
and I had to develop a
briefing in 15 minutes.

1927
01:13:24,630 --> 01:13:26,610
Of course I made this recommendation.

1928
01:13:26,610 --> 01:13:28,660
And I think that we've
seen that in Cyber 9/12,

1929
01:13:28,660 --> 01:13:31,380
where the judge is saying,
hey, tell me more about that.

1930
01:13:31,380 --> 01:13:32,460
Let's unpack that a little bit.

1931
01:13:32,460 --> 01:13:33,750
And then sometimes at the end being like,

1932
01:13:33,750 --> 01:13:34,937
are you sure you wanna do this?

1933
01:13:34,937 --> 01:13:37,710
'Cause there's still time
and you can walk this back.

1934
01:13:37,710 --> 01:13:42,000
We haven't taken action
yet, but I'd love to get...

1935
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,280
I guess I'm curious
about tabletop exercise

1936
01:13:44,280 --> 01:13:47,010
that you guys have participated
in or have developed.

1937
01:13:47,010 --> 01:13:48,360
And we do this all the time

1938
01:13:48,360 --> 01:13:49,620
because we're kind of crazy,

1939
01:13:49,620 --> 01:13:51,150
but we love red herrings.

1940
01:13:51,150 --> 01:13:54,570
And we love to, something
that kind of pushes the player

1941
01:13:54,570 --> 01:13:57,000
to take an action with
this limited information

1942
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,620
that might not be helpful for them,

1943
01:13:58,620 --> 01:14:00,660
so that they get more skeptical

1944
01:14:00,660 --> 01:14:03,810
and try to take the limited
variation that they have

1945
01:14:03,810 --> 01:14:04,680
with a grain of salt.

1946
01:14:04,680 --> 01:14:06,180
You're never gonna have
all the information

1947
01:14:06,180 --> 01:14:08,850
that you ever need to make a
completely accurate decision.

1948
01:14:08,850 --> 01:14:12,241
So how do you operate with
limited or imperfect information?

1949
01:14:12,241 --> 01:14:15,347
Have you guys ever seen any red herrings

1950
01:14:15,347 --> 01:14:19,470
in these simulations or in
the ones that you've developed

1951
01:14:19,470 --> 01:14:22,503
that people either latch
onto or take the wrong way?

1952
01:14:23,790 --> 01:14:25,031
- Open source malware.

1953
01:14:25,031 --> 01:14:27,457
(Winnona laughing)

1954
01:14:27,457 --> 01:14:29,550
Definitely doing those sorts of analyses.

1955
01:14:29,550 --> 01:14:30,960
And that goes back into

1956
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:35,412
the threat intelligence type
capture flag or simulations

1957
01:14:35,412 --> 01:14:37,113
that I've helped design.

1958
01:14:38,250 --> 01:14:39,990
Especially going into like,

1959
01:14:39,990 --> 01:14:42,113
how much do you trust
your threat intel feeds?

1960
01:14:42,113 --> 01:14:42,946
(Winnona laughing)

1961
01:14:42,946 --> 01:14:46,062
But that's probably a
different panel, but definitely

1962
01:14:46,062 --> 01:14:49,440
when you're talking about
the technical accuracy

1963
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:52,020
and understanding what
your assumptions are,

1964
01:14:52,020 --> 01:14:54,633
and not relying just on
what a vendor is saying,

1965
01:14:56,072 --> 01:14:58,920
or making sure that you
have the right context

1966
01:14:58,920 --> 01:15:00,780
when you're making those decisions.

1967
01:15:00,780 --> 01:15:03,780
- I think that dealing with
uncertainty is always a takeaway

1968
01:15:03,780 --> 01:15:05,537
from the tabletop exercises.

1969
01:15:05,537 --> 01:15:08,160
Folks try and sort of
weasel out of it where like,

1970
01:15:08,160 --> 01:15:09,900
you have to put out a
press statement right now.

1971
01:15:09,900 --> 01:15:10,733
What are you gonna say?

1972
01:15:10,733 --> 01:15:12,440
And they say, well, it
will sort of depend on

1973
01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:14,190
what the initial attack path was

1974
01:15:14,190 --> 01:15:15,780
and what the point of entry was.

1975
01:15:15,780 --> 01:15:17,550
And we're like, well, you don't know that.

1976
01:15:17,550 --> 01:15:18,713
You're not gonna know that.

1977
01:15:18,713 --> 01:15:20,280
And so, you might not
find out for several days

1978
01:15:20,280 --> 01:15:22,521
and you still need to make a decision.

1979
01:15:22,521 --> 01:15:24,197
That's something that's
really difficult to drill in.

1980
01:15:24,197 --> 01:15:27,833
'Cause I think when it's
a PowerPoint or something,

1981
01:15:27,833 --> 01:15:29,460
it feels like not real.

1982
01:15:29,460 --> 01:15:31,980
And it feels like because
it's vague, you'll just say,

1983
01:15:31,980 --> 01:15:33,897
well, if it was like
this, I would do this.

1984
01:15:33,897 --> 01:15:35,490
And if it was like this, I would do this,

1985
01:15:35,490 --> 01:15:36,360
and that's my answer.

1986
01:15:36,360 --> 01:15:38,160
And we have to sort of
pin them down and say,

1987
01:15:38,160 --> 01:15:39,780
you don't know the answer

1988
01:15:39,780 --> 01:15:41,768
and you still have to make a decision.

1989
01:15:41,768 --> 01:15:44,550
So to your point, I think
no one's really prepared

1990
01:15:44,550 --> 01:15:45,780
to deal with that sort of uncertainty.

1991
01:15:45,780 --> 01:15:47,250
But that's something we try and emulate.

1992
01:15:47,250 --> 01:15:49,110
We, on purpose, don't give
them enough information

1993
01:15:49,110 --> 01:15:51,030
to make a decision, 'cause
they're not gonna have that

1994
01:15:51,030 --> 01:15:51,873
in real life.

1995
01:15:52,980 --> 01:15:53,994
- Thanks for that.

1996
01:15:53,994 --> 01:15:54,827
I think, and opening this up to the room,

1997
01:15:54,827 --> 01:15:56,010
we have some new folks in the room.

1998
01:15:56,010 --> 01:15:58,600
Please, if you would
like to ask a question

1999
01:15:58,600 --> 01:16:00,517
or drop a comment, please make your way

2000
01:16:00,517 --> 01:16:01,890
over to a microphone.

2001
01:16:01,890 --> 01:16:03,319
The acoustics in here is not great.

2002
01:16:03,319 --> 01:16:04,690
Please, sir.

2003
01:16:04,690 --> 01:16:07,230
- [Audience Member] I'd be
interested in your thoughts

2004
01:16:07,230 --> 01:16:10,020
in terms of global corporations

2005
01:16:10,020 --> 01:16:12,810
with multi-international regulations.

2006
01:16:12,810 --> 01:16:17,760
When doing a tabletop,
trying to unpick the way

2007
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:20,670
that sometimes regulations
conflict each other

2008
01:16:20,670 --> 01:16:22,303
because of a lack of international,

2009
01:16:22,303 --> 01:16:25,200
sort of single coherent approach.

2010
01:16:25,200 --> 01:16:28,590
So I'd just be interested in
how people have overcome that

2011
01:16:28,590 --> 01:16:30,840
in their tabletops, in
that type of scenario.

2012
01:16:33,030 --> 01:16:34,080
- Can you rephrase that?

2013
01:16:34,080 --> 01:16:36,390
Are you asking about how we
make sure that they're aware

2014
01:16:36,390 --> 01:16:37,950
of regulatory requirements?

2015
01:16:37,950 --> 01:16:39,030
- [Audience Member] Well I think,

2016
01:16:39,030 --> 01:16:40,337
if you've got a global corporation

2017
01:16:40,337 --> 01:16:42,780
and they're working in different regions,

2018
01:16:42,780 --> 01:16:46,530
then typically, the regulations
can sometimes not be as one.

2019
01:16:46,530 --> 01:16:49,999
And then with the lack of a
single international policy

2020
01:16:49,999 --> 01:16:52,170
in terms of cyber security,

2021
01:16:52,170 --> 01:16:55,980
that absolutely complicates
the matter even further.

2022
01:16:55,980 --> 01:16:59,273
So if you're trying to do a ransomware,

2023
01:16:59,273 --> 01:17:00,360
well not necessarily a ransomware.

2024
01:17:00,360 --> 01:17:01,890
If you're trying to do a tabletop

2025
01:17:01,890 --> 01:17:05,730
and run that within that
complicated scenario,

2026
01:17:05,730 --> 01:17:10,680
any thoughts of how best to
run that type of situation?

2027
01:17:10,680 --> 01:17:12,810
- Yeah, this is a bit of a non-answer,

2028
01:17:12,810 --> 01:17:15,150
but we try and scope them to one country,

2029
01:17:15,150 --> 01:17:18,270
because there's usually
enough that could go wrong

2030
01:17:18,270 --> 01:17:21,570
even within one country that
there is some takeaways there.

2031
01:17:21,570 --> 01:17:22,740
But sometimes we'll do, you know,

2032
01:17:22,740 --> 01:17:24,150
there's an office in New York

2033
01:17:24,150 --> 01:17:25,770
and there's one in Singapore or something,

2034
01:17:25,770 --> 01:17:28,009
and they're both under attack
or they both lost data.

2035
01:17:28,009 --> 01:17:30,810
And then we sort of repeat a
lot of the questions, right?

2036
01:17:30,810 --> 01:17:31,710
Do you have external counsel?

2037
01:17:31,710 --> 01:17:32,790
But do you have external counsel

2038
01:17:32,790 --> 01:17:35,670
in all the different countries
that you're operating in?

2039
01:17:35,670 --> 01:17:37,230
Do you have a data privacy officer

2040
01:17:37,230 --> 01:17:38,063
in all the different countries

2041
01:17:38,063 --> 01:17:39,930
that's tracking those requirements?

2042
01:17:39,930 --> 01:17:42,206
So we don't do it as often, but...

2043
01:17:42,206 --> 01:17:43,039
- [Audience Member] Yeah, no.

2044
01:17:43,039 --> 01:17:44,665
I was just gonna pick up an earlier point

2045
01:17:44,665 --> 01:17:46,410
that we've talked about, law enforcement,

2046
01:17:46,410 --> 01:17:50,889
where most of the narrative
was about engaging them.

2047
01:17:50,889 --> 01:17:53,820
And then there is
situations where actually,

2048
01:17:53,820 --> 01:17:55,200
they engage you first off.

2049
01:17:55,200 --> 01:17:58,350
Because you weren't aware that
something has happened, so.

2050
01:17:58,350 --> 01:18:00,580
And I've had a situation

2051
01:18:01,847 --> 01:18:06,060
where a law enforcement
international organization contacted

2052
01:18:06,060 --> 01:18:07,631
a global company and then,

2053
01:18:07,631 --> 01:18:10,143
what were the actions that
were taken thereafter?

2054
01:18:11,580 --> 01:18:12,960
- I'd also add, I think it's important

2055
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:15,570
to have tabletops done
by teams in the country

2056
01:18:15,570 --> 01:18:17,220
in which you're operating in.

2057
01:18:17,220 --> 01:18:19,110
If someone really does have, whoops,

2058
01:18:19,110 --> 01:18:20,956
different global offices
that they want us to test,

2059
01:18:20,956 --> 01:18:22,980
we would try and get
folks who actually live

2060
01:18:22,980 --> 01:18:24,710
in those countries to run
those tabletop exercises

2061
01:18:24,710 --> 01:18:27,000
in the native language and who
have a better understanding

2062
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,350
of the requirements of
that country than we do.

2063
01:18:31,201 --> 01:18:33,150
- If I can chime on that locality piece

2064
01:18:33,150 --> 01:18:33,983
is really interesting.

2065
01:18:33,983 --> 01:18:36,120
'Cause I know we've done that
with Cyber 9/12 scenarios

2066
01:18:36,120 --> 01:18:37,969
where if we're operating
in another country,

2067
01:18:37,969 --> 01:18:42,030
we have to have a local partner
that's either a university

2068
01:18:42,030 --> 01:18:44,130
or a think tank that includes researchers,

2069
01:18:44,130 --> 01:18:44,970
so that we can make sure

2070
01:18:44,970 --> 01:18:46,980
that we're developing
a scenario that's, one,

2071
01:18:46,980 --> 01:18:48,090
compelling for the students.

2072
01:18:48,090 --> 01:18:50,970
But also, two, it's helping
them build muscle memory

2073
01:18:50,970 --> 01:18:53,550
with specific challenges
or gain some familiarity

2074
01:18:53,550 --> 01:18:55,896
with specific legislation
that is important to them.

2075
01:18:55,896 --> 01:18:58,200
One, it's good for them to
have that understanding,

2076
01:18:58,200 --> 01:18:59,790
but then two, it makes
them more marketable

2077
01:18:59,790 --> 01:19:00,960
when they go to apply for a job,

2078
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:03,617
because they have that understanding.

2079
01:19:03,617 --> 01:19:04,890
- [Audience Member] Yeah, and I also found

2080
01:19:04,890 --> 01:19:06,233
which takes precedence.

2081
01:19:06,233 --> 01:19:08,490
So if you've got multi countries,

2082
01:19:08,490 --> 01:19:11,240
which one are you gonna take
first as a prioritization?

2083
01:19:12,280 --> 01:19:13,920
- And I can actually kind of answer that

2084
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:16,410
because our Geneva scenario
is really fascinating

2085
01:19:16,410 --> 01:19:19,200
in that sense where it's
in Geneva, Switzerland.

2086
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:21,150
It includes competitors
from all over Europe

2087
01:19:21,150 --> 01:19:24,750
and also in the US and Asia.

2088
01:19:24,750 --> 01:19:26,520
But usually if we do want to focus

2089
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:27,778
on an international aspect,

2090
01:19:27,778 --> 01:19:29,610
Europe is a pretty good place for that.

2091
01:19:29,610 --> 01:19:31,110
You can look at the EU as a structure.

2092
01:19:31,110 --> 01:19:32,242
You can look at NATO as a structure.

2093
01:19:32,242 --> 01:19:35,036
We do have a track record of
pushing students to the EU,

2094
01:19:35,036 --> 01:19:37,350
so they can get familiar
with that legislation

2095
01:19:37,350 --> 01:19:39,218
that exists at the supernational level.

2096
01:19:39,218 --> 01:19:41,394
But it also challenges them to look at

2097
01:19:41,394 --> 01:19:43,830
where is the incident actually occurring

2098
01:19:43,830 --> 01:19:45,109
in that one particular country?

2099
01:19:45,109 --> 01:19:47,880
Is it impacting folks in other countries,

2100
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:49,080
and how do they wanna respond to that?

2101
01:19:49,080 --> 01:19:51,347
Is there a component that
might have to bring in NATO?

2102
01:19:51,347 --> 01:19:53,400
It can get a lot stickier and challenging,

2103
01:19:53,400 --> 01:19:55,410
but it's a good exercise,
I think, for students,

2104
01:19:55,410 --> 01:19:58,170
especially if they do
wanna work on a policy team

2105
01:19:58,170 --> 01:19:59,933
at an organization like
a Microsoft or Facebook.

2106
01:19:59,933 --> 01:20:02,730
They're gonna have to be
familiar with scaling up

2107
01:20:02,730 --> 01:20:04,590
or down in terms of which legislation

2108
01:20:04,590 --> 01:20:07,593
or government entities they're
gonna be interacting with.

2109
01:20:09,547 --> 01:20:10,380
- [Audience Member] Hey, everyone.

2110
01:20:10,380 --> 01:20:11,213
So I'm Gerov from Singapore.

2111
01:20:11,213 --> 01:20:12,900
I don't know if you just
randomly mentioned Singapore,

2112
01:20:12,900 --> 01:20:15,340
if it was a specific thing,
but I thought I'd jump in.

2113
01:20:15,340 --> 01:20:17,280
So we actually end up
having a lot of companies

2114
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:18,660
who have presence in Singapore

2115
01:20:18,660 --> 01:20:20,250
and obviously presence
everywhere else in the world.

2116
01:20:20,250 --> 01:20:23,144
And we have tabletop exercises.

2117
01:20:23,144 --> 01:20:24,870
There are two types of questions.

2118
01:20:24,870 --> 01:20:26,460
One is the policy question.

2119
01:20:26,460 --> 01:20:28,110
The other is a tabletop question.

2120
01:20:28,110 --> 01:20:32,340
The policy question of how
do different non-mutually,

2121
01:20:32,340 --> 01:20:34,680
non-integrated international
laws work together?

2122
01:20:34,680 --> 01:20:36,180
That's a policy question.

2123
01:20:36,180 --> 01:20:37,197
Sometimes they don't.

2124
01:20:37,197 --> 01:20:39,660
And I don't think the
tabletop people can answer

2125
01:20:39,660 --> 01:20:41,340
that question fairly.

2126
01:20:41,340 --> 01:20:44,940
So that is a bigger
international policy regulation,

2127
01:20:44,940 --> 01:20:48,269
legislation question,
which has no good answer.

2128
01:20:48,269 --> 01:20:51,860
But the tabletop question,
which is actually quite useful,

2129
01:20:51,860 --> 01:20:54,346
is sometimes just get
people to walk through that.

2130
01:20:54,346 --> 01:20:57,538
So in Singapore we have an
incident response disclosure

2131
01:20:57,538 --> 01:20:59,580
or incident disclosure policy,

2132
01:20:59,580 --> 01:21:02,160
which is in two hours
or something like that.

2133
01:21:02,160 --> 01:21:04,320
And other countries have 72 hours.

2134
01:21:04,320 --> 01:21:06,570
So we tell them, so you
have an incident now

2135
01:21:06,570 --> 01:21:09,660
which is impacting your Singapore systems,

2136
01:21:09,660 --> 01:21:13,470
and your Hong Kong systems,
and your British systems.

2137
01:21:13,470 --> 01:21:15,120
What do you do?

2138
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:17,910
And then they will have
to internally figure out

2139
01:21:17,910 --> 01:21:19,410
what is their process?

2140
01:21:19,410 --> 01:21:20,730
Who do they contact first?

2141
01:21:20,730 --> 01:21:23,100
Do they alert the
Singapore authorities first

2142
01:21:23,100 --> 01:21:26,340
and then risk having
activated the Hong Kong

2143
01:21:26,340 --> 01:21:28,833
and British authorities prematurely?

2144
01:21:29,675 --> 01:21:32,790
That's for them to answer,
but at least you force them

2145
01:21:32,790 --> 01:21:34,830
to have that conversation internally.

2146
01:21:34,830 --> 01:21:36,893
And then they realize that
the Singapore lawyer team

2147
01:21:36,893 --> 01:21:38,600
doesn't have the contact information

2148
01:21:38,600 --> 01:21:40,309
of the Hong Kong law
team, or they didn't know

2149
01:21:40,309 --> 01:21:43,740
that they have a different
disclosure policy

2150
01:21:43,740 --> 01:21:44,760
in other countries.

2151
01:21:44,760 --> 01:21:46,590
So sometimes the tabletop
exercise is just to get people

2152
01:21:46,590 --> 01:21:48,240
to understand that there are differences

2153
01:21:48,240 --> 01:21:50,220
and that they need to start
internally thinking about

2154
01:21:50,220 --> 01:21:52,863
that problem, even if there
is no good answer to it.

2155
01:21:55,679 --> 01:21:56,990
- Thanks for that, Gerov.

2156
01:21:56,990 --> 01:22:00,435
I know that we're getting
close to closing time.

2157
01:22:00,435 --> 01:22:02,910
Really appreciate you
guys joining us today.

2158
01:22:02,910 --> 01:22:05,520
I wanna turn over to Winnona and Sarah,

2159
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:06,750
if they have any last comments

2160
01:22:06,750 --> 01:22:07,800
or things that they wanted to add

2161
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:11,160
before we break up the session.

2162
01:22:11,160 --> 01:22:12,720
- Yeah, I'll say one thing.

2163
01:22:12,720 --> 01:22:14,550
I think that with table,

2164
01:22:14,550 --> 01:22:16,800
we talked about giving feedback earlier.

2165
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:19,230
We can really only give
feedback for the couple hours

2166
01:22:19,230 --> 01:22:20,233
that we see folks.

2167
01:22:20,233 --> 01:22:22,440
We really, tabletops are really good

2168
01:22:22,440 --> 01:22:23,945
for understanding people and processes.

2169
01:22:23,945 --> 01:22:26,340
They're not as good for poking holes

2170
01:22:26,340 --> 01:22:28,440
in actual cybersecurity maturity

2171
01:22:28,440 --> 01:22:32,610
and what folks need to be
prioritizing for their practice.

2172
01:22:32,610 --> 01:22:33,443
So I'll just say that.

2173
01:22:33,443 --> 01:22:36,150
I think they're very good
for particular purposes

2174
01:22:36,150 --> 01:22:39,764
for escalating cybersecurity
importance to management,

2175
01:22:39,764 --> 01:22:42,300
but there is a limited
amount of information

2176
01:22:42,300 --> 01:22:44,880
that we're able to give feedback on.

2177
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:47,013
And so I just wanna throw that out there.

2178
01:22:48,090 --> 01:22:50,910
- Yeah, I guess I have a
twofer for a last remark.

2179
01:22:50,910 --> 01:22:52,080
I guess the first thing is,

2180
01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:55,920
I know we've talked about
more of the technical side

2181
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:57,720
of the tabletops versus the policy.

2182
01:22:57,720 --> 01:22:59,340
And when those two integrate,

2183
01:22:59,340 --> 01:23:00,540
the one thing that I wanna stress

2184
01:23:00,540 --> 01:23:05,540
is I have seen so many technical
tabletops go really well,

2185
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:08,550
but when they're
communicated in a certain way

2186
01:23:08,550 --> 01:23:11,430
to a decision maker, there's
a complete disconnect,

2187
01:23:11,430 --> 01:23:12,867
even though they both want the same thing.

2188
01:23:12,867 --> 01:23:15,270
And I think that one of
the pieces of feedback

2189
01:23:15,270 --> 01:23:17,730
that I personally try to give,

2190
01:23:17,730 --> 01:23:19,560
especially when I see that disconnect,

2191
01:23:19,560 --> 01:23:22,951
is to talk about technical
aspects in terms of risk,

2192
01:23:22,951 --> 01:23:26,430
in terms of monetary value
versus what needs to be fixed

2193
01:23:26,430 --> 01:23:29,400
and what they need to
best describe the problem

2194
01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:30,233
to their principle;

2195
01:23:30,233 --> 01:23:34,230
and then vice versa, going
from high level to low level.

2196
01:23:34,230 --> 01:23:36,491
And then last but not least, if anyone is,

2197
01:23:36,491 --> 01:23:37,950
I know we got that feedback

2198
01:23:37,950 --> 01:23:40,830
of why don't we have a tabletop
exercise for DEF CON policy?

2199
01:23:40,830 --> 01:23:43,110
If anyone is interested in leading that,

2200
01:23:43,110 --> 01:23:44,370
we have a one year lead up,

2201
01:23:44,370 --> 01:23:47,820
so (laughs) come talk to us after.

2202
01:23:47,820 --> 01:23:49,710
But yeah, thank you for
this opportunity, Safa.

2203
01:23:49,710 --> 01:23:51,840
- I wanna foot stomp that, Winnona.

2204
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:53,250
If you have any comments
or feedback for us,

2205
01:23:53,250 --> 01:23:54,083
please let us know.

2206
01:23:54,083 --> 01:23:55,740
We're really just trying to keep improving

2207
01:23:55,740 --> 01:23:56,610
and growing this program.

2208
01:23:56,610 --> 01:23:59,400
And if I can do one shameless plug,

2209
01:23:59,400 --> 01:24:01,410
if you're interested in cyber simulations

2210
01:24:01,410 --> 01:24:03,990
that are multidisciplinary,
take a look at Atlantic Council,

2211
01:24:03,990 --> 01:24:06,669
Cyber 9/12, that's our
student competition.

2212
01:24:06,669 --> 01:24:08,190
If you're interested in learning more,

2213
01:24:08,190 --> 01:24:09,780
we do have some playbooks on the website

2214
01:24:09,780 --> 01:24:11,760
that folks can rummage through.

2215
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:13,577
In addition to that, we also have a,

2216
01:24:13,577 --> 01:24:15,660
I know we didn't get that
much into storytelling

2217
01:24:15,660 --> 01:24:17,070
for this session, but
I really wanted to lean

2218
01:24:17,070 --> 01:24:18,377
into the bargaining aspects

2219
01:24:18,377 --> 01:24:20,940
since folks were really
interested in that.

2220
01:24:20,940 --> 01:24:24,030
We do have a short story series
called the Cyber Moonshot,

2221
01:24:24,030 --> 01:24:26,700
which kind of makes fun
of the Cyber Moonshot,

2222
01:24:26,700 --> 01:24:29,100
but examines cybersecurity
concepts and challenges

2223
01:24:29,100 --> 01:24:31,320
through a comedic story.

2224
01:24:31,320 --> 01:24:32,850
But definitely recommend
that folks take a look

2225
01:24:32,850 --> 01:24:34,291
at those two items.

2226
01:24:34,291 --> 01:24:35,178
- Great.

2227
01:24:35,178 --> 01:24:36,011
- Thank you.

2228
01:24:36,011 --> 01:24:36,900
- Thank you so much, Safa.

2229
01:24:36,900 --> 01:24:37,920
- Thanks everyone for joining us.

2230
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:38,753
- Thank you, guys.

2231
01:24:38,753 --> 01:24:39,960
- And I think the next session

2232
01:24:39,960 --> 01:24:41,460
in this room is gonna be at noon.

2233
01:24:41,460 --> 01:24:43,410
It's gonna be hacking aviation po-

2234
01:24:43,410 --> 01:24:44,243
No, I'm lying.

2235
01:24:44,243 --> 01:24:45,076
Sorry.

2236
01:24:45,076 --> 01:24:45,909
(Winnona laughing)

2237
01:24:45,909 --> 01:24:46,920
It's gonna be addressing the gap between

2238
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:49,817
and assessing or measuring
the HARMer cyber attacks.

2239
01:24:49,817 --> 01:24:50,790
(audience applauding)

2240
01:24:50,790 --> 01:24:51,623
- Thank you.

2241
01:24:51,623 --> 01:24:52,956
Thank you, guys!
