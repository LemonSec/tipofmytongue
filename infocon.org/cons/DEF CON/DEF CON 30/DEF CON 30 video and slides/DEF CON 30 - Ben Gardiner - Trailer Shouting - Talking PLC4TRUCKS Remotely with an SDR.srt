1
00:00:00,207 --> 00:00:02,463
- All right, so to start
this off officially,

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,830
Ben Gardner and Chris
Poore are here to talk

3
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:12,240
to you about trailer shouting.

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,290
Please help me welcome them to the stage.

5
00:00:19,429 --> 00:00:20,487
- Thanks everybody.

6
00:00:21,561 --> 00:00:23,461
- [Man] Also, waters
are here for you guys.

7
00:00:23,461 --> 00:00:25,380
- That's going to be
needed. Thank you very much.

8
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,360
So, yeah, Chris and I are here to talk

9
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,550
to you about some
research that we have done

10
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:32,430
together with NMFTA and AIS.

11
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:35,614
Should be 45 minutes. I
hope we are going to end.

12
00:00:35,614 --> 00:00:37,470
It's definitely gonna be 45 minutes.

13
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:38,910
We are gonna end with a demo video.

14
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:42,180
So they said that actually
trying to do this remote

15
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:44,850
induction attack on stage
in this RF environment

16
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:46,110
was a bad idea.

17
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:48,503
You're probably right. So
you'll see a video instead.

18
00:00:49,349 --> 00:00:50,820
First about us.

19
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:51,870
I'm Ben Gardner

20
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:54,300
with the National Motor
Freight Traffic Association.

21
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,310
I'm a cyber security
research engineer there.

22
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:59,280
I have a career in reverse engineering

23
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,960
and embedded systems development,

24
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,640
and I like to volunteer at various things.

25
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,980
And I've had the pleasure
of being an instructor

26
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:07,950
at the cyber truck
challenge for every year.

27
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:09,960
And this is Chris Poore.

28
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,140
- Hi, I'm Chris Poore

29
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:13,230
and I'm a senior reverse engineer

30
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:15,540
at Assured Information Security.

31
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:16,920
My company does a lot of things,

32
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,800
but one of them is work
with people like Ben here

33
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,990
to find vulnerabilities and come up

34
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:23,913
with me mitigations for those.

35
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:27,420
You may see me yesterday
at the demo labs showing

36
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,970
off Fissure, the RF framework.

37
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:32,130
Some of the tools in
this talk are included

38
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:33,840
with that software, so check it out

39
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,240
at my companies Github
page if you get a chance.

40
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:41,700
- And it goes without saying that Chris

41
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,560
and I are just the lucky
two people that are up here

42
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,810
on stage we're, we're part
of a much larger team.

43
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:48,030
I actually see one of
them in the audience.

44
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:52,230
So Dan Salone right there,
Eric, there is on our team.

45
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:54,510
We had some anonymous
people as well, help us out.

46
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:55,410
And of course,

47
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:57,270
what we've done would
not have been possible

48
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:58,800
without the member fleets.

49
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,320
The people that own the
trucks that our members

50
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,483
of the NMFTA so big thanks to them.

51
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:08,130
So we're here to tell you
about an issue with J24-97,

52
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:11,370
also known as PLC4Trucks and for you

53
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,511
to understand the issue, you have to know

54
00:02:13,511 --> 00:02:14,640
what is this PLC4Trucks?

55
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,770
The PLC that we're talking about

56
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:19,170
is not programmable logic controllers.

57
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:22,380
It's the other PLC it's
power line communications.

58
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:24,810
This technology dates all
the way back to the 1950s

59
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:27,060
when it was introduced as ripple control

60
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:30,220
and has been applied all
over the place since then.

61
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:32,790
You can see a chart here
from Xavier Carcelle

62
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:34,200
that has a survey of a bunch

63
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,396
of different types of technologies.

64
00:02:36,396 --> 00:02:39,060
Today, you might be most familiar

65
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:42,600
with power line carrier when
you're dealing with HomePlug,

66
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,120
if you have ever installed
ethernet adapters

67
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,280
that plug into your AC main

68
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,780
and they extend your ethernet network,

69
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,190
that's HomePlug.

70
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:53,040
HomePlug is also found in
the combined charging system

71
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,690
for plug-in electric vehicles.

72
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:57,870
And that's a reduced subset
called HomePlug GreenPhy.

73
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:00,180
That technology is actually
produced originally

74
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,780
by Intelon which was
bought then by Atheros

75
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,850
and then was bought by Qualcomm.

76
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:07,710
And you can see there's
a whole bunch of Intellon

77
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:11,610
in this power line carrier
chart from Xavier Carcelle.

78
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:12,810
This talk though is really

79
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:15,030
about a different Intellon technology.

80
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:18,240
They made it in the SSCP-485

81
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,150
and PLC4Trucks has been
around for 30 years.

82
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:23,220
So it kind of fits into
the chart right there.

83
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:26,370
It has some similarities
with the CE Bus technology

84
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:28,350
that you can see pictured.

85
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:29,520
Similar frequency ranges,

86
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:32,190
but the signaling is slightly different.

87
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:35,970
And this talk is not
about HPGP or HomePlug,

88
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:38,523
it's about this weird
PLC4Trucks technology.

89
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:44,190
The reason we have it is
actually that you needed

90
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:46,920
to send trailer fault
data from the trailer up

91
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,800
into the tractor and the
fleets wouldn't accept

92
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,910
any more connectors.

93
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:52,860
So they added Power Line Carrier

94
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,990
onto the existing 12 volt line to send

95
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:56,313
that data over to you,

96
00:03:58,097 --> 00:04:00,210
PLC4Trucks was implemented

97
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:02,940
as a spread spectrum technology.

98
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:05,670
You can see we're showing you
where it sits in the spectrum,

99
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:07,650
which is down in the a hundred
to 400 kilohertz range.

100
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:08,820
It's much wider than a lot

101
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,350
of the other power line
carrier technologies

102
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:11,880
that are out there.

103
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:15,000
It was developed to be
sort of a bridge for UART.

104
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,510
So as an analogy, when
you bridge ethernet,

105
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:20,340
you're obviously putting
ethernet power lines.

106
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:24,540
This technology is like you
UART over power lines on trucks.

107
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:27,240
The chirps go up and down in frequency,

108
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:31,890
and they last about 400 microseconds each,

109
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:34,650
but they get put together into
larger millisecond messages.

110
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:35,880
And if you see it on your
spectrum spectrogram,

111
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,130
you might see these horizontal lines

112
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:40,200
because it's a spread spectrum
technology that's short

113
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,960
in time, and that's a waterfall plot there

114
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,610
on top of that chart,

115
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:46,830
the signaling is actually pretty clever.

116
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:49,830
It has a different preamble
and a different body.

117
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:52,110
In the preamble, it uses
amplitude shift keying,

118
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:55,680
and then it switches over to
phase shift keying in the body,

119
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,950
using the same chirps with
slightly different timings.

120
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:00,990
And there's a lot of kind of
interesting design decisions

121
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:02,520
that are put in here.

122
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,400
And most of them were
made for this reason.

123
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,770
To make it wire compatible
with the technology

124
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:09,873
that predates it called J1708.

125
00:05:12,851 --> 00:05:14,910
So they made this chip, the SSC P485.

126
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:16,260
That's a bidirectional bridge.

127
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:18,090
If it receives 1708 messages,

128
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:20,789
it wraps them in additional
information for the preamble

129
00:05:20,789 --> 00:05:23,578
and these signalings that you
can kind of see highlighted

130
00:05:23,578 --> 00:05:26,100
on the outsides of the
message on the bottom here.

131
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,500
And if it receives that on
power line, it does the reverse,

132
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,840
it creates the J1708 message in response.

133
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,300
So it's this bidirectional
transparent link

134
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,630
that kind of bridges the
J1708 UART technology

135
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:37,623
over power line.

136
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,330
So another J standard that
you need to understand, sorry,

137
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:44,193
it's J1708, what is this thing?

138
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:47,220
1708 predates J1939,

139
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,680
which would be the normal
way that you would deal

140
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,860
with communications on trucks today.

141
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:55,080
J1708 was introduced for
really the same reason

142
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,260
that CAN was introduced, it's
to move time varying signals

143
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,310
around the vehicle.

144
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:01,470
So they would pack the
data into small fields

145
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:02,850
and move them in smaller frames.

146
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:04,830
So they could have just two wires instead

147
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:07,200
of one wire per signal, right.

148
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:11,400
So a lot of 1708 is actually
encoded in J1587 messages,

149
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,230
which is like the application layer

150
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:16,200
that defines exactly how
everything is packed together.

151
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:19,470
So by an analogy you can
kind of think of J1587

152
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:22,770
as the data standard like J1939 is,

153
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:24,510
on top of CAN,

154
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:29,100
but here you can put
J1587 on top of J2497,

155
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,750
or you can put it on top of J1708.

156
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:35,423
So 2497 is just like an
alternative transport for J1587.

157
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,380
Now 1587 has more than just
the time during messages

158
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:43,710
that it was intended
for during mission time.

159
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:45,870
All the diagnostics are put in there also,

160
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:47,670
and there's data link escape messages

161
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:50,170
that people use for
doing their diagnostics

162
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,010
and 2487 adds one other thing,

163
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:56,790
which is dynamic address
claim for the MIDs,

164
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:58,350
which makes it a little bit different.

165
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:03,180
So that's kind of our crash
course on J2497 and J1708.

166
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,820
There is a lot of other
details in the previous talks

167
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,560
that Chris and I have done as well as

168
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,908
in Dan Sloan's talk on
1708 that you can find

169
00:07:09,908 --> 00:07:11,883
on the media server.

170
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:16,260
So this technology was
introduced, as I said,

171
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:19,470
to move the fault
information from the trailer

172
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:21,210
to the tractor,

173
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:24,690
but it didn't come without a
little bit of funny business.

174
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:26,040
And we'll talk to you about the patents

175
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,533
that surround this technology.

176
00:07:29,927 --> 00:07:31,500
Back in the 1990s,

177
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,020
NHTSA had been telling
the fleet for some time

178
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,030
that they were gonna require

179
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:38,640
that the trailer fault
information was displayed

180
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:42,093
on the dash of the truck and
they knew this was coming.

181
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,501
And so the industry
actually worked together

182
00:07:45,501 --> 00:07:47,640
to select how they would do this

183
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,870
without adding another connector,

184
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:50,370
because the fleet said they couldn't have

185
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:53,340
another connector added between
the tractor and the trailer.

186
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,470
And they actually settled on
this technology PLC4Trucks.

187
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:58,350
And you can see the quote
here that it was selected

188
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:01,893
because it was generic and
wouldn't have any licensing,

189
00:08:03,201 --> 00:08:07,710
but surprise, unfortunately,
the next year,

190
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:09,897
SAE actually withdrew
its blessing of J2497,

191
00:08:09,897 --> 00:08:13,410
because there was someone
that was in the meetings

192
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:15,600
and filing patents around
what they had been hearing

193
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,650
in the development of these technologies.

194
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:23,370
So eventually what happened
is everyone that was involved

195
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:25,980
did end up paying licensing
fees to the individual

196
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,120
that held the patent,

197
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,340
including the company
that bought his company

198
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:31,650
since the licensing had to
be done to the individual.

199
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:33,990
And that was a bit of a surprise too.

200
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:38,990
And SAE did eventually issue
the draft anyways for J2497,

201
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:40,830
despite the patents.

202
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:42,750
I was told that at one meeting,

203
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:46,050
this individual walked in and
was given an award for J2497

204
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:49,170
and then asked to leave the
room, which is kind of funny.

205
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:51,030
And this also, this part is disputed,

206
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,040
but I've also been told
that the reason we read

207
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,690
those IP disclosure and patent statements,

208
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:56,970
and I see some SAE people in the room,

209
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:58,290
we read those every single time

210
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:01,293
because of what happened with J2497.

211
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:06,510
So let me tell you a little
bit about what we've discovered

212
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:08,190
now that you know what this technology is.

213
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:10,140
Previously, Chris and I in 2019,

214
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:12,960
we told everyone that you can read 2497

215
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,550
from a distance of about six to eight feet

216
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:16,200
with active antennas.

217
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,570
Since then Chris has improved
some of the receiver antennas

218
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:20,400
and got those green ones working.

219
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,500
And I hope you tell people
about the other thing

220
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,333
down the road.

221
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,280
Today, we're happy to tell you that

222
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:29,130
not only can you read this traffic,

223
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:30,510
you can also write it.

224
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:31,960
So it's possible to write it.

225
00:09:33,138 --> 00:09:34,890
The distances and the
powers involved vary.

226
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:36,833
And I'll tell you a little bit about that.

227
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:40,710
When we were dealing with
CISA to get the CVE allocated

228
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:42,600
and to do this disclosure process,

229
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,670
one of the things that
was kind of difficult

230
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:48,210
was they need to do a
categorization to CVEs.

231
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:51,720
They have to put a CWE against the CVE,

232
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,700
but there really isn't a common weakness

233
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,220
for inducing RF messages.

234
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,630
And the closest thing
they could come up with

235
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:00,780
is this improper protection against EMFI

236
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:04,080
which is electromagnetic
fault injection protections,

237
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,209
which is something that you might assign

238
00:10:06,209 --> 00:10:07,320
to a microprocessor that isn't guarded

239
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,520
against fault injection.

240
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:11,880
Hence the title of the
talk, "Trailer Shouting",

241
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,703
which is a nod to the
amazing Colonel Flynn.

242
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:18,240
And then finally there was other research

243
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,670
that's been put out about HPGP,

244
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:24,243
which is that combined
charging system technology

245
00:10:24,243 --> 00:10:26,583
that we talked about
earlier from Intellon.

246
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:29,460
Back in 2019, when we said you could read

247
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:32,880
the technology, the PLC4Trucks remotely,

248
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,070
Martinovic and baker
from Oxford University.

249
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:37,353
They put out research saying that, yeah,

250
00:10:37,353 --> 00:10:38,190
you can actually read HBGP remotely

251
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:40,200
from charging stations and roughly

252
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,550
at about the same time that we did

253
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:44,100
our coordinated disclosure
for this remote right

254
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,470
They also put in another
paper called "Broken Wire"

255
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:48,360
which shows that they can interrupt

256
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,940
the HPGP charging sessions.

257
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,920
The big difference between the research

258
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,150
that they released this year and ours

259
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:58,020
is that we're writing valid
J2497 messages onto the bus.

260
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:00,030
We're not interrupting the communication.

261
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:02,103
We can create brand new valid messages.

262
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:06,300
So this is how our testing works.

263
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:09,240
We set up this antenna next to the trailer

264
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,130
at varying distances.

265
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:13,530
We start close, we play something

266
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:14,790
we call the Unichuff signal,

267
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:17,190
which is a recording of all the possible

268
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:19,410
solenoid test commands, which
are diagnostic commands.

269
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:21,180
And I'll tell you more about that.

270
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:24,060
And we play that in a loop
and we dial up the power

271
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:27,120
until we can hear the
trailer breaks, clicking.

272
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,920
We can hear the solenoid test.

273
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,180
And then we know we've confirmed

274
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:33,180
that the trailer equipment
has received that signal.

275
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:35,250
The tables here are a little bit weird

276
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:36,270
and they don't line up.

277
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:40,290
You'll notice that the minimum
power for a distance kind

278
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:43,050
of caps out at different
numbers, unpredictably.

279
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:45,420
And this is because I
had a really bad habit

280
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:49,200
of blowing up the power
amplifiers we were using to test,

281
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,580
and they just wouldn't work.

282
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:52,200
And we would look down
and say, what's going on?

283
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,450
And then we would notice
that the test was invalidated

284
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:55,350
at various points.

285
00:11:56,334 --> 00:11:59,550
And that's why it's 50 here
and 45 in the other location.

286
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:02,850
So yeah, I had a bad
habit of breaking things,

287
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:05,400
but you can see that on the left here,

288
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,470
we have a drive van with metal decking,

289
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:10,050
and it is possible to
actually induce messages

290
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:11,790
on drive vans with metal decking.

291
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:13,830
There is no table for
drive ends of wood decking

292
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:15,540
because we found that we weren't able

293
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:17,940
to get signals induced at any power level,

294
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,440
even for close distances.

295
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,900
So that change from wood
decking to metal decking seems

296
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,640
to make the equipment more susceptible

297
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,590
to the induction of the messages.

298
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:28,230
The one of the middle
is tests on a tanker,

299
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:31,600
and this is really the
most unfortunate situation

300
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,230
for about a hundred dollars US,

301
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:37,050
you can put out 12 watts
at these frequencies,

302
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:39,420
and that is enough power
in our test to get you

303
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,160
from 12 feet away from the trailer

304
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,570
to successfully induce the messages.

305
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:45,930
So for tankers it's particularly bad.

306
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:50,790
And then the third
table on your far right,

307
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:55,140
is when we took drive van
trailers with wood decking,

308
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:57,540
but extended them into
a triple road train.

309
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,880
And once they're in this triple
road train configuration,

310
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,700
then we find that they are
once again susceptible,

311
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:05,040
but the costs involve
end up being much higher

312
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:05,910
than in the tanker case.

313
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:08,670
We estimate upwards of
$10,000 for the kinds

314
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:10,974
of power amplifiers that are required

315
00:13:10,974 --> 00:13:13,023
to accomplish the successful induction.

316
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,320
So we had two CDs issued.

317
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,900
The first is the fact that
you can induce the messages.

318
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,840
The other is sort of
this otherwise non-issue.

319
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,470
The diagnostic software that's implemented

320
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,400
in all these trailer ECU controllers

321
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,040
has no authentication or authorization,

322
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,290
so you can just send the
correct bite sequence

323
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:33,450
at it without any back and
forth challenge response

324
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:35,370
or anything, really, even a password

325
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:36,810
and it'll just respond.

326
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:37,920
And if you think about it,

327
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,440
the era where this
software really comes from

328
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,273
is sort of the '80s

329
00:13:41,273 --> 00:13:44,701
the SSEP 485 was created as
a bridge between existing

330
00:13:44,701 --> 00:13:48,030
J1708 and the new J2497.

331
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:52,200
So people were able to just
forward port their firmware

332
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,460
and stick the chip in front of it.

333
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:55,740
So we're dealing with diagnostic software

334
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:57,630
that predates 2497 itself,

335
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:59,070
and it would be unreasonable to expect

336
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:01,500
that it would have authorization
and authentication.

337
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,020
It's the era of peaks and pokes.

338
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:07,050
But when you combine the
fact that you can create

339
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:08,790
these messages with RF

340
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:11,400
and that there's no
authenticated authorization

341
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,293
when you get this problem.

342
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:17,250
So, Chris, I hope you're gonna help fill

343
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,810
in the blanks on some of what's happening

344
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:21,273
with this RF black magic.

345
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:26,640
- So let's try to go
over some of the voodoo

346
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,200
that we're doing to these trailers

347
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,723
and navigate the RF
black magic that's going

348
00:14:30,723 --> 00:14:32,851
on in the background.

349
00:14:32,851 --> 00:14:35,820
When they first told me about this idea,

350
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:38,040
I thought there's no way
you're going to be able

351
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:41,520
to get a meaningful signal on that wire

352
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:45,090
at those low frequencies
and such wide bandwidths.

353
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:46,640
I didn't think it was possible.

354
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:50,340
It was such a complicated signal too,

355
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:52,710
but I decided to let it play through.

356
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:57,540
And we did the testing and we
ended up getting it to work,

357
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:00,063
but there were a lot of
things that didn't work.

358
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,600
We went through and we tried all types

359
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,730
of antenna configurations.

360
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:08,460
We found that loop antennas
weren't that effective.

361
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:10,410
We tried making our own loading coils

362
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,210
by taping a couple buckets together

363
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:14,640
and just wrapping wire around it.

364
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,720
That didn't work for us.

365
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,360
We tried rolling out our own ground planes

366
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,370
along the length of the trailer using

367
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:23,970
screen door type material and not so much.

368
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:28,970
And then someone suggested
that we try using the signal

369
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,470
that's produced from a modified truck duct

370
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:33,600
using the GPIOS pins.

371
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,160
And that's not really a good idea.

372
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:35,993
You shouldn't do it

373
00:15:35,993 --> 00:15:38,790
because that signal is much less quality

374
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:40,020
compared to the real thing.

375
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,570
It just doesn't really compare.

376
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:43,890
Then, as Ben mentioned,

377
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:46,020
we had the habit of breaking
the power amplifiers.

378
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:47,315
You can only imagine the joy of going

379
00:15:47,315 --> 00:15:51,060
across the country and then
when the first 10 minutes

380
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:55,140
of testing, you break the power
AFL amplifier accidentally.

381
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:55,973
- [Ben] Yeah, that's my bad.

382
00:15:55,973 --> 00:16:00,973
- [Chris] I hope yes, but what does work?

383
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:04,543
Surprisingly, the FL2K dongle work for us.

384
00:16:04,543 --> 00:16:06,420
For those of you that don't know,

385
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:11,420
it's a USB to VGA adapter
that can be used as an SDR.

386
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:14,400
And surprisingly it
provides more output power

387
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,791
at those low frequencies than a lot

388
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:18,630
of the SDRs that you'll see.

389
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:20,596
And it's much cheaper,

390
00:16:20,596 --> 00:16:22,800
especially with prices
going up these days.

391
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,710
So in the picture there,
you see the FL2K plugged

392
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:28,410
into a small five watt amplifier going

393
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:30,270
into a (indistinct)

394
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:32,640
and a couple of wire
antennas connected to that.

395
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:35,430
And we found that lengthy wire runs placed

396
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:38,550
along parallel to the trailer,

397
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:40,200
produced the best results for us.

398
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:45,981
We recently updated our
gr-J2497 code that's found

399
00:16:45,981 --> 00:16:50,981
on my company's GitHub page there.

400
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:52,830
Before it only did receive,

401
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:56,190
but now we put in transmit capabilities.

402
00:16:56,190 --> 00:17:00,120
So if you're using a FL2K or an RF,

403
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:03,450
you can transmit directly
at those frequencies,

404
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:06,465
or if you have a different
SDR that doesn't go that low,

405
00:17:06,465 --> 00:17:09,090
you can use a down
converter and you might have

406
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:11,790
to amplify the signal coming
outta the down converter,

407
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,850
But what's really going on in that wire?

408
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:20,520
What makes the chip understand our signals

409
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:23,070
as we transmit onto it?

410
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:24,960
There's a couple things
working in our favor.

411
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:29,324
For one, there's a lack of
differential signaling going on.

412
00:17:29,324 --> 00:17:31,140
It's just one wire and ground.

413
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:32,320
It's not like there's two wires going

414
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,023
along the length of the trailer.

415
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:37,295
And then there's the residence effect

416
00:17:37,295 --> 00:17:39,570
that Ben was mentioning where doubles

417
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:43,140
and triples may behave as better antennas

418
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:45,543
than just a single trailer.

419
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:50,310
Then there's the high sensitivity
of the chips themselves.

420
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:53,550
I mean, typically they
work on the order of volts,

421
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:54,840
these messages peak to peak,

422
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:58,410
but we can induce a signal
and it gets interpreted

423
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:01,230
as low as a few milli
volts, which is great

424
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:04,440
if you're trying to inject
something onto a wire,

425
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,840
and then there's other theories
that we're thinking about

426
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,280
about why it's doing this.

427
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,500
And one could be that it's getting

428
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,810
onto the ground better
than it is the wire.

429
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:14,790
And the chip only cares
about the difference.

430
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:17,490
So our signal could be stronger

431
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:19,563
on the ground for all we know.

432
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:25,410
So we were able to do it
despite my earlier doubts,

433
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:29,073
things like the low frequency,
the wide relative bandwidth,

434
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:34,020
it's all near field at these
distances and frequencies.

435
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:36,870
The trailers, the wires,
they're not comparable

436
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:39,090
to the wavelengths that we're trying

437
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:39,990
to work with here.

438
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:43,440
So they make for bad transmit
and receiving antennas,

439
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,570
but it's still good enough to work.

440
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:47,220
And then there could
be reflections going on

441
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:48,420
and impeded mismatches,

442
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:52,830
it's not meant for RF and
the chirp frequencies go

443
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:54,240
from 100 to 400 kilohertz.

444
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,970
And there's a big difference
between 100 and 400 kilohertz

445
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:58,320
in terms of wavelength.

446
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,960
So certain frequencies
might be transmitted

447
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,560
and received better than others.

448
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:08,100
And I've also seen just by
traveling down the highway,

449
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:11,100
I've taken my receive antenna
in the passenger seat,

450
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,300
held it up to the window

451
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:15,390
and I could see that certain trailers

452
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:19,380
transmit the signals
naturally better than others

453
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:21,150
based on the configurations of the wires

454
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:23,130
and the metal in the trailer.

455
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:26,190
I've seen some cables tucked
away in like metal tubing,

456
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:28,080
and you can't really get
much from the signal.

457
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,923
So it depends on the
trailer configuration.

458
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,440
And then you gotta manage your amplifier,

459
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:37,440
harmonics and signal
conditioning challenges,

460
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,940
which will come up when
you're trying to transmit.

461
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:42,810
Now Ben will give you a timeline about

462
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:45,513
how we discovered all this
and went through it, Ben.

463
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:48,330
- Thanks, Chris.

464
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:50,610
Yeah, we've actually
been at this for a while.

465
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:54,210
Since 2019, we started and as you know,

466
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:56,610
we did disclose that you
could read this stuff

467
00:19:56,610 --> 00:20:00,090
back in Safe Mode, Safe Mode DEFCON,

468
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:02,890
but in 2019 we were
actually doing some testing

469
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:06,129
and we did start the
public disclosure process

470
00:20:06,129 --> 00:20:08,280
about remote read.

471
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:11,198
At the time, we also had
results that did suggest

472
00:20:11,198 --> 00:20:13,050
that you could do a remote right,

473
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:16,020
but we couldn't actually
confirm that our testing method

474
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:18,570
at that time, wasn't due
to galvanic coupling.

475
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:19,920
Which means that,

476
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,720
so we had an oscilloscope that was plugged

477
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,980
into the mains power

478
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,540
and we had a signal
generator that was plugged

479
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:25,560
into the mains power.

480
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,210
And we couldn't discount the possibility

481
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:29,970
that the signal was actually
traveling through the ground

482
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:33,660
and or mains lines from
the signal generator

483
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:36,090
to the oscilloscope and that
it wasn't being induced.

484
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:37,110
And that was true.

485
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:40,800
So we did set up out to then test this

486
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,750
to make sure there was
no get galvanic coupling,

487
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:45,930
but of course the pandemic
happened and got in the way

488
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:48,120
of our darn testing schedule.

489
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,670
Well that's okay, there's more
important things happening.

490
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:53,250
Thanks to our member fleets

491
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,620
and some anonymous
equipment suppliers though,

492
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:58,050
we did manage to complete
a gauntlet of testing

493
00:20:58,050 --> 00:21:01,080
in late 2021 and confirm that yeah,

494
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,790
you can write these signals.

495
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:04,350
There's definitely no galvanic coupling

496
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:06,780
because we stopped measuring the signal.

497
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:10,560
We found that we were making
signals that were very small,

498
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:13,380
so small that they're within
the noise of the oscilloscope.

499
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:15,720
You could resolve them
with a very sensitive SDR,

500
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,950
like 16 bit SDRs,

501
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:17,850
but you couldn't resolve them

502
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:19,380
with something like the eight bit hack RF.

503
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:20,970
They were very, very small signals,

504
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:23,610
but they're still small
enough to trigger reception

505
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:25,530
on the trailer equipment.

506
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:26,640
So yeah, we stopped measuring.

507
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,362
I'll talk a little bit more about that.

508
00:21:28,362 --> 00:21:32,310
We work with CISA to get
a coordinated disclosure

509
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:36,150
and it was very quick I
think, and it was nice.

510
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:38,021
We wanted to get done in time to talk

511
00:21:38,021 --> 00:21:40,050
to the American Trucking Association's

512
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:41,430
technical maintenance council.

513
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:43,380
They have a task force
that was putting together

514
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:47,610
in the new specifications for
tractor trailer interfaces.

515
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:50,670
And we really wanted to make
sure that that task force

516
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:53,460
and the stakeholders thereof were aware

517
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:54,990
of the problems of J2497,

518
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:57,060
so that the new interface wouldn't inherit

519
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:58,590
all the same problems that have been there

520
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:01,770
in 2497 for the past 30 odd years.

521
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:03,450
So we are able to do that thankfully

522
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:05,670
by the time that they had
their meeting in March,

523
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:07,560
and eventually we were
also able to contact

524
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,690
the American Tanker Truck Association,

525
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:12,663
which is good because the
issue is the worst on tankers.

526
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:16,500
So about the Unichuff signal,

527
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,540
because we stopped kind
of trying to measure

528
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:19,620
how much we could induce,

529
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:21,690
because it was way down
in this very dirty,

530
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:24,963
noisy 12 volt line on the trailer.

531
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,260
We put together a signal
be called Unichuff.

532
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:30,390
It contains the diagnostic commands

533
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:33,870
for all three trailer brake suppliers.

534
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:35,042
And we send them to all five

535
00:22:35,042 --> 00:22:38,498
of the possible trailer brake locations.

536
00:22:38,498 --> 00:22:40,050
And we just do that on a loop,

537
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:42,660
because if you remember
the CVE that was issued,

538
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:45,420
there is no authentication
or authorization required.

539
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:47,790
So we just play it over and over again,

540
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:50,970
which lets us move where our
antennas, change our powers.

541
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:53,130
And eventually we hear clicking

542
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:54,730
and then we know that it worked.

543
00:22:55,890 --> 00:22:58,350
And we did this for solanoid test

544
00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:00,000
because you can hear the clicking.

545
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,440
It's very useful as a test,

546
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,680
but this is also applicable
to other diagnostic commands.

547
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,580
And we'll talk a bit about that later.

548
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,480
So Chris, how can they do this?

549
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,480
Should they do this?

550
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:15,300
- So if you're on the highway,

551
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,700
you should not do this
to other people's trucks.

552
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,357
This is not a good idea.

553
00:23:19,357 --> 00:23:21,270
They're big machines. You don't own them.

554
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:22,710
Don't mess with 'em.

555
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:25,394
But if you have your own truck

556
00:23:25,394 --> 00:23:27,808
or you wanna make your own bench set up,

557
00:23:27,808 --> 00:23:29,370
I strongly encourage that.

558
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:31,110
And there are different things you can do

559
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:32,878
if you have a bench set up.

560
00:23:32,878 --> 00:23:37,470
You can tap directly into the
wires and view these signals.

561
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:39,840
One way to do it is with
a DC block to get rid

562
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,090
of the 12 volts that's on the power line

563
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:44,760
and just see the signal and
you don't harm your scopes

564
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:47,643
or your SDRs or whatever
you got plugged in.

565
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:52,110
Another method is you can
get a hardware hacking,

566
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:54,210
diagnostic adapter.

567
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:58,920
They sell some that go from J2497 to 1708,

568
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,480
and you can plug it in on one end.

569
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,220
And then if you get your hands

570
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:05,130
on a supplier diagnostic
adapter that goes like right

571
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:07,170
into a brake controller or something,

572
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:10,503
you can view entire session
traffic and capture that.

573
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:15,600
If you wanna make your own
FL2K adapter like we did,

574
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:19,020
there are schematics out there for buying

575
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:22,680
or just buy a board that
goes from VGA to SMA

576
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,633
and you're off and running there.

577
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:29,850
And if you're making
your own bench set up,

578
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:34,200
you can add bonus features
such as wheel speed simulation

579
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,613
or pressurized air.

580
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,420
And then if you wanna go
online and see our code,

581
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:41,640
you can do it yourself with the SDRs

582
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,983
and the down converter
and amplifier methods.

583
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:51,030
This is an example of event
set up that Ben's been using

584
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:52,202
for the past couple years.

585
00:24:52,202 --> 00:24:55,743
I'll let him talk more about
it. It's pretty interesting.

586
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:58,850
- [Ben] Yeah this is
actually a CTF challenge

587
00:24:58,850 --> 00:24:59,880
at the car hacking village.

588
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,500
We have it again this year.

589
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,170
This year, the contestants
have to use an SDR.

590
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:06,930
In the past, we've given
them a diagnostic actor

591
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:08,313
and because it's DEFCON,

592
00:25:08,313 --> 00:25:10,410
(indistinct) also helped me modify it.

593
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:13,350
And we started a launch war
with each other yesterday.

594
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:14,820
So it's pretty fun.

595
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:17,370
And you should come
check it out if you like.

596
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:20,164
And yeah, I mean, bench
setups can be really key.

597
00:25:20,164 --> 00:25:22,470
If you want to take on the challenge

598
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:26,370
of doing your own J2497
research on a bench,

599
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:29,610
it might behoove you to know
that if you find something,

600
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:33,330
whatever you find is now
remotely exploitable, right?

601
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:35,520
So this is the environment
that you would have

602
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:38,340
in the situation of possibly
remote inducing messages.

603
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:39,210
Not that you're gonna do it,

604
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:42,060
but your bench set up may
be set up to look like this.

605
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:45,480
You're gonna have at least
a tractor brake controller

606
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,790
and one trailer brake controller,

607
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:51,390
but here in north America, you
could actually run triples,

608
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:53,250
meaning three trailers.

609
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:56,100
A lot of those triples actually
require converter dollies.

610
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:58,470
And that's what kind of changes
the back of a normal trailer

611
00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:00,540
into something that looks
like the back of a truck

612
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:02,667
so that you can put another trailer on it.

613
00:26:02,667 --> 00:26:04,170
And these converter dollies of course

614
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:05,820
have their own trailer brake controllers.

615
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:07,710
So even though you can
have a up to a triple,

616
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:10,650
you could have up to five
trailer brake controllers.

617
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:12,540
So if you want to have
an authentic test bench,

618
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:14,990
you might want to consider
all five being present

619
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:21,330
and yes, hang on a second.

620
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:22,163
I lost my notes.

621
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:29,250
Right, so when you're looking
at this stuff on your bench,

622
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:32,370
keep in mind that the only
required functionality

623
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:33,990
while the truck is rolling at mission time

624
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:35,490
is sending the lamp messages

625
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:37,290
from the trailer to the tractor

626
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:39,270
to show whether there's a fault.

627
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:40,620
There's a lot of other stuff going on,

628
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:43,380
but most of that is really
value add from the vendors

629
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:46,470
and doesn't necessarily need
to be happening on J2497,

630
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:49,413
especially when we get to new
tractor trailer interfaces.

631
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:53,100
Our experience with J2497
has kind of uncovered

632
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,660
that it's a little strange.

633
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:56,550
And there's a lot of
things about what we found

634
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:59,910
that suggest that either
it's not been explored

635
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:03,030
or that possibly this patent
had a real chilling effect

636
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:04,571
on the technology.

637
00:27:04,571 --> 00:27:06,360
You can see this picture at the bottom,

638
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,880
which is sort of this weird
chirp fragment coming out.

639
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,070
And as soon as we started
capturing these signals,

640
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:12,270
we were seeing these chirp fragments.

641
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:13,530
And we couldn't tell if it was us

642
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:16,140
or if it was something we
were doing on the software.

643
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:17,700
Eventually we broke out the signals

644
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,770
and it really was just
this tri-state output

645
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:20,970
on the bridge.

646
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:22,320
A tri-state is when you kind of try

647
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,480
to turn off external amplifiers

648
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,810
and this output was just going
high for some unknown reason.

649
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:30,150
It's highly unlikely that no
one has ever seen this before.

650
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:31,500
There's a lot of really smart engineers

651
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,480
that work on this technology.

652
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,962
We suspect that this and
other things really suggest

653
00:27:35,962 --> 00:27:39,108
that whenever someone
encountered this stuff,

654
00:27:39,108 --> 00:27:40,470
the answer was probably, well,

655
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:42,780
this is patented and we
don't do anything about it.

656
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:44,250
We can't make an alternative technology.

657
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:45,090
How could we change it?

658
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:47,730
So we think that all of the
weirdness here that you see,

659
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:50,670
we summarized really did
have a chilling effect.

660
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:52,680
And Michael Osman has talked about this,

661
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:55,170
how patents can be harmful to innovation.

662
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:57,780
In his case, he talked about forceps

663
00:27:57,780 --> 00:28:00,360
and that really caused really bad things.

664
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,730
This has thankfully hasn't hurt anybody,

665
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:05,970
but we do believe that
the patents being present

666
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:07,500
has had a chilling effect.

667
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:08,790
And I've heard of that as well,

668
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:12,450
that in 1998, when they
evaluated this technology

669
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:13,440
amongst the other ones,

670
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,820
there was a whole list of dozens

671
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:16,500
and dozens of features
that they could integrate

672
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:19,320
over J2497 and to this day,

673
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,700
really none of them have been implemented.

674
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,050
And I've been told by some engineers that

675
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:25,203
that's really was because
of licensing and the patent.

676
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:29,010
So the other thing to
note here is the preamble

677
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:30,810
is discarded on receive.

678
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:33,180
We previously had reported
that you can make frames

679
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:35,700
that have a different priority on 2497

680
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:38,400
than they have on J1708
when they received.

681
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,480
It's actually worse than that.

682
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:42,180
It turns out that the
preamble isn't used at all.

683
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:44,160
And we found that in one case,

684
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,620
this one brake controller
was just sending random bites

685
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:47,453
for its preamble.

686
00:28:47,453 --> 00:28:49,380
It never was sending the
correct lamp message.

687
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:50,970
And which explains why
we couldn't decode it

688
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:52,260
that first time we had a capture.

689
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:53,610
So another mystery solved

690
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:55,080
and the other two brake controllers,

691
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:58,080
only one of them implements
arbitration correctly.

692
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,720
And that one actually has
a priority inversion bug,

693
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,280
'cause it's doing it correctly,

694
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,710
it still can hold up its transmit

695
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:06,420
if it has a low transmit priority,

696
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:09,000
ahead of a high transmit priority.

697
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,980
So even though it implemented
arbitration correctly,

698
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:13,980
it messed something else
up, which is unfortunate,

699
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:14,880
but kind of funny.

700
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:18,300
So solenoid tests,

701
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:19,770
a lot of the testing we've done,

702
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:22,980
a lot of what we've disclosed
here is all about these tests.

703
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:25,440
When the trailer break
controller receives them,

704
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,080
it makes a clicking noise
if there's no air present,

705
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,880
if the air is present
and the driver's foot is

706
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,055
on the brake,

707
00:29:31,055 --> 00:29:32,580
it will actually release compressed air

708
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:34,710
through the exhaust port of
the trailer brake controller,

709
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:36,690
which makes a chuffing sound.

710
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:39,330
And that's why these
are called chuff test.

711
00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:41,520
The difference also is in dollies,

712
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,780
Dollies don't have traditional air brakes.

713
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:45,930
You don't need the driver's foot to be

714
00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:47,370
on the brake to chuff air.

715
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:48,900
If they receive a solenoid test,

716
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:50,820
they will chuff air regardless
of the configuration.

717
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:54,510
So when you have a road
train with dollies,

718
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:56,943
you'll actually exhaust
air much, much quicker,

719
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,840
but it's important to remember that even

720
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,280
though we're talking about solenoid tests,

721
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:04,860
they were a good stand in
for us to do our testing

722
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:07,140
'cause we could hear the
results when they were received.

723
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:09,090
They were also kind of bad enough.

724
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:11,370
There were fleets that
got upset about just this,

725
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:13,560
but there is more that's possible.

726
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:18,480
On tractors, the tractor
units are really supposed

727
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,800
to be receiving those lamp messages.

728
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:23,220
That's their function, but
they're doing more than that.

729
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:25,440
Some of them are actually
resetting in response

730
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,290
to messages that they
receive on the 2497 bus.

731
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:30,270
And when a tractor
brake controller resets,

732
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:33,000
it sounds off its modulators,
which is another chuff test.

733
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,130
So it does four or more chuff tests

734
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:36,840
in response to these reset commands,

735
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:39,270
which is actually a well
defined J1587 message,

736
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:41,403
not even a hidden proprietary one.

737
00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:43,890
There are a lot of the brake controllers

738
00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:44,880
that are doing bridging.

739
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,330
Thankfully that bridging
is from 2497 to 1708.

740
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:51,270
And we don't find 1708 on modern trucks.

741
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:53,040
Although there are a lot
of trucks on the road

742
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,618
that aren't modern.

743
00:30:54,618 --> 00:30:56,040
So it's not a zero impact thing.

744
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,780
There are tractor brake controllers

745
00:30:57,780 --> 00:31:01,290
that enable diagnostics from 1939 to 2497.

746
00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:03,630
So we know that some of
the software does include

747
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:05,820
higher privilege bridging

748
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:08,160
and it's not clear
whether it goes backwards.

749
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,710
We certainly haven't found
any that do that so far.

750
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:12,390
And we haven't found any
tractor brake controllers

751
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:15,660
that respond to legitimate
diagnostic commands on 2497,

752
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:16,623
which is good.

753
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:19,410
Back to trailers.

754
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:21,120
There are other diagnostic commands

755
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:24,000
on trailer brake controllers
that aren't solenoid tests.

756
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,560
You can change the tone ring size,

757
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,330
which tells the ABS controller

758
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:29,610
how fast is the wheel
going based on the signal

759
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:30,570
that it sees.

760
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:33,420
The good news is that when you
give it nonsensical values,

761
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:35,910
the ones that we've tested
don't do anything bad.

762
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:37,770
We thought maybe if you
gave it a nonsense value,

763
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:39,420
it might start ABS events.

764
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:41,430
It doesn't, which is good news.

765
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:43,560
You can also change the axle number.

766
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:46,680
You can do all your DTC reading
and clearing, et cetera.

767
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:49,170
Now 2497 is really the only interface

768
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:51,690
to access trailer brake
controllers in North America.

769
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:55,080
And so all the engineering
tools also work over 2497.

770
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,790
And even though those
tools aren't supposed

771
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:58,260
to be in customer hands,

772
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:00,810
the software that receives
the engineering tool commands

773
00:32:00,810 --> 00:32:03,360
is in the trailer brake controller
and will respond to them.

774
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,180
So things like uploading scripts,

775
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:08,100
some of the manufacturers
have scripting languages

776
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,660
that they put in their
trailer brake controllers.

777
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:13,340
And we're also told that firmer
updates do happen over 2497

778
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:14,730
on some of these trailer
brake controllers.

779
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:17,220
So there's a lot more than solenoid tests

780
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:19,650
that are all possible.

781
00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:21,690
So with all this happening

782
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:23,640
and there's some bad stuff happening here,

783
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,660
it's not a zero impact.

784
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:26,670
Why would we come up here
and tell you all about it

785
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:27,503
at DEFCON?

786
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:31,140
The timing was really
kind of important about it

787
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:33,270
and it does present a dilemma

788
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:35,790
and we recognize that the
dilemma is not unique to us.

789
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:37,590
This happens in a lot of situations

790
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:39,720
with security disclosures.

791
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,010
On the one hand, if we talk about it,

792
00:32:41,010 --> 00:32:42,990
it's gonna put unwanted
attention on thousands

793
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:45,120
of deployed vulnerable devices.

794
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,530
On the other hand, if
we don't talk about it,

795
00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:48,330
then the issue can't be widely understood

796
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:50,820
and people might just
keep doing the same thing

797
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:52,170
they've always done.

798
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:54,480
And this last part is
particularly important right now

799
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,770
because we're starting to define

800
00:32:55,770 --> 00:32:58,050
the new tractor trailer interface.

801
00:32:58,050 --> 00:33:00,690
And if they said that it had to maintain

802
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:03,750
complete backwards
compatibility with J2497,

803
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:06,300
which is something that
fleets would reasonably want

804
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,290
because they want to make sure

805
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:10,080
that their old equipment works
with their new equipment.

806
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,850
The fleets would then also inherit all

807
00:33:11,850 --> 00:33:14,850
of these security problems with J2497.

808
00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:17,910
So because right now that
task force is working

809
00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:19,110
to define these things,

810
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:21,540
we felt it was really important
to do this public disclosure

811
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:24,626
with CISA so that we could
tell the various task forces

812
00:33:24,626 --> 00:33:27,783
and tanker associations
and carrier associations

813
00:33:27,783 --> 00:33:31,380
to make sure that everyone
understands the issue.

814
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:35,042
We have asked the task force
to make sure that J2487

815
00:33:35,042 --> 00:33:37,350
is deprecated in the next interface.

816
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:40,650
And that will actually come
to a vote in September.

817
00:33:40,650 --> 00:33:44,823
The in-person ATMC meeting
and we hope they will agree,

818
00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:48,840
which brings us to probably
the reason you all came here

819
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:51,360
is let's look at some
trucks chuffing, right?

820
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,450
Okay, now actually getting time

821
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:57,210
to test trucks is pretty difficult.

822
00:33:57,210 --> 00:34:00,420
So we'll just show you how Chris

823
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:02,133
and I prepare for tests.

824
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:12,690
Right? Okay, got it.

825
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:14,100
Thank you for those of you that laughed.

826
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:15,033
I appreciate that.

827
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:19,560
Okay, in all seriousness, we
will show you chuffing trucks.

828
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,600
This is our demo setup.

829
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:24,600
We have the Unichuff
signal in that black box.

830
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:27,690
We turn that into a J2497 signal

831
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:30,180
with some code that's
now public and available.

832
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:33,930
We serialize that and
play it an FL2K USB dongle

833
00:34:33,930 --> 00:34:35,520
that Chris told you about.

834
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,140
That goes into a variable attenuator,

835
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:38,850
which feeds a power amplifier.

836
00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:40,800
The reason for the variable attenuator is

837
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,500
so that I don't blow up
any more power amplifiers.

838
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:44,850
That's important.

839
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:47,460
And then we feed that into the antenna,

840
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,890
which is sitting next to the truck.

841
00:34:49,890 --> 00:34:52,443
So let's do the demo.

842
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:56,503
Oh, there we go.

843
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:02,730
So that sound, you're hearing.
That's the chuffing sound.

844
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:06,123
That's the trailer break
controller exhausting the air.

845
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:10,257
I can see it down here.

846
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:14,160
You can kind of see the antenna
here, strung on the pylon.

847
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:17,550
So it's those two red wires
that are just to the left

848
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:19,350
and we're at a pretty
decent distance here.

849
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:22,200
This is a triple with grain haulers,

850
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,630
which are type B trailers,
so there's no dollies.

851
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:28,320
It's just three trailer brake controllers

852
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,493
on these grain haulers.

853
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:34,210
And of course the driver is in the cab

854
00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:37,140
and he has his foot on the brake.

855
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:39,000
And because he's in the cab
with his foot on the brake,

856
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,610
that's why we're hearing
the air chuffing out.

857
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:45,090
Here you can see the laptop
and the programmable attenuator

858
00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:47,190
and the power amplifier
that feeds the antennas.

859
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:49,650
And there's nothing else between the setup

860
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:51,250
and the truck, very independent.

861
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:56,950
Now what happens if you
do this test for a while?

862
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:04,980
It's not super easy to
hear here at DEFCON,

863
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:07,430
but the air stops to chuff.

864
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:09,210
So we ran the test for quite a while

865
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:11,310
and you can hear just the
solenoid clicking much

866
00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:12,420
more than the air.

867
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,490
There just isn't enough
air in the reservoirs

868
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:18,300
to keep up with the
continuous chuffing commands

869
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,680
that we're sending, right?

870
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:24,680
And you definitely hear that
it's different at least.

871
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:28,493
And of course,

872
00:36:28,493 --> 00:36:29,790
if they don't have enough
air in the reservoir,

873
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:32,130
then they can't release the
brakes to move the truck.

874
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:35,010
So if a truck were caught in
this situation long enough

875
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:37,290
for roughly two to three
minutes in this configuration

876
00:36:37,290 --> 00:36:39,303
for that tractor and these trailers,

877
00:36:39,303 --> 00:36:40,410
then it probably wouldn't be able

878
00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:43,233
to roll away until its
compressor could keep up.

879
00:36:47,850 --> 00:36:49,410
Back to that. Okay.

880
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:51,960
So I think you'll find that Chris

881
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,450
and I have showed you that
it's possible to both read

882
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:57,030
and write these messages remotely

883
00:36:57,030 --> 00:36:59,460
on some tractor and
trailer configurations.

884
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:00,750
And in the worst case,

885
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:02,587
writing remotely can be
done for pretty cheap.

886
00:37:02,587 --> 00:37:05,700
$300 US at a very large separation,

887
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:08,160
something that would work for ditched road

888
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,230
and the rights don't just
reach the trailer equipment.

889
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:13,380
They actually reach the tractor
brake controller as well.

890
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:14,940
And both the trailer brake controllers

891
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:17,040
and those tractor brake
controllers are doing more

892
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,923
than just the regulation
required lamp messages.

893
00:37:21,274 --> 00:37:24,450
We could not have done the cool stuff here

894
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:26,040
without the assistance of AIS.

895
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,660
This was a really great team effort

896
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:29,850
and we're very grateful
for your assistance.

897
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:31,830
And Dan, thank you very much.

898
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:34,923
And Eric, who's not here,
but on the stream hopefully.

899
00:37:35,850 --> 00:37:36,840
This would not have been possible

900
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:40,470
without the support of the
NMFTA member fleet carriers.

901
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:43,410
So thank you very much to
them and a huge thank you

902
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:45,864
to this a long list of
people that I won't read out,

903
00:37:45,864 --> 00:37:47,850
'cause it'll embarrass
those of you that are

904
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:48,683
in the audience.

905
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:49,770
But thank you very much to you

906
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:52,380
and we're happy to take
your questions now.

907
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:53,213
Thank you.

908
00:37:54,283 --> 00:37:56,866
(crowd claps)

909
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:05,813
Yes, sir.

910
00:38:08,389 --> 00:38:11,806
(man talks indistinctly)

911
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:32,250
- Yeah, so the question is we mentioned

912
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:33,990
that there's some interuptability.

913
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:36,660
I was saying bridging between 1939,

914
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:39,120
which is a CAN bus and this 2497,

915
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,980
which is a power line carrier,

916
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:45,077
the tractor brake controllers,
they connect J1939,

917
00:38:45,077 --> 00:38:48,330
'cause they're responsible
for actuating the brakes

918
00:38:48,330 --> 00:38:50,190
and responding to torque
and all the other messages

919
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:51,270
on the bus,

920
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:53,490
those tractor brake
controllers in North America,

921
00:38:53,490 --> 00:38:56,370
they also have to for regulation reasons

922
00:38:56,370 --> 00:38:59,070
receive 2497 messages.

923
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:00,990
So they're like the nexus
that connects to both

924
00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:02,875
of those buses and the
software in them does

925
00:39:02,875 --> 00:39:07,650
in some cases move data
for various reasons.

926
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:09,690
Does that answer your question, sir?

927
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:10,980
Welcome.

928
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:11,813
Yes.

929
00:39:12,810 --> 00:39:16,477
(guest speaks indistinctly)

930
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:20,910
- Okay yeah. So is that's a good question.

931
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:22,710
It's definitely a natural question.

932
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:26,351
We have tested something
like this when it's moving,

933
00:39:26,351 --> 00:39:28,320
the results were negative.

934
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:31,500
So what we found and we
mentioned that if you change

935
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:34,980
the tone ring size, it doesn't
make things bad either.

936
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:37,800
What we found is that
because these are ABS units,

937
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:40,350
they have wheel speed sensors
built right into them.

938
00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:43,320
The software knows intrinsically
how fast it's going.

939
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,510
All the ones we've tested
will just not receive

940
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:47,790
any diagnostic commands
while they're in motion.

941
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:49,650
I think you'll find in
one of the slides earlier,

942
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:50,580
I didn't say it verbally,

943
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:54,480
but it's there that if
they're in a fault state,

944
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,310
some of them will actually still respond

945
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:58,440
to the diagnostic
commands either in motion,

946
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:00,330
they have a fault and they will respond

947
00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:02,400
and that's for some of them,

948
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,720
for some versions on some things.

949
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,163
So your mileage may vary.

950
00:40:06,431 --> 00:40:09,848
(man talks indistinctly)

951
00:40:27,139 --> 00:40:29,490
- I mean, so we're talking about, okay,

952
00:40:29,490 --> 00:40:31,140
so the question is what would happen

953
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:33,240
if this was somehow theoretically possible

954
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:35,610
in motion or happened, right?

955
00:40:35,610 --> 00:40:38,163
And sorry, is that the question?

956
00:40:39,390 --> 00:40:40,350
Yeah. Okay.

957
00:40:40,350 --> 00:40:43,545
So these are air spring brakes.

958
00:40:43,545 --> 00:40:46,830
If it's just rolling
and you start to deplete

959
00:40:46,830 --> 00:40:49,020
the brake pressure and
no one has their foot

960
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:49,853
on the brake or anything,

961
00:40:49,853 --> 00:40:51,510
the effect is not really
gonna be anything,

962
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:53,370
unless you get all that supply air out

963
00:40:53,370 --> 00:40:54,840
and then the brakes would start to close

964
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,430
and it would slow down the vehicle.

965
00:40:56,430 --> 00:40:59,100
So it's pretty decent failure state,

966
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:00,570
I think in terms of impact.

967
00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:02,760
the thing that kind of
bothers the fleets about it

968
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:05,340
is the access to the
other diagnostic functions

969
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:07,800
and the potential immobilization
of tractor trailers

970
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:10,473
that are stationary and then
made to stay stationary,

971
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:13,140
'cause they're big and hard to move

972
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:15,940
and that would make things
bad in a lot of cases, right.

973
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:18,473
Does that answer your question, sir?

974
00:41:21,532 --> 00:41:22,365
Welcome.

975
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:28,933
Okay.

976
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:37,980
Thank you. Oh, do we have
a question back here?

977
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:39,003
Yes please.

978
00:41:41,162 --> 00:41:44,745
(guest talks indistinctly)

979
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,313
It's a good question.

980
00:41:49,313 --> 00:41:51,810
So the question is can
we use the same method

981
00:41:51,810 --> 00:41:55,533
to actually block
activation of brakes, right?

982
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:01,380
So brake control in North America
at least is all pneumatic,

983
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:04,200
which means it's all through
pressurized air control.

984
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,354
So application of the brakes
and release of the brakes

985
00:42:06,354 --> 00:42:10,410
is both through the blue line
that signals relay control,

986
00:42:10,410 --> 00:42:11,520
but it's all pneumatic.

987
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:15,990
There's no way to control the breaks

988
00:42:15,990 --> 00:42:18,890
with any of the research that
we've done here in that way.

989
00:42:20,370 --> 00:42:21,203
Yes, sir.

990
00:42:22,168 --> 00:42:25,835
(guest talks indistinctly)

991
00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:48,480
- Right and so the question
is sort of the talk last year

992
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:51,060
that was involved with stealing and

993
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:53,580
or completely disabling
all the shopping trolleys,

994
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:57,570
which is a great talk and
is seven kilohertz similar.

995
00:42:57,570 --> 00:42:58,680
Just like kind of Chris mentioned,

996
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:00,057
there's a big difference
between 400 kilohertz

997
00:43:00,057 --> 00:43:01,080
and 100 kilohertz.

998
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:02,430
There's actually an even bigger difference

999
00:43:02,430 --> 00:43:04,320
between one and seven.

1000
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:05,400
The thing that is similar is that

1001
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:07,290
there's no authentication
or authorization required.

1002
00:43:07,290 --> 00:43:09,720
So that loop that he did
that just play the thing,

1003
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:12,750
that's kind of what we did
with the Unichuff as well.

1004
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:14,130
The other really important distinction is

1005
00:43:14,130 --> 00:43:16,710
that those trollies,

1006
00:43:16,710 --> 00:43:18,930
the equipment that he was
attacking had antennas

1007
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:22,050
that were designed to receive RF.

1008
00:43:22,050 --> 00:43:23,864
They were electrical engineers,
real electrical engineers,

1009
00:43:23,864 --> 00:43:26,340
did the thing and made the
antennas to receive it.

1010
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:29,384
What we're doing is
convincing a power line system

1011
00:43:29,384 --> 00:43:32,190
to receive RF when it really shouldn't.

1012
00:43:32,190 --> 00:43:33,780
And so we need a lot more power

1013
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:35,943
and oomph to make that happen.

1014
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:39,953
You're welcome.

1015
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:47,200
I think we're good. Thank
you everybody very much.
