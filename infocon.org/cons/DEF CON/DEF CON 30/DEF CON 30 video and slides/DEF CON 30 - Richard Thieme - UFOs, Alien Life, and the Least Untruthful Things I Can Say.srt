1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,740
- This morning we have
a pre-recorded video,

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:04,530
but we have a very special
guest to introduce this video.

3
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:06,483
Please give a warm welcome to G. Mark.

4
00:00:07,541 --> 00:00:08,952
- Thank you.

5
00:00:08,952 --> 00:00:11,952
(audience applause)

6
00:00:13,178 --> 00:00:17,040
- Well good morning,
welcome to Richard Thieme

7
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:20,433
who has been presenting here since 1997.

8
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:26,360
I attended his first talk
at Black Hat One in '98,

9
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,890
and he has been a regular here.

10
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:32,190
Due to family health issues,
he is unable to be in person.

11
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:35,580
However, Richard will
be doing a broadcast.

12
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:37,200
I just wanna say a know to thanks to him

13
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,250
for his years of friendship.

14
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:41,250
If you've ever had a chance
to listen to Richard speak

15
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,290
or interact with him, you
find out he's probably

16
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:46,680
one of the finest
intellects in our community.

17
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,050
And yet, he never kind of became a hacker,

18
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:52,320
he really was a priest in his earlier life

19
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,890
and he adopted the hacker
community as his flock.

20
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:58,470
And I think for that, we
should all be grateful.

21
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:02,430
So please sit back, listen
to some interesting ideas

22
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:04,890
from Richard Thieme
for one of his passions

23
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:06,510
about UFOs, alien lifes,

24
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:10,230
and the least untruthful
things that he can say.

25
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:12,857
So please, over then to Richard Thieme.

26
00:01:14,375 --> 00:01:16,920
(audience applause)

27
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:21,900
- And welcome to UFOs,
aliens and, quite seriously,

28
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,230
the least untruthful things
I can say about that.

29
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:27,000
It's a pleasure to be back at Def Con,

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,250
although I wish I was there in person,

31
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:30,783
but could not be this year.

32
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,620
So I'm going to do the best
I can with one of the more

33
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:37,560
unusual talks you're
likely to hear this year,

34
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,360
exactly as it was requested

35
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,690
by the review committee at Def Con.

36
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:45,990
You probably need to know
that I've explored the subject

37
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:50,990
of UFOs seriously and in depth
and in detail for 44 years.

38
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:53,070
Above all, I've worked
with some of the best

39
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:57,210
and the brightest in what we
call the invisible college,

40
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:59,850
after Alan Heinick's
coining of the phrase,

41
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:03,450
to do academic research
well and scientifically,

42
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:07,380
and with integrity, and to
base our conclusions on data

43
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:11,130
and evidence and scrupulous observation,

44
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:13,530
discarding all those that don't contribute

45
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:17,043
to a reasonable understanding
of what we're looking at.

46
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,090
I mention all those people
that I've worked with,

47
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:24,690
because I'm gonna quote from
some of them in a little bit,

48
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:28,980
because I asked them for
their bottom line conclusions

49
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:32,370
after working on this subject
diligently and academically,

50
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:35,280
and in every way, collecting
hundreds of thousands

51
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,150
of documents over more
than half a century.

52
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:41,160
And these are good people.

53
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,313
So you'll have to take my
word for it, I vouch for them.

54
00:02:45,756 --> 00:02:47,670
A number of them contributed
to the celebrated

55
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:50,257
historical work to which
I also contributed,

56
00:02:50,257 --> 00:02:53,520
"UFOs and Government:
A Historical Inquiry,"

57
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,370
which is in over 100 university libraries

58
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:59,040
and is considered the real gold standard

59
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,980
for historical research into the subject.

60
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:05,040
So this is the most
forthright presentation

61
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,450
I can make on this subject,
and I wanna emphasize

62
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:12,840
that it is about alien life by request,

63
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,940
because I'm gonna tell you
some of the conclusions

64
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,220
we can make about the likelihood

65
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:21,030
that UFO phenomena represents alien life.

66
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:26,030
So you're looking at me, now
you're looking at the title,

67
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:28,410
the search for alien life, UFOs,

68
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:32,610
and the least untruthful
things I can say about that.

69
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:36,930
All right, let's begin by
remembering where we are,

70
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:40,920
what kind of universe we
inhabit, what kind of cosmos.

71
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,620
What you're looking at
right now is a selection

72
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:47,940
of just some of the galactic
clusters in the universe.

73
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:52,170
Now a galactic cluster is
a collection of galaxies,

74
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:55,860
often millions of galaxies,

75
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,890
often covering a huge span,

76
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:03,890
of which our Milky Way
galaxy is merely a pin prick

77
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:08,070
in its own galactic cluster.

78
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:10,710
And I'm gonna show you
a still picture of that.

79
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:13,080
This is Laniakea, I hope I have time

80
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,120
at the end to play a video.

81
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,560
If not, make sure you
plug Laniakea, that name,

82
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:24,210
into a search engine and
watch the four minute video

83
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:27,570
which illuminates how this was determined

84
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:31,920
to be the galactic
cluster in which we live.

85
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,590
You will notice all the way
to the end of that little

86
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:38,130
white filament arm on the right is a dot,

87
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:40,890
that dot is the Milky Way.

88
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:45,330
This cluster is hundreds
of light years across.

89
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:48,930
And the point I wanna
make is that Laniakea,

90
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:52,503
the Hawaiian name for open
skies or immense heavens,

91
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:57,150
there are 100,000 nearby galaxies

92
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:59,820
in just this one cluster.

93
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:03,930
Do you really think we are
the top of the food chain

94
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:08,100
and the only sentient
intelligence in the universe,

95
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:11,220
and that we are the first
to learn everything,

96
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,260
even though we've only had electric lights

97
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:15,840
for about 150 years?

98
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,370
As the universe counts time,

99
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:21,960
we are barely up from the slide

100
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:25,710
and we have made significant
progress very quickly.

101
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:28,560
What you're looking at
here is the telescope

102
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,910
Galileo created and used
to see moons of Jupiter,

103
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:37,560
for example, and other things in 1609.

104
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:41,730
So it's a little bit over 400 years ago

105
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:43,740
that he discovered spots on the sun,

106
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:47,700
and the phases of Venus, and
hills and valleys on the moon.

107
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:50,850
Now this is what we're using,

108
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,520
the James Webb space telescope.

109
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,730
You can Google the first
images that have come from it.

110
00:05:56,730 --> 00:06:00,990
It gives us our farthest
look, our farthest reach

111
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:05,580
into the galaxy, into the galaxies.

112
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:09,060
We have just found, using James Webb,

113
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:13,140
one of the oldest formations of a galaxy

114
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:16,440
in the early universe than
that we have ever seen.

115
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:20,520
But this is going to help us
because it is going to look

116
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,700
at and identify exoplanets,

117
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:26,190
that is those that are
likely to harbor life.

118
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:29,730
But more than that, this telescope,

119
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:31,440
I hope you can see it adequately,

120
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,890
it's called the Roman Space telescope.

121
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:36,960
It's got a much, much
bigger field of view.

122
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:41,550
It's scheduled to go up on a rocket

123
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:44,820
from SpaceX in about six or eight years,

124
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:48,720
2027, 2026, 2028.

125
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,720
And what is going to be able
to conduct is areas of the sky

126
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:56,940
will be viewed that are 100 times larger

127
00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:00,360
than the Hubble can see, 100 times.

128
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,810
And it will undertake a
galactic exoplanet survey

129
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:08,100
designed to find Earth-like planets.

130
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,380
That is, smaller rocky planets

131
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:14,550
in the right habitation
zone around nearby suns.

132
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:17,700
And it's gonna do this and
find galaxies in the Milky Way

133
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:22,170
100 times faster than the Hubble.

134
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:26,220
So this is just to say, we are on the cusp

135
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:31,220
in our limited and relatively
primitive technology ways

136
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,416
to identifying planets
where life has originated.

137
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:37,980
to identifying planets
where life has originated.

138
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:42,870
That is coming, but we
don't need to rely on that

139
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:45,300
to know that there are other things

140
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,120
suggestive of life in the universe.

141
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,510
What you're looking at here

142
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:54,990
is two photos from McMinnville, Oregon

143
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:57,600
in the late 1940's.

144
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:01,950
And these two photos show flying disks

145
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:06,000
that the farmer, Paul Trent,
had no idea what they were.

146
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,940
He took the pictures, he
says he wished he never had

147
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,620
because he was attacked and assailed

148
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:13,200
and called a charlatan and a fraud.

149
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:17,490
The kind of camera he was using
did not lend itself easily

150
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:20,520
to the kind of Photoshopping
we can do today.

151
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,560
And he wouldn't have known how to do it,

152
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:25,920
he was a farmer in McMinnville, Oregon.

153
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:30,920
So from the first days
of the current UFO era,

154
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:36,030
starting in the late 40's, we have images.

155
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:40,150
I refer you to a YouTube video

156
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:44,670
about the McMinnville, not
only the McMinnville photos,

157
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:47,490
but two videos, you can google those.

158
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:49,740
One is from Great Falls, Montana

159
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:53,580
and one is from Tremonton, Utah.

160
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:58,350
And what they show are
disks flying over an area

161
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:00,960
where people happen to have movie cameras,

162
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:04,053
and they took pictures of them.

163
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,520
They did the best they could
to identify them in every way,

164
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:12,330
they went to Naval labs,
they went to the Air Force.

165
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:15,810
The Air Force clipped some
frames from one of them,

166
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:18,960
the ones that showed
clearly shining silver discs

167
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,737
that, according to the camera operator,

168
00:09:20,737 --> 00:09:24,480
"Looked like shiny dimes in the sky."

169
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,570
He rebutted every silly argument they gave

170
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:29,910
for what else it might be.

171
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:34,910
But this is to make the point
that we had video movies,

172
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:40,100
we called them, of
flying saucers early on.

173
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,440
So we got to work

174
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,620
on how we had to manage that.

175
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,690
You're looking here at two photos,

176
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:53,400
it's two among many, of
UFOs, it's that basic.

177
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,410
People say, "Why are there no photos?"

178
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:56,437
Well, here's a photo.

179
00:09:56,437 --> 00:09:58,050
"Why are they so far away?"

180
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:02,280
Why because they kept
far away. Duh, right?

181
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:06,360
So these photos are clearer perhaps.

182
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,740
The modern era of the UFOs

183
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:10,140
begins in the 40's with foo fighters.

184
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:14,490
During World War II, those
glowing balls of light you see,

185
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:17,940
tracked our airplanes
over Germany and Japan.

186
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:21,090
We thought they were
secret weapons of the axis,

187
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:23,730
they thought they might
be secret weapons of ours.

188
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:26,040
We learned after the war,
from all the documentation

189
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,890
we could get our hands on, that
nobody knew what they were.

190
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:32,100
There are good books on foo fighters.

191
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,290
I am just trying to make the point

192
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:37,740
that we had photographs early on,

193
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:41,370
both movies and photos by reliable people,

194
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:43,773
these were taken by military pilots,

195
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:47,250
of unidentified flying objects

196
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:50,550
that are not explainable in any other way.

197
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:53,700
So that's why this statement was made,

198
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:58,290
this is Nathan Twining, a General,

199
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:02,790
Head of the US Air Force Material Command.

200
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:07,050
And he said, quote,
"The phenomenon reported

201
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:11,400
is something real and not
visionary or fictitious,"

202
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:14,970
and you can look that
up in historical annals.

203
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:18,150
But this is the full communication,

204
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:20,790
it's called the Twining
memo, but it wasn't a memo,

205
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:22,920
it was a different kind of communication.

206
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,717
And he said, quite clearly,

207
00:11:25,717 --> 00:11:29,580
"The phenomena is real and
not visionary or fictitious."

208
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:32,190
He described the size of them.

209
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:35,400
And above all, he described
the operating characteristics,

210
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,160
extreme rates of climb, maneuverability,

211
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,890
action which must be considered evasive

212
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:42,900
when cited by friendly aircraft and radar.

213
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,810
In other words, whether
inhabited by intelligent beings

214
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:48,330
or robots, they responded,

215
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:52,267
interacted with our
attempts to intercept them.

216
00:11:52,267 --> 00:11:54,450
"And it lends belief in the possibility

217
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:56,857
that some objects are
controlled," he said,

218
00:11:56,857 --> 00:11:57,960
"Always looking for the least

219
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,030
common denominator of understanding,

220
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:04,350
either manually,
automatically, or remotely."

221
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:06,480
And he added that they're metallic,

222
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,340
they're circular or elliptical in shape.

223
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:10,200
In other words, a classic flying saucer,

224
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,830
often with a dome on top,
flying in formations,

225
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:17,340
and no sound, no sound.

226
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:22,340
We did not know in 1947
how to create vehicles,

227
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:27,300
nor did anyone on this planet,
that didn't have any sounds

228
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,790
and that could fly like that.

229
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:32,370
That's why Major General John Sanford,

230
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:34,500
Chief of Intelligence for the Air Force

231
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,817
made this statement in the early 50's.

232
00:12:36,817 --> 00:12:41,817
"Credible people have
seen incredible things."

233
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,790
So others have described it,

234
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:46,980
and I have referred to these before,

235
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,330
but I'm gonna refer to them again

236
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:52,860
because these are important documentation.

237
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:56,160
Important documentation, it
is important documentation,

238
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,260
of what people knew and when.

239
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:01,920
Herman Oberth was Wernher
von Braun's mentor

240
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,220
and the father of German rocket science.

241
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:09,660
And he described, let
me back up to this one,

242
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:11,520
what they looked like.

243
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,653
He said the appearances are disks.

244
00:13:14,539 --> 00:13:16,260
It sometimes happen they're
one on top of the other.

245
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:19,050
They fly in a manner so
that the drive is acting

246
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:21,033
perpendicular to the plane of the disc.

247
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,120
When they're suspended
over a certain terrain,

248
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:27,030
they keep horizontal, when
they wanna fly quick, they tilt

249
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:29,253
and fly with the plane directed forward.

250
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:31,560
They glitter like metal.

251
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,840
They are dark orange
and cherry red at night,

252
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,000
if there's not much power necessary

253
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,490
for the particular
movement they're making,

254
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:41,430
such as when they're
hovering, suspended calm,

255
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:43,140
then they don't shine much.

256
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:46,470
But if they need more driving
power, whatever it is,

257
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:50,190
the source is their motion,
the shining increases,

258
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:52,560
brightens, and they appear
yellow, yellow-green,

259
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,840
green, like a copper flame.

260
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,340
And in a state of highest speed

261
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:58,380
or acceleration, extremely white.

262
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:02,250
And he went on to say,
look, this is 1950's,

263
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:05,580
the accuracy of these
measurements can't be doubted.

264
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,680
If there were only three or
four, I wouldn't rely on them,

265
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,330
but I've seen more than 50
from wireless sets of radar,

266
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:14,280
the American Air Force and Navy.

267
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,260
They can't all be inaccurate.

268
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:19,440
And this is substantiated
by our own Paul Hill

269
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,560
who worked for NASA for several decades.

270
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:26,460
And he duplicates the
observation that the UFO colors

271
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:29,250
stem from energetic ionizing radiation,

272
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:32,760
generated by the UFO,
which ionize the air.

273
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,830
And he lists the colors, red and orange,

274
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:37,170
least energy and so on, up to blue,

275
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:42,170
the strongest radiation peaks of nitrogen.

276
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,000
So they confirm one another,

277
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,480
what they confirm is that people
are seeing the same things

278
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,900
and that there are correlations
between speed and intensity

279
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:54,630
of ionization and the colors they manifest

280
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:57,480
when that is demonstrated,

281
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,480
as they move extraordinarily quickly.

282
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,440
So we wanna know what they
were. Well, here's a map.

283
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:07,680
This was in Look magazine in the 1950's.

284
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,840
You can't see it well, but
you can see all those labels.

285
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,630
And each label is appended
to a little circle

286
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:15,840
that is around an air force
base or a nuclear facility

287
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:20,100
where UFOs were cited, were hovering,

288
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:23,550
were looking like they
were doing reconnaissance,

289
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:25,380
looking like they were nosy

290
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:27,720
because that's where they showed up.

291
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,540
And that's why Look
magazine and Life magazine

292
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:35,100
ran serious articles
about what we were seeing,

293
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,140
and it was news then.

294
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:39,907
Here's my favorite headline,

295
00:15:39,907 --> 00:15:42,750
"Saucer Outran Jet, Pilot Reveals,"

296
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:43,920
it's in The Washington Post,

297
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,540
it's not in the National Enquirer.

298
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:48,750
That came shortly after these incidents

299
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:51,273
in Washington, DC in 1952.

300
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:57,030
And you can see it,

301
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:59,910
it was news then, it was news.

302
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:02,370
And so here's another news item,

303
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:05,400
Naval personnel drawing what they saw.

304
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,380
A news item, that's the point.

305
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:12,127
Here's another one, another
flying saucer headline.

306
00:16:12,127 --> 00:16:15,052
"Miami Pilots Spot 8 Saucers," et cetera,

307
00:16:15,052 --> 00:16:16,980
"Hundreds in State," in Indiana.

308
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:20,660
England, to show you that
it was a global phenomena.

309
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:23,220
In this picture that you're looking at,

310
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:26,610
when there was a famous
occurrence over Washington, DC

311
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:31,050
in July of 1952, this is what
it looked like to the pilot.

312
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:34,200
He's the dot in the center,
the others are the UFOs

313
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,740
that surrounded him when
he tried to pursue one.

314
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,780
And they came closer and closer

315
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:43,500
until his high emotion,

316
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,730
obvious from the recording

317
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:49,830
we have of him speaking
to the control tower,

318
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:52,470
these were observed by ground observers,

319
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:54,810
pilots sent up to chase them,

320
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:57,720
as well as three different Air Force base

321
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,300
with radar on the ground.

322
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:04,080
This created a pretty big consternation,

323
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,850
how do you explain this?

324
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:07,447
This is when Sanford said,

325
00:17:07,447 --> 00:17:10,920
"Credible people have
seen incredible things."

326
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:14,220
Well they approached it
by appointing a panel

327
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:16,800
called the Robertson panel.

328
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:20,283
It was convened in 1953, in January,

329
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:24,720
and it included Marshall Chadwell,

330
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,020
the CIA Assistant Director
of Scientific Intelligence.

331
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:30,960
His concern was that UFO phenomena

332
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,050
could be exploited by our enemies,

333
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:36,180
especially the Soviet Union then,

334
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:40,080
to incite mass hysteria and
panic and overwhelm lines

335
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,350
of communication required
for early warning defense

336
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:46,800
if their bombers were
coming over the pole.

337
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:50,970
That was the primary
focus, national security,

338
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:54,120
in light of how they could
be used or manipulated

339
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,943
by genuine terrestrial enemies.

340
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,940
So that was a serious concern.

341
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,560
We had to be on the alert

342
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:05,460
for a preemptive nuclear
strike by the Soviet Union.

343
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,980
The panel met for about a day, 23 hours.

344
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:10,710
Most of that time was not spent examining

345
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:12,603
the evidence for the UFOs.

346
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:16,230
We had conclusions like
the Air Force's own

347
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:18,690
photo reconnaissance
lab at Wright-Patterson

348
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:20,310
that said, after several weeks

349
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:22,740
looking at those films I mentioned

350
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,937
from Montana and Tremonton, Utah,

351
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,490
"We don't know what they are,

352
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:28,590
but they aren't airplanes or balloons,

353
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:31,110
and we don't think they're birds."

354
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,677
And the Navy added,

355
00:18:32,677 --> 00:18:37,677
"The UFOs are intelligently
controlled vehicles."

356
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:42,710
But their choice, as you might know,

357
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:46,689
was not to explore it scientifically,

358
00:18:46,689 --> 00:18:47,804
not to validate and verify
what they knew and others knew,

359
00:18:47,804 --> 00:18:52,590
not to validate and verify
what they knew and others knew,

360
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:56,460
it was to create a
press release like this,

361
00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:00,600
with Project Grudge, which
followed Project Sign,

362
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,677
which followed the Robertson panel.

363
00:19:02,677 --> 00:19:05,253
"We have investigated
and evaluated," blank,

364
00:19:06,209 --> 00:19:09,150
"and have found nothing of
value which would change our."

365
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:11,310
In other words, no matter what is seen,

366
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:14,430
put out this blanket denial that anything

367
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:16,623
is worth worrying about.

368
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:20,100
You get the idea, you know
I've referred to illusion,

369
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:23,940
misdirection, ridicule, as
the primary legs of the stool

370
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:25,410
of cover and deception.

371
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:29,250
And that's what they
employed from then on,

372
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:33,667
until, and they had
silliness like this, right?

373
00:19:33,667 --> 00:19:36,750
"UFO Aliens Found at
South Pole," and so on.

374
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:39,900
All kinds of crazy things
were placed in print,

375
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,900
and then the useful
idiots promulgated that

376
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,940
the way useful idiots on social media

377
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:47,883
are promulgating all
sorts of nonsense today.

378
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:52,020
Now the CIA concluded,

379
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:54,483
they're not a threat directly,

380
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:59,100
but military personnel should be trained

381
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:02,790
in the proper observation
of flying saucers,

382
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:05,160
and programs should be created

383
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:08,880
to debunk flying saucers to the citizenry.

384
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,500
So they don't get upset.

385
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:14,790
And that's the way it
was until just recently.

386
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:17,973
Now we have a change in the weather.

387
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:24,110
Now people are saying, "Oh,
there is something to it."

388
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,420
We can only speculate
about the motivations

389
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:30,120
of people who do not show their hands

390
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:34,020
inside the places where
these decisions are made,

391
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:35,580
but it became news again.

392
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:37,980
I showed you it was news,
then it was debunked

393
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:40,350
for decades upon decades.

394
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:43,440
Now "UFO report says UAPs

395
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:48,440
may be a national security
threat, why?" said the CNN.

396
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:50,760
Sixty Minutes, which everybody trusts

397
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,837
like Walter Cronkite was trusted,

398
00:20:52,837 --> 00:20:57,837
"UFOs regularly spotted in
restricted US airspace."

399
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:02,400
So we're back to the
Twining document, right?

400
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,670
Actually we are not, because
we have been researching this.

401
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:10,020
We, serious researchers, for decades

402
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:13,320
since the debunking
started and pushing back

403
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:16,860
against the debunking as
a professional program

404
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:19,860
to mitigate the impact of knowing

405
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:23,910
that real UFOs are visiting us.

406
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:27,270
And they are visiting, they're
not taking off from Kansas,

407
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:31,080
they are arriving from outside the earth.

408
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:34,410
So they are back to the Twining memo,

409
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:37,470
but we've known all this since the 1940's.

410
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:41,040
What have we, unprofessional researchers,

411
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:45,000
but highly credible, been
doing in the meantime?

412
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,390
We have been looking at
thousands and thousands

413
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,043
and thousands of cases.

414
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:54,660
We have lots of data, Project Blue Book,

415
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:58,020
which they undertook
had over 12,000 reports.

416
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:03,000
NICAP, the National
Investigation for Area Phenomena

417
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,690
and CUFOS, Center for
UFO Studies in Chicago,

418
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:09,090
has over 10,000 reports.

419
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:12,600
MUFON and NUFORC have
over 100,000 reports.

420
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:16,470
Most, 90%, are likely
sightings of known objects,

421
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:18,210
but many are not.

422
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:20,820
And they were doing research
that we didn't know about.

423
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:25,657
GEIPAN, in France, conducted
serious investigations of UFOs

424
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:31,953
and got no cooperation
from the United States.

425
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:36,780
Battelle Memorial Institute conducted

426
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:38,460
its own investigations in the 50's.

427
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:40,710
We know, we've been studying it,

428
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:43,740
and here's the Battelle
Memorial Institute analysis.

429
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:47,520
20% are unknown, and so
I wanna use that to show

430
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,910
that they knew from 1947 to '51,

431
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:54,450
the result of serious study
was that most were unknown.

432
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:57,453
And then this 1952 incident happened.

433
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:03,440
People were vectored in to approach,

434
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:07,230
a UFO that was coming in at 18,000 feet,

435
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:10,230
a strong signal and it was
traveling over 1,000 miles.

436
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:15,230
We've clocked these things at
zero to 14,000, in seconds.

437
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:19,200
They don't fly the way we think of flying,

438
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,140
aerodynamically in atmosphere.

439
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:25,620
They move the same way in the same

440
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:29,040
and with the same fidelity
to their structure

441
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:33,300
in space, in water, and in air.

442
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:36,240
They don't fly, something
else is happening.

443
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:40,020
Something is affecting
space time in their vicinity

444
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:43,650
that we don't know how to
understand or replicate.

445
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:46,170
Well in this case, they
reported it to the Pentagon

446
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:49,203
and they said, if another
one comes in, fire on it.

447
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,890
So obviously it's not
a hallucination, right?

448
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:57,890
That's 1952, and I referred
to that 1952 event,

449
00:23:58,177 --> 00:24:01,920
"Credible people have
seen incredible things."

450
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:05,610
And we're back to The Washington
Post the next morning,

451
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:08,460
introducing the subject in that way.

452
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:12,120
So Hynek became disgusted, Alan Hynek,

453
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,440
with how the Air Force treated him

454
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,050
because he was being
bypassed when he tried

455
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:18,900
to be a consultant for the Air Force.

456
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:22,597
And he made this statement
when he created CUFOS in '73,

457
00:24:22,597 --> 00:24:23,647
"The public," he said,

458
00:24:23,647 --> 00:24:25,800
"Was placed in the role on the enemy,

459
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:30,800
against whom counter espionage
tactics must be employed."

460
00:24:31,027 --> 00:24:34,057
"From my personal experience," he said,

461
00:24:34,057 --> 00:24:36,900
"From my personal experience,

462
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:40,110
the public was placed
in the role of an enemy

463
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:44,100
against whom counter espionage
tactics were employed."

464
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:46,170
I frequently felt those in charge

465
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:48,720
did not consider people who reported UFOs

466
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,670
or took a serious in interest in them

467
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:55,140
and wanted data about them,
they considered them enemies.

468
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:57,870
And they didn't need
reports, they had reports.

469
00:24:57,870 --> 00:25:01,410
They had plenty of sensors and
observations and photographs.

470
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:05,430
They knew this was real.

471
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:06,727
They didn't need Aunt Tilly to say,

472
00:25:06,727 --> 00:25:08,310
"Something landed behind my barn

473
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:10,677
and scared the cattle half to death."

474
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,960
This is the way my hero, Mobius,
in the novel that came out

475
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:19,440
last year, "Mobius: a Memoir."

476
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,390
It's called a memoir, but it's fictional

477
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:24,360
because I couldn't write about
an intelligence professional

478
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,850
telling the truth about his experience,

479
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:29,820
unless I put in the guise of fiction.

480
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:33,247
A friend at NSA said that
to me directly, he said,

481
00:25:33,247 --> 00:25:36,390
"You can't ever discuss
what we talk about in here,

482
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:37,747
unless you write fiction."

483
00:25:37,747 --> 00:25:40,740
"Fiction is the only way
you can tell the truth."

484
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,390
Well, thank you for that.

485
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:46,320
And this was the result,
it's highly recognized

486
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,840
as a real terrific tour de force.

487
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:52,380
You can look at the reviews
on Amazon, "Mobius: a Memoir."

488
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:56,220
But I just finished its
sequel, "The Mobius Vector,"

489
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:58,143
which will be coming out soon.

490
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,950
And Mobius says, "The
real collateral damage

491
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:03,997
was to civil society."

492
00:26:03,997 --> 00:26:05,700
"Once information went everywhere

493
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:08,430
faster than anyone could stop it,

494
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:11,677
the people we were protecting
had to be treated as enemies."

495
00:26:11,677 --> 00:26:14,437
"Because if they knew a
secret, everyone knew."

496
00:26:14,437 --> 00:26:17,040
"We had to invent false narratives,

497
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:20,850
this was the origin of this
distorted information space

498
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:22,807
in which we all live now."

499
00:26:22,807 --> 00:26:27,610
"The context of post
technologically revolutionary life

500
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:33,063
required that we do that,"
Mobius said, my hero.

501
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:37,470
And he's a hero because
he became a whistleblower.

502
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:39,570
And the second book, "The Mobius Vector"

503
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:41,790
is about his life as a whistleblower

504
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:43,410
and the third is coming out now.

505
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:45,660
You might find them of interest.

506
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:48,540
At any rate, illusion,
misdirection, and ridicule

507
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:51,960
were directed against us
and I know that personally.

508
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,360
But not just little people like me,

509
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,520
here's the general manager
of the French version

510
00:26:56,520 --> 00:27:00,210
of NSA, NASA, NASA.

511
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:02,550
And he said, "there are
campaigns of misinformation

512
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:04,800
that destabilize, even ridicule,

513
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,277
those who treat the subject seriously."

514
00:27:06,277 --> 00:27:08,370
"The American effort is deliberate

515
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:10,920
and orchestrated disinformation."

516
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:13,260
But why, loss of supremacy?

517
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:17,460
The top dog keeping potential
acquired technology,

518
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:19,890
if we can figure out how this stuff works?

519
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:22,380
Because you better believe
that anyone who figures out

520
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:26,970
how UFOs work owns the planet
and a lot more besides.

521
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:30,780
The technology is so far superior,

522
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:32,670
according to Wernher von Braun,

523
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:37,110
to anything we expected to encounter

524
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:39,930
once we knew the UFOs were real.

525
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:42,750
So here's the head of
NASA in France saying,

526
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:45,720
they're treating us the same
way they're treating you.

527
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,520
And people like Hillenkoetter,
who was the first director

528
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,797
of the CIA said, "It's time
to bring out the truth."

529
00:27:50,797 --> 00:27:53,880
"Behind the scenes, high
ranking Air Force officers

530
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,710
are soberly concerned."

531
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:59,190
I could go on and on with
quotes from the 40's and 50's

532
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:03,780
before the hammer came down
on people telling the truth

533
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:08,460
about what everybody
knew inside the fence.

534
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,410
That's just the way it was.

535
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:12,660
And just because they debunked cases,

536
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:15,870
doesn't mean that
interesting cases went away.

537
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:18,720
I refer you to these four, look them up.

538
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,870
The Minot case was beautifully explored

539
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:26,870
at minotb52ufo.com, a
thoroughly documented account

540
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:31,680
of our pilots encountering UFOs in the air

541
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:35,613
and on the ground at Minot
Air Force base in 1968.

542
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:39,390
Skip down to Tehran, Iran,

543
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:43,170
a DIA FOIA response details and dog fight

544
00:28:43,170 --> 00:28:45,120
between fighters and a UFO.

545
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,490
And an Iranian General later went public

546
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:50,340
at a Washington press conference
and confirmed the event.

547
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:54,090
We have the document from the
Defense Intelligence Agency,

548
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:56,990
and it is stated on the
document that the case

549
00:28:56,990 --> 00:28:59,940
is of the highest credibility.

550
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:03,270
Because when the Iranian pilot
vectored in toward the UFO

551
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:06,180
over Tehran, remember
Iran was our friend then

552
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:07,593
and had our best jets,

553
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:11,010
he was told to arm his craft.

554
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:14,100
And when he did, the avionics went out

555
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,360
and he had a curve around,

556
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,130
looking for a way to come to landing.

557
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:22,130
But once he was out of a
position where he could harm

558
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:25,593
or shoot at the UFO,
the avionics returned.

559
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,440
It sounds like, doesn't it,

560
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:32,250
ah-ah, don't do that, ah-ah?

561
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:34,803
We won't hurt you, but don't try that.

562
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:38,790
Those kinds of incidents
are a lot more common

563
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:40,650
than somebody being injured.

564
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:44,850
So I encourage you to look
at the Tehran UFO incident,

565
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:49,080
the Minot incident, and a
fishing trip to Wisconsin.

566
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,480
Boy, I wanted to give you
the details about that

567
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:54,360
and I don't know that I'll have time.

568
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:57,030
It was a person I interviewed in depth.

569
00:29:57,030 --> 00:29:59,830
We have his account corroborated

570
00:30:00,828 --> 00:30:02,850
of a UFO that came down
and went under the water

571
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:04,620
when he was fishing.

572
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:08,130
And how it came out of the
water with water cascading

573
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:11,400
off the sides, which
were encased in a plasma,

574
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:14,100
the very kind of plasma that ionizes

575
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,480
the atmosphere around it.

576
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,540
Once it was free of the
water, poof, it was gone.

577
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:20,010
But it had to be free of the water.

578
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:21,750
When they're touching the land or water,

579
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:24,030
they use a different propulsion system.

580
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,950
I'll try to give you
more details about that,

581
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:28,173
if I can, if have time.

582
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:33,520
Or write to me, email, or let me know

583
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:35,940
through my contact information

584
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:38,790
that you wanna know more
about it and I'll tell you.

585
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:41,070
This was the head of the
rocket division at Thiokol.

586
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:42,810
I remember being up there
when they were testing

587
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:45,543
a rocket engine, quite thunderous.

588
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,210
And he said, "If the
witnesses are accurate,

589
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:50,130
it's hard to explain what they saw

590
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:54,480
any other way than that they're
extraterrestrial vehicles."

591
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,703
And that's where we are,

592
00:30:57,690 --> 00:31:00,570
that's the point I wanna arrive at here.

593
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:04,080
There's no way to
understand this phenomena,

594
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:09,080
except as a manifestation of
extraterrestrial vehicles.

595
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,780
I list here just some of the kinds

596
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:14,730
of conversations I've had.

597
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:17,520
I've had, I would say, several hundred,

598
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:20,250
as have all of us in
the invisible college,

599
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:24,270
as well as combining over
literally thousands of cases

600
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:26,490
to eliminate everything that didn't fit.

601
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:28,470
And I hope I'll be able to
show you a little bit about

602
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:31,953
what we do with that, but time presses.

603
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:37,800
Recently, I made this simple
statement to a colleague

604
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:40,560
who had worked at the
Pentagon for many years,

605
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,820
that they were real,

606
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:44,070
that they have been here for a long time,

607
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:47,010
and they constitute a
national security threat.

608
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:52,010
And my friend asked about
that, that statement,

609
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,740
of someone who had been the Vice Chair

610
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:57,870
of the Joint Chief of Staff.

611
00:31:57,870 --> 00:31:59,437
And according to my friend, he said,

612
00:31:59,437 --> 00:32:04,437
"Richard, my friend said exactly
the same thing you said."

613
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:08,760
Yeah, they're real, they've
been here for a long time,

614
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,700
and they are a national security threat.

615
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:16,200
NORAD friends call them the visitors.

616
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:19,080
It's just a visitor,
nothing to do about it.

617
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:21,870
Edgar Mitchell, Apollo 14 astronaut,

618
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:24,930
went to the Joint Chiefs,
to their security liaison,

619
00:32:24,930 --> 00:32:26,940
to ask if a government effort was underway

620
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:30,210
to monitor the phenomena
in a meaningful way.

621
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:31,590
And the response he got was,

622
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:34,950
yes it is, don't ask anymore questions.

623
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:36,900
In other words, yes.

624
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:39,240
As the general said to
Alan Hynek in the Pentagon

625
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:41,940
in the 70's, "Alan, for heaven's sakes,

626
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:46,057
do you think we would
ignore something like this?"

627
00:32:46,057 --> 00:32:49,770
"Do you think we would
ignore something like this?"

628
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:52,320
And it was an NSA analyst,

629
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:55,530
someone I knew very well, a close friend,

630
00:32:55,530 --> 00:32:57,750
and I'll never forget
the way his voice sounded

631
00:32:57,750 --> 00:33:01,200
when he reviewed the many
instances he had discussed

632
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:05,910
in detail with people from
sites where events had happened,

633
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:09,990
who came to NSA to take his classes.

634
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:11,302
And he said to me, "Richard,
they're here, they're here."

635
00:33:11,302 --> 00:33:16,302
And he said to me, "Richard,
they're here, they're here."

636
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:20,310
So I'm trying to make the
point that after doing this

637
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:25,310
for 44 years, I don't have much question

638
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:30,210
about what is going on
in that limited way.

639
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:32,490
These are extraterrestrial vehicles,

640
00:33:32,490 --> 00:33:37,410
because nothing else
explains what's going on.

641
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:40,380
Now I wanna move on, I
can't cover everything

642
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:44,400
I put in the slides because I can't.

643
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,500
But here are some reflections

644
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,510
from some of the invisible college.

645
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:49,980
This is to just give you an idea

646
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:53,010
of some of the things we have documented,

647
00:33:53,010 --> 00:33:57,450
humanoid observations,
grays, dwarfs, humans,

648
00:33:57,450 --> 00:33:59,550
and the years in which they cluster.

649
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:03,060
Very similar to vehicle
interference cases,

650
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:05,460
which cluster in exactly the same years.

651
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:06,660
You can say, "Well, why is that?"

652
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:09,690
We don't know why, we don't know why,

653
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:13,050
we don't know what it means
to do it year by year.

654
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:16,530
What does it mean to
calibrate these by years,

655
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:20,310
when they're our years and
the visitors could care less

656
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:23,730
how we tell time using
orbits around the sun?

657
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:26,760
That's how narrowly we think.

658
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,500
We can't get at the reality

659
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:31,830
of this phenomena thinking that way.

660
00:34:31,830 --> 00:34:33,960
Here's a bigger picture of that.

661
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:37,770
And here's an example
of the types of things

662
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:40,230
that are observed that we have broken down

663
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:44,550
into just the most basic 164 cases

664
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:48,570
that are well documented and verifiable

665
00:34:48,570 --> 00:34:52,440
in terms of number of witnesses
and what was observed.

666
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:56,760
Okay, so I'll get to a few
samples from the database.

667
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:59,820
But before I get there, I want to read

668
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:02,610
some of the reflections from my colleagues

669
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:05,430
who have been working
on this for much more

670
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:07,023
than half a century.

671
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:11,760
One, Jan Aldrich, is a brilliant guy,

672
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,590
military intelligence background

673
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:17,580
and he runs Project 1947,
which you can find online.

674
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:20,460
It's a great repository of cases,

675
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:23,370
and you should go there if you
wanna begin doing the work.

676
00:35:23,370 --> 00:35:26,280
Because the work requires
that you look at the cases,

677
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:30,300
look at all of the cases,
read them and read them again.

678
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:33,060
So when I said to him, "What is going on?"

679
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:35,430
He said, "After 50 years,

680
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:40,080
honestly, I have no idea."

681
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:44,520
But here's a fuller statement
from a fellow who had,

682
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:47,940
I shouldn't use the names,
but they're very high ranking

683
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:51,360
in their professions,
which are scientific,

684
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,580
the people I'm gonna quote from.

685
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:56,370
And I'm gonna try to let
the quote stand for itself.

686
00:35:56,370 --> 00:35:59,310
I said, "After doing this
for over half a century,

687
00:35:59,310 --> 00:36:03,030
after heading a scientific
investigative group,

688
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:06,150
after using science,
because you have a PhD

689
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:09,177
in a branch of science,
what do you think?"

690
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:13,260
And this is what he thinks,
"UFOs are physical objects

691
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:15,337
that are intelligently controlled."

692
00:36:15,337 --> 00:36:18,300
"There's no obvious form of propulsion,

693
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:22,530
such as in a plane or a jet
or a rocket or a helicopter."

694
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:24,510
Although they do interact
with the atmosphere,

695
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:27,420
they can move through the
atmosphere at extreme speeds

696
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:29,190
with no obvious interaction

697
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:31,987
as evidenced by a sonic
boom, there isn't any."

698
00:36:31,987 --> 00:36:35,317
"No frictional heating in the
atmosphere, there isn't any."

699
00:36:35,317 --> 00:36:40,050
"Something else is happening
and we don't know exactly yet,

700
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:44,137
certainly out here where we
do our work, what it is."

701
00:36:44,137 --> 00:36:46,860
"The extreme accelerations that are seen,

702
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:50,490
hundreds of G forces,
argue for some unusual

703
00:36:50,490 --> 00:36:54,000
propulsion mechanism to
explain how the craft

704
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,587
and/or occupants in it could survive."

705
00:36:56,587 --> 00:37:00,330
"The origin of these vehicles is unknown,

706
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:02,250
but the most likely explanation

707
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:07,250
is the extraterrestrial
hypothesis for several reasons."

708
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:12,900
First of all, astronomy
argues in favor of this, ETH.

709
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:17,490
We've already discovered
notes over 5,000 exoplanets

710
00:37:17,490 --> 00:37:19,290
and we're limited in what we can detect,

711
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:21,960
and I already pointed out
to you that that's coming.

712
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:24,060
There are millions of
planets in our galaxy,

713
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:28,410
many inhabitable zones that
could support Earth-like life.

714
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:31,080
Chemistry and biology as disciplines argue

715
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:33,960
in favor of the
extraterrestrial hypothesis,

716
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,210
water and oxygen are everywhere.

717
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:40,350
And he goes on, "The building
blocks of life are ubiquitous

718
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:43,200
in our galaxy and likely
in other galaxies,

719
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,340
and physics argue in favor the ETH

720
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:49,800
because UFOs exhibit
the types of velocities

721
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,560
that one would expect from
an interstellar craft."

722
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:56,010
They reach speeds upward
to 40,000 miles per hour

723
00:37:56,010 --> 00:38:00,300
in one to two seconds, and
disappear from human sight.

724
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:02,313
If they maintain that acceleration,

725
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:06,180
a few hours, they'd be
traveling at the speed of light

726
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:07,323
or close to it.

727
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:11,190
So there is a core UFO phenomenon,

728
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:13,050
the product of an advanced,

729
00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:16,530
presumably extra terrestrial intelligence.

730
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:19,830
It can be documented
instrumentally and in other ways

731
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:23,310
science employs to understand
how the universe works

732
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:24,513
and what it contains.

733
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:28,380
In other words, if we could
only turn the resources

734
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:31,710
of science to examining
it in a partnership

735
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:35,760
between civilians and military
and intelligence people,

736
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,473
we would get to it.

737
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:41,520
I said, my friend said "They're here."

738
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:44,250
Well Bill Nelson, the head
of NASA, former Senator said

739
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:49,250
when he got his security
briefing on the recent events

740
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:51,150
that the Navy is now reporting,

741
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:53,947
that resulted in those news
items I mentioned, he said,

742
00:38:53,947 --> 00:38:56,130
"The hairs stood up on
the back of my neck."

743
00:38:56,130 --> 00:38:58,290
Now come on, this is the head of NASA.

744
00:38:58,290 --> 00:39:01,680
He's not making stuff
up just to scare people.

745
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:06,090
So the examples I mentioned to you,

746
00:39:06,090 --> 00:39:08,670
like the Minot case or the Nimitz case,

747
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:09,960
which you can look up online

748
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:13,200
because it's been so detailed lately,

749
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,390
or the famous O'Hare Airport case,

750
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:17,133
which I encourage you to look at.

751
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:20,730
There are multiple
witnesses and at O'Hare,

752
00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:23,610
a visible hole was burned in the overcast,

753
00:39:23,610 --> 00:39:27,240
that required a powerful
outburst of energy to do.

754
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:32,240
So look at the best case,
best witness examples,

755
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:33,900
and you'll see a pattern.

756
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:36,990
There's a limited number
of variety of shapes,

757
00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:39,990
they're metallic, they fly
at extraordinary speeds,

758
00:39:39,990 --> 00:39:41,970
they stop at a dime, they hover.

759
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:44,430
They accelerate like no earthly aircraft,

760
00:39:44,430 --> 00:39:45,930
they make hair pin turns in dirt

761
00:39:45,930 --> 00:39:48,030
like a hummingbird, and defy gravity.

762
00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:51,150
Any of our aircrafts
would just be destroyed

763
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:52,470
trying to do that.

764
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:54,840
In addition, they manifested this

765
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:57,600
for many, many years, and we know it.

766
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:00,600
And look at that chart
again, you have the slides,

767
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,460
on the cluster of sightings

768
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:06,393
in the past of humanoid observations.

769
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:13,350
These sightings, the database
that I presented to you

770
00:40:13,350 --> 00:40:15,210
after the humanoid sightings

771
00:40:15,210 --> 00:40:20,210
is 614 reports of vehicles
with square windows.

772
00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:23,160
Here's an example, third one,

773
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,470
saucer with three square windows.

774
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:29,700
In the white-ish glow within,
they saw a slim humanoid

775
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:33,750
five or six feet tall
dressed in a one page suit,

776
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:37,380
wearing some kind of helmet
with penetrating eyes.

777
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:40,200
You have read about the penetrating eyes,

778
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:43,593
if you have explored this at all.

779
00:40:45,450 --> 00:40:47,610
Human forms were looking out.

780
00:40:47,610 --> 00:40:50,130
Panels and windows appear
around center desk.

781
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:55,130
Look at those 614 reports, just
the examples that I gave you

782
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,240
and look at how many there are.

783
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:59,940
And I'll be glad to provide
anyone, who wants it,

784
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:03,930
with that complete
database of those reports

785
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:07,620
as a beginning point for
you to begin to explore

786
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:09,543
some of this on your own.

787
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:14,640
Carrying on with the
invisible college colleagues,

788
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:17,917
this is a professor of science.

789
00:41:17,917 --> 00:41:21,570
"They or their machines are
here for their own reasons,

790
00:41:21,570 --> 00:41:25,447
and we don't have any
direct data on that."

791
00:41:25,447 --> 00:41:29,280
"They're not interested
in conquest or damage,

792
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:33,900
all the claims of UFO
aggression are lies or hoaxes

793
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:36,660
or human or are mental problems."

794
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,460
It just isn't happening.

795
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:43,460
So what we're left with is as
Jan Aldrich from Project 1947,

796
00:41:44,790 --> 00:41:47,280
he said, he quoted Coral Lorenzen,

797
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:51,990
one of the early documenting
researchers in this field,

798
00:41:51,990 --> 00:41:54,750
quote, "Daddy does not know."

799
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:57,720
The government has more and
better data than it did,

800
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:00,390
and it has more and
better data than we do.

801
00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:04,680
But as far as the full story
goes, we are still back

802
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:06,663
in the 1940's, the 1950's.

803
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:11,370
in the 1940's, the 1950's.

804
00:42:11,370 --> 00:42:15,543
But, what are we gonna do?

805
00:42:18,210 --> 00:42:20,970
Intelligent life probably
exists on distant planets.

806
00:42:20,970 --> 00:42:24,270
If we can't make contact, we know that,

807
00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:27,870
more, more, more on exoplanets.

808
00:42:27,870 --> 00:42:30,363
Back to the galactic clusters,

809
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:32,463
there you see them.

810
00:42:33,930 --> 00:42:38,930
Life abounds, the universe
is teaming with life.

811
00:42:39,450 --> 00:42:43,350
And I have talked directly to witnesses

812
00:42:43,350 --> 00:42:47,283
who have seen humanoid
figures inside craft.

813
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:52,530
And we have documented
cases of humanoid figures,

814
00:42:52,530 --> 00:42:57,473
often smaller than we
are, near landed craft.

815
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,720
You don't need a lot of those.

816
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:03,330
If you see one bear, bears are real,

817
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:05,760
but we have more than you would guess

818
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:09,360
of those well documented cases.

819
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:12,030
I encourage you to
explore them on your own

820
00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:14,580
because what we're going
to be dealing with,

821
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:16,740
in the times to come,

822
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:20,490
are the certainties that we are not alone.

823
00:43:20,490 --> 00:43:22,410
We are not the top of the food chain.

824
00:43:22,410 --> 00:43:23,940
And if we're the apple of god's eye,

825
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:26,340
then there are millions
of apples on the tree.

826
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:28,770
And it's like a sibling
finding out that parents

827
00:43:28,770 --> 00:43:31,203
love all their kids, not just you.

828
00:43:33,450 --> 00:43:37,590
Lots of apples on the tree,
all are apples of god's eye

829
00:43:37,590 --> 00:43:40,650
if you wanna believe in
god or see it that way.

830
00:43:40,650 --> 00:43:45,650
But the simple fact is we're not alone,

831
00:43:46,350 --> 00:43:48,300
and we know we're not alone

832
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:50,760
because the data has accumulated.

833
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:55,503
I'm back to Laniakea, I'm
gonna see if this plays.

834
00:43:57,450 --> 00:43:59,690
Bet you it doesn't, darn it.

835
00:43:59,690 --> 00:44:03,270
It didn't show up in the
PDF file I wanted to use,

836
00:44:03,270 --> 00:44:05,040
it did in the other one.

837
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:10,040
But you can see, there's
the tiny little dot

838
00:44:10,530 --> 00:44:12,630
where the Milky Way galaxy is.

839
00:44:12,630 --> 00:44:17,630
I encourage you to plug
Laniakea into the search engine

840
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:22,640
and watch that brief four minute
video and just contemplate

841
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:26,643
what the James Webb is telling us.

842
00:44:29,790 --> 00:44:34,770
Contemplate what you know to
be true about the universe,

843
00:44:34,770 --> 00:44:36,600
and what you know to be true

844
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:39,660
about the ubiquity of life on earth.

845
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:44,040
Where it can evolve, it will evolve.

846
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:46,800
So there's always more to say,

847
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:49,020
I had other cases I wanted to discuss,

848
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:50,947
I'm gonna show you a picture
of the book I mentioned,

849
00:44:50,947 --> 00:44:54,570
"UFOs and Government,"
Michael Swords, Robert Powell,

850
00:44:54,570 --> 00:44:58,050
some of the invisible college.

851
00:44:58,050 --> 00:45:01,440
I'm there because I
contributed as best I could

852
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:03,270
to this monumental study.

853
00:45:03,270 --> 00:45:04,980
You can buy it, you can buy it from me

854
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:08,760
for the same Amazon
price, if you want signed.

855
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:13,760
And once again I refer you to
my website, theimeworks.com.

856
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:18,150
There's links to an awful lot
of speeches and other things.

857
00:45:18,150 --> 00:45:21,360
And as I say, "Mobius:
A memoir," all I can do

858
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:25,113
is encourage you to look
at the 20 or so reviews.

859
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:29,220
A few at Good Reads, five star reviews,

860
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:31,620
all over Good Reads and Amazon,

861
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:35,080
by people who don't identify
themselves as from DIA

862
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:38,760
or CIA or NSA, but they are.

863
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:42,120
And they laud how well I nailed it,

864
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:44,790
by virtue of my own experience

865
00:45:44,790 --> 00:45:48,600
working with people in
intelligence and security

866
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:51,840
for the past 30 years.

867
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:54,390
This is a homecoming for Def Con,

868
00:45:54,390 --> 00:45:58,680
it has been my psychic home for 26 years.

869
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:02,700
I have spoken at this conference
for 26 straight years.

870
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:06,240
I made the very best,
closest, deeply loved friends

871
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:11,100
and colleagues from that
first time on in 1996.

872
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:15,360
I owe so much to this conference

873
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:20,280
for illuminating the
proper hacker mentality.

874
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:23,430
And I will quote a talk
I did when the businesses

875
00:46:23,430 --> 00:46:25,950
were showing up and recruiting
hackers for the first time,

876
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:27,870
and I was worried they
would be assimilated

877
00:46:27,870 --> 00:46:32,790
into the economic structure,
as most of you have by now.

878
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:35,820
And I said, "Please do not neglect

879
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:39,720
the duplicity and larceny in your hearts."

880
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:42,630
By which I mean, the hacker modality,

881
00:46:42,630 --> 00:46:46,710
the hacker mentality, the
never quit, the up all night,

882
00:46:46,710 --> 00:46:49,830
the find a way to break
down the complex system

883
00:46:49,830 --> 00:46:52,770
until it looks like a
different complex system,

884
00:46:52,770 --> 00:46:55,020
which gives you means and access.

885
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:58,050
Do all the things you need
to do to make the word hacker

886
00:46:58,050 --> 00:47:01,740
not refer to a criminal,
but to the most imaginative,

887
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:06,630
creative, empowered person
we have got in our midst.

888
00:47:06,630 --> 00:47:10,860
So that's it, that's who I am.

889
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:13,920
I look forward to connecting
with you if we can.

890
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:15,420
Thank you for listening.

891
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:20,070
I'm sorry I could not be there
with you, but I'm glad I...

892
00:47:20,070 --> 00:47:22,020
- [G. Mark] Yeah we have him
here with us on the line,

893
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:24,150
so he'd like to say a few words.

894
00:47:24,150 --> 00:47:25,883
Okay, Richard you're live.

895
00:47:25,883 --> 00:47:29,640
(audience applause)

896
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:32,550
- [Richard] Okay, thank you.
Thank you for showing up.

897
00:47:32,550 --> 00:47:35,940
I really appreciate the interest in it.

898
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:39,210
For me, it's been sources and resources

899
00:47:39,210 --> 00:47:43,140
and years of exploring and
trying to pay attention

900
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:44,640
to what's real, and talking to people

901
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,950
both privately and publicly.

902
00:47:46,950 --> 00:47:49,800
And so I finally decided
to tell more of the truth

903
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:52,560
than I ever have, it's simple.

904
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:56,130
Thank you for being there,
I wish I could do Q and A,

905
00:47:56,130 --> 00:47:57,390
we don't have time.

906
00:47:57,390 --> 00:47:59,460
You've got my contact information,

907
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:01,890
it's easy to find through my website.

908
00:48:01,890 --> 00:48:06,210
Any questions, any concerns,
just write to me or text me

909
00:48:06,210 --> 00:48:07,590
and I will get back to you.

910
00:48:07,590 --> 00:48:12,590
And thank you Def Con, thank
you all of you as always,

911
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:17,900
so much for being everything
this con has been for 30 years.

912
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:21,033
- And thank you Richard, from all us.

913
00:48:22,780 --> 00:48:25,780
(audience applause)
