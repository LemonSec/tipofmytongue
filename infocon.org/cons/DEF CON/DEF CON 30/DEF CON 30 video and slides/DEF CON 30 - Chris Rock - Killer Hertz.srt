1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:03,180
- All right you guys. You finally made it.

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:05,910
This is the final talk of the day.

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:09,390
And of course we saved the best for last.

4
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:11,100
And this is basically Chris Rock.

5
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:12,771
He's been here for quite a while.

6
00:00:12,771 --> 00:00:15,750
The third time I've seen
you here. Third time,

7
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,180
and he's been my personal
favorite speaker,

8
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:21,090
'cause the topics, and then
we approach these problems,

9
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:22,260
over the most interesting ones

10
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,870
and hope you enjoy it, like I will.

11
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:26,740
So please give a big hand to Chris

12
00:00:27,704 --> 00:00:31,042
- [Audience] (applause), (cheer)

13
00:00:31,042 --> 00:00:33,730
- and you guys are in for
a big treat, all right.

14
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:46,110
- Thanks for coming to my
talk everybody, Killer Hertz.

15
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:47,760
You hear me all right?

16
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:48,873
Yep. Awesome.

17
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:55,624
So for those who don't know me,

18
00:00:55,624 --> 00:00:58,050
I've been a cyber mercenary for 30 years,

19
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:01,503
and I'm also the CISO and
co-founder of SIEMonster.

20
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:07,260
I was at DEFCON 23, where I
presented, I Will Kill You.

21
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:11,340
This was a talk on vulnerabilities
in the death industry.

22
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,260
And I was also at DEFCON 24 on

23
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,753
How to Overthrow a
Government, with Simon Mann.

24
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:22,920
So the reason I'm doing
this talk is, as a kid,

25
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,580
I grew up with terrorists
on the news all the time.

26
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:31,290
We had the IRA, Hizballah
and then later years,

27
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:36,290
we had Al-Qaeda, ISIS, Jemiah Zamir,

28
00:01:37,011 --> 00:01:39,485
but it seems to have gone quiet.

29
00:01:39,485 --> 00:01:42,063
So where are all the good terrorists gone?

30
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:47,970
Let's have a look at the numbers.

31
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:51,870
Death from terrorism down
39% in Mena, Middle East,

32
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:54,030
North Africa, in the last three years,

33
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:59,030
and terrorist attacks in the
west down 68% since 2018.

34
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:00,510
So something's going on.

35
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,340
The national intelligence
report had terrorism

36
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,573
as just a footnote.

37
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:13,170
So we're gonna have to give these guys

38
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:15,572
a bit of a helping hand
and we're gonna have to

39
00:02:15,572 --> 00:02:16,800
give them a bit of a hand because

40
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,360
if it's not considered a risk,

41
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,873
we're not gonna get a budget
to do what we need to do.

42
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,300
Just to give you some reference,

43
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:27,480
in 2016, they were number
one as the world risk.

44
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,430
So they've had a bit of a downfall.

45
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:31,253
So we need to give them a bit of a hand.

46
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:35,580
In the good old days, you could just walk

47
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:38,883
into a house of worship
and pull the trigger.

48
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,290
And if your guy didn't have
the balls to pull the trigger,

49
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:47,990
you could do it yourself remotely,

50
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,960
but you can't do that
anymore because of jammers.

51
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,900
Jammers are being installed in churches,

52
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,610
synagogues and mosques,

53
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:01,890
not so much for the terrorist aspect,

54
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:05,703
but to keep the audience from
using their mobile phones.

55
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:14,790
I originally got this idea from the talk

56
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:18,503
when Julian Assange was
in the Ecuadorian embassy

57
00:03:18,503 --> 00:03:19,440
and they were using jammers

58
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,510
to stop him communicating.

59
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:23,797
So I reached out to
Julian's team and said,

60
00:03:23,797 --> 00:03:25,297
"What's the problem?" And they said,

61
00:03:25,297 --> 00:03:28,017
"We've tried everything,
but we're being jammed."

62
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,230
And that was a bit of a challenge for me.

63
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:33,780
How do jammers work and
how do you get around them?

64
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:41,940
The thieves are using jammers
to block signals going back

65
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:44,163
to security monitoring stations.

66
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,663
So for those who know jammers,

67
00:03:49,663 --> 00:03:52,140
there's a wide variety
of jammers out there.

68
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:54,630
There's jammers to
protect military convoys.

69
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:58,650
There's the humvee's on
the left. Also personnel.

70
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:01,800
There's also jammers to
protect the corporate sector

71
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:05,250
as well, whether it be
boardroom secrets leaking out,

72
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:09,330
drones, the spying, and
also the prison systems

73
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:13,050
using jammers as well
to stop the prisoners

74
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:14,313
from using mobile phones.

75
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:24,400
So here we have an
example of a Humvee Jammer

76
00:04:26,146 --> 00:04:30,570
being protected by using
jamming signals to stop the ID

77
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:33,150
from blowing up the humvee and also

78
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:37,140
the Thales Eclipse being
protected by a wave

79
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:40,890
to stop that jammer being
targeted to been going off.

80
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:44,111
So I'll give you just a
basic overview of jammers.

81
00:04:44,111 --> 00:04:46,950
It's a complex topic, but
I'll just give you the basics.

82
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:49,320
So we have what's called a spot frequency

83
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,120
where if you know the
frequency of the target,

84
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,540
like a mobile phone, you can
just blast out the signal

85
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,550
to that mobile phone
frequency to block it.

86
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:57,513
That's called spot.

87
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:02,400
We have sweep, where
you're sending out signals

88
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,400
across a wide range of
targets, whether it be

89
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,670
garage door openers, baby
monitors, digital phones,

90
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:10,039
stuff like that.

91
00:05:10,039 --> 00:05:12,510
Or we have something called
barrage, where we send

92
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:14,793
power across all signals, all at once.

93
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,430
Jammers are actually pretty smart

94
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:21,900
and they've evolved over the last 10 years

95
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,850
where they actually
have active intelligence

96
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:26,370
where they'll actually look for a signal,

97
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:28,560
record the signal, and
then play back the signal.

98
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,880
So if there's something that the jammer

99
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,220
has never seen before,
it can be used to record

100
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:35,073
and play back, for even pre detonation.

101
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:45,810
Here's an example of a jammer being used.

102
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:48,660
We've got the hurt
locker on the left there,

103
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,490
trying to disable the IED,

104
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:52,050
and we've got the terrorist on the balcony

105
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:57,050
of glink, trying to
target, to blow up the guy,

106
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,040
and he's got no protection.

107
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,870
But on the right hand side, we have again,

108
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:03,780
the hurt locker with a
jammer protecting him

109
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,063
from a detonation of that IED.

110
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:16,260
Some of the big manufacturers of jammers.

111
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:20,160
You guys will know these names
and the counter ID market is

112
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,663
a 2 billion dollar industry.

113
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:31,620
Here's an example of a personnel jammer

114
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,030
that the military will use,

115
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:34,710
and you'll notice the
different antennas there,

116
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:37,320
high, medium, and low. We'll
get into that more detail.

117
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,850
And you can see the specs beside it.

118
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:40,830
Jammers need a lot of power.

119
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:42,720
So you'll actually see
things like run time

120
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,720
and stuff like that.

121
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:51,240
The commercial sector's exactly the same.

122
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,520
You'll actually get spec
sheets on what frequencies

123
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,063
they protect and also run time
and wattage used per channel.

124
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:06,110
Here's an example of a personal convoy,

125
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:09,180
VIP jammer to protecting VIPs.

126
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,760
And you can see the specs within there.

127
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:14,550
I'll just expand on
that a little bit there.

128
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:16,770
You can see the channel
one has a frequency

129
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:19,950
between 20 and 60 megahertz.

130
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:21,690
That gives you 40 megahertz.

131
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:24,660
Now if each receiver on
an IED can be configured

132
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:27,060
down to 10 kilohertz,
that's 4,000 channels

133
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,770
that this jammer must protect against

134
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:31,020
just within that channel one frequency.

135
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:33,540
So we're talking about
five watts per channel.

136
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:36,210
You're looking at 20 kilowatts of power

137
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:37,590
just for that channel one.

138
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:40,500
So that's why jammers will
use different techniques,

139
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,353
whether it be spot, sweep
or barrage for protection.

140
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:51,450
You guys would've seen
this diagram before.

141
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:53,430
It's a pretty much radio frequency diagram

142
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:56,264
all the way up from VLF to EHF.

143
00:07:56,264 --> 00:07:58,380
In the middle there, you'll
see stuff that we use

144
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:03,064
every day, for radio,
wireless, mobile phones,

145
00:08:03,064 --> 00:08:04,964
short wave radio, and stuff like that.

146
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:15,510
And you'll see the jammer
essentially blocks out

147
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:16,343
that frequency.

148
00:08:16,343 --> 00:08:17,880
You notice I haven't covered
the lower frequencies.

149
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,410
I'll get into those a little bit later on.

150
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:21,840
So jammers effectively
block anywhere between

151
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:26,040
20 megahertz and 6,500 megahertz.

152
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,870
There is some specialist
jammers that'll block down

153
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:31,530
to one megahertz, such as
like radio frequencies,

154
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:34,770
but that's huge scale jam
protection. They're static.

155
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:37,080
They're not mobile like we
saw before on the humvee.

156
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,173
So I was interested in
what's below 20 megahertz.

157
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,800
Here's an example of a IED,
how an IED is put together.

158
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,440
Obviously we're not gonna go
into all the details of an IED

159
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,940
and we're gonna focus
on the switch component,

160
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:56,670
but just so you know what
we're looking at here.

161
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:59,673
We have a container which
essentially encompasses the IED.

162
00:09:00,614 --> 00:09:03,900
That can be anything.
It can be a cigar box.

163
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:07,020
It can be a steel box. It can be a cow,

164
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:09,390
a dead cow on the side
of the road or a vehicle.

165
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:12,930
Obviously the shrapnel, the
switch, the power source,

166
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:15,570
and essentially the explosives down below.

167
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:17,770
I'm only gonna focus
on the switch component

168
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,100
and you can see there,

169
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,470
there's some military ordinance there.

170
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:30,215
It makes a good IED
because essentially it has

171
00:09:30,215 --> 00:09:33,900
some of those parts already,

172
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,370
whether it be the container, the shrapnel

173
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:37,410
and the main charge, so all we need to do

174
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:40,413
is add power and a switch.

175
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,580
So let's have a look at the
different types of switches.

176
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,440
We're not gonna go into all
of them. I've written a paper.

177
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,660
You can have a look at
the other ones later on,

178
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,550
but I was going from the bottom up.

179
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:57,660
We have victim operated. This
could be like a cigar box,

180
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,790
similar to what the uni bomber used,

181
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:03,147
where the victim opens
it up and gets blown up.

182
00:10:03,147 --> 00:10:05,880
And we have a timer which,
this could be anything,

183
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:09,623
from a kitchen timer that can
be a washing machine dial,

184
00:10:09,623 --> 00:10:12,510
or it can be something as complex

185
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:13,998
as a number 10 delay pencil,

186
00:10:13,998 --> 00:10:16,020
which they used in World War II,

187
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:18,990
which was essentially a
pencil with a copper section,

188
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:21,360
with a glass of vial inside that

189
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,520
when you crush the copper section,

190
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,590
the vial would break and cupric chloride

191
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:30,123
would then melt a striker and
then kick off the detonation.

192
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:33,030
And the one we're looking
at today is the command,

193
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:34,563
the remote control component.

194
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:43,800
So looking at the command,

195
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,270
obviously we have things like trip wires

196
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,103
and stuff like that.

197
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:46,950
Now we're not looking at that today.

198
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:48,770
We're looking at the
radio control section.

199
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:50,760
So in the red box there,

200
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,280
you'll see things like
cordless phone, mobile phone,

201
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:56,220
garage door openers, baby
monitors, and things like that.

202
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,270
Something that can be triggered remotely.

203
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:02,700
Now, the beauty of these technologies is

204
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,230
when you're using things like mobile phone

205
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:06,060
or cordless phones, digital phones,

206
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:08,160
is they're being designed
to put up with interference,

207
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,390
So if they're being jammed,

208
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:10,800
they'll actually switch frequencies.

209
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,320
So jammers need to look at that and then

210
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,093
move frequencies to support that.

211
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,050
So I'm a bit of a practical guy.

212
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:26,250
I'm happy to do the theory,

213
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,800
but I like to look at
the prac side together.

214
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,980
So I've actually built the
switch component of an IED

215
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,393
with a garage door opener,

216
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:36,750
but instead of having an initiator

217
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:39,150
to kick the explosive off, I've
just used a flashing light.

218
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:40,700
That seemed a little bit safer.

219
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:54,581
So you can see there's no container there.

220
00:11:54,581 --> 00:11:56,820
There's the power source,
the 12 volt battery,

221
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:59,010
the initiator, which is
actually the light in this case

222
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:00,810
and the remote control garage door,

223
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:02,310
which is the switch component.

224
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:07,980
I've done the same with a mobile phone.

225
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:10,567
In this case, I haven't used a light.

226
00:12:10,567 --> 00:12:12,570
I've used a piece of nichrome wire,

227
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:14,703
which is to act as an initiator.

228
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:35,850
And I dunno if you can see that
clearly, but it just lit up.

229
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:39,420
So now that's the switch component,

230
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,610
and then I'll show you how
jammers work with that.

231
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:44,730
So let's test our IEDs out in the field,

232
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:46,290
first with a garage door opener,

233
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:48,653
and then with a mobile phone.

234
00:12:49,552 --> 00:12:52,802
(explosive rock music)

235
00:13:50,472 --> 00:13:53,389
- [Automated Voice] Terrorists win.

236
00:13:55,443 --> 00:13:58,776
- [Audience] (applause)

237
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:02,460
- So that was shot with a Phantom camera

238
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:05,853
that does 1,000 frames per
second to get that footage.

239
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:10,680
So let's look at the counter measures.

240
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,513
Let's look at the jammer.

241
00:14:11,513 --> 00:14:14,433
How does the jammer
operate against these IEDs?

242
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:19,800
Again, here's our garage
door and let's have a look

243
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,900
at what a jammer does.

244
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:48,710
So it completely kills the signal.

245
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,720
Again, let's have a
look at the same example

246
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,223
with a mobile phone.

247
00:15:28,606 --> 00:15:29,790
So you can see the
jammer is very effective.

248
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:30,960
This is just a portable jammer,

249
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,150
but very effective in blocking
the signal from the phone.

250
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:35,550
Now the jammer will either
block the transmitter,

251
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:36,843
or the receiving device.

252
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:41,820
Next we'll have a look at
the jammer in the field.

253
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,890
This case, I've used a
more of a powerful jammer

254
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:45,570
just because the ranges that we had to do.

255
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:49,768
So this is based on a
pelican suitcase jammer.

256
00:15:49,768 --> 00:15:53,018
(explosive rock music)

257
00:16:13,081 --> 00:16:15,998
- [Automated Voice] Terrorist wins.

258
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:20,400
- So that jammer essentially
blocks the communication.

259
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,473
It's essentially a ten to one mute ratio.

260
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:29,430
So now that we know how jammers work,

261
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:31,330
where are the holes in the technology?

262
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,290
So we can see the jammer will
blocks those frequencies.

263
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:37,440
We talked about it before,
the 20 to 60 to 500 megahertz,

264
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,030
but what about these other frequencies?

265
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:40,593
VLF all the way down to ELF.

266
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,140
You can see the wavelength size.

267
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,850
I think that might be the
problem of why jammers

268
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:47,400
are not configured to work
at those sort of ranges.

269
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:54,706
Taking a closer look at these,

270
00:16:54,706 --> 00:16:56,940
the frequencies or wavelengths,

271
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,500
you can see that they're
used by the military,

272
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,363
VLF, ULF, and ELF.

273
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:05,430
And you can actually see
that it's actually used

274
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:07,800
from a military point of view
for things like navigation

275
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:11,223
is also a way of communicating
to submarines underwater.

276
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:17,640
So these wavelengths actually
travel around the world.

277
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:25,260
In the sixties there was
actually a project called

278
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:27,780
project Elf, where they
actually built these rays.

279
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,820
And you can see the sizing there,

280
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:33,240
6,000 miles of buried cable
and two 40 mile antennas

281
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,560
to actually transmit.

282
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,257
So you can see now why the
jammers are pretty much

283
00:17:36,257 --> 00:17:38,250
not configured below 20,

284
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:40,700
just 'cause of the size
of the antennas required.

285
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:49,830
Just to give you a
visualization, how VLF works.

286
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:52,860
Here's a cross section of
the Earth, 400 kilometers.

287
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:54,900
On the top Z, that's our ionosphere,

288
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,660
that's 40 kilometers
above the Earth surface.

289
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:01,500
On the Y axis the lowest
point is the Earths surface

290
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,230
and you can see the VLF
wavelength actually propagating

291
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:06,333
or going around the Earths surface.

292
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,713
So it's great for
communication around the world.

293
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,240
Okay. ULF lower than VLF,

294
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,430
range from 300 Hertz to three kilohertz,

295
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:29,730
wave length 1,000 to 100
kilometers in length,

296
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:31,680
and the two kilohertz,
which is gonna come up

297
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,830
during this talk, the wave
length's 150 kilometers long,

298
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:37,290
and you can see by the antenna
size at a half wave length,

299
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:39,780
we're looking at a 75 kilometer antenna.

300
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:42,360
Now having an IED with a
75 kilometer antenna up,

301
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,283
is pretty obvious.

302
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:48,570
The signal light travels
through Earth and through water.

303
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,230
I need to explain something
called near field and

304
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:57,300
far field. Some of you will
already know what this is,

305
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,680
but I need to cover this in depth

306
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:01,410
so you can see what
technology we're using here.

307
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:03,690
I'll use the duck in the water example.

308
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:06,090
So picture a dead duck
that you chuck in a pond.

309
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,150
When you chuck the duck in the water,

310
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:11,300
it will bounce left
and right, up and down.

311
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,900
Away from that duck,
you'll see ripples or waves

312
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,403
form away from that target.

313
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,550
Where the ducks moving left
and right, up and down,

314
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:22,470
we call that near field.

315
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:25,920
Where it has those nice
waves, consistent waves,

316
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,213
we call that far field.

317
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:29,520
When we're talking about far field,

318
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,320
we're talking about all the
wireless crap that you guys

319
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,540
on a daily basis, mobile
phone, garage store opener,

320
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:36,180
baby monitors, everything.
That's radio comms,

321
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:38,640
but it's the near field part
that I need to communicate to

322
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,740
you guys on what this tech that I'm using.

323
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,990
So here's a more technical
than the duck view

324
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:50,850
of near versus far.

325
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:53,880
In this case, instead of the
duck, we have the antenna,

326
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,800
we have the wavelength reactive,

327
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,540
I'll get into that a little bit later.

328
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:59,793
moves into frotional
pattern, then far field.

329
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:12,450
Another technical view we have
just before the transition

330
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:14,190
period, that's our near field range

331
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:15,150
and you can see something called

332
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:16,650
an E field, electrical field,

333
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:18,930
and also H field, magnetic field,

334
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:21,930
essentially the antenna's
getting it's shit together.

335
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:23,670
It's 90 degrees out from phase,

336
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:24,900
and as it moves into far field,

337
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,663
which is essentially two
wavelengths from the antenna.

338
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,900
The reason I wanted to show
you this, is the H field,

339
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,150
is something that we're looking
into, the magnetic field.

340
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:34,470
We're not interested in the E field.

341
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:36,660
It's the magnetic field we're after,

342
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:38,103
before it reaches far field.

343
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,710
Again, another diagram there.

344
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:49,080
The point that I wanted to
show you this diagram for

345
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:52,500
is just where you can see
where two wavelengths out

346
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:57,500
for far field and one to two
wavelengths for near field.

347
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:01,170
And that reactive zone
there near the antenna

348
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:03,660
is actually, it transmits power.

349
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:06,460
So we can actually transmit
power in that reactive zone.

350
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,820
And this is the far field.

351
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,710
This is what we use pretty much every day

352
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:15,210
with wireless comms.

353
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:16,920
You can see we've got the electrical field

354
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:20,040
and the magnetic field
working at right angles,

355
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:24,600
perpendicular to each
other, with a clear path.

356
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,950
This is like the waves from the ducks.

357
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:28,383
It's just a clear communication path.

358
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:36,330
And we use near field every day.

359
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:40,500
You guys use it for payment
processing or proximity cards

360
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:45,500
running at 13.56 Megahertz
or the older 125 kilohertz.

361
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:48,390
You'll notice the antenna is a coil,

362
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,430
and that coil is used
to pick up that H field

363
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:52,500
that we were talking about
before in the near field range,

364
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,343
not the E field.

365
00:21:59,324 --> 00:22:00,930
Now all our lives in
security, we were taught

366
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:04,890
near field, great for secure
communications at short range.

367
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:05,760
And that's true.

368
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,070
It's got a great range from
one to five centimeters,

369
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:09,420
but what happens if we change that?

370
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:11,283
What happens if we use two kilohertz?

371
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,010
Our near field range is 75 kilometers.

372
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:15,690
Now I can work with 75 kilometers.

373
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:17,730
That gives me a communication
channel that I can use

374
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:20,122
as long as I can get
a large enough antenna

375
00:22:20,122 --> 00:22:22,053
to communicate at that range.

376
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:31,860
So how do we create a wavelength

377
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,260
without the massive antenna?

378
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:37,220
Something called Earth mode.

379
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:41,190
We're essentially using
the Earth as an antenna.

380
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:45,030
So NATO defines Earth mode
as three separate ways.

381
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,110
I've gotta make sure that you guys know

382
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:47,580
which one is which.

383
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:49,410
The first one is, up and over.

384
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:53,040
A large antenna is inserted
into the ground and the VLF,

385
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,840
that large wavelength or ULF

386
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,750
will move up across and then down.

387
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:00,180
That's not what we're using today.

388
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:02,670
We have our Deep Strata Mining comms.

389
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:04,200
The one that actually
goes through the Earth.

390
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,540
This is used in the mining industry.

391
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:09,780
Up to eight kilometer loops
on the surface of the Earth

392
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:14,370
and uses a magnetic field to
communicate down to miners.

393
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:16,110
You guys may not be aware

394
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:18,660
that you can't use radios underground.

395
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:20,100
So there's ways of getting around that

396
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:22,440
using magnetic fields.

397
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,330
It can also be used for blasting as well.

398
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:28,230
So if you've got a blast caps underground,

399
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:29,910
you can actually send
a signal which is safer

400
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:31,740
from above the ground to blow it up.

401
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:36,480
You can also communicate to
miners on one way communication

402
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,880
or used for asset tracking
as well for objects

403
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,180
that are under the ground.

404
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:43,740
And the third one is the one
that we're looking at today.

405
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:45,180
It's an adaption of something called

406
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:47,070
Conduction Current Mode,

407
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:51,210
where two electrodes are
inserted into the Earth

408
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:53,850
with a voltage applied to both electrodes

409
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:57,000
and a magnetic field is
created in the Earth's surface

410
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,620
to a receiving target.

411
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:01,110
Now that can be either
picked up by an E field,

412
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:02,850
another two probes at the other end.

413
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:04,020
I'm not interested in that.

414
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:06,660
That was used by Morse and
in World War I to communicate

415
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:09,720
between bunkers. The one
that we're using today is a

416
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,403
magnetic field loop antenna.

417
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,330
So before we create some hardware,

418
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:20,370
we're gonna have to do some
simulations to find out what's

419
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:22,440
the best frequency,
what's the best distance

420
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:27,440
between electrodes and what's
the best voltage to apply.

421
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:29,790
So I used three different
programs to do this.

422
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:33,720
One's called ANSYS, one's
RES2Mod, and one's CST Studio.

423
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,280
You can see the block
of the Earth we used for

424
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,677
the simulation. Nine by
nine by two kilometers,

425
00:24:37,677 --> 00:24:39,093
the two kilometers deep.

426
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,450
And we used electrodes that
were two meters in length,

427
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:44,490
one meter into the ground.

428
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:47,853
And they started off as 10
meters apart from each other.

429
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,330
This will give you an
idea of what the signal

430
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:56,160
actually looks like.
So from the simulation,

431
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,590
you can actually now visualize
to see that the signal

432
00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:01,200
not just travels along
the surface of the Earth,

433
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,303
it travels in the Earth itself.

434
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:09,990
Again, radio frequencies
don't travel underground,

435
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:11,973
but at least low spectrum, it does.

436
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:19,920
So the first three frequence
we used were 73 kilohertz,

437
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:22,530
nine kilohertz, and 0.1 kilohertz.

438
00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:24,960
And that shows you the bit
of the range that we used.

439
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,890
So 10 meter electrode separation,
only one amp was applied.

440
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:31,530
We're using no modulation, no pre amps.

441
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:32,550
This is just basic,

442
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:35,190
which frequency can
generate the most amount of,

443
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:36,490
in distance for signaling.

444
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,870
And the 0.1, as you
can see was at close to

445
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:41,043
a kilometer in length.

446
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,550
Here's a spreadsheet,

447
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:50,700
more details in my paper
about 73 kilohertz.

448
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:53,670
We can effectively get
a range of 1,600 meters

449
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:57,583
using a thousand meter
separation between electrodes,

450
00:25:57,583 --> 00:26:01,353
3,600 Watts of power, and
that's the usable distance.

451
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:07,080
At nine kilohertz you can see,
we can get further distance.

452
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,660
We can get up to 2,800
meters with nine kilohertz.

453
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:11,850
Again, this is with no modulation.

454
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:13,620
This is with no impedance matching.

455
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:15,323
We'll get into that a little bit later.

456
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:20,793
And finally, 0.1 megahertz.

457
00:26:21,889 --> 00:26:22,722
You can see there,

458
00:26:22,722 --> 00:26:25,043
we're getting ranges of up
to five kilometers in length.

459
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:31,683
And that was the simulation
based on 0.1 megahertz.

460
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,920
Now, why don't we just use 0.1 megahertz?

461
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,870
It obviously goes really far.

462
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:41,760
The problem we have is that
that range, we're dealing with

463
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,410
all the other nonsense in the world.

464
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:46,290
So we're dealing with
natural and manmade noise,

465
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:50,100
natural being lightning
strikes. So a lightning strike,

466
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,300
I couldn't even believe this figure,

467
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:54,330
8 million strikes per day hit the Earth.

468
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:56,370
And like I showed you
with that VLF wave length,

469
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:57,540
that's goes around to Earth,

470
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:59,400
exactly the same thing
happens with lightning strikes

471
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,592
and we're talking like a billion volts.

472
00:27:01,592 --> 00:27:03,092
So the signal goes pretty far.

473
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:05,970
Manmade noise, we're talking about things

474
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:07,800
like utilities, transformers,

475
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:11,973
stuff that is a side effect
of manmade equipment.

476
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:17,430
So instead of using 0.1,
which has a lot of noise,

477
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:20,073
the best range was one to four kilohertz.

478
00:27:28,611 --> 00:27:29,730
In this slide, you can have a look at

479
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:32,700
what it looks like between
low power versus high power.

480
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:36,240
Obviously the more power you
submit, the longer the signal.

481
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,390
So you can see one kilometer at 20 Watts,

482
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:42,513
whereas we got 2.5 kilometers
to 3,600 Watts of power.

483
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,970
Also TX electrode separation,

484
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:53,701
we've got one at 10 meters and one at 100.

485
00:27:53,701 --> 00:27:55,493
So we're starting to see a pattern here.

486
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:04,110
Something I'll get into
a little bit later,

487
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:06,630
but it's something called
normal versus tangential.

488
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:08,760
Normal means an antenna is
lying flat on the ground.

489
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:11,130
That is that loop antenna
lying flat on the ground.

490
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:13,290
Tangential is when that
area, that antenna,

491
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:15,270
that loop is actually vertical,

492
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:17,880
90 degrees from the Earth's surface.

493
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,500
Now, why don't we use tangential?

494
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,610
I'll get into that little bit later.

495
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:21,720
We obviously get more distance,

496
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:25,140
but we absolutely have some
issues with an up and down,

497
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,010
especially with an IED.

498
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:28,620
You don't want that standing
above the Earth's surface,

499
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:30,320
but there's other reasons as well.

500
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,600
We did some E-Field tests as well.

501
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:39,180
You may remember from the
picture I showed you before,

502
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:40,680
And actually there's a
tiny little picture there

503
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:43,350
where we've got the E Field
up the top in near field

504
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:44,680
and also the H Field.

505
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,890
This is done previously through history,

506
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:48,993
as I said, Morse, and during World War I.

507
00:28:50,781 --> 00:28:52,081
The range was not as good.

508
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:00,930
Another thing we had to take
in effect before we designed

509
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:03,090
our hardware was impedance matching.

510
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:05,160
Impedance matching means matching the soil

511
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,290
to what you are using the device in.

512
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:09,510
By matching the impedance on the receiver

513
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:12,810
and the transmitter, we
actually got further gain

514
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:15,750
from the hardware device and
also within the simulations.

515
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:19,440
So we can see, we got 1.5
kilometers in dry soil

516
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,360
with matched impedance,

517
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,659
but we only got 0.7 with non matched.

518
00:29:23,659 --> 00:29:25,950
In the hardware we
needed to actually put in

519
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:27,243
some impedance matching.

520
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,931
Another thing to take into
account because we're using

521
00:29:33,931 --> 00:29:37,680
frequencies which have a lot of noise

522
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,810
is modulation techniques.

523
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:42,480
The best one to use through
the Earth is something called

524
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,030
ANC, adapted noise cancellation.

525
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:47,460
MLD, maximum likelihood detection,

526
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:50,100
and DAFB, decision aided feedback.

527
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,660
We could double our distance by using

528
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:53,763
the right modulation techniques.

529
00:29:55,432 --> 00:29:56,850
In the paper that I've written,

530
00:29:56,850 --> 00:29:58,260
which is on the DEFCON media server,

531
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:00,930
I've actually got schematics
for different modulations,

532
00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:02,130
so you can try them out.

533
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:12,810
We talked before about using
power through the Earth.

534
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:16,230
We can actually transmit at 3,600 Watts,

535
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:18,090
we can actually move
power through the Earth

536
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:20,610
at about 50 meters. It's not a huge range,

537
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:22,860
but we can actually move
power through the Earth.

538
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:24,210
And you might think, "Well,
what's the point of that?"

539
00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:26,520
Well, it can be used in
things like agriculture.

540
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,560
We can actually run this across a farm

541
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,710
and have sensors
underground without power.

542
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:42,240
I talked before about
normal versus tangential

543
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,113
antenna placement, where
tangential had better range

544
00:30:45,113 --> 00:30:47,970
than normal. The beauty of normal is

545
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:50,520
if you're lying it flat on the ground,

546
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,873
it's immune from jammers.

547
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:57,390
With tangential, in the unlikely scenario

548
00:30:57,390 --> 00:30:58,990
that someone's running a jammer,

549
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:02,340
we're talking thousands of
kilometers away in far field

550
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:05,583
against the one to four kilohertz range,

551
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,064
what we need to do is use two antennas

552
00:31:09,064 --> 00:31:10,950
at right angles to each other.

553
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:13,260
And sometimes we would need a whip antenna

554
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:14,433
to confuse the jammer.

555
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:23,790
And just using the simulation software.

556
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:27,120
we can actually say that by
using the right frequency,

557
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,760
the right separation,
the right modulation,

558
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,080
and upping the power,

559
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:33,780
we can actually get big
ranges with this thing.

560
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:37,533
That's 4,200 meters,
that's without pre amps.

561
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:43,410
Okay that's enough of
the simulation stuff.

562
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:44,660
Let's go to the hardware.

563
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:49,320
This was my prototype
using those simulations.

564
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,450
So on the left, we have the transmitter,

565
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:56,450
which has got a signal generation
power pack, a modulation.

566
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:59,790
And on the right hand side,
we have a circular antenna.

567
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:03,870
I'll get deeper into that, a
laptop for doing modulation

568
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:08,100
as well as de logging
encryption and stuff like that,

569
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,660
and battery and analog.

570
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:12,180
A lot of this can be replaced
by using things like Arduino,

571
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,803
where we can use pure synthesis.

572
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,720
So here's our transmitter
with a commercial version

573
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:24,300
where we've replaced a lot of those parts

574
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:27,330
with smaller parts obviously.
When I design hardware,

575
00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:28,800
it's always best to build big,

576
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:31,140
make it easier on yourself
and then shrink it down,

577
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:33,090
when you know it actually bloody works.

578
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,890
So in this case, we're
using the Arduino/Pi

579
00:32:40,890 --> 00:32:43,563
to do the encryption and processing.

580
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:54,150
And here's the RX component.

581
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:56,010
We shrunk that down quite considerably,

582
00:32:56,010 --> 00:32:57,933
again using a Arduino.

583
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:01,200
You can see on the ground
there, that circle,

584
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:05,850
I'll give you a close up on
that in a sec, and LCD display,

585
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:09,360
so you can actually
communicate not only on an IED,

586
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,310
but you can actually
communicate messages between

587
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:13,510
transmitter and receiver
at those distances.

588
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,900
And on the one on the left,
we have the transmitter,

589
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,610
there's the electrodes.

590
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:26,820
In the real world, in a IED setting,

591
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:27,780
you're not gonna use electrodes.

592
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:30,019
You're gonna use things that
already exist, stop signs,

593
00:33:30,019 --> 00:33:34,020
picket fences, stuff like that.

594
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:36,810
And on the right, we have our antenna,

595
00:33:36,810 --> 00:33:38,880
which I'll expand that out.

596
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,370
So that's a one meter diameter
antenna with copper wire

597
00:33:41,370 --> 00:33:44,583
that's rounded. That is our
loop antenna at large scale.

598
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:56,530
Here are the field tests
that we did in Australia,

599
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:02,160
TX electrodes, 50 meters apart.

600
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,020
We only used 20 Watts of power
'cause we're in the middle of

601
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:09,020
nowhere and we got to
923 meters in distance,

602
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:11,553
and that was with basic ASK modulation.

603
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:20,910
Something interesting that did
pop up was this result here,

604
00:34:20,910 --> 00:34:23,970
and when on closer analysis,
you'll see that red line

605
00:34:23,970 --> 00:34:26,010
that's going across from east to west,

606
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:28,410
that was actually some
fencing wire underground.

607
00:34:28,410 --> 00:34:31,260
So you'll notice the
signal being a H field

608
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:35,670
magnetic field actually
transmitted along the wire.

609
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:37,920
And the beauty of that
is you can actually get

610
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,930
longer distances by using something called

611
00:34:39,930 --> 00:34:41,370
utilities, assisted mode.

612
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:42,867
And there's actually some
literature on the internet where

613
00:34:42,867 --> 00:34:45,119
you can actually look where
hobbyists are be using

614
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:48,540
underground pipes in the
UK to get longer signals

615
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:52,620
with even basic equipment
that I'm putting forward here.

616
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:54,750
So in other words, if you're
using it in an urban setting,

617
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:56,200
you'll get further distances.

618
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:04,883
Everything I built is home
brew, so you can build your own,

619
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:12,450
including the schematics. And again,

620
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:14,050
they're all on the media server.

621
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:20,090
So in summary, this is what we've built.

622
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:24,240
We've got a commercial
transmitter with two electrodes in

623
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,280
the ground at varying distance.

624
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:29,190
We've got a large scale jammer

625
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:31,980
and we've got our loop
antenna under the ground.

626
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:33,830
So let's have a look at it in effect.

627
00:35:38,009 --> 00:35:41,259
(explosive rock music)

628
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:20,697
- [Automated Voice] Terrorists win.

629
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:27,033
- [Audience] (applause)

630
00:36:30,773 --> 00:36:32,460
- Besides the ID component,

631
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:34,650
we have other use cases
for this technology.

632
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:36,720
Again, agriculture,
which I mentioned before

633
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:39,240
about communicating with
underground sensors.

634
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,590
Again, you don't need power.

635
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:43,163
You can actually communicate
short distance with power.

636
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:49,020
Also another use case is spying.

637
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:50,790
We're running at one to two kilohertz.

638
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:52,350
The jammer, like I said, is not listening

639
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:54,180
at 20 to 65 megahertz.

640
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:56,460
And you need large antennas

641
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:58,113
to pick these sort of signals up.

642
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,060
Also in a war setting as well.

643
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,020
So just to summarize,

644
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:18,870
the device will communicate
up to seven miles in length.

645
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:21,180
It operates at 1 to 4 kilohertz,

646
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:24,450
conductive current magnetic
field ULF in near field,

647
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:26,973
not far field. Jammers work in far field.

648
00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:33,090
Configurable from 20 Watts to 3,600 Watts

649
00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:34,440
and scale up to 20 kilowatt.

650
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,090
Obviously the more
kilowatts you're running,

651
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:40,200
the more difficult hardware is to manage

652
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:44,940
at the transmitter end.
RX only runs on 20 Watts,

653
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:47,040
impedance matching for
different soil types,

654
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:51,620
whether it be dry, sand or
wet soil, encrypted message,

655
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:55,353
modulation options, and
as I said, jammer proof.

656
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:00,030
And that's the end of the talk.

657
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:02,930
If you want any further
details on the tech

658
00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:05,730
you can have a look at the
paper on the media server.

659
00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:07,338
Thank you very much. Thank you.

660
00:38:07,338 --> 00:38:11,096
- [Audience] (applause)

661
00:38:11,096 --> 00:38:12,096
- Thank you.
