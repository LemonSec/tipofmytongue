1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,586
- Welcome to the DEF CON
30 Homecoming 101 Track.

2
00:00:04,586 --> 00:00:08,836
(audience cheering and applauding)

3
00:00:11,973 --> 00:00:15,390
So it is been like a very emotional year.

4
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:18,870
How many people at the
beginning of the year

5
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:21,103
weren't sure if we were
even gonna be here?

6
00:00:21,103 --> 00:00:22,560
A show of hands?

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,160
Right, it's really questionable.

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,110
Month after month, and the stress,

9
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:32,670
and so being here and seeing
my people is really awesome.

10
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:34,830
So you're awesome,

11
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:36,544
just thought I'd say that.

12
00:00:36,544 --> 00:00:39,480
(audience applauding)

13
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,840
So for those of you who have
not really been to a DEF CON,

14
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,370
or maybe only a DEF CON virtual,

15
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:46,230
and now this is your first...

16
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:47,790
First timers, raise your hand.

17
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:48,840
No shame.

18
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,868
Holy shit.

19
00:00:49,868 --> 00:00:51,503
(laughs)

20
00:00:51,503 --> 00:00:53,040
- That's amazing.

21
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,240
- Oh well, I mean it makes sense,

22
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,070
you'd all be in this room at this time.

23
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,600
So that works.

24
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,923
Okay so you won't get too
many of the older references,

25
00:01:00,923 --> 00:01:02,073
but that's fine.

26
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:05,370
I'll just kind of talk for
about 10 or 15 minutes,

27
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:07,297
and then we're gonna pass off to Melanie

28
00:01:07,297 --> 00:01:10,650
who runs our communications and press

29
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:15,028
and is sort of the
consciousness of the CON.

30
00:01:15,028 --> 00:01:16,230
- Don't put that on me.

31
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:17,580
- I don't put that...

32
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:20,103
I lean on Mel for a lot of advice,

33
00:01:20,103 --> 00:01:22,140
and then we're gonna have this great panel

34
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:27,140
with some new and longtime
DEF CON goons and attendees.

35
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:29,337
And then, we're gonna go to the audience

36
00:01:29,337 --> 00:01:32,340
and ask some question and
answer your questions.

37
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:33,603
So before we do that,

38
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:36,990
there's a couple of cliche
phrases around DEF CON

39
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:37,823
I just wanna address.

40
00:01:37,823 --> 00:01:41,070
One is DEF CON is what you make of it

41
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:45,757
and this came about when a lot
of people were complaining,

42
00:01:45,757 --> 00:01:48,480
"Hey, I didn't get this
one specific experience

43
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,500
that I wanted,

44
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,480
or I didn't meet this one person

45
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,790
that I knew I was supposed
to meet if I came,

46
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:57,150
or I didn't get to hack
the car or whatever."

47
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,507
And other people would say,

48
00:01:58,507 --> 00:01:59,623
"No, well I got to do that.

49
00:01:59,623 --> 00:02:01,707
Why I didn't you get to do that?"

50
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:05,340
It quickly turned into
there's a million ways

51
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,020
to experience this conference

52
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,960
and unlike some other more
corporate conferences,

53
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:13,470
we don't have these pathways
totally defined for you.

54
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:15,360
It's not like you get on the track one,

55
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,370
shake the hand with the executive.

56
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:18,780
and get the sales briefing.

57
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,790
It's really up to you

58
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:23,160
and it can be very chaotic at sometimes

59
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,260
which causes some stress,

60
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,090
but it's also super rewarding

61
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:29,340
because it's like a
choose your own adventure.

62
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:33,930
We're in this unlimited massive
multiplayer universe here

63
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:36,450
and everybody has had to go through

64
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:38,940
what you are gonna go through this year,

65
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,860
trying to figure it out.

66
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,170
Some people's focus on the talks.

67
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:45,450
Some people sit down with their laptop.

68
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:47,700
Some people sit in Lock
Picking Village for half a day

69
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,650
and walk away with a new skill.

70
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:53,490
And so, don't feel that you missed out

71
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:54,540
'cause it's impossible.

72
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,550
Around DEF CON, I think three,

73
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:58,170
I started hearing stories of stuff

74
00:02:58,170 --> 00:02:59,320
that were happening at the CON

75
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,433
but I was throwing that I
didn't know was happening.

76
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:07,980
And then, I realized
this is bigger than me

77
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:11,550
and I have to be okay with
not knowing everything

78
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:13,140
that's going on.

79
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,880
That's kind of like...

80
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:17,280
If you have children,
that's kind of letting go.

81
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,750
Please tell me the stories.

82
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:22,770
Please send me the pictures of
her first steps or whatever,

83
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:23,625
because I'm not there.

84
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:26,730
I missed it but I'm still there,

85
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:28,867
and that's what you're
gonna hear at DEF CON a lot,

86
00:03:28,867 --> 00:03:29,700
"Oh my God,

87
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,198
did you see the cabanas flying
through the air last night

88
00:03:32,198 --> 00:03:33,630
when the storm hit?

89
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,480
Did you see the water raining
in on the roof last night?"

90
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:39,630
I guess what I'm getting at is

91
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:41,400
I want you to go make your own path

92
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,500
and I want you to not feel bad

93
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,660
if you didn't see everything.

94
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:48,660
So that's sort of the it
is what you make of it.

95
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,550
If you're very introverted,

96
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:53,580
maybe take an attempt to maybe extrovert,

97
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,800
but if you can't that's okay

98
00:03:55,800 --> 00:04:00,265
because probably a third of
DEF CON is super introverted.

99
00:04:00,265 --> 00:04:03,870
When we built the CON unintentionally,

100
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:05,010
I'll take credit for it

101
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:08,640
but really it's an unintentional action,

102
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,910
is we grew by word of mouth.

103
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:14,010
We don't have a marketing budget.

104
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:17,670
And so every year, based
on people's experiences,

105
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:21,600
they'd tell their friends
and it grew very organically.

106
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,600
And so, there's no attempt
to target a market audience

107
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:30,303
and get that market audience to attend.

108
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:36,300
It is what it is through
just organic word of mouth.

109
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:39,240
I think that's one of
our greatest strengths

110
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,340
because the people are here
generally want to be here.

111
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:44,580
We didn't mind trick them with
some Facebook targeted ads

112
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:45,483
or something,

113
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:49,030
and because that people
are pretty passionate

114
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,150
about what they're into

115
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:53,520
or what they want to try to get out of it.

116
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,650
So that's just kind of how we got there,

117
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:56,583
how we got here.

118
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:04,920
In the early days, and
even today, we never...

119
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,567
I come from the bulletin board days

120
00:05:06,567 --> 00:05:09,570
and USENET days after that,

121
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:11,378
and you never knew the gender

122
00:05:11,378 --> 00:05:13,350
of the person you were talking to.

123
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:14,850
You didn't know their age.

124
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:16,830
You didn't know where they were from.

125
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,120
You didn't know anything about them,

126
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:23,120
except what you saw in
their messages at 300 baud,

127
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:25,950
at 1200 baud, 2,400 baud.

128
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:28,380
And so, we would make your decisions on

129
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:31,230
if the person was an idiot or
not based on what they said

130
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,230
and that just carried forward.

131
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:36,780
We don't give a shit what you look like

132
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:39,750
or what you sound like or anything.

133
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:42,510
We are interested in what's in your brain.

134
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:46,530
You should be judged here on your ideas,

135
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:49,500
and your compassion, and how
you interact with other people

136
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,533
and not what kind of shoes you're wearing.

137
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:56,070
And so that might be important elsewhere,

138
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:58,919
but here you'll see these people in suits,

139
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:02,167
talking with these
teenagers with green hair

140
00:06:02,167 --> 00:06:03,690
and they're having a great time

141
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:05,490
and it's really kind
of a surreal experience

142
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,170
and it's awesome.

143
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:10,110
So please try to just suspend your eyes

144
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:13,443
and focus on your experience
when you talk to people.

145
00:06:14,571 --> 00:06:15,983
We have had,

146
00:06:15,983 --> 00:06:19,315
you'll hear some things
about Spot the Fed contest.

147
00:06:19,315 --> 00:06:23,340
We have had a rocky history
a little bit with the feds,

148
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,630
but it's always been tongue in cheek

149
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:29,583
and I'll tell you a brief story
about how that got started.

150
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,250
We were organizing,

151
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:37,250
DEF CON was the first not
invite-only hacking conference,

152
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,490
30 years ago.

153
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:40,890
Before, you had to know someone to get in,

154
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:43,050
to get the invite, to get on the list,

155
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:45,150
to show up the hacking thing

156
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:46,080
and I didn't like that

157
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,810
'cause I didn't get
invites to some of them.

158
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:51,390
It's like fuck that
I'm making my own show.

159
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:53,160
But when we made our own show, I was like,

160
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,230
well I don't want that experience
to happen to other people.

161
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:56,820
So we invited everybody

162
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,920
and it wasn't just
hackers or phone freakers,

163
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,440
we invited artists and
musicians and lawyers.

164
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,660
Basically in those days,

165
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:07,320
there was this whole
Renaissance sort of pre-wired.

166
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,730
The internet could be anything.

167
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:09,600
It could be art.

168
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,970
It could be this utopia.

169
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:14,070
And so, everybody was invited

170
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:15,660
and everybody was trying to figure it out.

171
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:18,150
And so, I had this
really eclectic early mix

172
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:21,180
and actually a friend I made
at the very first DEF CON

173
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,703
was a lawyer for Capitol Records.

174
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:27,240
That summer I was working as an intern

175
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,950
at Capitol Records in Hollywood

176
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:30,750
'cause of this connection I made.

177
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,873
And so it was a really nice blending,

178
00:07:36,819 --> 00:07:38,869
well I knew the feds were gonna be there.

179
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:43,170
Law enforcement in movies were
kind of promoting this image

180
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:45,180
of the hacker as this
mythical person that could fly

181
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:48,150
and walk through walls and hack computers.

182
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:53,150
I send a fax to the FBI
field office here and I say,

183
00:07:53,737 --> 00:07:55,780
"Hey, I'm Jeff Moss.

184
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:57,570
We're doing this hacking conference.

185
00:07:57,570 --> 00:07:59,043
You're invited."

186
00:07:59,043 --> 00:08:01,500
It just kind of goes into this black hole

187
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,030
and I sent them to the secret service

188
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:05,190
and I was trying to blanket everything

189
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:06,661
so nobody's surprised at the last minute

190
00:08:06,661 --> 00:08:09,600
if they hear that there's a
hacking conference in Vegas.

191
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,370
Well, the show's getting closer and closer

192
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:12,360
and I'm starting to get nervous.

193
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,187
And so, I call the field
office in Vegas and I say,

194
00:08:15,187 --> 00:08:17,760
"Hey Jeff Moss, I'm doing
this hacking conference."

195
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,593
They say,

196
00:08:18,593 --> 00:08:21,960
"Okay, let me transfer you to
the special agent in charge."

197
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,587
He answers the phone,

198
00:08:23,587 --> 00:08:25,737
"Special agent in charge,
blah, blah, blah."

199
00:08:25,737 --> 00:08:27,547
And I go into my spiel,

200
00:08:27,547 --> 00:08:29,310
"Hey, we're doing this hacking conference.

201
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:30,390
I'd love to have you there.

202
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:31,380
We're gonna have all these hackers.

203
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:33,630
We're gonna do this, it would be great."

204
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:36,270
There's this big, long
pregnant pause on the phone

205
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:39,780
like I can feel eyes lasering
me through the phone.

206
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:43,787
And he says, "We are
aware of your activities."

207
00:08:43,787 --> 00:08:47,131
(audience laughing)

208
00:08:47,131 --> 00:08:50,190
And I'm like, "Oh great, so you're coming?

209
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:52,968
So that sounds that's good right?"

210
00:08:52,968 --> 00:08:55,380
He laughs 'cause he knew
he was messing with me

211
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,870
and he's like, "No, no we're enforcement

212
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,700
and what you want is policy.

213
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,050
That's Washington, DC.

214
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:02,227
That's not a field office.

215
00:09:02,227 --> 00:09:03,837
You should talk to them."

216
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,390
Okay, no problem.

217
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:10,860
First DEF CON comes and
goes, shenanigans happen.

218
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:11,693
It's over.

219
00:09:11,693 --> 00:09:12,780
It's Sunday where cleaning up

220
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,970
and guy comes over to me

221
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:18,480
and he like shows me his badge.

222
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,430
He's like, "Hey, yeah good show."

223
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:22,779
I'm like, "You said, you were not coming."

224
00:09:22,779 --> 00:09:25,272
And he is like, "Well, you know."

225
00:09:25,272 --> 00:09:28,920
And it's like, "Okay, we can do this.

226
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,570
We're looking for you next year."

227
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:34,470
It turned into this sort
of cat and mouse game.

228
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:36,387
In the early days, if
they wore leather loafers,

229
00:09:36,387 --> 00:09:37,680
you knew they were feds.

230
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,750
Then they got sneakers on.

231
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:40,583
They got smarter.

232
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:42,840
The fanny packs with
the firearms disappeared

233
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,820
and they got better and better.

234
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,290
The long story short though

235
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:49,620
is that created this
kind of more accepting

236
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:50,940
interactive experience,

237
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:54,030
and that Spot the Fed game unintentionally

238
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:55,680
really paved the way I think

239
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,220
for no animosity between us.

240
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:04,020
Our communities kind of game
recognizes game a little bit.

241
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:08,160
And so, all these unplanned experience

242
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,320
have led us to this point,

243
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,653
this crazy blending of
different communities.

244
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,343
And so, when people think
that there is a master plan...

245
00:10:18,343 --> 00:10:21,270
No man, there's no master plan.

246
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:24,360
The master plan is community
and getting people together

247
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,841
and giving them as many pathways

248
00:10:25,841 --> 00:10:28,020
to make connections as possible.

249
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:29,053
When you have this many people,

250
00:10:29,053 --> 00:10:30,990
you'll notice this and
this is intentional.

251
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:33,265
When you get this many
people, a conference,

252
00:10:33,265 --> 00:10:37,260
it is impossible to not feel lost.

253
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,790
So what do we do?

254
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:40,260
We fork you off.

255
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,730
Interested in aviation?

256
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:42,600
You wanna go in aviation?

257
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,100
You wanna go ICS part of aviation.

258
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:44,933
You want to go...

259
00:10:44,933 --> 00:10:45,766
And next thing you know,

260
00:10:45,766 --> 00:10:47,130
you're sitting at a table
with 10 other people

261
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:49,170
with your interest and
you're talking to them

262
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:51,540
and now you don't have to
deal with a thousand people.

263
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,670
You just made 10 friends, right?

264
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:54,503
You're in the lock picking.

265
00:10:54,503 --> 00:10:55,710
You're in the high security lock picking.

266
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:57,210
You're in the thing.

267
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:58,830
Now you've got 10 people around you.

268
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:00,420
And so we are constantly thinking,

269
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:01,709
how do we split everybody off

270
00:11:01,709 --> 00:11:04,080
into smaller areas of interest

271
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,663
and then let you decide
where you wanna go.

272
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,910
So it does feel big,

273
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:11,640
but it's also conferences
inside the conference,

274
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,317
inside the conference.

275
00:11:13,317 --> 00:11:16,170
We're constantly trying to
figure out how to do that

276
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:18,420
and one of our famous strategies

277
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:20,640
is I give you a lot of rope.

278
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,307
If you want to run, say
the AI Village and you say,

279
00:11:24,307 --> 00:11:26,520
"I've got this idea for an AI Village."

280
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,650
It's like, "Okay convince me.

281
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:30,330
Okay, you get a space.

282
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:32,430
Let's see if you fuck it up.

283
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:35,250
If you don't, you get more space."

284
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:36,632
And so when you go in there

285
00:11:36,632 --> 00:11:37,680
and you see a really large village,

286
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,034
it's like they didn't
screw it up for years.

287
00:11:39,034 --> 00:11:42,510
(audience laughing)

288
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:43,590
If you see a small village,

289
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:45,990
a lot of times their first
timer or they're just starting.

290
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:46,890
They're trying to figure it out.

291
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:49,080
So your feedback to them
could be really valuable

292
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,640
because they're just trying to figure out

293
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,320
how do they find their
way in this community.

294
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,000
You'll see villages come and go.

295
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,430
It didn't work out, or the time was wrong,

296
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:57,863
or there's a lot of interest in blockchain

297
00:11:57,863 --> 00:11:59,550
and then the interest drops

298
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:03,093
and we repurpose the space
to try the next idea.

299
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,710
And so again, not a master plan really.

300
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:11,250
We are just trying to get
you all to talk and connect

301
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:15,420
and carry on that DEF CON
spirit throughout the year.

302
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:16,707
Because you'll find out that the friends

303
00:12:16,707 --> 00:12:18,480
and the relationships you make here,

304
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,790
you'll carry throughout
the rest of the year.

305
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:21,930
We do some virtual events.

306
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:22,830
We have a Discord.

307
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:24,120
We have forums,

308
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,643
but really man nothing beats
this in person feeling.

309
00:12:27,643 --> 00:12:30,003
So try to get the most out of that.

310
00:12:30,886 --> 00:12:35,886
One final thing is the
one thing we don't do

311
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:38,830
is we don't take sponsorships

312
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:41,543
and that's a conscious decision.

313
00:12:41,543 --> 00:12:42,840
There's probably a lot of money

314
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,270
we've been leaving over on
the table over the years.

315
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:48,030
But when we started the conference,

316
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:49,260
there were no sponsorships.

317
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:50,880
Nobody was doing this.

318
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,930
And so by the time money
arrived in the hacking scene

319
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:56,160
and sponsors arrived,

320
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,100
we'd already built ourselves
to be self-sufficient.

321
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,420
So we really didn't need it

322
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,523
and we didn't want to be influenced by it.

323
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,457
And so if sometimes you
look around you're like,

324
00:13:06,457 --> 00:13:08,520
"Man, they should just put
an extra video wall there.

325
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,600
They should do this extra thing."

326
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,433
It's like,

327
00:13:10,433 --> 00:13:12,930
"We could if we started
taking sponsorships

328
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:14,280
and generate a lot more revenue

329
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,927
but we don't want to."

330
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:19,590
That's a pretty intentional decision

331
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,180
because we like our freedom

332
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,950
and we like the ability to tell vendors

333
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:25,590
or people who might try to intimidate us

334
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:27,930
to not have a talk on
an access control system

335
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:29,730
or a voting system.

336
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:31,720
We like not being able to be pressured

337
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:33,930
through different vendors.

338
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:37,200
So that's also a little
bit of the CON history

339
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,460
that you might not,

340
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:39,480
might be in the back of your head

341
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:42,210
but that is a conscious decision.

342
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:46,770
Okay, so that's my opening
orientation remarks.

343
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:48,720
All I do the whole CON is I walk

344
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,800
and I just orbit and orbit

345
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,450
and that's all I do the whole time.

346
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:53,070
And so if you see me, say hi.

347
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:54,150
I'm happy to talk to you,

348
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:55,470
but if it looks like my hair's on fire

349
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:57,684
and I'm racing somewhere
just get outta my way.

350
00:13:57,684 --> 00:13:59,400
(audience laughing)

351
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,371
Please.

352
00:14:00,371 --> 00:14:02,790
(audience laughing)

353
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:03,930
Okay, so I'm gonna hand it off.

354
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:05,100
Where did Mel go?

355
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,060
Oh, there you are.

356
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:07,830
Okay, so I'm gonna
introduce you to Melanie

357
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:09,660
who's gonna introduce you to our panelists

358
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:10,493
and we're gonna go...

359
00:14:10,493 --> 00:14:12,060
They're gonna carry on the conversation

360
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:14,190
and it's gonna open up to the audience.

361
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:15,210
So great.

362
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:16,043
Thank you everyone.

363
00:14:16,043 --> 00:14:19,189
(audience applauding)

364
00:14:24,486 --> 00:14:25,319
- All right.

365
00:14:25,319 --> 00:14:26,490
Thanks Jeff.

366
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:29,040
A bit of course, correction.

367
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,600
I go by Wednesday.

368
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,433
- [Jeff] Wednesday.

369
00:14:31,433 --> 00:14:33,525
- For strangers, so. (laughs)

370
00:14:33,525 --> 00:14:35,040
- [Jeff] You're all strangers.

371
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,571
- And you're all strangers.

372
00:14:36,571 --> 00:14:38,879
Alright, so thank you so much everybody

373
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:41,730
for joining us today.

374
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:43,020
I'm really excited about the folks

375
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:44,910
that we've pulled together today.

376
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:46,590
They all have very different

377
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:50,034
and unique experiences with DEF CON.

378
00:14:50,034 --> 00:14:53,760
So I've asked them to share
a little bit of their story

379
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,980
and how they got involved in the community

380
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:58,410
to help all of you as you acclimate,

381
00:14:58,410 --> 00:14:59,378
and find your people,

382
00:14:59,378 --> 00:15:02,970
and find your little groups
within this very large group.

383
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:06,870
I am the type that I am very introverted

384
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:09,870
and I just pretend to be
an extrovert for a living.

385
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:12,270
So if you also feel that way,

386
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:13,620
there are plenty of corners,

387
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,270
plenty of wonderful people,

388
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:18,480
and we wanna help you find the folks

389
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,557
that you really gel with.

390
00:15:19,557 --> 00:15:21,900
If you are an extrovert,

391
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,430
I don't understand where you come from

392
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:25,330
but there's also a place for you here.

393
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,170
So that being said,

394
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:29,850
a little bit of background about myself.

395
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:33,690
As Jeff mentioned, I run
the press department,

396
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:36,120
the communication
strategy here at DEF CON.

397
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,795
I have been a goon for nine years.

398
00:15:38,795 --> 00:15:41,890
So I have seen a lot of the
changes that he talked about

399
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:45,980
and I actually started by volunteering

400
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:50,130
with what at the time
was called DEF CON Kids.

401
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:51,600
So we used to have a village

402
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,860
dedicated to our youngest hackers.

403
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:57,727
It eventually evolved into
something called Rootz Asylum.

404
00:15:57,727 --> 00:16:00,990
They have since retired as of this year,

405
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:03,440
but hopefully we will have
something taking its place

406
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,650
for next year.

407
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:07,320
So if that's something
that's interesting to you,

408
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,153
let me know

409
00:16:08,153 --> 00:16:10,320
because we are trying to
pull something new together.

410
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,460
But that's how I got started,

411
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:14,040
it was just volunteering
with one of these villages

412
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:17,460
and over time there was more needs

413
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:20,610
and more things that the
team needed help with.

414
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:25,260
Eventually, I hope nobody
actually holds me responsible

415
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:27,153
for the consciousness of DEF CON,

416
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,260
but it is part of my professional training

417
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:34,080
to help organizations be a
little bit more empathetic

418
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,748
and more inclusive.

419
00:16:35,748 --> 00:16:37,940
So with that being said,

420
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:41,107
I wanna introduce our amazing panelists

421
00:16:41,107 --> 00:16:44,070
that we've brought together today.

422
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:47,167
I'm gonna ask each of you
to introduce yourselves.

423
00:16:47,167 --> 00:16:49,175
Let us know what you want to be called.

424
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:51,047
I know all of you by different names

425
00:16:51,047 --> 00:16:52,470
and I wanna be respectful

426
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:54,660
of what you want to be
called by this group.

427
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,685
So let us know what you want to be called.

428
00:16:56,685 --> 00:17:00,335
Let us know how you got
introduced into DEF CON

429
00:17:00,335 --> 00:17:04,848
and give us one tip of a do or don't

430
00:17:04,848 --> 00:17:06,780
that you would share with a newcomer

431
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:09,030
who's here for the first time.

432
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:10,713
So let's start with you.

433
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:14,610
- My name is Tennisha Donna Hill.

434
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:16,113
I prefer to be called T.

435
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:22,223
I got introduced into DEF
CON through BlackGirlsHack.

436
00:17:23,183 --> 00:17:24,875
This is our first year here.

437
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:28,290
We have a village called
Girls Hack village.

438
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:29,123
So, yeah.

439
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:31,994
- Do you have a tip for the newcomers

440
00:17:31,994 --> 00:17:33,900
on something that you
would recommend they do

441
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:34,750
or they don't do?

442
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:38,100
- Plan for the things that you can't plan.

443
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:42,033
Just keep thinking about all
the what ifs and keep planning.

444
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:46,380
- Hello, my name is Shannon Morris.

445
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:48,312
I go by Snubs on the internet.

446
00:17:48,312 --> 00:17:50,700
My pronouns are she and her

447
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,733
and I got introduced to DEF CON back in,

448
00:17:52,733 --> 00:17:56,640
I wanna say like 2009
through a YouTube podcast

449
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,100
I do called HAK Five, H-A-K Five.

450
00:17:59,100 --> 00:17:59,933
You can Google it.

451
00:17:59,933 --> 00:18:00,900
It's really good.

452
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,040
Definitely subscribe.

453
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,663
Like and subscribe, thanks.

454
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:07,800
I guess my main thing would be,

455
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,633
please dear God wear deodorant.

456
00:18:10,633 --> 00:18:13,126
(audience laughing)

457
00:18:13,126 --> 00:18:16,293
(panelist applauding)

458
00:18:17,196 --> 00:18:18,990
- Is this on?

459
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:20,340
Applause out the gate.

460
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,900
Hello, my name is Steven.

461
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:25,617
I go by @AsifoSays on social stuff there.

462
00:18:25,617 --> 00:18:29,190
I was introduced to Jeff by
some individuals on my team

463
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:30,210
who had been before,

464
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:32,070
and then we were having
a recruiting event.

465
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:35,070
So I came and I was
like, "Oh, this is cool."

466
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:38,310
One piece of advice that I
would say or I guess to do

467
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:41,460
is whatever remotely
interests you go check it out

468
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:42,960
especially if it's your first time.

469
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,520
There might be something
that you weren't expecting.

470
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,440
And it's like, "Hey, this
is actually pretty cool."

471
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,240
For me was the social
engineering community

472
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,417
where they were calling I was like,

473
00:18:49,417 --> 00:18:50,727
"That's pretty cool."

474
00:18:54,317 --> 00:18:58,260
- My name is Michael also known as Sparky.

475
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,640
It's he/him.

476
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,991
I started DEF CON 8.

477
00:19:01,991 --> 00:19:06,090
DEF CON 10, I was brought into the knock

478
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:09,993
and 20 years later I'm sitting on stage.

479
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:17,430
I guess the one tip I
have is look to your left,

480
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:18,690
look to your right,

481
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:21,030
these are your people

482
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:23,220
and take a chance

483
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,570
and talk to them.

484
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:28,050
You might not kick off a
conversation with them,

485
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:29,910
but the reality is you might

486
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:31,830
and from there you might end up

487
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:34,590
in a half dozen other conversations

488
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:38,310
and it is the three days outta the year

489
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:40,763
where you're gonna have
an opportunity to do that.

490
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:43,350
Don't miss out on that chance.

491
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:45,746
- Awesome, thank you.

492
00:19:45,746 --> 00:19:48,630
I wanna add my own tip

493
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:51,390
which I'm also sharing
on behalf of DEF CON.

494
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:54,510
Do not fuck with the hotel or the casinos.

495
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:56,100
I'm being serious.

496
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:56,933
- Yep.

497
00:19:56,933 --> 00:19:58,650
- It is very difficult to find a venue

498
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:00,480
that will put up with our shenanigans.

499
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,063
Please don't make it harder for us

500
00:20:02,063 --> 00:20:05,760
to host DEF CON in future years.

501
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,593
Okay?

502
00:20:06,593 --> 00:20:10,410
Do not fuck with our hotels or the casinos

503
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:11,580
that have opened their doors

504
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:14,610
to let our community
come in and be together.

505
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:16,683
So that's my tip.

506
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,253
So one of the things,

507
00:20:19,253 --> 00:20:21,355
and Jeff touched on this a bit as well,

508
00:20:21,355 --> 00:20:23,563
but one of the things that
I think is so important

509
00:20:23,563 --> 00:20:25,553
and is different about DEF CON

510
00:20:25,553 --> 00:20:28,440
compared to what we might consider

511
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:31,351
to be a professional info sec conference.

512
00:20:31,351 --> 00:20:33,663
There's an example down the road.

513
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:38,767
It's that DEF CON isn't
just a transaction of,

514
00:20:38,767 --> 00:20:40,886
"Hey, we went to this
conference and did this thing."

515
00:20:40,886 --> 00:20:44,670
But DEF CON really is a
community above and beyond

516
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:48,180
what is gonna happen over the
next three days this week.

517
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:51,930
And so, I wanna ask our panelists here

518
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:55,635
to talk a little bit about
what did you do to engage

519
00:20:55,635 --> 00:20:59,280
in the community outside of the three days

520
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,455
that we have together every year?

521
00:21:01,455 --> 00:21:04,740
What is some advice that you
would share with everybody

522
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:07,440
in terms of how to make DEF CON

523
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,723
more than just a transactional event?

524
00:21:18,509 --> 00:21:19,830
- That's a really good question.

525
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:20,663
- I don't think her mic is on.

526
00:21:20,663 --> 00:21:22,953
- Is her mic on?
- Yeah, her mic.

527
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:28,620
- Sorry, can we have somebody
else while we try to...

528
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:31,169
- No, alright.

529
00:21:31,169 --> 00:21:32,250
- We'll get back.

530
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:33,083
Is it on now?

531
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,860
- Yes.
- Okay.

532
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,420
- That's a really good question.

533
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,373
Thanks for making me first.

534
00:21:37,373 --> 00:21:40,650
(Melanie and Michael laughing)

535
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:41,973
Connecting with people,

536
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:45,540
join organization,

537
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:48,630
for me personally, I'll
speak from my experience.

538
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:49,837
I joined BlackGirlsHack.

539
00:21:49,837 --> 00:21:52,533
I'm the director of policy over there.

540
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,070
It was easy for me to connect and grow,

541
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:58,740
even though we all live across the country

542
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:01,030
with people in the cyberspace

543
00:22:02,245 --> 00:22:04,740
and that develops relationships

544
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:07,650
where some of these
people are not my friends.

545
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:08,483
I can call on them.

546
00:22:08,483 --> 00:22:09,316
I have mentors.

547
00:22:09,316 --> 00:22:12,600
I have different people, if
something happens at work,

548
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,470
I can lean on.

549
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:16,350
So for me, it's continuous,

550
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:20,943
continually connecting and
share with other people.

551
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:27,180
- The first year I came here
to DEF CON was back in 2009

552
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,830
and it was overwhelming

553
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:31,380
and I'll be very transparent with you.

554
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:33,840
I have crazy imposter syndrome

555
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,689
and being around so many smart people

556
00:22:35,689 --> 00:22:40,530
made me feel like I didn't
know enough to be here.

557
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:43,140
So when I came home from DEF CON

558
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:46,030
and I started doing shows on YouTube,

559
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:48,270
I decided to really delve into things

560
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:50,073
and start educating myself.

561
00:22:50,073 --> 00:22:53,400
The way that I tried to
become a part of the community

562
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:56,040
was by introducing tutorials on things

563
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,720
that I was truly, really interested in.

564
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:01,323
I like Wireshark series
and stuff like that.

565
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:05,280
By learning those things myself

566
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,950
and by delving into it like a noob

567
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:10,477
and completely just telling people,

568
00:23:10,477 --> 00:23:12,840
"Hey, I'm a noob too. It's okay.

569
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:15,480
It's okay to learn all these
things and educate yourself.

570
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,950
That's totally fine."

571
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:19,020
I learned coming back the next year

572
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:21,116
that everybody else is more than happy

573
00:23:21,116 --> 00:23:22,980
to share their knowledge

574
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,300
and that was the biggest thing

575
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:26,623
that I brought home from DEF CON,

576
00:23:26,623 --> 00:23:28,136
after going a couple of years,

577
00:23:28,136 --> 00:23:32,220
was that people are more than willing

578
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:35,850
and more than happy to
teach you new concepts,

579
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:38,970
teach you new techniques
about information security,

580
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:43,080
and privacy, hacking in general.

581
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,480
There's so much more that you can learn

582
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:48,870
when you are willing to
get yourself out there

583
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:51,990
and kind of combat your
own imposter syndrome

584
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:52,897
and just tell people,

585
00:23:52,897 --> 00:23:55,560
"Hey, I don't know how this works.

586
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:58,437
Can you tell me like I'm five years old?"

587
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:00,630
By doing that,

588
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:03,780
I really, really felt like
a part of this community.

589
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:05,160
And through the years,

590
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,973
it's become strong and
stronger to the point

591
00:24:07,973 --> 00:24:12,240
where I came back this year
after being gone for two years.

592
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,280
I got ambushed by a few
friends in the hallway

593
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,990
and I started bawling my eyes out

594
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:17,790
'cause I was so happy to see them.

595
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:21,180
It truly it does turn into a family

596
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:23,610
once you find your people here.

597
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:26,430
I think it really just takes
getting outta your shell

598
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:29,133
and just being willing to talk to people.

599
00:24:31,226 --> 00:24:33,168
- For me, this is my second DEF CON.

600
00:24:33,168 --> 00:24:36,420
The first one I went to was
like right before the pandemic.

601
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:37,253
When the first one,

602
00:24:37,253 --> 00:24:39,110
I probably just knew people on my team

603
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:41,520
or I'd worked with directly before.

604
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,480
Since then,

605
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,550
the way that I've probably
had the most interaction

606
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:47,280
with people in this community
is at my local conferences

607
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,050
or just other conferences that I travel to

608
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:50,070
'cause I imagine you guys

609
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:52,260
probably go to other conferences there.

610
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:55,826
And then, also people that
have funny memes on Twitter.

611
00:24:55,826 --> 00:24:57,783
That's my tribe.

612
00:24:59,576 --> 00:25:00,991
And so now when I come back around here,

613
00:25:00,991 --> 00:25:02,310
I might bump it to people

614
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:03,457
or maybe just through Twitter and say,

615
00:25:03,457 --> 00:25:04,950
"Hey, are you gonna be around?"

616
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:06,960
And then, just catching
up with people that way

617
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,220
and that's helped me a lot.

618
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:10,270
I feel like I know a lot more people now.

619
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:17,700
- So for me, when I
started coming to DEF CON,

620
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:19,800
I was actually the station manager

621
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:24,063
for the world's largest
online punk rock station.

622
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:28,320
I had bought a computer a year before that

623
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,945
and I was like computers got that.

624
00:25:31,945 --> 00:25:34,590
And so, I showed up at DEF CON

625
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:38,220
and I totally rocked
the imposter syndrome,

626
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:39,420
sat down at the table,

627
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:42,310
and had my head completely blown

628
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:44,945
to the point where it
was a little panicky too

629
00:25:44,945 --> 00:25:45,778
'cause you're like,

630
00:25:45,778 --> 00:25:48,207
"Oh shit, I'm way out of my element."

631
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,333
After that,

632
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:54,240
I attempted to try to get a press pass

633
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:58,290
and was roadblocked year after year.

634
00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:00,588
So I eventually found another methodology.

635
00:26:00,588 --> 00:26:01,721
- Not by me, not by me.

636
00:26:01,721 --> 00:26:03,586
(Michael laughing)

637
00:26:03,586 --> 00:26:06,270
- No, no, not by Mel.

638
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:08,970
But yeah, I found a
different way of doing it.

639
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:12,348
I made friends and started
talking with those people

640
00:26:12,348 --> 00:26:15,810
and handed out cheesy business cards

641
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:18,616
and an unfortunate event happened

642
00:26:18,616 --> 00:26:21,870
and they needed somebody to step in

643
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:23,403
and help out with DCT.

644
00:26:25,126 --> 00:26:27,120
I was sitting at the Alexis Park

645
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,187
and my two coworkers walk
past me and I'm like,

646
00:26:30,187 --> 00:26:31,830
"What are you guys doing here?"

647
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:32,663
And they're like,

648
00:26:32,663 --> 00:26:35,817
"Oh, somebody reached out to
us and asked us to set up DCT.

649
00:26:35,817 --> 00:26:36,650
And I was like,

650
00:26:37,657 --> 00:26:39,660
"Seriously, I handle the business cards

651
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:41,337
and they get the goon badge."

652
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:47,450
So I made a stink and invited
myself into their team

653
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,430
and next thing you know I was hanging APs

654
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:52,890
and the rest is kind of a history.

655
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:56,250
For me at home, I don't
longer live in a large city.

656
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:58,020
I live in a small town.

657
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:00,780
I live in a small town
that has been transitioning

658
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:03,570
from being in mill town
or an industrial town

659
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:08,193
into being a new or
trying to reinvent itself.

660
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:10,413
This small town,

661
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:14,580
they don't embrace technology.

662
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:18,420
It is very hands off for them,

663
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:19,860
but I'm opening a Makerspace

664
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:23,940
and I'm getting the
community to try to learn

665
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:25,295
about the maker community.

666
00:27:25,295 --> 00:27:28,380
From there, start to bridge that gap

667
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:30,090
and start to introduce technology

668
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:33,120
and start to introduce
a new mindset to them.

669
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:37,173
So that's the part I try to
give back to the community.

670
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:38,933
- Awesome.

671
00:27:38,933 --> 00:27:42,180
I loved all those ideas and
I love all your stories.

672
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:44,067
The other thing that I will add is that

673
00:27:44,067 --> 00:27:46,470
if you aren't really sure where to start

674
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:49,650
and you haven't quite found
your group of folks yet,

675
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:53,100
there is an organization
called the Lonely Hacker Club.

676
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,396
So if you wanna look them
up and connect with them,

677
00:27:55,396 --> 00:27:58,590
they do a really good
job of helping people

678
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:01,170
like matching them with
folks who share interests

679
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:05,040
in helping you locate certain
corners within DEF CON

680
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,440
and within the community
where you can meet new folks.

681
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,642
So that's a good resource

682
00:28:08,642 --> 00:28:12,063
if you're looking for
some additional support.

683
00:28:12,063 --> 00:28:13,350
So that being said,

684
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:16,170
I wanna give folks time to ask questions

685
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:17,430
so you can pick the brains

686
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:19,444
of these really smart people up here.

687
00:28:19,444 --> 00:28:22,620
We do have roaming mics.

688
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:24,840
So if you have a question
that you'd like to ask,

689
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,010
just raise your hand

690
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:30,213
and the goons will be
bringing the mic to you.

691
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,033
- Yes.

692
00:28:35,033 --> 00:28:36,860
- I'm just gonna say
this to start off with.

693
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:41,670
My expertise is an
administrative and operational.

694
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:44,070
So if you're gonna ask me
a question about the knock

695
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:45,423
and where the pixies go,

696
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,140
I'll do my best

697
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:51,540
but most likely I'll just
give you my Twitter handle

698
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:53,290
and I will get you an answer later.

699
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:56,403
- I see a hand back there.

700
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:58,530
- Raise your hand really high

701
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:00,030
so we can see if you have a question.

702
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:00,863
- I see one there.

703
00:29:00,863 --> 00:29:01,870
- We can get a mic to you.

704
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:04,170
- Where are the mics?

705
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:05,289
- Oh, make 'em run.

706
00:29:05,289 --> 00:29:06,534
Make him run.

707
00:29:06,534 --> 00:29:08,130
- I see a mic person running.

708
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:09,006
- There you go.

709
00:29:09,006 --> 00:29:10,673
- Run, run Sir. Run.

710
00:29:11,803 --> 00:29:13,470
- [Attendee 1] Thank you.
- Yes.

711
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:14,303
- Hi.

712
00:29:14,303 --> 00:29:15,136
Oh, wow.

713
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:17,190
I appreciate you,

714
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:19,020
I appreciate you asking everyone

715
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:21,900
not to fuck with the
casinos and the hotels.

716
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:23,370
How about each other?

717
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:26,002
The reputation is that,

718
00:29:26,002 --> 00:29:30,210
you enter a DEF CON wifi and it's toxic

719
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:32,634
and why is that okay if that's true?

720
00:29:32,634 --> 00:29:35,493
And if it's not true, please dispel.

721
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:39,090
- I just wanna make sure
I understood the question.

722
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:41,270
So tell me if I'm getting this wrong.

723
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:43,500
The question is why is there not a rule

724
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,300
about not fucking with each other

725
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:47,520
in terms of the wifi network

726
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,040
and everyone's connected devices?

727
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,065
Did I get it?

728
00:29:51,065 --> 00:29:52,140
Okay.

729
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:53,643
It's a very good question.

730
00:29:54,553 --> 00:29:58,532
I don't have a 100%
definitive answer for you,

731
00:29:58,532 --> 00:30:02,090
but I'm gonna tell you the way
that we're thinking about it

732
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:05,160
is this is a hacker conference.

733
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:08,010
We expect people to hack on things.

734
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:09,549
We're also very mindful of the fact

735
00:30:09,549 --> 00:30:13,410
that members of our community fall along

736
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:16,140
a very long moral spectrum

737
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:19,350
in terms of what is
considered ethical hacking

738
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:23,070
and what is kind of everybody's comfort

739
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:24,602
and boundary with that.

740
00:30:24,602 --> 00:30:27,010
We have to be realistic about that

741
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:31,350
because we have anonymous attendance.

742
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:33,840
I don't actually know who is in this room.

743
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:34,673
That's on purpose.

744
00:30:34,673 --> 00:30:37,110
We don't want governments
and other agencies

745
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:40,890
to be able to come and get
it an attendee list from us.

746
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:42,750
So there is a little bit,

747
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:45,150
I think of self-awareness

748
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:46,770
of what kind of environment we're in

749
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:49,931
from a security perspective
while we're here.

750
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:53,700
And so, we do try to provide advice

751
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:56,310
on how to protect yourself,
how to protect your networks.

752
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:59,884
We advise you don't bring
your corporate devices here.

753
00:30:59,884 --> 00:31:02,340
But at the same time

754
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:06,030
I wanna also acknowledge
the fact that in 2022,

755
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:10,350
if you don't feel safe using technology

756
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:11,310
within the DEF CON space,

757
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:13,410
I think we also need to be talking about

758
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:16,210
how safe our normal everyday networks are.

759
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:20,760
So there's a lot of advice
about don't bring smartphones,

760
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,938
don't use wifi, don't use all of this,

761
00:31:22,938 --> 00:31:24,720
when you come to DEF CON

762
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,480
and people are putting all
their devices in fair days.

763
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,952
If you are a high risk
high target individual

764
00:31:29,952 --> 00:31:33,480
where you know nation
states are targeting you,

765
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:37,230
I think that's all applicable advice.

766
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:39,420
But for most of us,

767
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:41,880
the types of things that
I do to protect myself

768
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:45,030
when I'm in DEF CON are the
things I do every single day

769
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:48,633
because those threats exist
even when the hackers go home.

770
00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:53,118
So I don't know if that's a
satisfactory answer for you,

771
00:31:53,118 --> 00:31:54,330
but that's at least the way

772
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:57,120
that we've been thinking
about it in terms of DEF CON.

773
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:00,450
We hope that everybody is
respectful of each other,

774
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:01,878
but this is also a hacker conference

775
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:04,710
and we want people to be able to learn

776
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:06,116
and develop new skills

777
00:32:06,116 --> 00:32:07,785
and to be able to find vulnerability

778
00:32:07,785 --> 00:32:10,205
so that they can ultimately be fixed

779
00:32:10,205 --> 00:32:12,593
but we can't enforce that
that's what people do

780
00:32:12,593 --> 00:32:16,056
with the knowledge that they gain.

781
00:32:16,056 --> 00:32:20,217
- I don't know if I could
add a little bit extra.

782
00:32:20,217 --> 00:32:25,217
Mel is a hundred percent
correct, but we do offer...

783
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:28,590
So we have DEF CON Open.

784
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:31,857
It is the wild west and a great experience

785
00:32:31,857 --> 00:32:33,783
if you have not tried it yet.

786
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:36,780
And then, we have DEF CON,

787
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:39,370
which you formally known as DEF CON Secure

788
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,842
and there's tons of information available

789
00:32:42,842 --> 00:32:46,522
at wifiregdefcon.org.

790
00:32:46,522 --> 00:32:51,187
I definitely recommend you visit there.

791
00:32:51,187 --> 00:32:54,543
And then, the question
about the casino floor.

792
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:56,423
Yeah.

793
00:32:56,423 --> 00:32:59,108
I mean part of my French
but don't shit in the pool.

794
00:32:59,108 --> 00:33:00,830
It is...

795
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:03,750
They don't mess around.

796
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:04,650
That's a crime.

797
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:09,650
It is a crime to attack a
company, a person, anything right?

798
00:33:11,991 --> 00:33:16,991
They don't look at it as
you being experimenting

799
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:22,080
or there is no three day
free pass in Las Vegas.

800
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:25,140
You step outta line and they will respond

801
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:26,190
with their full force

802
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:28,980
and they brought extra
force for this weekend.

803
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:30,200
So yeah...

804
00:33:32,875 --> 00:33:36,210
You got a sandbox, go build castles,

805
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:38,070
tear down castles.

806
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:39,870
Do it in this environment.

807
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:41,370
Everybody's gonna leave happy.

808
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:45,360
- You are the best bad cop to my good cop.

809
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,660
Thank you for adding that.

810
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:50,490
Any other questions
from the audience? Yep.

811
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:51,323
- [Attendee 2] Hey.

812
00:33:51,323 --> 00:33:53,820
So most conferences I go to,

813
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:57,300
I leave with a bag full of stuff.

814
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:59,610
Come here, everyone tells
me I'm at the wrong place.

815
00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:01,110
So I'm just wondering,

816
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:04,503
is there a place to get
free swag anywhere here?

817
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,230
- Yes.
- Yeah.

818
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:08,630
- Snub should take that one.

819
00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:11,790
- Oh my gosh.

820
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:14,370
Go to the sticker swap.

821
00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:16,533
You can get so many stickers.

822
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:19,601
I have a friend who literally throws

823
00:34:19,601 --> 00:34:22,710
little rubber ducks at people,

824
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:24,543
over and over again.

825
00:34:25,410 --> 00:34:26,352
I had a friend last night

826
00:34:26,352 --> 00:34:29,266
that gave me a little action
figure for his company.

827
00:34:29,266 --> 00:34:32,100
You can find stuff all over the place.

828
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,330
People are handing out swag.

829
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:34,610
- [Attendee 2] Would you
introduce me to your friend

830
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:35,962
'cause I like action figures?

831
00:34:35,962 --> 00:34:37,280
- I mean like...

832
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:40,173
Okay Carl, we can go find 'em.

833
00:34:42,482 --> 00:34:43,622
Full disclosure,

834
00:34:43,622 --> 00:34:46,200
I am volunteering at the HAK Five booth.

835
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,940
But straight up with a purchase,

836
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:49,530
we're giving out free battery packs.

837
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:50,970
You can find stuff all over the place.

838
00:34:50,970 --> 00:34:52,620
So yeah, definitely.

839
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:54,180
Go to the sticker swap,
I'm gonna be there.

840
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:55,580
I'll give you some stickers.

841
00:34:56,730 --> 00:34:59,580
- We're having a networking event tonight.

842
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:01,050
If you come to our networking event,

843
00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:02,650
you will have swag bags for you.

844
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,393
- [Attendee 2] Oh damn,
I know where I'm going.

845
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:09,180
- Is that at the Girls Hack Village?

846
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:10,170
- Girls Hack Village

847
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:15,170
and in the Flamingo, Virginia City III.

848
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:17,220
Sorry, it's very long.

849
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:18,180
So you guys come there.

850
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:22,290
We're also having a
nineties party tomorrow

851
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:23,700
here in the Caesars Forum.

852
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:26,310
So, everyone is welcome.

853
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:27,450
So we'll have swag.

854
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:28,710
So just come visit us,

855
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:30,438
a small little promo.

856
00:35:30,438 --> 00:35:31,290
- Awesome.

857
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:33,720
But the reason you won't
get a DEF CON swag bag

858
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,142
when you register is, as Jeff mentioned,

859
00:35:35,142 --> 00:35:37,260
we don't have corporate sponsors.

860
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:41,340
And so, that swag is either
gonna come from the vendors

861
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:44,161
who are sponsoring individual villages

862
00:35:44,161 --> 00:35:47,430
or from attendees who
are being very generous

863
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:49,680
in sharing things with the community.

864
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,060
I think one thing to note

865
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:53,850
that I think a lot of first
time attendees may not know

866
00:35:53,850 --> 00:35:56,400
is that DEF CON operates a little bit

867
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:00,207
like a platform where we provide the space

868
00:36:00,207 --> 00:36:03,030
for people to create villages,

869
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:06,355
but the villages run their
own content and programming

870
00:36:06,355 --> 00:36:09,150
which means that they may have sponsors

871
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:10,987
but that sponsor only sponsors that room

872
00:36:10,987 --> 00:36:14,670
and their relationship is with
the village not with DEF CON.

873
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:19,259
So you may find swag at
different parts of conference

874
00:36:19,259 --> 00:36:20,910
and parts of DEF CON,

875
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:23,640
but we don't have just one
single DEF CON swag bag

876
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:26,343
because DEF CON does not
accept corporate sponsors.

877
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:29,723
- Yeah, we'll clap that.

878
00:36:29,723 --> 00:36:30,556
That is good.

879
00:36:30,556 --> 00:36:31,389
That's a good thing.

880
00:36:31,389 --> 00:36:33,753
(audience applauding)

881
00:36:33,753 --> 00:36:35,606
- Great explanation.

882
00:36:35,606 --> 00:36:37,506
- I think we had a question over here.

883
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:39,930
- [Attendee 3] Sorry if I stutter,

884
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:43,050
but how would someone go
about getting into hacking?

885
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:45,990
This is coming from knowledge
on basic networking and stuff,

886
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:49,200
but how would someone
teenager or hell even adult

887
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,720
go into hacking at all?

888
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,790
- You gotta Makerspace in your community?

889
00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:56,160
Sorry I'm like shameless
plug for Makerspace but yeah,

890
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,390
you got a Makerspace in your community?

891
00:36:57,390 --> 00:36:59,223
You gotta hacker space?

892
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:02,760
That's a great place to start

893
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,890
because you're gonna get
direct feedback from people

894
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:07,200
and people will engage with you.

895
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,038
- There are also local DEF CON groups

896
00:37:10,038 --> 00:37:12,720
and a lot of cities all over the world.

897
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,390
So that would be my first
place where I would start

898
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:17,880
was I would look up online

899
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:21,213
whether or not there was a
DEF CON group in my city.

900
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:24,180
If not, then I would
look at a hacker space.

901
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:27,570
There are a lot of even
just hacker collectives

902
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:29,443
that exist in a lot of cities.

903
00:37:29,443 --> 00:37:31,176
So at least from my experience,

904
00:37:31,176 --> 00:37:32,718
having somebody in my town

905
00:37:32,718 --> 00:37:35,790
that I can meet with in meet space

906
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:38,270
is where I would start and
what I would recommend.

907
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:43,270
But even for kids, there's a
lot of free resources online.

908
00:37:43,438 --> 00:37:47,310
Just be really, again as
Sparky was saying earlier,

909
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:50,430
be really careful about the environments

910
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:51,690
that we're teaching people in

911
00:37:51,690 --> 00:37:53,586
because we don't wanna see kids

912
00:37:53,586 --> 00:37:55,900
accidentally end up in legal trouble

913
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:59,310
because they unknowingly crossed a line.

914
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:00,733
So look for those resources online

915
00:38:00,733 --> 00:38:03,107
that are giving you a safe environment

916
00:38:03,107 --> 00:38:07,502
rather than having the kids
just hack all over the internet

917
00:38:07,502 --> 00:38:09,334
'cause we need those skills.

918
00:38:09,334 --> 00:38:10,800
We need that talent.

919
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:14,793
We don't wanna lose them
to the legal process.

920
00:38:15,838 --> 00:38:16,922
- There's one back there.

921
00:38:16,922 --> 00:38:18,622
- I think the goon has a question.

922
00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:22,500
- After this one, we
have time for one more,

923
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,542
so the one in the back
will be the last one.

924
00:38:24,542 --> 00:38:25,375
- [Attendee 4] Yes,

925
00:38:25,375 --> 00:38:27,660
so mainly I'm a backend software engineer.

926
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:29,370
I mainly write APIs and ghosts.

927
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:30,750
So I'm not exactly a hacker,

928
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:32,910
but what would be a
suggestion that you give to me

929
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:36,510
to gain some expertise
from the great people here

930
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:38,070
so that what it is I write

931
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:40,530
is not riddled with vulnerabilities?

932
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:43,260
Any particular places I should go?

933
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:45,630
- I just wanna note that
we found the unicorn,

934
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:48,446
a developer who doesn't
wanna write insecure code.

935
00:38:48,446 --> 00:38:50,907
(audience applauding and cheering)

936
00:38:50,907 --> 00:38:51,740
- There you go.

937
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,493
- Any advice from our panelists?

938
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:02,093
- There's definitely,

939
00:39:02,093 --> 00:39:02,926
probably some interesting stuff

940
00:39:02,926 --> 00:39:04,020
for you in Blue Team Village.

941
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:05,850
I don't know what it is you work in.

942
00:39:05,850 --> 00:39:08,190
There's also the Cloud Village as well

943
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:10,590
which could have some
interesting stuff for you.

944
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:16,500
- I'll be speaking at the Blue
Team Village this afternoon,

945
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:17,333
so come.

946
00:39:21,090 --> 00:39:23,297
We have different things going on

947
00:39:23,297 --> 00:39:24,407
in our village as well too

948
00:39:24,407 --> 00:39:26,250
so you can come there as well.

949
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:27,840
You are welcome.

950
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:31,080
- The other place I'll
recommend is the AppSec Village.

951
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,240
So they do a lot of
stuff around pen testing,

952
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:36,180
software quality testing and all of that.

953
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:37,260
So that's another good place

954
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:40,387
to meet other software developers
who care about security.

955
00:39:40,387 --> 00:39:43,263
- I'll probably definitely
plus one the AppSec Village.

956
00:39:44,253 --> 00:39:47,435
You're already two
thirds of the way there.

957
00:39:47,435 --> 00:39:50,543
I mean the fact that you
will stand up publicly

958
00:39:50,543 --> 00:39:53,490
and say that you do not
want to write insecure code

959
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:56,970
is the right step forward.

960
00:39:56,970 --> 00:39:58,890
I can't tell you how
many dev meetings I'm in,

961
00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:01,607
where they're like, "Nah, we'll
take care of it afterwards."

962
00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:04,470
- Nope.

963
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:06,330
- All right, last one in the back.

964
00:40:06,330 --> 00:40:07,170
- [Attendee 4] Yes.

965
00:40:07,170 --> 00:40:10,950
I'm here attending the
conference with my wife.

966
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:14,492
My wife is not here for DEF CON though.

967
00:40:14,492 --> 00:40:16,347
I only have the pass for me.

968
00:40:16,347 --> 00:40:18,600
Are there any events or meetups

969
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:21,400
or anything of that nature
where we can attend together?

970
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:24,510
- That is a good question

971
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:26,793
that I truthfully don't
know the answer to,

972
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:31,320
but if you will come find me after this

973
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:34,170
and we can exchange contact
info so I can find out

974
00:40:34,170 --> 00:40:35,003
and I'll let you know.

975
00:40:35,003 --> 00:40:38,970
I'll also have the DEF CON
Twitter handle tweet out

976
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:39,990
whatever I find out.

977
00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:43,080
So if other folks are
interested in that information,

978
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:46,230
watch the DEF CON Twitter
handle and we'll get that out.

979
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:49,473
But that is a great question,
thank you for asking that.

980
00:40:49,473 --> 00:40:51,903
- That actually brings up a great message

981
00:40:51,903 --> 00:40:54,240
that I would love to share.

982
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,830
One year I brought my husband,

983
00:40:55,830 --> 00:40:59,888
I got him a badge and he
loved it and he's in HR.

984
00:40:59,888 --> 00:41:03,780
He's not a hacker, but he loved it.

985
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:05,250
He went in the Lock Picking Village

986
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:06,600
and he sat down for an hour

987
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,437
and he came out and he was just like,

988
00:41:08,437 --> 00:41:09,840
"I know how to pick locks."

989
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,010
I was so proud of him.

990
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:11,880
I was so proud.

991
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:12,713
And then I was like,

992
00:41:12,713 --> 00:41:14,490
"Don't tell your boss 'cause you're HR.

993
00:41:14,490 --> 00:41:17,000
You probably shouldn't
know how to do that."

994
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:21,060
Bring people who are not
hackers to the convention

995
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:22,980
and share the wealth of knowledge

996
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:25,860
because oftentimes you can find a village

997
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:27,750
that they will absolutely love.

998
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:28,890
- Oh yeah.
- Yeah.

999
00:41:28,890 --> 00:41:29,979
For sure,

1000
00:41:29,979 --> 00:41:34,200
I brought my wife once to DEF CON

1001
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:37,530
and nine months later my son was born.

1002
00:41:37,530 --> 00:41:40,530
So there are other events.

1003
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:41,430
- Congratulations.

1004
00:41:44,010 --> 00:41:46,290
- We happily named him Flynn too.

1005
00:41:46,290 --> 00:41:50,610
- So yeah, what village was that?

1006
00:41:50,610 --> 00:41:51,443
- It's invite only.

1007
00:41:51,443 --> 00:41:53,510
(panelist laughing)

1008
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:57,930
No, there's tons of stuff to
do with your significant other

1009
00:41:57,930 --> 00:42:00,840
and that's the beauty of it.

1010
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:02,040
We are a community,

1011
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:03,330
as Jeff said earlier,

1012
00:42:03,330 --> 00:42:07,950
of artists and lock
pickers and phone freaks

1013
00:42:07,950 --> 00:42:10,233
and there's just so many different things.

1014
00:42:11,589 --> 00:42:14,643
There's always something to find.

1015
00:42:14,643 --> 00:42:17,190
If you're really, really
having a hard time,

1016
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:20,130
just go see a fantastic singer.

1017
00:42:20,130 --> 00:42:21,200
Right, there you go.

1018
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,610
Go see a fantastic performer.
- A lot here.

1019
00:42:23,610 --> 00:42:25,320
- Yeah, yeah.

1020
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:27,960
- So, are you saying
DEF CON changes lives?

1021
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:28,793
- Oh damn.

1022
00:42:28,793 --> 00:42:31,200
(panelist laughing)

1023
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,280
- I didn't laugh.

1024
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,660
- Okay, changed your life.

1025
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:34,980
- I haven't brought him.

1026
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:36,953
I am hoping for roots

1027
00:42:36,953 --> 00:42:39,663
or sorry the new version of it.

1028
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:45,570
I personally believe that DEF CON

1029
00:42:45,570 --> 00:42:50,283
may have to sponsor my child to attend,

1030
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:53,213
concerns there.

1031
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:55,193
- Awesome.

1032
00:42:55,193 --> 00:42:56,700
Well that's all the time
that we have for today.

1033
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:58,577
How about a round of
applause for our panelists?

1034
00:42:58,577 --> 00:43:01,744
(audience applauding)

1035
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:07,530
So thank you so much everybody

1036
00:43:07,530 --> 00:43:10,170
for starting your DEF
CON 30 with us here today

1037
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:12,042
and welcome to DEF CON.

1038
00:43:12,042 --> 00:43:13,670
(panelist cheering)

1039
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:16,883
- Welcome to DEFCON, half the planet.
