1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,860
- So we have a pretty
interesting talk today.

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:04,170
We have Jen Easterly and
our own Dark Tangent.

3
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:06,030
They're gonna give us a little discussion

4
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:08,100
about how Aerosmith and Run-DMC

5
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:10,830
can tell us about the
future of cybersecurity.

6
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:12,808
So enjoy.

7
00:00:12,808 --> 00:00:14,660
(audience applauding)

8
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:15,493
- Okay.

9
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,890
All right, thanks for coming to our talk,

10
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:22,650
and I'm gonna reveal our agenda.

11
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:24,480
This is what we'll be covering.

12
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,537
That's blank.

13
00:00:25,537 --> 00:00:26,370
(audience laughing)

14
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:29,100
'Cause this is gonna be a
more unscripted conversation

15
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,500
between Jen and myself.

16
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,570
And we have a couple
things we want to cover.

17
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:35,130
But really, we wanted to have

18
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:36,810
a sort of an authentic conversation,

19
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:39,240
not a scripted thing
where I have to make sure

20
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,880
I ask a specific question
and so on and so forth.

21
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,980
So it might not be totally smooth,

22
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:45,960
but it'll be totally interesting.

23
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,550
And then at some point we're gonna start

24
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:50,220
involving the audience
with some questions.

25
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:51,540
And so you can listen to us,

26
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:53,790
maybe work through some of your questions.

27
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:58,790
And before we get started, I
have to de conflict myself.

28
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:02,670
I actually am on the CISA Advisory Board

29
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:07,670
and so I'm gonna be repping
my "Keep CISA weird" shirt.

30
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:09,090
(audience cheering)

31
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:12,870
So just to remind the director

32
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:15,120
that just 'cause it's government

33
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,863
doesn't mean it has to be boring.

34
00:01:16,863 --> 00:01:18,734
- Exactly.
(Dark laughs)

35
00:01:18,734 --> 00:01:19,567
Love it.

36
00:01:19,567 --> 00:01:21,240
I should have brought mine
now I feel kind of guilty.

37
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,670
- Yeah, look at that.

38
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:24,240
In the blade runner font,

39
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,070
for those of you wondering
what that font is.

40
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:27,477
- You should show them the back.

41
00:01:27,477 --> 00:01:28,710
- Oh, I can't read that.

42
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:29,543
What does that say?

43
00:01:29,543 --> 00:01:31,830
- It says, "How about
a nice game of chess?"

44
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:33,060
- Yes.

45
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,440
A nice game of chess,

46
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:37,440
which Kenneth Gears is
running the chess competition

47
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,623
at DEFCON in case you wanna
have a nice game of chess.

48
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:44,250
All right, let's kick it off.

49
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:45,900
Why are you here?

50
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,780
- Yeah, well, let's see a show of hands.

51
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,363
How many people know what CISA is?

52
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,210
- Wow.
- Oh, it's pretty good.

53
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:56,512
- How many of you work for CISA?

54
00:01:56,512 --> 00:01:59,095
(all laughing)

55
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:01,860
- Well, maybe I can leave.

56
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:02,958
My job is done here.

57
00:02:02,958 --> 00:02:05,730
- Yeah, we've converted
them all to employees.

58
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:06,563
- Exactly.

59
00:02:06,563 --> 00:02:09,330
So as you know, CISA is the newest agency

60
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:10,664
in the federal government

61
00:02:10,664 --> 00:02:14,160
founded by our mutual friend, Chris Krebs

62
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,230
about three and a half years ago.

63
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:18,690
And I think events like this,

64
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:23,550
especially with the folks
who are here are so important

65
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:26,670
for us to develop trusted
partnerships with.

66
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:28,530
And so you and I before I was confirmed,

67
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:31,500
had a great conversation
about the importance

68
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,790
of this community.

69
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:37,363
And certainly from my past
in the army, at the NSA,

70
00:02:37,363 --> 00:02:40,950
and even at Morgan Stanley
where we sent folks here

71
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:43,230
realized that this is such
an important community

72
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:44,280
for us to connect to.

73
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,100
So I was excited to
come hang out with you-

74
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:47,933
- Yeah.

75
00:02:47,933 --> 00:02:49,170
- And have some fun.

76
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:51,174
- You're all important.

77
00:02:51,174 --> 00:02:52,925
(audience laughing)

78
00:02:52,925 --> 00:02:55,830
We're gonna talk about
that I think a little bit.

79
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:58,380
It's interesting because
when I started with DEFCON

80
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:00,600
and it was all about the technical,

81
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,770
and it was all about the party,

82
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:03,900
and it was all about the hack

83
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,093
and the social grew up around it.

84
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:08,790
And we'd always talk about keeping true

85
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:11,760
to the core of DEFCON
meant that you had to stay

86
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,640
kind of hacker and all the
things that weren't hacker,

87
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,660
that's fine too.

88
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:20,460
But if you lost that core, you might drift

89
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:22,410
and then you're not quite
sure what your identity is.

90
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:24,150
And one of the things we do at DEFCON now

91
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:27,330
is when we're reviewing papers is we say,

92
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:30,120
we're not an InfoSec conference,
we're a hacking conference.

93
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,110
And there's difference.

94
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:36,110
Here it's maybe joy of
discoveries, spontaneous learning.

95
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:39,030
InfoSec may be advancing your career

96
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:42,360
or honing a technique that
will help you in your job.

97
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,780
Have you really thought through,
what is the core of CISA?

98
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,880
What is your guiding stone

99
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,907
where everything else kind of orients?

100
00:03:49,907 --> 00:03:51,960
'Cause we've had 30 years to figure it out

101
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:55,860
and you've had a year and
a half plus what Chris had.

102
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,947
- Well a year and a couple weeks.

103
00:03:57,947 --> 00:03:59,400
- Yeah.

104
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,190
- Well, it's a good question
because one of the first things

105
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:06,303
that I looked at when I got
there is, what's our culture?

106
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:08,640
What are our core values?

107
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,020
What do we expect from each other

108
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:12,660
and what do we aspire to
be as an organization?

109
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:16,110
And because we were built off
the back of a staff element,

110
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:18,308
we really didn't have any of that kind.

111
00:04:18,308 --> 00:04:20,670
- I was curious, if you
can share the numbers,

112
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:24,470
what's average turnover in a
government agency or in CISA?

113
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:26,550
What's retention even like in that?

114
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:30,720
- Yeah, I mean, it's actually
pretty good retention.

115
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,460
Our turnover attrition,

116
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:37,140
and I separate attrition
from regretted attrition,

117
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,760
'cause not all attrition is-

118
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:39,593
- Is bad.

119
00:04:39,593 --> 00:04:42,450
- Necessarily a bad thing
for the organization,

120
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:45,240
but it's under probably like 10%.

121
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:49,830
So maybe in some case
under 5%, but it's low.

122
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:53,790
- Compared to say Amazon
at 40%, not looking so bad.

123
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:55,890
- Yeah, but I have a different philosophy.

124
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:59,250
I mean, so attracting and retaining talent

125
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:02,100
is really predicated on
developing a great culture

126
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,810
and that's why we've laid out

127
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:05,520
what the core values of CISA are,

128
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,720
what our core principles are.

129
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,020
But if somebody wants to
come in to defend the nation

130
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,330
for a period of time and then go back out

131
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:15,480
to a critical infrastructure
owner or operator,

132
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:18,060
you become part of the
collective defense of the nation.

133
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:20,580
So I'm totally cool with that.

134
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:23,640
Come learn what it's like to
work in the federal government.

135
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,970
We are probably as much the private sector

136
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:29,130
as any place in the federal government.

137
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:33,390
And so I think it's
about building capability

138
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:34,500
for the nation.

139
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,680
- I remember when I was
spending time in DC,

140
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,440
there was always the politicals,

141
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,140
the full-time employees,
and the contractors.

142
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:45,360
And there are these three communities

143
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,220
and they're all working
at the same agency,

144
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,900
but they're different

145
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,010
and they have different interests,

146
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:51,870
and different motivations and everything.

147
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:54,240
And originally at big DHS,

148
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,090
they had quite a large
number of contractors

149
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:58,650
and I remember having a conversation

150
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:01,523
with some leadership
back in the day saying,

151
00:06:01,523 --> 00:06:05,550
if 60% of your workforce are contractors,

152
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:07,140
that means the remaining 40%

153
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:10,800
have to be really good
at managing contractors.

154
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,240
You have to have expert skills,

155
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,630
but if you're 40% is just like those 60%,

156
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:18,600
so does it mean that 'cause
you're building that culture,

157
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,780
you have to have the culture
of managing contractors

158
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:24,900
or is it you treat everybody identically

159
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,750
knowing you have to have
different skill sets for the...?

160
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,010
How do you...?
- Yeah.

161
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:31,310
- Because it's not
managing cooperate America.

162
00:06:32,631 --> 00:06:34,849
- For me, we are just riffing
here so that's just a...

163
00:06:34,849 --> 00:06:36,330
- Yeah.

164
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:39,030
- For me, I really
don't see a distinction.

165
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:43,140
I mean, there is a distinction
in terms of certain rules,

166
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,700
a way a contract is handed.

167
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:48,060
So for example, I'm a big
mental health advocate.

168
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:50,220
So we made 2022 the year of mental health

169
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:52,740
and employee wellbeing.

170
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:55,020
But really everybody wellbeing obviously

171
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,700
if you contribute to the mission of CISA.

172
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,927
But one of the things that we did

173
00:06:58,927 --> 00:07:01,320
was we got Headspace, the mindfulness app.

174
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,349
Do you use that?

175
00:07:02,349 --> 00:07:03,182
- Okay, I don't use it.

176
00:07:03,182 --> 00:07:04,015
- I recommend it to you.

177
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:08,133
So it's good for
meditation and mindfulness.

178
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,190
So we got that for all of our employees

179
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:13,230
and we couldn't get it for the contractor.

180
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:14,992
So there's certainly the legal things-

181
00:07:14,992 --> 00:07:15,825
- Interesting.

182
00:07:15,825 --> 00:07:16,800
- There's training that we offer

183
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,150
that we can ask a contractors
company to offer to them.

184
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:24,720
If we give days off, we
can work with that vendor.

185
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,670
But otherwise, I just see
everybody as part of team CISA.

186
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:33,270
Same values, collaboration,
innovation, service,

187
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:35,790
accountability, all of us same principles.

188
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:38,580
And we have a culture
council that we stood up

189
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:41,100
to make sure that we
are guarding our culture

190
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,044
and embracing it.

191
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:43,410
- So the people in other
agencies looking at you like,

192
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:45,000
what the hell is Jen doing?

193
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,972
Or are they like, that's
awesome, we wanna imitate that?

194
00:07:47,972 --> 00:07:49,739
- That.
- That, okay.

195
00:07:49,739 --> 00:07:51,300
- I don't know.
(Black laughs)

196
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:54,570
I think people see that
we're having a lot of success

197
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:56,280
with bringing in talent.

198
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,780
- Yeah.
- And so that's good.

199
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:00,300
I mean, partially that is the
culture that we're building,

200
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:04,710
but it's also because we were
uniquely given authorities

201
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:06,810
as America's Cyber Defense Agency.

202
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:08,940
I mean, the Congress went all in on us.

203
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,680
They gave us more money, more authorities.

204
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,060
They gave us something called

205
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,770
the Cyber Talent Management System,

206
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:18,770
which allows us to hire much
more agilely and pay more.

207
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,560
One thing that always
drove me bananas was,

208
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,900
you have to have a bachelor's degree,

209
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,060
or a master's degree, or a PhD.

210
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,830
I mean, and then you get a PhD

211
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:31,020
and come in as a GS 11 or something.

212
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,503
- Right, doing malware analysis.

213
00:08:32,503 --> 00:08:33,336
- Exactly.

214
00:08:33,336 --> 00:08:34,169
I don't really care

215
00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:35,520
whether you have a college degree or not.

216
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,430
My most technical person
at Morgan Stanley,

217
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:41,370
my head of cyber analytics
had no college degree.

218
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:46,370
And so I think it's really
about aptitude and attitude

219
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:48,990
and that's why I think the
culture piece is so important

220
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:52,590
because you might be the most
technical person in the world.

221
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:54,390
But if you're an asshole,

222
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:57,420
that's not gonna be good for the culture

223
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,740
that we're trying to build.

224
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:01,830
And so aptitude and attitude
is what we need to do

225
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:03,900
and the CTMS takes us there.

226
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:06,510
It also helps us pay closer to market,

227
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:08,410
not what I paid the
guys at Morgan Stanley.

228
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:11,430
- The CTMS she's mentioning...

229
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:12,660
- Oh yeah, you started that, right?

230
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:15,813
- Well, eight years ago or more

231
00:09:15,813 --> 00:09:19,290
that we did some
recommendations on hiring in DHS

232
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:21,150
and how to retain, attract.

233
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:23,130
We were really big on this concept

234
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:26,703
of verification of talent.

235
00:09:27,971 --> 00:09:29,370
So you have to prove your skills,

236
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:31,590
Demonstration of Skill I
think is what we called it.

237
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:33,030
And then that way you would hire,

238
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,380
it doesn't matter what your education is.

239
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:37,770
If you can demonstrate the
skill, then you're qualified

240
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:41,460
and it was a good report,
people agreed with it

241
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:45,270
and then nothing for it until
just last year, seven years.

242
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:46,410
- Yeah, 2021.

243
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:49,650
- And so, speed of government.

244
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:53,933
But now that it's happened,
now you can run with it.

245
00:09:53,933 --> 00:09:56,523
And so, yeah, it's slow fast.

246
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,193
In our world,

247
00:09:58,193 --> 00:10:00,150
in hacking you expect things
to happen very quickly,

248
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:02,400
but in government world,
sometimes things are slow

249
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,590
and I kind of use that to balance

250
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:06,238
both sides of my personality.

251
00:10:06,238 --> 00:10:08,483
- Yeah, but it's the bureaucracy.

252
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:12,843
I mean, people ask often
what keeps you up at night?

253
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:15,420
The adversaries are out there

254
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,070
and they're really sophisticated

255
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:20,250
and increasingly complex threat landscape.

256
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:23,340
But for me, it's battling the bureaucracy

257
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:27,120
both so we can attract
and retain great talent,

258
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,740
but also be able to do the mission.

259
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,570
We have to be able to
move the speed of cyber

260
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:32,117
and not at the speed of bureaucracy.

261
00:10:32,117 --> 00:10:34,170
- You can't get a PhD
in bureaucracy, can you?

262
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:35,751
So I mean....
- Or government.

263
00:10:35,751 --> 00:10:37,080
- Yeah, or government.

264
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,720
- And so that's the thing
that I worry the most about

265
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,390
and that's the thing that
we're fighting against is,

266
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:45,960
how can we do things much
more like the private sector

267
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,730
and battle the government bureaucracy?

268
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:50,220
And we're starting to
have a lot of good success

269
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:52,920
and part of it is what
we've been talking about

270
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,540
since over a year ago is,

271
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:57,000
how do you build those
trusted partnerships?

272
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,030
There's this whole talk
predicated on unlikely

273
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:02,790
but powerful partnerships that Run-DMC

274
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:05,460
and Andrew Smith, 1986 walked this way.

275
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:07,602
- I like the DMC, I'll take that.

276
00:11:07,602 --> 00:11:09,060
That'd be good.

277
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,530
One of the things,

278
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:13,920
I think we talked about this is that...

279
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,490
And I'm curious if by show of hands,

280
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:21,010
how many people trust an organization

281
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:25,260
versus trust an individual?

282
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:28,400
You don't trust say the FBI,
you trust your buddy at FBI

283
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,540
or you don't trust Microsoft,
you trust your buddy.

284
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:33,250
So show of hands, who would
trust the organization

285
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,203
and who would trust your individual

286
00:11:37,203 --> 00:11:38,903
that you have a relationship with?

287
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:43,950
Right, and so I think knowing that...

288
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:45,447
- [Audience 1] I trust no one.

289
00:11:45,447 --> 00:11:46,950
- You trust no one.
- You trust no one.

290
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:51,660
- Yeah, and so I think that
means that we have to organize,

291
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,400
you have to build a way for people

292
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,400
to build those relationships
with your organization

293
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,260
and then maybe over time
they trust the organization

294
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,190
more and more and more.

295
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:03,570
But until you have that
kind of continuity of trust,

296
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:05,430
because I think when the hits the fan,

297
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:07,082
they're gonna call up their buddy

298
00:12:07,082 --> 00:12:09,175
and they're not gonna
call the Switchboard.

299
00:12:09,175 --> 00:12:10,008
- No.
- Yeah.

300
00:12:10,008 --> 00:12:11,250
- I mean, that answers your question

301
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:12,750
and that's why I'm here.

302
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:15,357
And that's why I spend so
much time engaging with people

303
00:12:15,357 --> 00:12:18,310
and on the road, and going to
various events to meet people

304
00:12:19,345 --> 00:12:20,294
and being responsive.

305
00:12:20,294 --> 00:12:22,020
- But behind you, you have to have a team,

306
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:23,497
or group of people or...

307
00:12:23,497 --> 00:12:25,269
- Yeah, I've got an awesome team.

308
00:12:25,269 --> 00:12:26,850
A lot of them as you know.

309
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:28,650
A lot of them are here but now that,

310
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:30,090
you and I talked about this

311
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:34,080
and I just came from a
discussion around elections.

312
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:38,450
And the operative word
for all of this is trust

313
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:39,390
at the end of the day.

314
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:40,680
And so the question is,

315
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:43,740
how do you actually build
trusted partnerships

316
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:47,070
between the federal government
and all of the partners

317
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:47,903
that we need to work with?

318
00:12:47,903 --> 00:12:50,730
Because we're a voluntary
agency, we're not a regulator.

319
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:53,520
And our job is to defend
critical infrastructure

320
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,380
and we don't own the vast majority

321
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,580
of critical infrastructure.

322
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:59,040
So you have to have trusted partnerships

323
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,690
so we can work together to make sure

324
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:02,820
that everybody has the
guidance, and the resources,

325
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:06,057
and the tools to be able
to defend the nation.

326
00:13:06,057 --> 00:13:08,220
And so again, it's about trust,

327
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,650
And again, what we talked about,

328
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:12,000
what we've been trying to do

329
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,180
through the Joint Cyber Defense
Collaborative as you know

330
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:17,610
through our Cybersecurity
Advisory Council,

331
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:20,490
through the Technical Advisory Council,

332
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:22,290
and I really want you to talk about that,

333
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:24,900
through the CSRB, the
Cyber Safety Review Board

334
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:27,960
that you and Rob Silvers and
Heather Atkins talked about,

335
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:31,200
is creating trust between
the federal government

336
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,340
and all of the stakeholders
to include industry.

337
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:37,830
And I see the most important things is,

338
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:42,150
you gotta approach it with
first of all, humility.

339
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:44,250
We certainly can't solve
this problem as a government.

340
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,570
We don't have all the answers,

341
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:48,120
and so humility I think
is truly important.

342
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,860
I think vulnerability is something.

343
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,300
So it's interesting, right?
- Yeah.

344
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:54,180
- Because vulnerabilities
are such a negative word

345
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:55,590
in our technical community.

346
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:58,080
But I think vulnerability is
an incredibly important thing

347
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,190
when you're talking about building-

348
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:00,023
- Personal development.

349
00:14:00,023 --> 00:14:01,470
- Trusted relationship.

350
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:03,870
I think transparency is
something we always talk about.

351
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:08,580
Transparency builds trust,
and that's huge for me.

352
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:12,450
And then finally, gratitude,
bringing together the community

353
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:15,900
and sort of figuring out
how we can appreciate

354
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:18,092
what every side is bringing to the table.

355
00:14:18,092 --> 00:14:19,740
- So you mentioned a couple words

356
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:22,350
that really resonate with me.

357
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:24,030
One is transparency,

358
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:26,340
just because DEFCON
we've done so much work

359
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,173
trying to build.

360
00:14:27,173 --> 00:14:30,750
We were the first conference
to use a transparency report

361
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,700
to try to tell people what happened.

362
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:33,600
That's a little painful

363
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,840
because you don't revealing
the bad things that happen,

364
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:41,840
but the good that comes out
of it outweighs the bad.

365
00:14:42,247 --> 00:14:46,650
And the other thing I think
is, this is a global game now

366
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:50,160
and so things you do
are setting a standard

367
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,140
or an expectation with all the partners

368
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:55,260
and allies and frankly opponents.

369
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:58,260
And so, it's almost
like if you could set up

370
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:01,320
your organization to play the...

371
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:04,710
So what does team rule of loss strengths?

372
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:08,733
Its transparency, its accountability.

373
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:12,270
Team authoritarian doesn't
wanna be transparent,

374
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:13,530
they don't wanna be accountable.

375
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:16,020
So it's like the more we can emphasize

376
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:18,690
and highlight that contrast
between both sides,

377
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:21,150
team undecided in the middle,

378
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:22,500
they can make a more informed decision

379
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,020
of which team they may be
want to associate with.

380
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:27,000
And so I think the more that you or I

381
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,360
or any of our organizations
can operate in a transparent

382
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,740
or an accountable way,

383
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:34,477
it makes it that much harder
for your opponents to say,

384
00:15:34,477 --> 00:15:36,090
"Oh, we're transparent too.

385
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:37,770
Oh look how accountable we are."

386
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,290
No, we might have other
things that are similar,

387
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:42,480
but draw the contrast.
- Yeah.

388
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,100
- And it might be hard for
a government to do that

389
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,080
because you you're so used to

390
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:50,160
all the liability of
being transparent, right?

391
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,930
You might have laws against it.

392
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:52,980
- It's really interesting.

393
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:57,980
So I spent the first 27 years
of my career in the army,

394
00:15:58,841 --> 00:16:02,070
a good portion at the
National Security Agency.

395
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:04,200
I was at the White House
under the Bush administration,

396
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,487
then under the Obama administration

397
00:16:05,487 --> 00:16:07,140
and then went off to Morgan Stanley

398
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:08,580
for four and a half years.

399
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:10,666
And when you think about the first half

400
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:15,666
of that being in the
intelligence community,

401
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:19,117
it was a little bit
counterintuitive to say,

402
00:16:19,117 --> 00:16:22,050
"Okay, we wanna be really
transparent with everything."

403
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:22,883
- Right.

404
00:16:22,883 --> 00:16:26,100
- Not because we didn't
believe in transparency,

405
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,620
but because there's
always a fear of sources

406
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,360
and methods getting compromised

407
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:34,070
and then not being able to do
the mission for the nation.

408
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:37,803
But I think increasingly,
and this was after 2013,

409
00:16:38,827 --> 00:16:39,660
(inaudible)

410
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,820
there's a real embrace of transparency

411
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:45,180
because ultimately government
has to be accountable

412
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:46,740
to the American people.

413
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:50,100
And so I've seen a very good evolution

414
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,960
in the embrace of transparency.

415
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,970
And frankly at CISA,

416
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:57,240
because we are such an
outward facing agency,

417
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,250
every day is working with private sector,

418
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:01,350
or state and local, or election officials.

419
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:03,540
- Right.
- It is about...

420
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,340
We know that unless we're transparent,

421
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:08,700
unless people can
understand why we're doing

422
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:11,040
what we're doing, the
products are going out,

423
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,360
we're asking for feedback from them,

424
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,910
unless we're being completely transparent,

425
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:16,110
the model breaks down.

426
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:18,510
I don't have a badge where I can show up,

427
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:20,370
I don't have subpoena power

428
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:24,780
and so it's all about, "Okay,
why should you trust CISA?"

429
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:27,570
Because we add value,
because we're responsive,

430
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:29,537
because we have great expertise,
because we're transparent.

431
00:17:29,537 --> 00:17:33,690
- So it's the all carrots,
no sticks kind of.

432
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:34,523
- Not really.

433
00:17:34,523 --> 00:17:37,860
I mean, we have very, very
small regulatory power

434
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:40,920
on the chemical facilities,
anti-terrorism side.

435
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:41,820
There's a physical...

436
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,890
- But so it has to be voluntary.

437
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:45,270
- But it's all voluntary,

438
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:50,270
which frankly, I embrace because I think

439
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:52,410
if we were a regulator,

440
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:55,410
we would not be able to create
the trust and partnerships.

441
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:56,595
- You'd be in court every other minute.

442
00:17:56,595 --> 00:17:57,719
You wouldn't get anything done.

443
00:17:57,719 --> 00:17:58,552
- But we did it.

444
00:17:58,552 --> 00:17:59,917
when I was in finance it's not like,

445
00:17:59,917 --> 00:18:02,310
"Hey, let's go rush to tell the regulators

446
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:03,925
when we (inaudible)."

447
00:18:03,925 --> 00:18:06,210
- Yeah, we discovered something like that.

448
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,590
- And for the stuff that we talk about,

449
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:08,550
you guys did some great work

450
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:09,660
and I really want you to talk about this

451
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:12,000
on coordinated vulnerability disclosure.

452
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,070
You have to have a relationship

453
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:18,090
where you can have that
trust with the researchers,

454
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:23,070
and then ultimately be able to
put information out that is,

455
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:24,930
people are gonna have
confidence in, believe it,

456
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:27,360
understand it, be able to
mitigate vulnerabilities,

457
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,370
and it's just incredibly important.

458
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:31,500
So can you talk a little
bit about the tech?

459
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,303
- Yeah, okay.

460
00:18:34,898 --> 00:18:39,898
So, Jen constituted a security
advisory committee for CISA

461
00:18:42,513 --> 00:18:47,070
and it looks at, I think
we have what seven or...?

462
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:49,710
- Oh yeah, probably seven big things.

463
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:52,290
It's about how do you build the agency?

464
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:55,050
How do you evolve America's
Cyber Defense Agency?

465
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:57,453
So it's a very eclectic group,

466
00:18:58,410 --> 00:18:59,340
but I really want...

467
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:00,605
And not everybody's technical.

468
00:19:00,605 --> 00:19:01,920
Some people come from...

469
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,470
- Yeah, you're doing
infrastructure, and energy.

470
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:05,850
and misinformation.

471
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:06,683
We have different....

472
00:19:06,683 --> 00:19:07,523
- Finance, energy, exactly.

473
00:19:07,523 --> 00:19:12,210
- Yeah finance and so out of
that spectrum of subgroups,

474
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:14,460
I'm chairing a technical
advisory committee.

475
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,870
And the part that was really cool

476
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:18,630
is I can bring people
in from other countries,

477
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:20,430
clearances aren't necessary,

478
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:22,170
all of our reports become public

479
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:24,240
and we just published two reports.

480
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,590
One on threaten intelligence

481
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:28,119
and one on vulnerability disclosure,

482
00:19:28,119 --> 00:19:32,550
and we'll be producing
more reports in the future.

483
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:34,770
And so I had a lot of leeway

484
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:39,360
to attract a diverse group of people,

485
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,700
and it's been really amazing

486
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:44,880
because unlike the big HSAC reports

487
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,040
that would take a long
time, and be very large,

488
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,320
and there was no immediate impact,

489
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,720
we delivered our first reports.

490
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,940
They were voted on by
the overall committee,

491
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,860
they were approved by the director,

492
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,570
and two weeks later,

493
00:19:57,570 --> 00:19:59,820
we're having calls with people inside CISA

494
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:04,820
from those teams and threat
intel digesting our report,

495
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:07,530
excited that we've given recommendations,

496
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:10,680
already making changes
inside the organization.

497
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,923
What's going on here?

498
00:20:11,923 --> 00:20:13,247
I'm not used to that.

499
00:20:13,247 --> 00:20:15,000
- That's not your daddy's government.

500
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,560
- No, and they're excited,

501
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,240
and they're like, "Wow,
you gave us a great idea,

502
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,610
and that reinforces this other thinking

503
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:21,930
that we need to tie a connection

504
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:23,280
between just not the threat intel.

505
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,550
We need to start
enriching it with metadata

506
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:31,550
because the people in OT they wanna know,

507
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:37,020
do I really have to turn
off my vaccine processor

508
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,280
to patch this?

509
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:41,128
Or can I just put in a firewall rule?

510
00:20:41,128 --> 00:20:44,010
Yes, you said this is a critical nine,

511
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:46,080
but what does that mean to me?"

512
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,520
And so we want to create,

513
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,890
one of our recommendations
was essentially creating a way

514
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:54,270
to enrich these with metadata
in a community portal

515
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:56,377
where people, the other
vaccine manufacturers can say,

516
00:20:56,377 --> 00:20:58,200
"No, no, no, we're running
that Phillips gear,

517
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,940
just do this other thing."

518
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:02,280
And then we're missing that.

519
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:05,340
And what that does, is
without that metadata,

520
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,020
people are frozen with indecision

521
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,700
and they're running all these risks.

522
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,220
So we can speed up that loop,

523
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:16,020
making the threat intel
more valuable, faster.

524
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:20,190
And so there's other interesting
recommendations like that,

525
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:23,250
but just the speed at which they got it,

526
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:24,510
and they wanted to implement it.

527
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:27,660
And so I think for the rest

528
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,850
of the technical advisory committee,

529
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:32,040
that have never interacted
really with government before

530
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,810
there's a lot of them,
this is their first chance

531
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:36,420
ever being on an advisory committee.

532
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,800
It's really empowering to them.

533
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,540
They're really excited.

534
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:41,130
They listen to us.

535
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:44,430
They did something, this is
not how it's supposed to be.

536
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:46,500
And I'm hoping that
through this experience,

537
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,150
more and more people want to get involved.

538
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:49,290
And so for example,

539
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:54,180
we would interview 20
different people on a report.

540
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:56,130
So even though you're not on the tech,

541
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:57,570
if you're a subject matter expert

542
00:21:57,570 --> 00:22:00,690
in something we're looking
at, we might call you up

543
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:03,420
and you might come in
and give us your opinion.

544
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:04,253
And because of that,

545
00:22:04,253 --> 00:22:07,260
we get people across the whole industry,

546
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:10,740
small manufacturers and energy giant

547
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:13,500
Southern corporation
style, huge companies.

548
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:18,090
And we're really focused
on diversity of opinion

549
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:19,410
because what we're finding too

550
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:21,210
is there's no one single use case,

551
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:23,943
especially in vulnerability disclosure.

552
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:26,910
There's some people that
are out of business,

553
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:29,220
companies are out of business,
but they're widely adopted.

554
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:31,410
How do you disclose
that to the manufacturer

555
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:33,090
if they're gone?

556
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:34,980
Who can bless that it's okay

557
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:36,720
for you to reveal that publicly?

558
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,540
There's no law, there's no...

559
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:41,610
So you can run into these thorny issues

560
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:46,290
and CISA acting as sort
of a governance mediator,

561
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:49,980
I'll argue that they should take on

562
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:51,940
more of a coordination role

563
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:58,010
and get sometimes between the
researcher and the company.

564
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:59,610
Because a lot of researchers,

565
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:01,590
we don't wanna spend the rest of our lives

566
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:03,030
arguing with the company.

567
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:05,700
We found the bug, we want
the right thing done,

568
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:08,640
but I'm not willing to
sacrifice three months of pain.

569
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,320
- Yeah, and that's
exactly what we're doing.

570
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,390
I mean, we have the platform

571
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:16,350
and recently we did this
for elections actually.

572
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:17,850
Folks might have seen a report we did

573
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:22,020
working with a researcher
and working with Dominion.

574
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:24,150
And that was a really complicated,

575
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:26,037
coordinated vulnerability disclosure.

576
00:23:26,037 --> 00:23:30,450
And so, we spent a lot of rigor,

577
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:33,270
very deliberate efforts to do that.

578
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:36,570
And sometimes it's hard
to necessarily mediate

579
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:37,403
the middle of that but...

580
00:23:37,403 --> 00:23:39,127
- And the interesting thing is people say,

581
00:23:39,127 --> 00:23:40,710
"Well, what's the role of government?"

582
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:42,210
And it seems like role of government

583
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:46,140
is to get involved in these sticky issues

584
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:49,290
that don't have a clear business solution.

585
00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:54,180
It's like a conflict between
commercial and civil society

586
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:57,600
and you need a disinterested third party

587
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,787
to make those hard calls on something.

588
00:23:59,787 --> 00:24:01,620
- And disinterested is an important word

589
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:05,220
because we are only...

590
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:08,880
I mean, our north star is defense,

591
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,350
which is kind of pure to me.

592
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:12,314
Having been on the offense side,

593
00:24:12,314 --> 00:24:14,730
I actually like the defense better

594
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:16,803
and I think defense is the new offense.

595
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,890
But it's a pure mission

596
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:22,440
and so I think that's really
important when you think about,

597
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,990
we are only in it to defend the nation.

598
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:26,610
But I wanna pick up on something you said,

599
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:29,940
because this morning I got to just chat

600
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:31,020
with some of the researchers

601
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:35,130
that we've built relationships
with over the past six months

602
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:36,720
and it's kind of funny.

603
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,590
The one was Jags.

604
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:40,816
If you know Jags and then Silas Cutler.

605
00:24:40,816 --> 00:24:41,790
- Yeah, Silas is always fun.

606
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:43,440
- Yeah, and then I saw Marcus

607
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,780
over at the EFF poker
tournament with Kurt.

608
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:46,890
So that was fun too.

609
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:50,010
But I met those two guys

610
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:52,530
because they reached out to me on Twitter.

611
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:56,310
Actually it was something
critical, Jags had some...

612
00:24:56,310 --> 00:25:00,210
He was unhappy about something,
decisions we had made

613
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:03,907
and he just sends me this DMs and I said,

614
00:25:03,907 --> 00:25:06,000
"Well, let me give you a call.

615
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,170
What's your phone number?"

616
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:08,460
I didn't know who he was but here we are.

617
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:11,181
- Yeah, you didn't know
we all had a (inaudible).

618
00:25:11,181 --> 00:25:13,468
- We talked it out, and
actually we talked through it

619
00:25:13,468 --> 00:25:14,301
and he was the one said,

620
00:25:14,301 --> 00:25:15,134
"Well it's..."

621
00:25:15,134 --> 00:25:17,430
'Cause it started out
with ignite the hackers,

622
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:18,990
he's like, "No, what you really need

623
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:20,610
is this technical advisory council."

624
00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:22,380
And I said, "Well, I've got Jeff Moss."

625
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:23,430
He's like, "Well, he's fabulous."

626
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:25,320
I said, "Yes, I know."
- Okay.

627
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,780
- But I am such a fan

628
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:30,270
of the incredible power of researchers.

629
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:31,219
- Yeah, the community.

630
00:25:31,219 --> 00:25:32,580
- I've seen the power
on the government side,

631
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:34,980
but on the private sector side,

632
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:39,630
I mean, we are really leaning
into working with everybody

633
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:41,250
who wants to be part of this community.

634
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:45,180
And Silas worked with us on
the Maui ransomware report

635
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:48,600
that we did doing some
fantastic reverse engineering.

636
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:52,680
Jags worked with us on the
Hermetic Wiper stuff for Ukraine.

637
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:55,560
And so, these types of collaborations

638
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:59,130
are just so absolutely critical

639
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:01,050
And I think we're making
some really good progress.

640
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:02,010
- So talk a little bit...

641
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:06,023
I'm always curious on
CISA's it's global nature,

642
00:26:06,023 --> 00:26:09,873
when you're talking to
our partners or others,

643
00:26:11,238 --> 00:26:13,800
do they come up and say,
"Hey, how is this working?"

644
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,450
Are they lessons that can be imitated,

645
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:18,360
or is the society so different

646
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,970
that it's kind of like a unicorn?

647
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:22,500
- Yeah, other feds you mean?

648
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,450
- Yeah, or other countries
like Australia, UK,

649
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:25,443
anywhere, European.

650
00:26:26,681 --> 00:26:29,640
I saw you signing an MOU with Ukraine.

651
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,473
- With Ukraine, yeah.

652
00:26:30,473 --> 00:26:31,802
It's like (inaudible), yeah.

653
00:26:31,802 --> 00:26:34,350
- So what is the MOU?

654
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:37,260
How do they see CISA a
in the US government,

655
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:39,630
it's not an MOU with FBI or NSA, right?

656
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:41,010
It's the defensive agency.

657
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:43,410
- It's all defense, but
that's the beauty of it

658
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:47,643
because every country has
different things on encryption.

659
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:50,010
Different things in terms of authorities

660
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:51,720
they can do on the offensive side,

661
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,160
different things that they're doing

662
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,540
on the foreign in intelligence side.

663
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:58,170
But defense is pretty much
the same around the world

664
00:26:58,170 --> 00:27:00,210
and so we have fantastic relationships

665
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:01,950
with over 100 CERTs,

666
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:05,070
'cause we're US-CERT and ICS CERT.

667
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:06,510
We have what's called

668
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:08,430
the International Watch
and Warning Network,

669
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:10,890
which is 16 nations across the country,

670
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:14,700
really terrific information
sharing partnerships.

671
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,560
And then of course we're very, very close

672
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,150
with all of our 5i's partners.

673
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:20,820
And so, the international
piece is fantastic.

674
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:22,530
Whenever we talk about the JCDC,

675
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:25,024
we lean into the private sector part,

676
00:27:25,024 --> 00:27:29,610
but the JCDC includes all of
our international relationships

677
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:33,630
to include Ukraine, and we
had this terrific as you said,

678
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:35,790
meeting with the sort of
four different agencies

679
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:36,870
across Ukraine.

680
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:38,790
We did this memorandum of cooperation,

681
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:41,250
which is really about capacity building

682
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:45,150
as well as ways to more
actually share information.

683
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:46,770
- Is there the equivalent of a,

684
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:49,110
if you see something, say something

685
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:51,630
sort of we're the US
government, we see something,

686
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:53,820
we're gonna say something
in the UK or Ukraine.

687
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:55,020
Is there sort of that kind of...?

688
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:57,067
- Yeah, a hundred percent.
- Yeah.

689
00:27:57,067 --> 00:28:01,470
- Obviously if there's an
imminent threat we will,

690
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:03,240
whether it's private sector or whatever,

691
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,790
we have an obligation to ensure

692
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:08,010
that we are getting that information out.

693
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:11,100
But sometimes it's just
dots, suspicious (inaudible).

694
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:13,080
- Only in hindsight.

695
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:17,723
- And so we will always lean
forward because we think.

696
00:28:17,723 --> 00:28:19,890
- So it's a bias toward...

697
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:21,750
- It's always a bias towards action

698
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:24,120
and we'd much rather be
in the proactive space

699
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:27,690
than in the reactive
space because left of boom

700
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:30,300
is better than right of
boom, which is right.

701
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:31,920
The name of the game is resilience.

702
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:36,920
But a great example is Albania.

703
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:40,680
The whole thing happened that came out

704
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:45,680
and we have a good
relationship with their CERT.

705
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:50,460
And so we were able to help
them based on researchers

706
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:53,040
that came in to work with the JCDC

707
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,830
to do some malware analysis

708
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:59,700
and to give back some really
important information to them.

709
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:03,210
And so it's really this
community coming together

710
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:05,130
for the global defense.

711
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:06,840
- Well, that was...

712
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,190
There's so much to talk about, man.

713
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:09,570
We could have beers,
we could beer on that.

714
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:10,950
- We have to ask questions.

715
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:11,820
Did you say beers?

716
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:13,047
- Yeah, I wish we had some beers.

717
00:29:13,047 --> 00:29:13,893
- Oh.
- Yeah.

718
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,713
'Cause I can drink.

719
00:29:15,713 --> 00:29:17,710
I don't know if you're
technically on duty, but...

720
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:19,890
- Yeah, I stopped drinking in 2021,

721
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:21,452
which I think was a bad idea.

722
00:29:21,452 --> 00:29:23,910
(all laughing)

723
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:24,743
- Yeah, that's good.

724
00:29:24,743 --> 00:29:26,640
Let's go for a question or two.

725
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,870
But I wanted to get back.

726
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:30,420
Your north star, you
said that core principle,

727
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:34,150
where a Hackathon CISA
is a defense organization

728
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:39,540
and you are what defend
today, protect the...

729
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:40,800
- Well, Chris and I talk about this.

730
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:43,440
It started out at defend
today, secure tomorrow.

731
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,380
- Secure tomorrow to sort
show put out today's fires-

732
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:47,940
- Yeah, and secure the future.

733
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:49,607
- But think longer term.

734
00:29:49,607 --> 00:29:52,303
- Sure, I mean, the emerging tech piece

735
00:29:52,303 --> 00:29:54,120
is we do the quantum piece as you know,

736
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,367
a lot of work on that with NSA and NIST

737
00:29:56,367 --> 00:30:01,367
and focus on 60, focus on
security of smart cities.

738
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,859
And so we're working...

739
00:30:02,859 --> 00:30:04,230
- So there's this longer term perspective.

740
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:05,394
- Yeah.

741
00:30:05,394 --> 00:30:06,227
- You're not just a firefighting agency.

742
00:30:06,227 --> 00:30:07,350
- No and we don't wanna be.

743
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:11,250
We wanna actually ensure
that all of our partners

744
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:15,270
are building resilience
into their systems.

745
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:16,770
And that's one thing.

746
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:19,039
From a tech perspective,
we we've talked about this

747
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:21,870
at the Cybersecurity Advisory Committee.

748
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:23,460
I spend a lot of time talking about things

749
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:25,290
like multifactor authentication,

750
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:28,290
more than a password and all the basics.

751
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:29,970
But what I think we need to do

752
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:32,760
is ensure that the big
technology companies

753
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:35,340
are actually taking accountability

754
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:37,710
for breaking the security
into their systems-

755
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:38,910
- It drives crazy.

756
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:40,410
- So users don't have to actually

757
00:30:40,410 --> 00:30:41,430
ultimately worry about the (inaudible).

758
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:43,260
- Well, the people I
think most responsible

759
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:45,720
are the people closest
to the levers of power.

760
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:48,210
And if you're the
manufacturer, you're Microsoft,

761
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:49,680
not to beat on them, they do a great job,

762
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,730
but if you're Microsoft,

763
00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:52,680
you are in the best position
to make the correction,

764
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,480
not a third party piece of software

765
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,850
to run on top of your operating system.

766
00:30:56,850 --> 00:31:00,570
And so I think there's
that responsibility there

767
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:03,381
and they've been acknowledging
in Apple and Google.

768
00:31:03,381 --> 00:31:05,730
But I really think that
the more that can be done

769
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:07,890
at close to where the problem is,

770
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:09,420
that frees us up to do...

771
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:10,530
- Hundred percent.

772
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:12,990
And I think they're
recognizing that as well.

773
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:14,820
I mean, part of the
executive order last year

774
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:18,750
was to signal that use of the
government's purchasing power.

775
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:20,700
So if you have contracts
with the government,

776
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:24,360
some of these requirements

777
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:27,360
will become necessary to do business.

778
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,468
- You must be this tall
to sell the government.

779
00:31:29,468 --> 00:31:30,301
- Yeah, sort of.

780
00:31:30,301 --> 00:31:32,280
Exactly, so we're getting there.

781
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:35,040
And then your other point
about the federal partners.

782
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,920
I think the other really
cool thing about the JCDC is,

783
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:41,370
it's the only federal
cyber entity that by law

784
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:46,230
brings in CISA, NSA, FBI, DOD, DOJ, ODNI,

785
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:48,000
the National Cyber
Director Secret Service.

786
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,400
So by law all on one platform.

787
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,840
So we stood this (inaudible).

788
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,280
- Different than a fusion center, right?

789
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,503
- Exactly, we stood this
thing up, but it's not CISA's.

790
00:31:55,503 --> 00:31:59,370
It's a platform where industry
can come to government

791
00:31:59,370 --> 00:32:03,210
and not have to have
that PhD in government

792
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:05,238
to figure out how to interact.

793
00:32:05,238 --> 00:32:06,684
- Right.

794
00:32:06,684 --> 00:32:08,373
Okay, let's go for some question guys.

795
00:32:08,373 --> 00:32:09,206
- Any question.

796
00:32:09,206 --> 00:32:13,073
- Who's got a question?
- Who's got a question?

797
00:32:13,073 --> 00:32:15,195
- [Audience 2] CISA can influence

798
00:32:15,195 --> 00:32:16,259
how Congress appropriates money

799
00:32:16,259 --> 00:32:19,315
to go to the state locals
for cyber security?

800
00:32:19,315 --> 00:32:20,613
- Yeah.
- Okay, repeat the question.

801
00:32:20,613 --> 00:32:21,446
- Yeah, the question,

802
00:32:21,446 --> 00:32:25,800
can we influence how money
goes to state and locals?

803
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:30,800
And certainly I have to say,
we have been really blessed

804
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:35,280
in terms of our engagement
with the Congress.

805
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:39,870
Cyber security happily is
still a very bipartisan issue.

806
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:41,910
And so when I go up on the hill,

807
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:43,890
whether it's to talk about my budget,

808
00:32:43,890 --> 00:32:47,403
whether it's to testify, just
an update on what we're doing,

809
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,090
the questions that I routinely get

810
00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:53,100
from the House and the Senate are,

811
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,810
what more can we do for you?

812
00:32:54,810 --> 00:32:55,643
Which is not the question

813
00:32:55,643 --> 00:32:57,840
that you will always get from Congress.

814
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,990
And so that's actually
really, really encouraging.

815
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:03,810
And one of the things
that I talk about the most

816
00:33:03,810 --> 00:33:06,840
are the importance of us
being able to work closely

817
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:10,410
with state and local to
do all kinds of security,

818
00:33:10,410 --> 00:33:12,720
but a lot of focus on election security.

819
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:16,740
And so we are always
advocating for state and local

820
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:18,870
and the grant program
that we're about to do,

821
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:22,710
the NOFO, Notice Of Funding Opportunity,

822
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:24,930
I think will be really, really important

823
00:33:24,930 --> 00:33:25,763
for state and local.

824
00:33:25,763 --> 00:33:26,850
I thought it was great.

825
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:29,460
That was in the last
package, billion dollars,

826
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:32,370
200 million this year, hugely important.

827
00:33:32,370 --> 00:33:35,430
And the other thing is, two other things,

828
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:38,010
so we are over the next few years

829
00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:40,275
really growing our field force,

830
00:33:40,275 --> 00:33:42,930
it's one of the things
I'm most excited about

831
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:46,110
to have more folks out all across nation.

832
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:48,000
- Out the beltway.
- Yeah, exactly.

833
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,730
It's where I love to be, out the beltway.

834
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:52,710
Working with state and local.

835
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:55,350
We've got cybersecurity coordinators

836
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:58,890
working with every state CISO, state CIO.

837
00:33:58,890 --> 00:34:01,110
And so we're really gonna dig into that.

838
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:04,980
I've got my cyber security
advisor for Region 9,

839
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:07,350
which is based out of
California, Joe Oregon,

840
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:10,830
I think he's in here and
David Rosado heads that.

841
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:13,290
But we are totally leaning in on that.

842
00:34:13,290 --> 00:34:16,410
So, please continue to give us feedback.

843
00:34:16,410 --> 00:34:18,330
The other thing, we're
trying to be creative

844
00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:22,770
in terms of first, how
we help small businesses,

845
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:25,915
because they are really,
as Josh Corman would say,

846
00:34:25,915 --> 00:34:29,370
often in the space of being
target rich, resource poor.

847
00:34:29,370 --> 00:34:30,990
And so we've done a lot of work

848
00:34:30,990 --> 00:34:33,570
in terms of how do we break things down

849
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:35,280
to make it simple for small business

850
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:38,490
to be able to protect itself
knowing that the median side

851
00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:40,410
of a small business is 10 people.

852
00:34:40,410 --> 00:34:43,170
And so small businesses are out
in everybody's jurisdiction.

853
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:44,518
And then also try and be creative.

854
00:34:44,518 --> 00:34:47,070
We were as part of the committee working

855
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:51,420
this really cool pilot,
like a town gown, right?

856
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:52,530
It's awesome.

857
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:55,260
This town gown pilot in Austin

858
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,960
with Mayor Steve Adler and Bobby Chesney,

859
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:00,000
who they're both on
our board to try and...

860
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:00,850
- He made these shirts, so I wear him.

861
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:02,157
- Yeah, Bobby made these shirts.

862
00:35:02,157 --> 00:35:06,840
And so, what we're trying
to do is Austin has this 311

863
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:10,060
so people can call and
if they've got an issue

864
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:12,780
somebody's on the other end
of the phone to help them.

865
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:15,000
They turned out they get a
lot of calls about cyber stuff

866
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,330
and so now we're gonna have
students on the other end

867
00:35:18,330 --> 00:35:21,630
who are gonna be trained to
how to respond to things,

868
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:23,880
and then that will also
help them get experience.

869
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,607
- It's the cyber 911.

870
00:35:25,607 --> 00:35:27,658
And so 81161, you can call 111-

871
00:35:27,658 --> 00:35:29,010
- Exactly.
- And get some help.

872
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:32,340
- So creative ways to build the bench

873
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:35,190
throughout the nation and to raise skills.

874
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:36,290
- One of the things...

875
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:40,890
Lots of acronyms at DHS,
but one of the things I like

876
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:43,080
is it's a ground up
organization, grassroots,

877
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:45,090
it comes state, local.

878
00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:46,500
But there's acronym SLTT,

879
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:49,110
state, local tribal, and territorial

880
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:52,920
because we are more
than a nation of states.

881
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:56,595
And I always respected that
because it was always the SLTT

882
00:35:56,595 --> 00:35:59,790
because you never hear
people talk about the tribes

883
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:00,810
and the territories.

884
00:36:00,810 --> 00:36:02,760
I mean, some presidents don't even know

885
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,590
that we have territories.
(audience laughing)

886
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:07,470
And so it's confusing, I understand.

887
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:10,530
But so it's really nice to see the DHS

888
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:13,722
really recognize that,
no, it's all Americans.

889
00:36:13,722 --> 00:36:15,360
- Yeah.

890
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,193
- This gentleman here,

891
00:36:16,193 --> 00:36:17,850
and then we'll go over
to this gentleman here.

892
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:18,810
- [Audience 2] Hi, thank you guys.

893
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:22,470
My question actually was about
what you just talked about

894
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:24,390
and that is, what can government do

895
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:26,310
to help protect private enterprise?

896
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:29,400
So me personally, my colleague and I

897
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,847
work for a family-owned company.

898
00:36:31,847 --> 00:36:32,822
We're relatively large

899
00:36:32,822 --> 00:36:35,749
and we're an (inaudible)
spending portion of budget

900
00:36:35,749 --> 00:36:36,899
on cybersecurity tools,

901
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:41,910
whether it's software
services, SOC as a service.

902
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:43,860
We don't have our own fire department.

903
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:45,260
We don't have our own police department.

904
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:47,183
We don't have our north.

905
00:36:47,183 --> 00:36:49,563
Yet you now have had to (inaudible)

906
00:36:49,563 --> 00:36:52,207
many that create our own.

907
00:36:52,207 --> 00:36:53,490
And so my question to you is,

908
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:54,630
has there been discussions about

909
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:56,910
the role government can play,

910
00:36:56,910 --> 00:37:00,090
whether it's federal
or at the state local?

911
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:02,430
I think you gave some great examples,

912
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:05,010
but where it's security as a service,

913
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:09,150
almost like a tax dollar
funded provided service

914
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:11,259
that a company can sign up for

915
00:37:11,259 --> 00:37:14,270
or the government is watching it for them

916
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:16,470
and notifying them, the small
and medium size business.

917
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:21,470
- Yep, so if you are a
critical infrastructure,

918
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:25,050
and I don't know if there are
actually some small entities

919
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:26,700
that are critical infrastructure,

920
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:29,130
that is part of our core mission.

921
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:31,650
We are working with
businesses large and small

922
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:33,450
as part of critical infrastructure

923
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:36,330
to ensure that they
have tools and services.

924
00:37:36,330 --> 00:37:39,360
And frankly, a lot of our stuff is free,

925
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:42,240
which is a great four letter word.

926
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,640
So you think about,

927
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,220
and I would invite you to
take a look at our website

928
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:48,780
because a lot of that information is there

929
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:51,150
and we just updated what we call

930
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:53,430
a Small Business Cyber
Security Action Plan,

931
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:55,980
'cause we wanted to break it
down as simple as possible,

932
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:59,010
and then provide all of
our no cost services.

933
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:01,230
Some of the stuff is pro bono provided

934
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:03,360
from our industry JCDC partners.

935
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:06,000
So we realize that small businesses

936
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,730
and small entities don't
have the wherewithal

937
00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:10,590
to create these huge security teams

938
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:12,540
like I had it at Morgan Stanley.

939
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:15,030
And so we're spending a lot of time again,

940
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:17,760
trying to make sure that
the resources are out there

941
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,970
and broken down in a
way that all businesses

942
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:22,020
can avail themselves.

943
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:25,230
And so I would say follow up with us

944
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:27,480
because I'm really
interested in particular

945
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:30,720
in feedback on what we're
doing with small businesses,

946
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:33,060
because the other part of
critical infrastructure

947
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:35,790
is now it's also a blurry line

948
00:38:35,790 --> 00:38:37,680
because just given the interdependencies

949
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,980
on the supply chain, you might
not be the classic member

950
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:42,090
of critical infrastructure,

951
00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:44,280
but you could very well be a vendor

952
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,780
for that critical infrastructure.

953
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:47,130
So what we're really trying to do

954
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:50,190
is have a very large
blanket across the country

955
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:52,440
as we continue to grow our own capability

956
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,513
as America's Cyber Defense Agency.

957
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:57,330
- This gentleman over here.

958
00:38:57,330 --> 00:39:00,600
- [Audience 3] At Black Head
your predecessor, Chris Krebs

959
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:03,780
talked about separating CISA from DHS

960
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:06,808
as a sub cabinet agency.

961
00:39:06,808 --> 00:39:08,255
What do you see the pros and cons

962
00:39:08,255 --> 00:39:12,220
of making a move like that
or a recommendation that.

963
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:13,775
- Repeat the question.

964
00:39:13,775 --> 00:39:14,608
Or I can...

965
00:39:14,608 --> 00:39:16,830
He asked, Chris Krebs and Black Hat

966
00:39:16,830 --> 00:39:18,690
was talking about several different things

967
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:20,070
that could be improvements,

968
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:21,630
and one of the suggestions he's had

969
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:23,937
was potentially separating CISA

970
00:39:23,937 --> 00:39:26,040
and creating its own standalone.

971
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:28,230
And the question is, what are
the pros, what are the cons?

972
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:31,830
- Yeah, I mean, I think
over the last two decades,

973
00:39:31,830 --> 00:39:33,870
when I think about federal cyber security,

974
00:39:33,870 --> 00:39:37,500
there's probably two
big things that happened

975
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,140
that have really helped
to change the landscape

976
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:42,780
in terms of America's capability.

977
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:45,120
One was on the offensive side,

978
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:47,400
and that's when we stood
up US Cyber Command.

979
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:50,400
So that was Paul Nakasone, TJ White

980
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,950
working with Keith Alexander (inaudible),

981
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:55,260
and I think that was a
really important capability

982
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:59,910
that now 10 years on is
making a real difference.

983
00:39:59,910 --> 00:40:01,980
And I think the most important thing

984
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:03,540
that happened in the last five years

985
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:07,233
was the establishment CISA in 2018,

986
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,770
which really proved that a name change

987
00:40:10,770 --> 00:40:12,660
and more money and more authorities

988
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,190
can make a real difference.

989
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:16,470
I still have NPPD.

990
00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:17,730
- NPPD, right?

991
00:40:17,730 --> 00:40:19,740
- There's no infrastructure
in there or even cyber.

992
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:23,460
And so building a cyber and
infrastructure security agency

993
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:25,260
I think was critical.

994
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:27,240
And then following onto that,

995
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:29,340
there were actually organizational changes

996
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:32,130
and more authorities
that came with the NDAA

997
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:34,710
2021 out of the cyber space delirium.

998
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:36,630
One of the things was,

999
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:38,580
it was called the Joint
Cyber Planning Office,

1000
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:41,850
but JCPO sounded like a
disease and a horrible acronym,

1001
00:40:41,850 --> 00:40:44,820
which is why JCDC 'cause
it sounds like ACDC.

1002
00:40:46,425 --> 00:40:48,202
- And who can argue with ACDC?

1003
00:40:48,202 --> 00:40:49,530
- Who can argue with ACDC?

1004
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:51,480
Exactly, right?

1005
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:54,597
So, so many really important
things have happened,

1006
00:40:54,597 --> 00:40:59,490
and my job, Tommy is to
make sure that I am all in

1007
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:03,840
on what we are doing
now and I don't, well...

1008
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,610
- If you split it off,

1009
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:07,920
it's unclear what the
benefits are immediately.

1010
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:11,070
So I can see the turmoil
and the bureaucratic churn

1011
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:12,840
and the fighting for budgets and turf,

1012
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:16,053
and even the concern would be,

1013
00:41:17,107 --> 00:41:19,320
"Oh, well we've got an agency for that.

1014
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,340
They're in charge now.

1015
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:22,770
Oh, I'm OMB, I don't have to do that.

1016
00:41:22,770 --> 00:41:24,300
That's their problem."

1017
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:26,227
And so it's like,

1018
00:41:26,227 --> 00:41:28,380
"Okay, well if we put
up with all that churn,

1019
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:31,170
but there better be a
really big golden egg

1020
00:41:31,170 --> 00:41:32,599
at the end of that."

1021
00:41:32,599 --> 00:41:34,350
And I don't know what
the golden egg would be.

1022
00:41:34,350 --> 00:41:37,500
- I think CISA, I feel like
we're a golden egg, right?

1023
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:40,516
- You're right.
(Black chuckles)

1024
00:41:40,516 --> 00:41:42,780
- And the other thing
is there are benefits

1025
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:47,700
to us being part of DHS in
terms of having that connection

1026
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:50,280
to my friend, Dave Pekoske TSA,

1027
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,960
from an aviation security.

1028
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:54,390
Deanne Criswell from a FEMA perspective.

1029
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:57,030
So they're important connectivity,

1030
00:41:57,030 --> 00:41:58,770
secret service that we've got there

1031
00:41:58,770 --> 00:42:00,720
to have these colleagues around the table

1032
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,520
as fellow components.

1033
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:06,030
But I am laser focused on building

1034
00:42:06,030 --> 00:42:07,740
America's Cyber Defense Agency

1035
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:10,980
to be the agency that America deserves.

1036
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:15,980
And that's no small endeavor
as you know given your role.

1037
00:42:17,010 --> 00:42:17,843
- So, yeah.

1038
00:42:17,843 --> 00:42:20,640
I'm not sure, it's not clear to me

1039
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:21,930
and it sounds like it's not clear to Jen

1040
00:42:21,930 --> 00:42:23,340
what the benefit would be.

1041
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:24,810
I just see economic.

1042
00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:27,240
I mean, I just see bureaucratic churn,

1043
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:30,240
but I like the big thinking.

1044
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:34,023
But it's not the time now, I don't think.

1045
00:42:35,056 --> 00:42:39,250
Gentlemen in the back
and then in the front.

1046
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:40,437
- [Audience 4] So obviously,
you guys are doing a lot

1047
00:42:40,437 --> 00:42:41,673
and we appreciate it.

1048
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:46,740
Historically, government
has always been one way

1049
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:49,290
capable of communicating community.

1050
00:42:49,290 --> 00:42:50,344
It's very...

1051
00:42:50,344 --> 00:42:51,360
- The FBI problem.

1052
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,549
We'll listen, but never talk.

1053
00:42:53,549 --> 00:42:55,830
- [Audience 3] So what
can the community here do

1054
00:42:55,830 --> 00:43:00,684
to help CISA and the nations
pull beyond DMs and Twitter

1055
00:43:00,684 --> 00:43:01,830
(Jen and Black laughing)

1056
00:43:01,830 --> 00:43:04,410
help with the problems that we have?

1057
00:43:04,410 --> 00:43:08,250
- Yeah, first of all, thank
you for asking that question,

1058
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:11,640
'cause I think it's
exactly the right question

1059
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:12,570
we should be asking.

1060
00:43:12,570 --> 00:43:16,230
What can we do to help and
what can you do to help us?

1061
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:20,160
So I think the DMs and
Twitter is emblematic

1062
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:24,480
of what folks probably thought

1063
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,047
about the federal government.

1064
00:43:26,047 --> 00:43:29,310
"Hey, these are just people
kind of making decisions

1065
00:43:29,310 --> 00:43:30,826
and ended up being used."

1066
00:43:30,826 --> 00:43:31,659
- But honestly it's pretty cool.

1067
00:43:31,659 --> 00:43:34,560
Do you DM the head of the
FBI and get a response?

1068
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:35,393
- Yeah.

1069
00:43:35,393 --> 00:43:37,560
- "I noticed an organized
crime group down the block."

1070
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:38,393
He's not...

1071
00:43:38,393 --> 00:43:39,690
- And his DMs probably are not open yet.

1072
00:43:39,690 --> 00:43:41,536
- Yeah, they're not open.

1073
00:43:41,536 --> 00:43:44,220
- But what we have done to build on that

1074
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:48,030
is really leaning into this
new thing that we stood up,

1075
00:43:48,030 --> 00:43:50,160
which is the Joint Cyber
Defense Collaborative,

1076
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:53,400
which is working with
all of the researchers

1077
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,620
that wanna come to the table with us,

1078
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:59,340
working with every company
that wants to be a partner.

1079
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:02,160
I just met with the
ESET guys this morning.

1080
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:07,160
So we are really open for
collaboration, open for business.

1081
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:08,873
And I would just say,

1082
00:44:08,873 --> 00:44:12,480
if you wanna be part of the
collective cyber defense

1083
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,670
of the nation, which
it sounds like you do,

1084
00:44:14,670 --> 00:44:15,716
reach out to us.

1085
00:44:15,716 --> 00:44:18,240
You don't have to just
come to the director,

1086
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:20,730
everybody I think is in fact,

1087
00:44:20,730 --> 00:44:23,910
approaching the collaboration
with the humility,

1088
00:44:23,910 --> 00:44:27,450
the vulnerability, the
transparency and the gratitude.

1089
00:44:27,450 --> 00:44:29,430
And frankly, something
that I think is important

1090
00:44:29,430 --> 00:44:31,860
and that's like assume noble intent,

1091
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:33,813
and treat feedback is a gift.

1092
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,080
I mean, that's like my
operating principles in life.

1093
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:40,353
And as an agency director, you
kinda like you gotta do that.

1094
00:44:42,577 --> 00:44:44,003
- And this gentleman in the front.

1095
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:51,060
- [Jason] I wanna ask,
what is the (inaudible)

1096
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:52,770
for applicants.

1097
00:44:52,770 --> 00:44:53,603
For example,

1098
00:44:53,603 --> 00:44:56,871
I would recruit this weekend
that basically told me

1099
00:44:56,871 --> 00:45:00,501
there are a lot of applicants
that they're going through.

1100
00:45:00,501 --> 00:45:04,710
They don't have that many
people to handle them.

1101
00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:06,570
I know actions speak louder than words

1102
00:45:06,570 --> 00:45:08,818
and I know you're trying hard

1103
00:45:08,818 --> 00:45:09,851
and I've seen some of your talks

1104
00:45:09,851 --> 00:45:12,750
and I knew this couldn't pass
me as person as you cares.

1105
00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:14,413
We seem to care as much as you do,

1106
00:45:14,413 --> 00:45:15,974
but what is CISA doing in action?

1107
00:45:15,974 --> 00:45:16,807
- I do.

1108
00:45:16,807 --> 00:45:18,495
- Jason] It's been like
you mentioned a year,

1109
00:45:18,495 --> 00:45:22,475
so what's the next three
years gonna look like?

1110
00:45:22,475 --> 00:45:23,785
How are you gonna get more

1111
00:45:23,785 --> 00:45:27,060
or how you gonna hire more
security agents, people to help?

1112
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:29,430
I know there are of people
who are really (inaudible)

1113
00:45:29,430 --> 00:45:32,370
and really care about this
country and doing good work

1114
00:45:32,370 --> 00:45:33,480
who are you willing to take

1115
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:36,870
pay cuts to do (inaudible)
work, especially outta college.

1116
00:45:36,870 --> 00:45:38,310
- Right, do you wanna come work for us?

1117
00:45:38,310 --> 00:45:40,238
'Cause, let's talk after this.

1118
00:45:40,238 --> 00:45:41,640
(Black chuckles)

1119
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:42,510
- All right
- [Jason] Sounds good.

1120
00:45:42,510 --> 00:45:43,343
- Yeah.

1121
00:45:43,343 --> 00:45:44,370
No, I know this feels

1122
00:45:44,370 --> 00:45:46,759
like a congressional
hearing actually, but yeah.

1123
00:45:46,759 --> 00:45:49,098
(all laughing)

1124
00:45:49,098 --> 00:45:50,460
That's good.

1125
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:52,290
What's your name?
- [Jason] Jason.

1126
00:45:52,290 --> 00:45:54,450
- Jason, thank you for the question.

1127
00:45:54,450 --> 00:45:58,500
Yeah, man, part of this is
dealing with bureaucracy

1128
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:00,510
and slaying the dragons of bureaucracy.

1129
00:46:00,510 --> 00:46:03,960
I mean, it's a good thing
that we have the CTMS system,

1130
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:06,363
but we just started it
and it's rolling out.

1131
00:46:07,410 --> 00:46:08,243
We are...

1132
00:46:08,243 --> 00:46:09,420
- So you see that's like a year or two?

1133
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:12,720
How long does it take to
digest something like that?

1134
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:14,520
- Well, we're almost to the end of,

1135
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:16,620
I mean it started last November,

1136
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:18,630
and putting a system in place,

1137
00:46:18,630 --> 00:46:20,430
which is not even on the GS scale,

1138
00:46:20,430 --> 00:46:22,170
it's a completely different scale,

1139
00:46:22,170 --> 00:46:23,730
it's a completely different way of hiring,

1140
00:46:23,730 --> 00:46:24,960
completely different way of paying.

1141
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:29,880
So it's a little rocky
getting these things stood up.

1142
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:31,560
But to Jason's point,

1143
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:35,130
we are also reforming
all of our HR processes.

1144
00:46:35,130 --> 00:46:36,621
It's one of the reasons why

1145
00:46:36,621 --> 00:46:38,850
I'm hiring a chief people officer.

1146
00:46:38,850 --> 00:46:40,590
We don't have those in government,

1147
00:46:40,590 --> 00:46:43,320
but I felt like we actually need somebody

1148
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:46,320
to lead our human capital strategy

1149
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:49,410
to ensure that we can build a talent

1150
00:46:49,410 --> 00:46:51,150
like a true talent management system,

1151
00:46:51,150 --> 00:46:53,040
not just get people in the door

1152
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:55,950
but bring people in the
door more at entry level

1153
00:46:55,950 --> 00:46:58,650
because we're a very senior agency.

1154
00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:00,630
And I just think that's, first of all,

1155
00:47:00,630 --> 00:47:03,840
that's a strategic risk to be so senior.

1156
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:06,930
But I also really believe
in creating career paths

1157
00:47:06,930 --> 00:47:11,930
and ladders and we are kind
of starting from not scratch,

1158
00:47:12,870 --> 00:47:14,550
but we are starting from a place

1159
00:47:14,550 --> 00:47:17,430
where I am very aggressively
trying to reshape

1160
00:47:17,430 --> 00:47:18,780
the organization.

1161
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:20,700
So we're bringing in more junior people,

1162
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:22,590
we're doing career ladders,

1163
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:24,660
we're doing mentoring and coaching.

1164
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:28,290
It's part of the gift of
having a startup agency

1165
00:47:28,290 --> 00:47:30,660
and the burden of having a startup agency.

1166
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:35,660
But if you are talented, we
are gonna get you in the door.

1167
00:47:36,030 --> 00:47:37,080
So let's actually...

1168
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:38,880
I'd like to talk after this.

1169
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:39,713
But the other thing I'd say,

1170
00:47:39,713 --> 00:47:41,970
there are things that
you can do to contribute

1171
00:47:41,970 --> 00:47:44,332
to the collective defense of the nation

1172
00:47:44,332 --> 00:47:46,800
while you're waiting
to come join the team.

1173
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:49,290
And so if you talk to Jags,
or you could talk to Silas,

1174
00:47:49,290 --> 00:47:52,890
people like that who have
made a real contribution

1175
00:47:52,890 --> 00:47:54,450
to the products that we're doing,

1176
00:47:54,450 --> 00:47:57,930
the advisories that are
being used around the world,

1177
00:47:57,930 --> 00:48:01,740
I think that's one way you can
contribute in the near term.

1178
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:04,200
But I'm working to solve that problem.

1179
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:07,260
- So you're going for the hire the B team

1180
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:08,820
and turn them into the A team.

1181
00:48:08,820 --> 00:48:11,550
Not try to hire the A team
because that's how one,

1182
00:48:11,550 --> 00:48:12,383
you can't...

1183
00:48:12,383 --> 00:48:13,605
- Yeah, no, I agree with that,

1184
00:48:13,605 --> 00:48:14,438
but I don't like A and B.

1185
00:48:14,438 --> 00:48:15,750
- I mean, I'm using as an example

1186
00:48:15,750 --> 00:48:18,360
of you don't have this law,
I'll just hire the best.

1187
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:19,500
It's like it doesn't work that way.

1188
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:22,620
You can't build a good culture

1189
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:24,570
if you're only trying to get A personality

1190
00:48:24,570 --> 00:48:26,668
general type alphas.

1191
00:48:26,668 --> 00:48:27,607
- No, a hundred percent.

1192
00:48:27,607 --> 00:48:30,120
I mean, you need to,
what I wanna do coming up

1193
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:34,050
is a ton of recruiting at
schools around the country.

1194
00:48:34,050 --> 00:48:35,975
So you can bring in the energy.

1195
00:48:35,975 --> 00:48:36,808
- Well, when was it?

1196
00:48:36,808 --> 00:48:39,510
The NSA has the 20 centers of university.

1197
00:48:39,510 --> 00:48:40,680
- Yes, NSA, DHS.

1198
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:41,513
- Right.
- Yeah.

1199
00:48:41,513 --> 00:48:42,485
- Yeah, so you've gotta...

1200
00:48:42,485 --> 00:48:44,940
- (inaudible) as well, the
centers of academic excellence.

1201
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:46,380
So what I'm trying to do is go visit

1202
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:50,370
all of the minority serving
institutions around the country

1203
00:48:50,370 --> 00:48:52,140
because we're also trying to-

1204
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:54,780
- Increase.
- Aggressively diversify,

1205
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:59,700
which I think is not
just a moral imperative,

1206
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:01,620
but a national security imperative

1207
00:49:01,620 --> 00:49:04,425
when you think about the importance of-

1208
00:49:04,425 --> 00:49:05,550
- Diversity of perspective.

1209
00:49:05,550 --> 00:49:07,440
- Diversity of perspective,
diversity of thought,

1210
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:08,610
that's how we solve problems.

1211
00:49:08,610 --> 00:49:11,940
Whether it's neuro diversity,
diversity of gender identity,

1212
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:14,370
sexual preference, race, national origin,

1213
00:49:14,370 --> 00:49:16,230
all of that equals diversity of thought.

1214
00:49:16,230 --> 00:49:19,980
And that's not where the government...

1215
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:22,230
It's like the administration
is leaning into that,

1216
00:49:22,230 --> 00:49:25,110
but that's not necessarily where
the government started out.

1217
00:49:25,110 --> 00:49:25,943
- Right.

1218
00:49:25,943 --> 00:49:29,070
- So we got work to do, but it's all high

1219
00:49:29,070 --> 00:49:31,538
in my two priorities, people partnerships'

1220
00:49:31,538 --> 00:49:33,090
- 'Cause I'm facing this way,
I'm getting all these people.

1221
00:49:33,090 --> 00:49:34,353
Is anybody over here that has the question

1222
00:49:34,353 --> 00:49:37,320
that I'm just not in my line of sight?

1223
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:39,720
Okay, so I'll go back over here.

1224
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:40,553
Oh, in the middle.

1225
00:49:40,553 --> 00:49:41,386
Middle, okay.

1226
00:49:41,386 --> 00:49:42,780
Middle.

1227
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:43,613
Where are you?

1228
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:46,416
Oh, behind the camera.

1229
00:49:46,416 --> 00:49:49,583
(audience chattering)

1230
00:49:51,049 --> 00:49:53,532
- [Audience 5] Out of
curiosity, has CISA considered

1231
00:49:53,532 --> 00:49:55,301
partnering with high
schools around the nation

1232
00:49:55,301 --> 00:50:00,301
to bring new (inaudible).

1233
00:50:01,428 --> 00:50:05,295
- Has CISA considered
partnering with high schools

1234
00:50:05,295 --> 00:50:07,533
around the nation to-

1235
00:50:07,533 --> 00:50:08,610
- [Audience 5] Advance their computers?

1236
00:50:08,610 --> 00:50:09,660
- Oh, advance computers.

1237
00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:13,233
Sort of like the high
school version of the NCCDC,

1238
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:16,260
the National Collegiate
Cyber Defense Challenge.

1239
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:18,810
There was a high school version of that,

1240
00:50:18,810 --> 00:50:21,060
but maybe a broader engagement.

1241
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:23,250
- We absolutely have.

1242
00:50:23,250 --> 00:50:24,487
These are all part of...
- How many minutes?

1243
00:50:24,487 --> 00:50:26,730
- I've been talking about

1244
00:50:26,730 --> 00:50:28,500
building this talent management system,

1245
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:30,270
we're partnering with high schools.

1246
00:50:30,270 --> 00:50:33,480
We brought in our first
high school intern,

1247
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:37,500
partnering with organizations like NPower,

1248
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:41,070
partnering with Girls Who Code,
partnering with Girl Scouts.

1249
00:50:41,070 --> 00:50:46,070
So we are doing these things
entrepreneurial, which is cool.

1250
00:50:46,230 --> 00:50:48,750
But what I'm trying to do is to ensure

1251
00:50:48,750 --> 00:50:52,410
we can do them
systematically and at scale.

1252
00:50:52,410 --> 00:50:56,040
So if there are great ideas
about how we can partner,

1253
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:58,020
'cause I know there's
probably a lot of great folks

1254
00:50:58,020 --> 00:50:59,883
who are doing things like this,

1255
00:51:01,410 --> 00:51:03,723
please come and work with us on it.

1256
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:06,510
- Okay, I have time for one last question

1257
00:51:06,510 --> 00:51:09,540
and then we've gotta call a wrap on this.

1258
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:13,230
I mean, if you're interested
in policy type questions...

1259
00:51:13,230 --> 00:51:14,063
- Oh, yeah we're doing some afterwards.

1260
00:51:14,063 --> 00:51:16,950
- Yeah, after this, in the policy track,

1261
00:51:16,950 --> 00:51:21,660
we're doing a little policy
meet and greet with some beer.

1262
00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:24,840
And so hopefully, we'll
continue conversations

1263
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:26,160
that you have, not just with Jen,

1264
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:28,560
but other people in the policy community.

1265
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:30,420
Jags will probably be there.

1266
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:32,850
So let's take the last question.

1267
00:51:32,850 --> 00:51:34,083
Gentlemen in the blue.

1268
00:51:34,990 --> 00:51:37,389
- [Audience 6] It's a quite an impression

1269
00:51:37,389 --> 00:51:39,150
(inaudible) just things.

1270
00:51:39,150 --> 00:51:44,104
Some lectures with the disposal
that there is a cyber leak

1271
00:51:44,104 --> 00:51:47,247
in our governments and
it's through (inaudible).

1272
00:51:47,247 --> 00:51:51,893
One, was the danger of that
I'm holding the professor

1273
00:51:51,893 --> 00:51:55,890
title by myself, a very normal scientist

1274
00:51:55,890 --> 00:51:58,589
and she said that she's (inaudible)

1275
00:51:58,589 --> 00:52:02,400
of the power of the data and knowledge,

1276
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:06,279
not of the government,
but of the private sector

1277
00:52:06,279 --> 00:52:09,397
because a lot of data about everybody

1278
00:52:09,397 --> 00:52:11,410
and it relates to
something you said earlier

1279
00:52:11,410 --> 00:52:15,377
about those companies like
Microsoft, for example,

1280
00:52:15,377 --> 00:52:18,990
are not from anybody, not for anyone

1281
00:52:18,990 --> 00:52:22,672
but Microsoft that leaks the clause

1282
00:52:22,672 --> 00:52:27,434
that is not customers,
it just provides them IT.

1283
00:52:27,434 --> 00:52:32,100
But other companies tend
to become competitors

1284
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:33,930
with their own customers.

1285
00:52:33,930 --> 00:52:35,830
You won't see a bank that (inaudible),

1286
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:38,850
you might see it in other companies

1287
00:52:38,850 --> 00:52:41,220
that provide everybody IT.

1288
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:46,220
That's one thing to think about as danger.

1289
00:52:48,981 --> 00:52:53,981
But another lecture was interesting
by professor (inaudible)

1290
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:59,343
from (inaudible) in machine
learning, AI etcetera,

1291
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:03,230
is a professor (inaudible)

1292
00:53:06,390 --> 00:53:08,500
and he said publish some research

1293
00:53:09,588 --> 00:53:14,040
that from the dangers of
AI, so the machine learning.

1294
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:18,570
So it's not just the supervised
machine learning etcetera,

1295
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:21,333
but we have to moderate it afterwards.

1296
00:53:21,333 --> 00:53:24,783
You can't give the machine
learning in general

1297
00:53:24,783 --> 00:53:26,190
a good job.

1298
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:27,559
- Right, so I think make.

1299
00:53:27,559 --> 00:53:29,070
- [Audience 6] Make everybody happy.

1300
00:53:29,070 --> 00:53:29,903
- I think that.

1301
00:53:29,903 --> 00:53:31,983
- [Audience 6] If you wanted
to get everybody happy,

1302
00:53:31,983 --> 00:53:33,318
just make them stupid.

1303
00:53:33,318 --> 00:53:35,982
So stupid, not (inaudible) happy.

1304
00:53:35,982 --> 00:53:36,838
- Well I think the...

1305
00:53:36,838 --> 00:53:37,723
- [Audience 6] Machine learning,

1306
00:53:37,723 --> 00:53:40,080
if you put it into
execution in a big scale

1307
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:44,501
might become like making
everybody stupid, not productive,

1308
00:53:44,501 --> 00:53:48,018
and it's a great venture for the future.

1309
00:53:48,018 --> 00:53:49,860
- I'm convinced that machine learning

1310
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:52,380
is used for all these
algorithmically generated

1311
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:55,950
YouTube videos that are just
pursuing maximum clicks,

1312
00:53:55,950 --> 00:53:58,570
which probably do produce
a high stupidity quotient

1313
00:53:59,850 --> 00:54:04,143
that maybe one day will rise
to a national security threat.

1314
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:07,470
But that sounds like there's
the AI and the quantum,

1315
00:54:07,470 --> 00:54:09,510
there seems to be these
larger, bigger things

1316
00:54:09,510 --> 00:54:11,910
out there on the horizon.

1317
00:54:11,910 --> 00:54:14,970
And sometimes, private
sector is not equipped

1318
00:54:14,970 --> 00:54:15,803
to deal with them.

1319
00:54:15,803 --> 00:54:16,860
And that's where I think again,

1320
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:19,680
role of government plays a role.

1321
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:20,891
- Totally.

1322
00:54:20,891 --> 00:54:22,391
- So you get the last word in.

1323
00:54:23,550 --> 00:54:24,600
- Gratitude.

1324
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:25,560
- Yeah, thank you.

1325
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:26,400
- Thank you for having me,

1326
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:28,200

questions and the time

1327
