1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,730
- The theme that we chose
for the talk this morning

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:06,060
of interview our Fireside
Chat without a fireside

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:09,780
was the shifting nature of cyber power

4
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:11,610
over the last four decades.

5
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:13,320
Small topic.

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,650
When we talk about cyber
power, we often think about

7
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:20,640
or we think we're referring
to offensive operations.

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,890
But I think that we need to focus more

9
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,620
on defensive operations
because they really play

10
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,753
a critical role in national security.

11
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:32,670
It reminds me of an exercise
that Israel did back

12
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:35,280
in 2013 in Tela Aviv University.

13
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,880
Where they did a simulated
exercise involving

14
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,230
an attack that appeared to be coming

15
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:43,980
from Iran and Iran back
Hezbollah and Lebanon,

16
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:46,620
it started with physical
attacks into Tela Aviv,

17
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,930
and then it escalated into cyber attacks.

18
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:52,350
And eventually those cyber
attacks spilled over into the US,

19
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:54,660
took out the stock exchange.

20
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,960
Again, this was a simulation,
took out the stock exchange,

21
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,180
took out air traffic control at JFK,

22
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:04,050
caused two airplanes to
crash and kill 700 people.

23
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:05,370
And there was some confusion about

24
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:09,450
whether Iran was responsible
or whether it was Israel

25
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:13,470
that was responsible in an
effort to pull the US into a war.

26
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:15,180
And there was an Israeli official

27
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:17,239
who said something very interesting

28
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:18,600
after the exercise was over.

29
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,923
He said that it was
very surprising to him,

30
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:26,460
he was shocked to see
how quickly cyber events

31
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,500
could turn dangerously kinetic,

32
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,050
when leaders were ill prepared
to deal with the attacks

33
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:34,740
on cyber domain and were under
pressure to respond quickly.

34
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,960
Without properly defended
critical infrastructure,

35
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,432
he said leaders were left
with little room to maneuver

36
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:42,330
in their decision making
when an attack occurred.

37
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:44,730
When civilian systems were
struck and citizens were killed,

38
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:47,220
leaders were under pressure
to make quick decisions,

39
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:50,040
often based on faulting
incomplete information.

40
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,310
Good defense then was integral...

41
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:55,200
Sorry, good defense then was integral

42
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,610
to good decision making.

43
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:59,550
If systems were resilient
and could fend off attacks,

44
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:02,130
they wouldn't contribute to escalation.

45
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:03,678
So I thought this is a
really good illustration

46
00:02:03,678 --> 00:02:05,970
of the national security responsibility

47
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:07,197
that owners and operators of business

48
00:02:07,197 --> 00:02:09,000
and critical infrastructure have.

49
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,130
It's not just about
keeping a pipeline running

50
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:13,980
and fuel flowing, but about
shoring up what essentially

51
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:17,130
could become the frontline in a conflict.

52
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:19,920
So, Chris, I wanna turn
to you and sort of talk

53
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,250
about what's...

54
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:27,600
In your impression exactly,
how important is defense?

55
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,930
How important is the commercial
sector, the private sector,

56
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:35,820
really a national security and
keeping systems resilient so

57
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:38,730
that government officials
have the time that they need

58
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:42,090
to make decisions when attacks
occur or preventing them?

59
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:43,050
- Yeah, so thanks Kim.

60
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:45,273
Thanks for that excellent introduction.

61
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:47,850
Can everybody hear me?

62
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:49,140
Great.

63
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,690
Thanks for that excellent
introduction to the topic.

64
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:53,400
And thanks for sharing the stage today,

65
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,620
I'm really looking forward
to this discussion.

66
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,180
I know you're supposed
to ask the questions,

67
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,410
I'm gonna provide some answers,

68
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:01,440
but I think I will learn as
much as anyone in the room might

69
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,040
just from the nature of the
discussion we're gonna have.

70
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,160
I think defense is very important
and I'll explain kind of

71
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,200
in my opening remarks why I think that is,

72
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,050
but I'll lead with an
anecdote that I often tell.

73
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:15,480
So for anybody that's heard
me speak before my apologies,

74
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,310
but it's one of my favorite anecdotes,

75
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:21,300
which is the anecdote
about an agency or a CEO,

76
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:24,390
a head of organization who's
walking around the building,

77
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:27,240
happens to bump into a chief
information security officer,

78
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:30,720
not knowing quite what that
is, and says you do cyber?

79
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,850
I've heard all this stuff about cyber.

80
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:34,770
How are we doing in cyber?

81
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:37,693
And the CISO being somewhat
intimidated at that moment says

82
00:03:37,693 --> 00:03:39,780
in a word, good.

83
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,610
And the CEO or the head of agency now

84
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:43,980
being somewhat embolden,
says there might be a bigger,

85
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,180
better, longer story here.

86
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,860
Or maybe I'll tell that
to my leadership team

87
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,350
next time I meet them, says,
how about in two words?

88
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:50,553
Two words, not good.

89
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,760
Now I tell that story not simply

90
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,040
because there's a small
amount of mirth in it,

91
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:59,850
but that's actually the nature
of cyberspace as we speak.

92
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:02,190
There are things about cyberspace we

93
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:04,140
could say are quite good.

94
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:07,020
The use of cyberspace or
the digital infrastructure

95
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:11,220
that underpins everything we
do, is what made it possible

96
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:15,150
for us to imagine, to
design, to fabricate,

97
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:17,340
to kind of generate, to ploy,

98
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:22,200
administer a vaccine in
record time, 12 to 15 months.

99
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:26,730
When here to four with the
standard processes that will rely

100
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:30,390
upon the kind of manual
exchange of information

101
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:33,150
at much slower rates and
with much less intensity,

102
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:34,650
would've taken many years time.

103
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:36,600
That's good, that's hugely good.

104
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,690
And what we do in our individual
lives or business lives,

105
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:42,810
what we do across societies
to generate and take advantage

106
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:45,000
of critical functions, that's good.

107
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,250
But there's a lot that's not good.

108
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:50,250
Across my experience, my
time kind of in this domain,

109
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:53,064
which now borders on 45 years,

110
00:04:53,064 --> 00:04:55,140
I think we've experienced three waves

111
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:57,900
of what I would describe as macro attacks.

112
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:01,680
First wave was focused on
adversaries holding data

113
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,180
and systems at risk.

114
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:05,580
It's what gave rise in
the early days to a focus

115
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:06,935
on the defender's part to,

116
00:05:06,935 --> 00:05:09,570
we have to focus on the confidentiality,

117
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:12,930
the integrity, the availability
of data and systems,

118
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:15,000
the kind of CIA triad.

119
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,500
But we later learned that,

120
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,050
that was merely the kind of opening round.

121
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:20,670
The subsequent waves of attacks,

122
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:22,980
they still held data and system at risk,

123
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:24,420
but they then abstracted that

124
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:26,430
into holding critical functions at risk.

125
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:29,250
And if you're gonna try to
defend critical functions,

126
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:31,432
you have to imagine
how are they generated?

127
00:05:31,432 --> 00:05:35,250
They're not merely simple
abstractions of data and systems,

128
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,920
they generally require
collaboration between disparate

129
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,270
and diverse organizations,

130
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:42,420
often private and public
organizations working together

131
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:44,820
to generate electricity,
to cause it to flow,

132
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,860
to cause it to then have
the right properties

133
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,570
in terms of the underlying system.

134
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:50,190
But if you're gonna defend
a critical function,

135
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:51,870
you have to defend a collaboration,

136
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:54,570
you have to actually
effect a collaboration.

137
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:56,160
But the most recent wave of attacks

138
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,557
that we've experienced were
an attack on confidence.

139
00:05:58,557 --> 00:06:00,480
And kind of put all those
together in thinking

140
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,510
about the Colonial Pipeline
attack that we suffered a year

141
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:08,280
and a half or ago or more,
the Russian criminals got into

142
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:11,610
that system essentially
by holding data at risk.

143
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:15,330
Somebody failed to properly
secure a virtual private network

144
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:18,484
that being exposed, that
attack surface being available,

145
00:06:18,484 --> 00:06:20,910
the kind of integrity availability of

146
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:23,070
that security kind of mechanism not

147
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:25,085
being up to snuff, got it.

148
00:06:25,085 --> 00:06:28,650
They then kind of used that
to hold the kind of delivery

149
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:30,990
of fuel stocks up and down
the Eastern seaboard at risk,

150
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:33,390
so they held the critical
function at risk.

151
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:34,860
But what really then happened

152
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:37,080
in the most important kind
of lesson from that is

153
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:40,830
they then held the confidence
of millions of people at risk.

154
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:43,590
And what they eventually
succeeded in doing was

155
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:45,780
in defeating one, they defeated all.

156
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,730
They defeated tens of
millions of people because

157
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:49,800
of a single person's error.

158
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,390
We need to flip the script,

159
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:53,850
we're not gonna shoot our way out of that.

160
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:57,030
No amount of response, no amount
of a fire drill responding

161
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:59,070
to two and three alarm fires is going

162
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:03,030
to restore the confidence that
people didn't have that day,

163
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:04,770
or to defend the collaboration

164
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:06,510
that we didn't defend that day,

165
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:10,519
or frankly, to defend kind
of in the time necessary,

166
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:13,260
the data and systems that
are underneath all of that.

167
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:15,840
The only reasonable
solution is to get serious

168
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,870
about defense, to make
defense the new offense.

169
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:21,210
Such that if you're an
adversary in this space,

170
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:23,100
you gotta beat at all
of us to beat one of us.

171
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,137
That requires an investment
upfront in resilience

172
00:07:25,137 --> 00:07:27,848
and robustness, not just
in data and systems,

173
00:07:27,848 --> 00:07:29,910
but in roles and responsibilities,

174
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:31,980
that's how you defend collaboration.

175
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:34,980
And the confidence too, so
that you need to make sure

176
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:38,310
that everyone in the system
understands what role they play

177
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:39,780
in the defense of that system so

178
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:42,210
that everyone can participate
in their own defense.

179
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:44,760
But today we teach kids
more about hot stoves

180
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,983
and crossing city streets,

181
00:07:45,983 --> 00:07:48,210
than we teach them about cyberspace.

182
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:49,230
We need to fix that.

183
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:50,670
So do I think defense is important?

184
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:51,600
I absolutely do.

185
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,890
Defense is the new offense.

186
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:53,970
And unless we get serious

187
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:56,580
about defense make the
investments necessary,

188
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,740
we will not put cyber in its proper place,

189
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:02,190
which I would not elevate
to some new exalted status.

190
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,110
I would subordinate cyber such that it

191
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:06,723
then delivers the confidence that we want

192
00:08:06,723 --> 00:08:08,280
in our personal activities,

193
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,519
our business activities
or societal activities.

194
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:12,360
If we're serious about cyber,

195
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,280
we need to then bend it to our purpose.

196
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,040
We need to make sure that we
have confidence that we can do

197
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,470
on digital infrastructure the
things that we want to do.

198
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:20,757
I think it's all about defense.

199
00:08:20,757 --> 00:08:22,765
And any amount of offense must extend

200
00:08:22,765 --> 00:08:25,920
from the defense as opposed
to be imagined as something

201
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,220
that plays out on a
completely separate field.

202
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:31,590
- I'm actually going to
switch positions over here,

203
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:32,940
'cause I'm having trouble hearing you.

204
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:35,340
So I'm just gonna come
down here if that's okay.

205
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:41,483
If you wanted to move
over to get us some space.

206
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,600
With that in mind, I'm wondering,

207
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,800
we talk a lot about defense,

208
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,147
we talk a lot about the need to show up,

209
00:08:49,147 --> 00:08:50,573
to get more serious.

210
00:08:50,573 --> 00:08:52,590
But I'm wondering how we actually do this.

211
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:54,642
Because when we have attacks,

212
00:08:54,642 --> 00:08:58,230
major attacks like Colonial
Pipeline SolarWinds,

213
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:01,290
we usually find out afterwards
that there were ways things

214
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:04,470
that they should have done in
order to prevent or mitigate.

215
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:08,280
I'm thinking about to Operation
Aurora attack back in 2010

216
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:11,130
when the attackers went after
source code repositories,

217
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:13,500
using the source code management systems.

218
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,900
And Dimitri Perivoliotis
said something interesting

219
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,570
at the time that those
systems were wide open

220
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:20,670
because no one had ever really thought

221
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:22,380
that those were the things
that they should be protecting.

222
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:23,370
They were protecting email,

223
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:27,060
they were protecting consumer
information, things like that.

224
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:32,060
And so the crown jewels of
these companies were left open.

225
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:34,620
And something happened similar
to that with SolarWinds,

226
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:39,620
where after the back door was
injected into the software,

227
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:43,260
people were saying that the
source code repositories

228
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,820
were secured, but they hadn't thought

229
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,650
to secure the build environment

230
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:49,230
because no one had injected malware

231
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:51,630
into software during a build before.

232
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:54,990
So I'm wondering how we
fixed this problem of a lack

233
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:57,540
of anticipation or a lack of imagination,

234
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,490
of where hackers are going to go next.

235
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:01,590
And how do we really get companies serious

236
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:06,590
about doing security, when
they often are reactive

237
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,400
rather than proactive?

238
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,130
How do we instill in them the need?

239
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:13,110
And if they may not have budget,

240
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:14,520
they may not have the skill set.

241
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,740
How do we get them up
to speed and the level

242
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:17,820
where we need them to be?

243
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,320
- That's a great question.

244
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,320
So first I would observe
building on what you've said,

245
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,590
that the problem that we face
is not a technology problem,

246
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:28,260
it's a doctrinal problem
or plenary speaking,

247
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,360
it's a roles and responsibilities problem.

248
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,490
We actually don't know who
is accountable for what

249
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:35,820
in delivering the resilience
and robustness that's required

250
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:38,070
in digital infrastructure,
not for its own sake,

251
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,770
but so that it will deliver
personal activities,

252
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:43,260
business activities on and
so forth, as I've mentioned.

253
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:44,490
There are three reconciliations

254
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:46,050
that I think need to take place.

255
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:49,110
And these are primarily
reconciliations in terms

256
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:51,346
of how do we get a new
doctrine on the table?

257
00:10:51,346 --> 00:10:54,300
We wrote an article out of my
office couple of months ago,

258
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,700
we called this a New Social Contract.

259
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:59,760
Leave the term behind which
may or may not be pithy enough,

260
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,960
but it was essentially about

261
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,730
what do we owe each other in this space?

262
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:03,930
How do we get that right?

263
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:06,240
And the three reconciliations
I think are required is first,

264
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,230
there's a vertical reconciliation
in any organization.

265
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:11,280
Just pick one.

266
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,230
Where you have to make
it such that the leaders

267
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:15,270
of that organization who are responsible

268
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:17,070
for determining what the strategy,

269
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:18,510
what the strategic objectives,

270
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:20,820
what the aspirations of
that organization are,

271
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,610
take into account not
just the people resources

272
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:25,770
that they would deploy to bring that off,

273
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:28,620
or the big ideas that they
would deploy to bring that off,

274
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:31,410
but the use of digital
infrastructure to bring that off.

275
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:33,630
'Cause digital infrastructure
is not a commodity

276
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:35,910
in the corner, it's actually
the lifeblood of most

277
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:37,080
of these enterprises.

278
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,660
And so the leaders need
to think I am accountable

279
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:42,360
for figuring out how I'm gonna
use digital infrastructure,

280
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,300
I am accountable for me getting
whatever risks that I take,

281
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,550
I need to make sure that
I have the relationship

282
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:50,460
with the information
technology or the cyber people

283
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,350
that would allow me to
make intelligent choices,

284
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:54,000
but it's not delegable.

285
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
We have to make sure that
the agency heads or the heads

286
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,460
of organizations or boards
are the accountable party

287
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:02,550
for digital infrastructure's use.

288
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:05,190
And as much as any other
critical asset they think about,

289
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:10,170
this is a CapEx issue, not an OpEx issue.

290
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:11,850
You don't think about it
in the formative moments

291
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:14,070
as you're designing
your business strategy,

292
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:15,810
then you're kind of off to the races.

293
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:17,250
But in that vertical reconciliation,

294
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:19,260
we also need to think about
what's the responsibility

295
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:21,270
of the folks who deliver these services.

296
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:25,080
If you ask Align, CISO, or
CIO, or IT or cyber person,

297
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,750
we don't have enough of
them, that's for sure.

298
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,640
But if you ask them what they do,

299
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:32,310
and if they say I defend
critical infrastructure

300
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:35,220
or I defend IT, that's a good answer,

301
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,170
might be a technically correct answer,

302
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:38,370
but it's an insufficient answer.

303
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:40,830
What they need to say is
I defend the business.

304
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:42,000
And I've read the business plan,

305
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,310
I know what we're gonna do
with digital infrastructure.

306
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:46,530
I know we wanna do business
in some interesting odd,

307
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:49,170
maybe dangerous places, and I
know how to actually mitigate

308
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:52,440
the risk and deliver on
the business results.

309
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,120
That's a vertical reconciliation.

310
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,640
There's a horizontal
reconciliation across the system.

311
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,500
Again, I've said that
this should be focused

312
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,560
on capital expenditures not
operational expenditures.

313
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,690
And we need to make sure
that we're no longer going

314
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:06,960
to accept that you can deliver a system

315
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,910
to somebody who's using
it for some purpose,

316
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:10,860
whether it's individual or societal,

317
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,960
and have made no investment

318
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,300
in its inherent resilience and robustness.

319
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:18,360
We need to allocate
responsibility and accountability

320
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:21,180
to the providers, the
suppliers, the integrators,

321
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:23,820
so that they actually
invest what's required

322
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:26,550
to make those systems
inherently resilient and robust.

323
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:27,960
They'll never be secure,

324
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,630
but they need to be more
inherently resilient and robust.

325
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:31,667
We've done that with cars.

326
00:13:31,667 --> 00:13:34,890
You can't buy a car
without an air safety bag,

327
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:39,120
or a safety seatbelt, or some
form of interlock brakes.

328
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,080
We've done that with airplanes.

329
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,250
We've done that with therapeutics.

330
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:45,090
If cyber is as important
as it is, and it is,

331
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:47,190
we need to make sure we
allocate some responsibility

332
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:50,250
across that supply chain,
so that it's not the person

333
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:52,470
who's operating at the
end of that whip chain

334
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:55,230
who's stuck with the system
that can't be defended,

335
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:57,570
and having to wholly defend
themselves against somebody

336
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:00,390
that they actually can't
beat on that given day.

337
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:02,580
And the final reconciliation,

338
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:05,310
if we reallocate that
set of responsibilities,

339
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:07,230
is back to that kind of formative moment

340
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:08,490
when we build anything,

341
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:10,320
how do we build in the
resilience and robustness?

342
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,690
I've mentioned that
more than a time or two,

343
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:14,640
but it's not something we do or do well,

344
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,810
we just have to do that.

345
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:17,280
I think we do those things that we

346
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:20,220
then will have a resilient
and robust infrastructure

347
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:22,770
that then can be defended,
but it won't be secure,

348
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:24,360
it must then be defended.

349
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,237
And on top of that, we must
then have a collective defense.

350
00:14:27,237 --> 00:14:30,060
And we have this kind of
slogan, this catchy phrase

351
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:32,430
that we're kind of parroting
around in our various venues

352
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:35,160
where we say, we propose
that from this day forward,

353
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,260
if you're an aggressor in cyberspace,

354
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:40,080
you have to beat all of
us to beat one of us.

355
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,790
Now, as pithy as that might be,

356
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:43,440
what's really behind that is,

357
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,720
the division of effort
defense doesn't work,

358
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,100
it never has worked.

359
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,360
If you say to someone,

360
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:51,450
you defend your patch
of this shared space,

361
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:52,950
you defend your patch based upon

362
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:55,740
what little you know, what
little authorities you have

363
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:58,200
and what limited
capabilities you might have

364
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:01,530
to perhaps bring some resources
to bear in that defense

365
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:03,300
that's setting you up for disaster.

366
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,710
That's essentially being in a rowboat

367
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:05,970
where there's a hole in the other side.

368
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:08,520
And you say to that person,
holes on your side of the boat,

369
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,480
I'm not gonna help you.

370
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,346
Good luck with your side of the boat.

371
00:15:11,346 --> 00:15:13,140
That simply doesn't work.

372
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:15,600
A collective defense is one where you make

373
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,070
and beat all of us to beat one of us.

374
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:19,122
It's actually beginning
to happen in the Ukraine.

375
00:15:19,122 --> 00:15:21,300
Think about what's
transpiring in the Ukraine.

376
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,400
First, we didn't get enough
credit to the Ukrainians

377
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,100
for being able to defend cyber space.

378
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,690
I and a whole bunch of others

379
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:30,369
would've said early in that contest,

380
00:15:30,369 --> 00:15:34,380
that gross kind of
aberration of offense applied

381
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:36,600
against the Ukraine, that
the Ukrainians would have

382
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,610
a really tough time defending themselves

383
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:40,260
in cyberspace against the Russians

384
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:42,750
'cause the Russians numerically superior,

385
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:45,780
lots of capability, lots
of doctrine on their side.

386
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:48,120
We didn't get enough credit
to the Ukrainian's ability

387
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,440
to defend themselves.

388
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,050
Their interior lines,
meaning that they essentially

389
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:56,202
have back to back kind of
defenders on all sides facing out,

390
00:15:56,202 --> 00:15:58,560
their ability to do the preparatory work

391
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,020
to become reasonably resilient and robust,

392
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:03,870
and their ability to kind
confidence that their suppliers

393
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:06,300
are providing inherent
resilience and robustness,

394
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,190
and will deliver under
the terms of service

395
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:10,260
that resilience and robustness has made

396
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:13,110
for a collective defense
that's really hard to be.

397
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:14,850
Not impossible but hard to be.

398
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:17,220
When Microsoft essentially delivers

399
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,780
under their terms of service,

400
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:21,570
inherent resilience and
robustness, and Cisco and ISSET

401
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:24,660
and some number of others,
that's a collective defense

402
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:25,770
that is different than what we

403
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:28,050
would've done 5, 10, 15 years ago.

404
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:29,640
I think that's what was required.

405
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:32,520
I just add one further thing,
which is I had the chance here

406
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:35,520
to walk around to the
various kind of activities,

407
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,650
the villages that were kind of set up,

408
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:40,860
and what I found remarkable
was not just the audacity

409
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:43,733
of the technology and the
talent in those various rooms,

410
00:16:43,733 --> 00:16:46,110
but the applied purpose to which

411
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:48,480
that's being kind of affected.

412
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,340
What people were actually considering is

413
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:52,860
how do I do something that's
technologically interesting,

414
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:55,710
stimulating new novel for some purpose

415
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:57,998
that would then aid and vet
the increase of resilience

416
00:16:57,998 --> 00:17:00,540
in an automobile or the
increase of resilience

417
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:03,090
in a piece of critical infrastructure?

418
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:05,640
Kind of folks who actually
are sharing the responsibility

419
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,410
delivering critical function side by side

420
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:09,870
in those various venues, that's very cool.

421
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:11,850
And that muscle memory
would be really useful,

422
00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:14,370
necessary for us as we
defend these assets out

423
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:15,693
in the larger society.

424
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,080
- I love that you brought up
Ukraine 'cause I do wanted

425
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,490
to ask you a couple questions about that,

426
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:21,840
But I'll come back to that later.

427
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,000
Because you started to
talk about supply chain

428
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,700
and the responsibility of software vendors

429
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:30,930
and equipment makers here
to put out secure systems

430
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:32,490
to the market.

431
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:34,260
But there's another side
of the supply chain issue.

432
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:36,420
And of course that is
the foreign manufacturing

433
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:38,880
of devices and equipment.

434
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:43,880
And we're talking about a
situation obviously with chips

435
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:48,660
from China and manufacturing
in China that was created

436
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,130
because for economic purposes,

437
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:52,140
it was a lot cheaper to have
chips manufactured there.

438
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:52,973
It's a lot cheaper

439
00:17:52,973 --> 00:17:55,020
to have motherboards
manufactured in Beijing.

440
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:56,783
How do we...

441
00:17:56,783 --> 00:17:59,400
The government has gone
in on an aggressive push

442
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,880
to get Huawei systems out of telecoms.

443
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:07,170
But how do we realistically,
I guess wean ourselves

444
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:08,940
from the reliance on systems

445
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:12,960
that we now recognize maybe ubiquitous

446
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,550
in critical infrastructure,

447
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:17,160
and we need to walk back that reliance.

448
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,450
How does that happened?

449
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:19,410
- In two ways.

450
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:21,750
One, and there might be
some other components,

451
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,280
but I'll just kind of broadly point out

452
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,050
two kind of dynamics.

453
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:27,870
One is you need to have
an honest kind of eyes

454
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:30,300
wide open recognition
of what the true cost is

455
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:32,820
and relying on kind of foreign produced

456
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,590
critical infrastructure.

457
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:37,080
If it comes from a country
like China or Russia

458
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,840
where the legal system
is not one that deals

459
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,450
with privacy interest,
proprietary interest,

460
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:44,310
in a manner that you're comfortable with.

461
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:46,812
The true cost of that is not
to be measured in the dollars

462
00:18:46,812 --> 00:18:48,660
or the Yuan that you spend,

463
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:51,930
is to be measured in the
opportunity costs you have,

464
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:53,520
about the lack of confidence you have,

465
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,100
and how your information's
gonna be protected,

466
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,020
or the competitive disadvantage you're at

467
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:00,450
when that information is
then used for purposes

468
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:02,280
that are then gonna be
used directly against you

469
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,800
in an economic or in
national security context.

470
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,050
So we need to be serious in understanding

471
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:08,280
what the true cost is.

472
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:11,310
Having said that, just
saying no is not the answer.

473
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:13,470
We can't just rip and replace this stuff

474
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:15,660
if we don't have anything
to replace it with.

475
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,640
And so we need to
actually fill that vacuum

476
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,880
with material equipment systems,

477
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,790
systems of systems that
we do have confidence in.

478
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:25,680
We might not onshore all of that,

479
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,690
but we need to make sure
that we reassure that

480
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:29,490
to places where we have confidence.

481
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:31,830
Both in the manufacturing
and the resilience

482
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:33,180
that's invested in that,

483
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:35,880
and in the legal systems
that essentially govern that.

484
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:39,030
The administration, the
Biden, Harris administration,

485
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:43,080
just signed into law, the
kind of the legislature just,

486
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:46,380
I think magnificently kind
of generated something called

487
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:48,210
the CHIPS and Science Act.

488
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:51,360
52 billion that we're now about to invest

489
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,180
and essentially filling
that vacuum to ensure that

490
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:56,430
if chips are a fundamental commodity

491
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:59,280
in the economic security,
the national security

492
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,250
of everything that we do and it's a matter

493
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:03,840
of extension important to all

494
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,280
of our individual activities as well.

495
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,980
You can't buy a car if we can't buy chips.

496
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,210
We need to actually make it such

497
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:11,370
that we can build those again here.

498
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:13,800
Good news is as we retain
in the United States

499
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,050
and like-minded nations, the
Netherlands comes quickly

500
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:20,010
to mind the ability to
innovate that technology.

501
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:22,230
But we do not have the
ability to manufacture,

502
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:24,120
and we need to actually make
the investments required

503
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:24,953
to do that.

504
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,950
- To touch on the Ukraine issue,

505
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:30,780
and you mentioned Microsoft,

506
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:33,960
we have had a lot of reports
on a lot of public declarations

507
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,220
from companies like
Microsoft, Cisco, Mandiant,

508
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:40,050
about their assistance
given to Ukraine prior

509
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:43,380
to the invasion in the midst
of the invasion and since then.

510
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:46,110
And they've talked about
defending government systems

511
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:48,990
in some cases, moving data out of Ukraine.

512
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:53,990
I'm wondering if this puts the
private companies in any kind

513
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,643
of risk of repercussions.

514
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:01,620
We don't know the full limits
of what they're engaging in.

515
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:02,940
Presumably it's just defense.

516
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,920
But if you're talking about
defending military systems

517
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,070
and government systems,

518
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:09,660
and what is the calculus that is made

519
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,130
by these private companies?

520
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:13,650
Is there a potential for a
risk against their own people,

521
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:17,280
their own data centers,
their own operations,

522
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,140
that they might be the target

523
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:21,810
of some kind of repercussive activity?

524
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:22,978
- Well, as I see it,

525
00:21:22,978 --> 00:21:25,290
I can't tell you how
Vladimir Putin sees it.

526
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:27,660
But as I see it, shouldn't be.

527
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:31,140
I gotta notice two weeks
ago from the manufacturer

528
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:33,810
of my car saying that they
had found a safety defect

529
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:35,610
in the car and they wanted
me to bring the car back

530
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:38,430
in so they could fix it.
It's a hugely good thing.

531
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:40,620
I think that, that actually
is a necessary part

532
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:43,890
of their terms of service,
because that car needs to be safe

533
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:45,720
for me to drive it from
point a to point B.

534
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,980
I expect it to be safe.

535
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:49,050
I expect them to then vouch safe

536
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:50,910
across the life of that car,

537
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:52,860
or at least the warranty
of that car for the safety,

538
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:54,480
the resilience, the robustness of it.

539
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,410
That's what I see Cisco, and
Microsoft, and ESET and others.

540
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:00,990
That's an illustrative list,
not an exhaustive list.

541
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:03,120
Doing for the products and
services that to deliver

542
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,640
to customers in the Ukraine or elsewhere.

543
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,470
If they find a problem in that,

544
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:10,080
whether that problem is
posed kind of in the form

545
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,270
of an inherent vulnerability
in the software,

546
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:14,370
maybe it's a zero day
that's been discovered,

547
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:16,470
or maybe it's the manner
in which some adversary

548
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:19,140
might take advantage of that,
it's the adversary's doctrine,

549
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:22,350
but they can shore that up
and make it more defensible.

550
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:24,900
It is I think an appropriate
act of under the terms

551
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,400
of service defense.

552
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,360
It's not provocative, it's
not imposing in any particular

553
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:33,420
effect on a transgressor in that space.

554
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:35,220
If it is imposing a cost on Russia,

555
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:37,050
it's only because it's
more costly for Russia

556
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:39,630
to do something that's
already inappropriate.

557
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:43,710
Attacking kind of honest,
legitimate users of those services

558
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:44,820
across the world.

559
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:46,350
So I think it's entirely appropriate.

560
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:49,410
And I think it's high time
that if you're a provider

561
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:52,440
of a commodity service,
that you think about what's

562
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,870
the inherent resilience
and robustness that I

563
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:57,840
should deliver hand in glove with that?

564
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,760
If that's the only place
where that can be done

565
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,670
at scope and scale, then that
is the most appropriate place

566
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:03,503
to do it.

567
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:07,680
- So the US sent other
nations have been talking

568
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,960
for a long time about setting cyber norms.

569
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:13,110
And they've been having some
trouble coming to agreement.

570
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:14,130
There's some basic agreements

571
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:16,803
about not attacking civilian
critical infrastructure,

572
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:20,880
but with regarding to get
into detail about a lot

573
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,030
of other norms, there's some
difficulty because nations

574
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:25,950
are reluctance to give
up some capabilities they

575
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:27,330
might want to use.

576
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:30,090
How do we arrive at
norms when countries want

577
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:31,680
to preserve options?

578
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:34,200
And how do you set norms
when you can't be certain,

579
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,510
for example, that
subsequent administration,

580
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:40,950
subsequent governments
might not adhere to them?

581
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:44,500
- Actually, I see that there's
more agreement in norms

582
00:23:45,978 --> 00:23:47,670
than that might suggest.

583
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:50,190
So the global group of experts
from the United Nations,

584
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:51,720
and I think I saw Chris Painter here.

585
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:54,570
So kudos to Chris and his
colleagues were doing this.

586
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:58,230
Delivered in about 2015 a
set of norms that the US

587
00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:00,630
and of great many other nations affirmed.

588
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:04,530
And the that were defined

589
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:07,650
then remain the norms
United States subscribes to

590
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:10,110
in terms of what we would do, should do,

591
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:11,733
will do in peace time.

592
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:14,790
I think those norms have had an effect,

593
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:16,620
not simply in giving people the sense as

594
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:17,970
to what's appropriate and inappropriate,

595
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:20,457
but it is unified and brought
together like-minded nations.

596
00:24:20,457 --> 00:24:22,590
And so they have an effect more

597
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:24,750
than simply telling potential adversaries

598
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:27,210
what's on or off limits,

599
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:30,150
but rather to find and
unify like-minded nations

600
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:32,790
so that they increasingly
create common cause

601
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:35,610
and defenses that are
appropriate of those norms.

602
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:37,500
60 nations gathered in the White House

603
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,330
about three months ago to sign something

604
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:41,940
called a Declaration for the Internet.

605
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:44,280
My bet is those 60
nations would find a lot

606
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,530
of other things they couldn't agree about,

607
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:47,610
but they agreed on that.

608
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:50,790
They agreed that the principles
of a free and open internet

609
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:53,610
that serves the needs
of respected societies,

610
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:55,920
was important enough that
they would sign up to that.

611
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,900
Now the hard work before
us is how do we actually

612
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:00,840
then implement that in
the practices principles

613
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,760
and the collective defenses
that we would mount

614
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,810
on top of that?

615
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:06,000
I do think that it's problematic,

616
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,850
because there are some
things that look like they're

617
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:11,040
on the edge and they're
not clean and crisp

618
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,810
in terms of absolute boundaries,

619
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:14,790
but the norms generally are I think,

620
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:17,733
reasonably well defined and
generally well subscribed to.

621
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:20,220
- So speaking about norms

622
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:22,050
and we were talking a bit about Ukraine,

623
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:24,960
I wanted to sort of pivot to the activism

624
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,160
that we're seeing out of Ukraine.

625
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,650
You talked about the
resilience and the defense,

626
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:31,320
and there's this other side
that the Ukraine is engaging

627
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:35,670
in with regard to the IT
army and eliciting assistance

628
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:38,580
from volunteers to launch cyber attacks

629
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,230
against Russian infrastructure.

630
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:44,640
So Western countries have been very silent

631
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,762
about this activity.

632
00:25:45,762 --> 00:25:49,650
And I wanted to ask if we
are setting a precedent

633
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:52,470
for these kinds of operations.

634
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:54,930
Obviously there there's
extenuating circumstances here,

635
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:56,493
this is the time of war.

636
00:25:57,540 --> 00:26:01,770
But there are concerns
that once you've engaged

637
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:04,020
this kind of force, this
kind of volunteer force,

638
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:07,590
you can't really put it back in the well,

639
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:12,590
especially if you're engaging
actors like anonymous.

640
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:17,160
And so I'm curious what you would say

641
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:20,400
and what government's
positions should be on this.

642
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,610
Particularly with regard to Ukraine,

643
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:28,260
it hasn't been just sort
of anonymous volunteers.

644
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:31,080
They're a case of two
companies based in Estonia,

645
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:35,220
who one built a DDoS attacks tool

646
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:38,370
for the IT army and others to use.

647
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:40,140
They're usually as a security company,

648
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,360
usually involved in defensive activities.

649
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:46,050
And then the other one launched
a bug bounty program calling

650
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:48,690
for vulnerabilities and
rushing critical infrastructure

651
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:51,930
that they plan to hand off
to Ukrainian intelligence

652
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:54,390
and cyber operators to
attack those systems.

653
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:56,310
So where should we be?

654
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:59,700
Should we be concerned that
this is setting a precedent

655
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,380
that we won't be able to control?

656
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:03,600
- Yeah, I think the law, at
least for the United States

657
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,433
is pretty clear here.

658
00:27:04,433 --> 00:27:06,720
The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986,

659
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:11,220
makes it clear that there
are limits for individuals

660
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:14,130
who operate using their
own authority in terms

661
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:15,330
of what they're allowed to do.

662
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:18,450
And the United States government,
despite the fact that,

663
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:20,973
that law is got some kind of age on it,

664
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:24,240
still of the opinion
that it will not condone

665
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:28,710
nor will it support individuals
violating the standing law.

666
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:30,332
So I think that's very clear.

667
00:27:30,332 --> 00:27:34,320
That being said, there's a way
to take this enormous talent

668
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,980
and it's represented in this
room and outside these halls.

669
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:39,300
So there's a way to take that talent.

670
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:43,050
And within the kind of rule of
law apply that appropriately

671
00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:46,590
to help identify what flaws
might exist in our architecture,

672
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:49,440
so that we can then through
bug bounty programs or red team

673
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:53,220
or white teams find
and kind of patch those

674
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:56,280
to better understand how we can
affect a collective defense.

675
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:58,599
That talent is hugely valuable and can,

676
00:27:58,599 --> 00:28:01,620
and should be applied under the
rule of law for the purposes

677
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:02,760
that I've described earlier

678
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,560
and what a defense might look like.

679
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:07,620
But operating outside
the bounds of that law,

680
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:11,160
remains kind of unlawful
for the United States.

681
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,890
And I don't think there's
any question about that.

682
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:17,070
- And what about just
as an add on to that,

683
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:19,290
is sort of the activity that
we've been seeing in Iran.

684
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:22,950
We've seen sort of a tit for
tap between Iran and Israel.

685
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:26,370
And in Iran we've seen
attackers go after gas pumps,

686
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:28,170
4,000 gas pumps in the country.

687
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:32,190
And then also we had an
incident recently unconfirmed

688
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:36,150
regarding a steel mill
equipment and fire there.

689
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:37,830
And I'm just wondering, again,

690
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:40,650
we're talking about setting
norms internationally.

691
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:42,360
There were 20 nations in 2015,

692
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:46,680
as you pointed out that sort
of set some basic norms.

693
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:50,730
And yet there are still actors
that we're going to see,

694
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:53,190
obviously, actions that
are just reaching up

695
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:56,070
to the threshold and not
necessarily going over.

696
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:58,140
But in the case of
what's happening in Iran,

697
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:00,447
it is attacking critical infrastructure.

698
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:05,010
And so I'm wondering how
are we going to, I guess,

699
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:08,013
have some kind of control or
set some kind of boundaries

700
00:29:08,013 --> 00:29:13,013
or express what we consider
the limits of activity?

701
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,910
Especially if it's,

702
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:17,280
I understand sort of the
complications when it comes

703
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:20,670
to let's say a country and adversary

704
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:25,410
where we might not be
opposed to the activity.

705
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:28,380
If you've got Russia, who's
a clear aggressor there.

706
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:31,323
If you've got Iran who
may be aggressing as well.

707
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:35,910
How do we grapple with
these kinds of activities

708
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:37,320
that are going to go after
critical infrastructure?

709
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:39,220
What we consider outside of the norms?

710
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:45,210
- Well, we affirm the norms,
which I think stand to this day

711
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:47,910
as a reasonable articulation of

712
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:51,270
what we believe are the
activities that are appropriate

713
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:55,560
or inappropriate in peace time
as defined by those norms.

714
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,960
And Iran doesn't check with us,

715
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,060
as they then kind of violate those norms.

716
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:02,520
So we don't take responsibility
for their actions,

717
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:05,940
but we still affirm the
norms and urge anyone

718
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:09,960
who would stand with us and
affect a collective defense

719
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:12,870
to affirm those norms, to
sign the declaration for free

720
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:13,920
and open internet,

721
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:16,260
so that we can then combine
our collective talents,

722
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:19,200
authorities, capabilities,
to achieve something

723
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,420
that we couldn't do alone.

724
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:23,250
So I don't think that those are

725
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:24,450
in conflict with one another.

726
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:26,220
Affirming those norms and observing

727
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:28,560
that there are in fact kind of entities,

728
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,810
nation states in the
world who violate them.

729
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:32,730
It does not challenge the norms,

730
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:34,800
it might kind of make
it such that they're not

731
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,210
being perfectly implemented,

732
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:37,810
but the norms stand as they are.

733
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:41,970
- Just a decade ago, there
were only about a handful

734
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:46,165
of nations that had offensive
cyber operations capabilities.

735
00:30:46,165 --> 00:30:49,680
US, Russia, China, UK,
Israel, just by my counting.

736
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:53,670
And since then, we've added
a lot of other countries,

737
00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:56,880
Iran, North Korea, more
than a dozen others

738
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,170
that I can think of.

739
00:30:58,170 --> 00:31:00,240
Clearly all aren't equal
in their sophistication

740
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,240
and capabilities in
terms of causing damage,

741
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,800
but even less sophisticated actors

742
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,540
can cause real disruption.

743
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:10,230
So I'm wondering is deterrence
an international loss

744
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:13,327
efficient to keep these
new powers in check

745
00:31:13,327 --> 00:31:15,431
when some parties may not be deterred

746
00:31:15,431 --> 00:31:17,340
in the way that traditional nation states

747
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:20,760
might be deterred regarding
politics and things like that.

748
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:23,940
How do you curb hack and leak operations?

749
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:26,850
Operations that don't
yet make the threshold

750
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:29,160
of being illegal?

751
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,200
How do we control what feels like

752
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,370
it's getting out of control?

753
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:33,203
- That's a good question.

754
00:31:33,203 --> 00:31:36,330
I would offer kind of two kind of framings

755
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:38,190
before I come to main point.

756
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:40,407
First, as you've asked the question

757
00:31:40,407 --> 00:31:43,203
and I often kind of have
this discussion as well,

758
00:31:44,130 --> 00:31:46,923
there aren't quite a lot of
nation states in the world

759
00:31:46,923 --> 00:31:49,530
that are capable of doing offense.

760
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:51,300
And it then leads you to consider

761
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:54,090
whether one is more capable
of offense than another.

762
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:55,350
And so you all of a sudden get

763
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:57,540
into this kind of mental discussion,

764
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:00,780
this mental consideration
of who's best at offense?

765
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:03,090
Is party A or party B best at offense?

766
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:05,280
And that's really however
titillating that might be,

767
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:08,010
not the right kind of
compare and contrast.

768
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:11,370
We need to think about whether
our defense is up to the task

769
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:14,070
of essentially holding at any offense.

770
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:15,810
It's a comparison of defense to offense

771
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:17,280
that we ought to then start with.

772
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,930
And so while there are quite a few more

773
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:21,060
that would enter into offense,

774
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:23,970
whether that's in peace
time or kind of conflict,

775
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:25,647
kind of lead that to their judgements,

776
00:32:25,647 --> 00:32:29,910
I'm really focused on how do
I get the defense up to speed.

777
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:32,280
And I think in that regard,
you mentioned deterrence

778
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,560
as an important piece of that.

779
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,870
I think the deterrence, if
you think your way through,

780
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:40,080
is really about changing the
decision calculus of somebody

781
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:44,070
that would do something to your
detriment before they do it.

782
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:45,750
And I don't think that deterrence

783
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:50,750
in cyberspace is impossible,
I think it's hard.

784
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,700
I think as some have
noted that in cyberspace

785
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:55,470
the cost of being so low,

786
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:57,660
you'll never completely remove mischief,

787
00:32:57,660 --> 00:33:00,150
but you can in fact kind of challenge it.

788
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:01,890
And I think you do that in the ways

789
00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:04,290
that traditionally deterrence
has been thought of,

790
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:06,150
first you make yourself hard to target.

791
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:09,960
Invest in the defense,
remember it's CapEx not OpEx.

792
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:13,050
Such that you're sufficiently
resilient and robust,

793
00:33:13,050 --> 00:33:14,850
you might cause someone to reconsider

794
00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:16,380
whether they're gonna have a go at you

795
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:18,300
because it's simply
expensive on their part.

796
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:22,380
Two, mount a stout defense
on top of what then results,

797
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:24,060
so that you can catch them in the bargain

798
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:25,950
and engage, interdict and evict that

799
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:27,810
at the earliest possible moment.

800
00:33:27,810 --> 00:33:30,270
Again, that should affect
their decision calculus.

801
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:32,520
But if it doesn't, you're at
least kind of in the bargain

802
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,890
of holding your own against that offense.

803
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:37,020
Three, impose costs on them,

804
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:38,910
but not just cyber on cyber cost.

805
00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:40,260
Again, we're not gonna
shoot our way out of

806
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:41,850
this using cyber alone,

807
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:45,600
but imposed financial cost,
kind of legal remedies,

808
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,940
diplomatic remedies, sometimes
public shaming works.

809
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:51,270
But all of those kind of
cost impose that on them

810
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:53,460
to change their decision calculus.

811
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:55,380
Now, not in a place to know

812
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:58,950
what Russia's decision calculus
is vis avis the Ukraine,

813
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:01,920
but is an observable fact
that they have not attacked

814
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:06,900
the west in and through
cyberspace through this campaign.

815
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:09,900
That can be described as deterrence,

816
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:12,150
whether that's deterrence by essentially,

817
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:13,710
they just haven't thought about it,

818
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:16,950
or deterrents on the basis
of a conscious choice,

819
00:34:16,950 --> 00:34:18,480
it seems to be working.

820
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,240
It seems to be that they've
not attacked us in ways

821
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:25,230
that we imagine they might,
kind short of the use of force

822
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:27,330
as they have complained mightily

823
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:29,490
that we're inappropriately assisting

824
00:34:29,490 --> 00:34:31,560
the defense of the Ukraine.

825
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:34,620
So that seems to be at
the moment something

826
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:36,690
that is working out better than we

827
00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:38,910
might have imagined going into that.

828
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:42,660
That might be deterrence of
a proactive affirmative kind,

829
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:46,920
but in any regard, their
decision calculus is where I

830
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:49,650
would want it to be of,
they shouldn't attack us,

831
00:34:49,650 --> 00:34:51,510
if they do, we made it clear that we will

832
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:53,184
defend ourselves stoutly.

833
00:34:53,184 --> 00:34:55,290
And therefore I think deterrence can work,

834
00:34:55,290 --> 00:34:58,053
and we've got an example in
hand where thus far it has.

835
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:01,140
- I have one last question.

836
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:03,060
We might have time for audience questions.

837
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:04,650
So if you think of something,

838
00:35:04,650 --> 00:35:07,290
we might have time for one question.

839
00:35:07,290 --> 00:35:10,230
My last question is regarding
how government intelligence

840
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:14,520
agencies have been
recruiting talent internally

841
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,480
for a long time.

842
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:19,230
And we're seeing particularly
interesting developments

843
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:23,670
in China with the Ministry
of State Security,

844
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:25,260
which is the civilian intelligence agency.

845
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:27,330
Where they're setting up front companies,

846
00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:30,727
commercial entities, sometimes
legitimate security companies

847
00:35:30,727 --> 00:35:34,680
that have this side business
of doing hacking operations,

848
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:37,710
sometimes economic espionage
for the government.

849
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:41,280
And also they're hiring university
students and translators

850
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:46,200
who may be witting, may be
unwittingly contributing

851
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,730
to the operations.

852
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:51,030
So what are some of the ways
that governments, I guess,

853
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:52,560
are leveraging this talent,

854
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:55,560
and how does it complicate
the US government response

855
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:58,350
to this when we're talking about civilians

856
00:35:58,350 --> 00:36:00,360
that may may know what they're doing

857
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,530
and may not know what they're doing?

858
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:03,900
- Well, first we need to be crystal clear.

859
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:05,820
In the United States
and like minded nations

860
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:08,160
about what authorities we bring to bear,

861
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,200
and who's then kind of authorized

862
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,480
to bring those authorities to bear.

863
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,310
So private citizen.

864
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:15,240
Again, I've talked about the

865
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,880
Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986.

866
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,530
It's not authorized to engage

867
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:24,333
in kind of unilaterally kind
of aimed hacking activities.

868
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,460
White hacking testing that's
done with the consent,

869
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:31,710
penetration testing, kind of bug bounties,

870
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:32,910
all of that's appropriate.

871
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:36,420
But we can actually kind
of cheat our way to success

872
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:37,680
in filling these jobs,

873
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,030
we need to do it the old fashioned way,

874
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,290
which is let's be crystal clear

875
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:41,790
about what the authorities are.

876
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:44,190
That being said, the question
that's really on the table is

877
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:45,900
how do we fill these jobs?

878
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:48,000
At the moment about one third of the jobs,

879
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,160
anywhere you look, inside
the government or outside

880
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,530
of the government that
have the word cyber IT

881
00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:53,730
in them are empty.

882
00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:54,960
We're not filling those jobs.

883
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,580
The good news is, we're
continue to fill them

884
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:57,900
at the two thirds rate.

885
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:01,080
The bad news is the denominators
running away from us.

886
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:03,930
And so we need to appeal to the
broadest possible population

887
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:06,750
to essentially kind of
offer them the opportunity

888
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:08,970
to fill those jobs and then assist them

889
00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:11,190
in the transition to those jobs.

890
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:13,500
But we also need to make
sure that other disciplines,

891
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,270
whether they're lawyers, or CEOs,

892
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:17,640
or tradesmen who need to
know more about cyber,

893
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,290
that they have the skills necessary

894
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:21,270
to make intelligent choices about the use

895
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:23,640
of digital infrastructure
in this brave new world.

896
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,920
And that every citizen,
every person in cyberspace

897
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,082
knows enough to make
full use of cyberspace.

898
00:37:28,082 --> 00:37:30,300
They don't all need to
be Python programmers,

899
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:32,010
but they need to know more than they do.

900
00:37:32,010 --> 00:37:35,490
We need to solve all of that
by mobilizing a strategy

901
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:37,110
that says, how do we educate?

902
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:38,070
How do we train?

903
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:40,830
How do we make perhaps
the awareness possible

904
00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:42,570
so that everyone's participating

905
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:45,540
in the defense of this realm,
not just the precious few.

906
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:46,980
But we'll do it the old fashioned ways.

907
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:48,420
We'll do it under the rule of law,

908
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:51,000
and we'll do it in the appropriate
way that everybody knows

909
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,020
what role they're playing

910
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:54,060
and they know why they're authorized

911
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:55,830
or why they're expected to participate

912
00:37:55,830 --> 00:37:56,802
in that particular role.

913
00:37:56,802 --> 00:37:59,040
What the Chinese do shouldn't be something

914
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,800
that kind of teases us or
tempts us to do it kind of

915
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:06,033
in a way that confuses or
perhaps challenges our values.

916
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:09,930
- So I wanted to open up for
questions from the audience.

917
00:38:09,930 --> 00:38:12,300
We have time for maybe one or two.

918
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:14,400
Do we have a microphone?

919
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,233
We don't.

920
00:38:15,233 --> 00:38:17,430
Okay, so I'm gonna have
to repeat the question.

921
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:19,130
Let's take that question up there.

922
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:23,453
Speak loud.

923
00:38:23,453 --> 00:38:26,280
- [Audience] You raise
prospect, there was a great deal

924
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:31,280
of galvanization from
state industry, et cetera

925
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:33,990
in defense in to Ukraine.

926
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:36,240
I wanted to give a sense of how replicable

927
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:39,060
that might be in other geographic areas

928
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:41,635
where there's much less of that historical

929
00:38:41,635 --> 00:38:45,090
kinda transatlantic unity kinda built

930
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:46,982
into those relationships.

931
00:38:46,982 --> 00:38:49,530
- Yeah, so I'll rephrase
- Do you wanna repeat?

932
00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:51,630
- if I cheat on this, you stop me.

933
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:54,600
I think the question is
the Ukrainian situation

934
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:57,330
has galvanized a collective defense.

935
00:38:57,330 --> 00:38:59,670
And I think the question
really is is that an anomaly,

936
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:02,520
that's a one time event, or
whether that's replicable.

937
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:05,610
Can we actually achieve
that on a continuous basis?

938
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:08,070
I think it is replicable.

939
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:11,026
I get up every morning
trying to make it replicable.

940
00:39:11,026 --> 00:39:13,770
Such that what I pitch is,

941
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:15,900
Hey, why don't all of us
contribute to the defense

942
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,130
of each of us or vice versa,

943
00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:19,500
each of us contribute to
the defense of all of us.

944
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,570
That colonial pipeline
business where the defeat

945
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:23,600
of one person held at risk the confidence

946
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:27,120
of 10 million people, why don't
we flip that script and say,

947
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:30,597
all of us can make it such
that we defend each of us.

948
00:39:30,597 --> 00:39:33,300
And if we do that as a matter of course,

949
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:36,447
the way we've done that for
highway transportation systems,

950
00:39:36,447 --> 00:39:37,980
the way we've done that for airplanes,

951
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:38,910
the way we've done that for just

952
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:41,430
about every other critical
asset in our country,

953
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:43,860
then we all know what role
we play in the defense

954
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:47,340
of something that we hold as
a common good, a shared asset.

955
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:49,440
I think that's the way to play that.

956
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,900
So it doesn't require
some electrifying moment.

957
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:54,390
That's kind of urban
transgression of the Russians

958
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:57,090
into the Ukraine, to get us
to believe that we've got

959
00:39:57,090 --> 00:39:58,950
some common resource here that we need

960
00:39:58,950 --> 00:40:00,900
to step in and collectively defend.

961
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:04,080
It ought to be something
we think of 24 hours a day.

962
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:04,980
- Other questions?

963
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:07,317
Yeah, go ahead.

964
00:40:09,572 --> 00:40:12,117
- [Audience] I appreciate
your focus on defense,

965
00:40:12,117 --> 00:40:17,117
I'm gonna get you thoughts
on the very topic of interest

966
00:40:17,254 --> 00:40:21,687
our government has when they
also wanna have offense.

967
00:40:21,687 --> 00:40:25,830
And they actively try
to leave vulnerabilities

968
00:40:25,830 --> 00:40:29,123
in (indistinct) or to add back doors.

969
00:40:30,808 --> 00:40:32,730
How do we have a defense

970
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:35,740
at the same time we also
want to have offense?

971
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:40,740
- Yeah, so I'm not prepared
to say what the US government

972
00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:41,670
will or will not.

973
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:44,700
So the question is, how can
we make a case for defense

974
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:47,010
when we in fact have an offense?

975
00:40:47,010 --> 00:40:49,590
So I'm not going to tell you
what the US government has

976
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:52,590
in terms of an arsenal
of one kind or another.

977
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:57,000
But I would just note that we
have offensive capabilities

978
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,790
broadly across kind of just
about every country I can think

979
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:01,200
of but the United States.

980
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:04,410
Both kinetic, physical
and kind of cyber wise.

981
00:41:04,410 --> 00:41:05,243
Why?

982
00:41:05,243 --> 00:41:07,800
Because at some point we may
need to bring them to bear

983
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:11,100
in the legitimate defense of our people.

984
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:12,780
Now, they need to be built in a way

985
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:16,080
that they're appropriate, that
they kind of are necessary

986
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,730
and appropriate to the task.

987
00:41:17,730 --> 00:41:20,760
Need to make sure that they do
not hold at risk the society

988
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,230
that they would defend.

989
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:24,990
So if we have fighter airplanes
and they have munitions,

990
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:27,000
we need to make sure that
they're properly secured

991
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,270
and that they're not at some
point kind of easily deployed

992
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:33,570
or deployed at all to hold
that population at risk

993
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:36,570
that they would defend,
same thing's true for cyber.

994
00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:38,670
There's nothing different
about cyber in terms

995
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:40,930
of what norms we would bring to bear.

996
00:41:40,930 --> 00:41:43,620
I would tell you that
as a matter of course,

997
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:46,800
the vast majority of
weakness that is discovered

998
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,800
by US government and
other like-minded nations

999
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:52,890
in critical infrastructure,
civilian infrastructure,

1000
00:41:52,890 --> 00:41:55,410
the vast majority if
not all of that is given

1001
00:41:55,410 --> 00:41:58,110
to the private sector so that
they might then be defended.

1002
00:41:58,110 --> 00:42:01,249
And just as I think we
know in our own defense,

1003
00:42:01,249 --> 00:42:05,070
85% of what we find goes
wrong is attributable

1004
00:42:05,070 --> 00:42:07,080
to kind of a failure of a human being

1005
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:09,270
or a failure of doctrine, are adversaries,

1006
00:42:09,270 --> 00:42:10,470
have the same challenge.

1007
00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:13,410
And so most of the flaws, the
vulnerabilities we would use

1008
00:42:13,410 --> 00:42:14,550
in the heat of the moment,

1009
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:17,490
are likely to be found
in doctrinal differences

1010
00:42:17,490 --> 00:42:19,830
kind of people kind of issues.

1011
00:42:19,830 --> 00:42:22,590
Not in some fundamental flaw
that we would take advantage of

1012
00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:25,140
that it's a common flaw for all of us.

1013
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:27,390
The bias has to be, if
there's a common flaw,

1014
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:28,590
we actually defend it.

1015
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:31,800
We don't actually use it kind
of in some reserve capacity

1016
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,843
to hold everyone at risk, so.

1017
00:42:33,843 --> 00:42:35,640
- We have time for just one more question.

1018
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:36,640
- One more question.

1019
00:42:38,010 --> 00:42:40,380
- [Audience] You briefly
talked about the talent problem

1020
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:43,230
and hiring pipeline,
that defense department

1021
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:46,050
and the Homeland Security
department get a lot of coverage

1022
00:42:46,050 --> 00:42:47,940
as a member of the administration.

1023
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:50,484
What efforts are happening
in the US are talking

1024
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:52,920
about departments like
education and conference?

1025
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:53,990
- Yeah, that's a great question.

1026
00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:57,180
So we talk a lot, he says
about, and I think you're right.

1027
00:42:57,180 --> 00:43:00,450
Talk a lot about the
need to properly educate

1028
00:43:00,450 --> 00:43:02,820
and to fill jobs, cyber jobs, IT jobs,

1029
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:04,890
and I kind of added some other disciplines

1030
00:43:04,890 --> 00:43:06,450
that perhaps we need to do more about.

1031
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:07,890
And we hear a lot about what's happening

1032
00:43:07,890 --> 00:43:09,540
in places like the Department
of Homeland Security,

1033
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:12,112
the Department of Defense,
but what about all the others?

1034
00:43:12,112 --> 00:43:13,980
I agree that we need to actually,

1035
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:15,570
we can't just filter one end of the poll,

1036
00:43:15,570 --> 00:43:17,340
we need to solve the whole problem.

1037
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:20,880
And so at the White House
about three weeks ago,

1038
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:24,210
had a summit to essentially
focus on this problem.

1039
00:43:24,210 --> 00:43:26,550
We brought 60 leaders from
across the private sector,

1040
00:43:26,550 --> 00:43:28,500
academia and the government.

1041
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:30,540
Interestingly, the secretary of commerce,

1042
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:33,150
secretary of labor, secretary
of Homeland Security,

1043
00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:36,270
and secretary for department
of education, all spoke.

1044
00:43:36,270 --> 00:43:38,190
Susan Rice also spoke,

1045
00:43:38,190 --> 00:43:40,470
given her responsibility
within the administration.

1046
00:43:40,470 --> 00:43:42,690
And we spoke about the collective need,

1047
00:43:42,690 --> 00:43:45,360
not just one department
of two departments need.

1048
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:46,920
And how do we come up with a strategy

1049
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:49,470
that actually kind of tries
to solve the whole problem,

1050
00:43:49,470 --> 00:43:52,800
make a bigger pie for the nation
as much as all the agencies

1051
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,440
and departments, so that any
one of us think can benefit

1052
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:56,790
from what happens inside of that.

1053
00:43:56,790 --> 00:43:58,800
But you're quite right, we have
to solve the whole problem.

1054
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,759
We can't solve just a
piece of the problem.

1055
00:44:00,759 --> 00:44:01,592
- [Audience] Thank you.

1056
00:44:01,592 --> 00:44:02,572
- Great.
- Thank you Chris,

1057
00:44:02,572 --> 00:44:04,020
thanks for your time.
- Thanks very Kim,

1058
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:05,300
always nice to see you, thanks.

1059
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:08,300
(audience clapping)

1060
00:44:13,759 --> 00:44:16,342
(upbeat music)
