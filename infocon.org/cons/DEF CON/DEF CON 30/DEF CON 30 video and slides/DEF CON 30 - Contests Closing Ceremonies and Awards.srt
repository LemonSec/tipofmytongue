1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,413
- So just to introduce myself, I am Kabes.

2
00:00:05,725 --> 00:00:07,308
Hi.

3
00:00:07,308 --> 00:00:10,308
(audience cheering)

4
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:13,650
Full disclosure,

5
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:17,640
I just found out that I'm
responsible for this whole room

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,465
when I walked into it.

7
00:00:19,465 --> 00:00:22,632
(audience applauding)

8
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,720
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

9
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:28,920
Also, I hope that this is
everyone's first year here,

10
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:29,867
and you don't know that I was involved

11
00:00:29,867 --> 00:00:33,000
in the scavenger hunt
for the last 10 years.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,430
So that just really leaves
everything wide open

13
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:37,583
for all the trouble you
guys could get into.

14
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:42,270
This is going to be a very,

15
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:44,810
very unorthodox closing ceremony...

16
00:00:45,873 --> 00:00:48,959
(audience cheering)

17
00:00:48,959 --> 00:00:51,180
Because I'm figuring
it out just right now.

18
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:52,890
So thank you everyone,

19
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:55,283
and we're gonna drink about it later.

20
00:00:55,283 --> 00:00:58,200
(audience cheering)

21
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,080
All right, I'll just
give my thumbs up now.

22
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,910
Oh, I'm good, all right.

23
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:06,930
So even though I went through
the trouble of collecting

24
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:11,820
the scores and the stats for
everyone's contest or event,

25
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:16,230
I definitely did not have
time to put any of it on here,

26
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:17,730
because I'm making it up as I go.

27
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:20,280
What I'm going to do is I'm going to

28
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,800
call up the name of a contest or event,

29
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,720
if you're here come on up.

30
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,310
You're gonna talk to people about it,

31
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:30,087
and then we will be awarding prizes

32
00:01:30,087 --> 00:01:32,343
for the first place contestants.

33
00:01:33,702 --> 00:01:35,550
(audience cheering)

34
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:36,383
Thank you.

35
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:41,580
I'm so excited that this
horrible moment for me

36
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:44,460
is going to be immortalized
in DEF CON history.

37
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:45,363
This is great.

38
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,790
It's fine.

39
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:48,623
All right.

40
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,940
First of all, thank you to
all of the C&E organizers,

41
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:56,880
even though we look incredibly
disorganized right now,

42
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,713
so much work goes into this.

43
00:01:59,701 --> 00:02:02,390
We all have day jobs, and...

44
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,530
This is all just our love of the CON,

45
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:10,683
this is all of our time and energy.

46
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:15,240
Thanks so much to all of the organizers,

47
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,550
my GOONS are saving my life right now.

48
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:19,349
Please give it up for my GOONS.

49
00:02:19,349 --> 00:02:23,599
(audience cheering and applauding)

50
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,780
And since we're getting real deep

51
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,510
and you're learning a
lot about me right now,

52
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:33,450
I just came into this
role about a month ago.

53
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:36,270
They just met me and
they were very receptive

54
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:38,970
to all of the bossing
around that I've been doing

55
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:42,780
while I try to get my sea legs with this.

56
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:47,583
I would like to personally
thank them for saving my ass.

57
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:57,180
All right, beverage cooling
contraption contest,

58
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,030
please come up and save me from this.

59
00:03:03,784 --> 00:03:05,460
- [Beverage Cooling Organizer] Party.

60
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:07,050
The beverage cooling contraption contest

61
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:08,700
is the most fun you'll ever have.

62
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,670
We had a blast, we had a
whole bunch of teams sign up.

63
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:14,490
Basically, you cool a
beer as fast as you can.

64
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:15,990
So we have two different competitions.

65
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:17,750
One where you can bring anything you want

66
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,560
in the entire universe.

67
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,820
Just don't tell us what it is,

68
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,530
and you'll get it past
security, it's fine.

69
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:25,140
So you can bring air conditioning
units, whatever you want,

70
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,270
and you cool a beer as fast as possible.

71
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:28,350
We had that competition,

72
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:29,640
and then we have the other one.

73
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,650
where you can only build your contraption

74
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:34,530
with stuff you get from
the Las Vegas strip.

75
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:36,510
You cool a beer down as fast as possible.

76
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:39,240
So we got piles of dry
ice, isopropyl alcohol.

77
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,500
If you don't know, those two together

78
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:44,070
is negative 140 degrees
Fahrenheit, negative 90 Celsius.

79
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:45,720
So you can cool really fast,

80
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,270
it also hurts your hands like crazy.

81
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:50,790
Basically we had those two competitions,

82
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:53,850
I conveniently got the scores
on my cool burner phone.

83
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:56,100
So we had two competitions,

84
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,443
we had one, so Casey are you here?

85
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,110
He's there, okay.

86
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:02,730
Casey won the unlimited competition,

87
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:04,410
he brought a chiller plate,

88
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,843
he cooled 70 degrees in seven seconds.

89
00:04:06,843 --> 00:04:11,843
From 105 to roughly around
40 degrees in seven seconds,

90
00:04:12,894 --> 00:04:14,253
the thing was amazing.

91
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,040
He was sitting there siphoning it

92
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,843
with his mouth for an hour.

93
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:22,383
And then H.D. Smitty, are you here?

94
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,900
- [Audience Member] Yeah.

95
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,760
- [Organizer] I dunno if he
is, it doesn't look like it,

96
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,960
neither of 'em are here.

97
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,482
But he won for the hack competition.

98
00:04:30,482 --> 00:04:34,500
He got a bunch of air
compressor canisters,

99
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,840
and blew air compressor
canisters into a dry ice

100
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,600
isopropyl solution,
also hurting his hands.

101
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,790
And built a cool spiny thingy

102
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:44,580
out of stuff he found in the
trashcan in the contest hall.

103
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,230
And he did really, really well.

104
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:50,640
I think it was two minutes
down to 40 degrees from 105,

105
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,507
so also really, really cool.

106
00:04:52,507 --> 00:04:54,750
- [Kabes] I think you guys
need gloves, it sounds like.

107
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:55,583
- [Organizer] There were lots of gloves,

108
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:56,510
nobody was using them.

109
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:59,226
- [Kabes] Safety first.
- [Organizer] Not my job.

110
00:04:59,226 --> 00:05:01,643
We had safety goggles too
and none of them were opened.

111
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,643
That's pretty much it,
none of them are here.

112
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,670
- [Kabes] We'll figure that out later too.

113
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:09,540
- [Organizer] Yeah, cool.

114
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:10,670
- [Kabes] Thank you.

115
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:14,920
(audience cheering and applauding)

116
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,263
Absolutely a perfect
example of safety third.

117
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,540
All right, Bio Hacking Village.

118
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:27,900
Do I have anyone from
Bio Hacking Village here?

119
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,270
That's a bummer, all right,

120
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:31,500
I'll get there one day.

121
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,500
That's actually somewhere I've
really been trying to get to.

122
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:36,993
Moving on.

123
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:40,800
Creative writing short story contest.

124
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,620
Do I have anyone from there?

125
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,540
No, okay.

126
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:47,195
Oh hey.

127
00:05:47,195 --> 00:05:48,028
Yay.

128
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:55,313
No.
(audience applauding)

129
00:06:02,587 --> 00:06:04,754
It's so great to meet you.

130
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,560
- [Serum] It was a lot of fun,

131
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:10,320
I'm Serum, I actually won
the contest with War Dreamer.

132
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,787
So thank you everybody,
it was a lot of fun,

133
00:06:11,787 --> 00:06:14,635
and a lot of hard work,
I loved the competition.

134
00:06:14,635 --> 00:06:17,802
(audience applauding)

135
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:25,770
- [Kabes] All right, is Fox here?

136
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:26,643
Fox?

137
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:29,313
Man, yes.

138
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:34,650
You have perfected being
in multiple places at once.

139
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:35,820
I knew you could do it,

140
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,720
I knew you would build the technology.

141
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:45,270
- [Fox] Hi I'm Fox, I did
the Fox hunt challenge,

142
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:48,330
for hunting down little foxes that we hid.

143
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:49,770
There were three of them in total,

144
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:50,940
it was all for fun.

145
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:54,840
We hid one at the DEF
CON sign under the chair.

146
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,340
We had one, which was really mean,

147
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:57,390
behind a projector.

148
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:59,280
And I forget where the
third one was at this point.

149
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,500
But yeah, it was super awesome.

150
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,823
Yeah, there he is Rich.

151
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:06,530
But yeah, thanks guys.

152
00:07:08,315 --> 00:07:11,482
(audience applauding)

153
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:17,190
- [Kabes] All right, no
pressure to everybody else,

154
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:20,283
but this one is very near
and dear to my heart.

155
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,482
Scavenger hunt, come on up.

156
00:07:23,482 --> 00:07:27,732
(audience cheering and applauding)

157
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:31,353
It's so weird being on this side of this.

158
00:07:33,567 --> 00:07:34,558
- [Judge] What is this?

159
00:07:34,558 --> 00:07:35,430
- [Kabes] I don't know.

160
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:38,760
It's all wrong, it's not
meant to be this way,

161
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:41,220
this is my contest.

162
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,780
I'm supposed to be with them.

163
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,520
- [Judge] But you are over there,

164
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,290
go over there, go sit over there.

165
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:47,580
Hello everybody,

166
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:50,670
I am one of the judges with
the DEF CON scavenger hunt,

167
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:52,140
if you do not know about us,

168
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:54,243
then I don't know how you don't.

169
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,360
We are the shenanigan
raisers here at DEF CON,

170
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,724
we have been doing this for 25 years now.

171
00:08:00,724 --> 00:08:04,974
(audience cheering and applauding)

172
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,550
We typically have teams join
from all over the world,

173
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:10,590
Typically people who come
and play in our contest

174
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:12,930
actually end up being in these positions.

175
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:15,870
They actually end up being GOONS, speakers

176
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,477
and they get really involved with DEF CON,

177
00:08:17,477 --> 00:08:20,073
'cause we force them to do that.

178
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:23,640
You may be remembered for
good things, you may not be,

179
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,023
that's not my problem.

180
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:30,100
We also had a side
project join us this year

181
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:34,580
from the National Upcycled
Computing Collective and...

182
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:37,103
What's the...

183
00:08:38,058 --> 00:08:38,891
- [Ian] What?

184
00:08:38,891 --> 00:08:39,770
- [Judge] Your institute.

185
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,440
I'm gonna hand it over to Ian

186
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,910
to talk about our little side project

187
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:47,002
that joined us with
scavenger hunt this year.

188
00:08:47,002 --> 00:08:50,400
- [Ian] Sure thing, the
shell on demand appliance,

189
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,440
which you saw as a lovely soda machine,

190
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,930
hanging out next to the scav hunt table

191
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:56,970
was providing shells to DEF CON attendees

192
00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:00,660
anonymously using cash donations.

193
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:01,890
We do have some stats from it

194
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:04,380
that we'd be happy to share with you.

195
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:07,443
We sold 483 virtual machines.

196
00:09:08,433 --> 00:09:10,770
Unfortunately based off
of the traffic stats

197
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:14,013
off of each virtual machine,
only 41 of them were used.

198
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,390
Only five of the VMs had
their passwords changed,

199
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:21,570
does nobody hack at DEF CON anymore?

200
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:24,000
What is this?

201
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,370
But nonetheless, it was a great service

202
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:28,520
and we hope we can
bring it back next year.

203
00:09:29,431 --> 00:09:32,013
(audience applauding)
- [Judge] Thank you guys.

204
00:09:38,092 --> 00:09:41,259
- [Audience Members] Who won, who won?

205
00:09:43,438 --> 00:09:45,630
- [Kabes] I was gonna try to
fill in the blanks of that,

206
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:48,180
see, this is what happens when
I'm not with them anymore.

207
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:49,020
They fall into a mess.

208
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,400
- [Judge] The winners
will actually be announced

209
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,597
at closing ceremony.

210
00:09:51,597 --> 00:09:53,490
- [Kabes] The big one.
- [Judge] The big one.

211
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:57,273
So if you want to hear who won
you can join us over there.

212
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,693
- Okay, Hacker Runway.

213
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:11,880
I know that the person
that ran it is not here,

214
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,740
she ended up losing her voice,

215
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:16,110
like me, this is not what
I usually sound like.

216
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:21,110
And so she's been running the
contest for four years now,

217
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:26,310
and this is one that I've
become really attached to.

218
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:28,920
Because one of my favorite
things about it is

219
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,450
that it's incredibly accessible

220
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,450
to people who are just
getting started in the CON.

221
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:37,920
Like I did, one of my favorite things

222
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,810
when I first got here 15 years ago

223
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:42,030
was playing around in
hardware hacking village,

224
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:43,233
learning how to solder.

225
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:47,790
And trying to stick LEDs on all my stuff

226
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:48,780
so that it looks really cool.

227
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:51,570
Which is exactly what you
get to do with Hacker Runway,

228
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:53,160
you get to make some stuff,

229
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:57,090
show off your beautiful blinky things,

230
00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:01,110
or your actual interactive items.

231
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:03,450
The winners of this contest were actually

232
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:06,930
announced yesterday live on the stage.

233
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:07,970
We had a...

234
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,990
I actually don't remember
the name of the contestant,

235
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:14,100
'cause this isn't my contest,

236
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,530
but she had an interactive backpack.

237
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:19,950
I don't know if you guys saw
her going around the CON,

238
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:22,473
but it was an actual hackable backpack.

239
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:25,580
I definitely encourage you guys to...

240
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:29,190
Maybe look up this contest.

241
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:32,100
Because the biggest regret
I've heard this year

242
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,500
is that a lot of folks didn't know

243
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,080
that this was a project they
could be working on all year,

244
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:40,530
and just bring it out at DEF
CON and show off your stuff.

245
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:41,793
It was so much fun.

246
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:46,080
We'll figure that out later too.

247
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,693
Hack Fortress, is Hack Fortress here?

248
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:51,483
It's okay.

249
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:55,293
Recon Village?

250
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,353
Thank you.

251
00:11:58,929 --> 00:12:03,179
(audience cheering and applauding)

252
00:12:14,398 --> 00:12:16,357
- Hello, good afternoon DEF CON.

253
00:12:16,357 --> 00:12:17,880
We are Recon Village,

254
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:21,030
we were hosting the CDF
capture the flag event.

255
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:23,340
It was a 38 hour grueling competition

256
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:27,690
where we had about, let me
check the stats quickly.

257
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:29,140
I don't remember the numbers.

258
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:32,850
All right, we had about 134 teams

259
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:35,013
all across the globe signing up,

260
00:12:35,013 --> 00:12:37,260
with 240 registered users.

261
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:39,475
Being a hybrid system we kept it

262
00:12:39,475 --> 00:12:42,270
for everyone to sign
up wherever they were.

263
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:44,160
We had teams from India, Japan, France,

264
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,620
everywhere across the globe plain.

265
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:49,320
It's basically based on finding
information on the internet,

266
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:54,320
reconnaissance and finding
information on social media.

267
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:59,940
All those 38 hours teams spent

268
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:02,430
smashing their head against the wall.

269
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:04,920
People came up to me for figuring out

270
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,800
who were the creators so
that they can grab my neck.

271
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,693
Thankfully I had remained discreet.

272
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,370
But then we had

273
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,093
about...

274
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:18,600
50 odd teams gathering points.

275
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,810
We had three winners,
top three winners here.

276
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:24,150
We had the team Alligator Hunters,

277
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:25,900
anyone here from Alligator Hunters?

278
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:28,650
Oh yeah, they are here.

279
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:30,720
- [Kabes] Yay.
(audience applauding)

280
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,720
Cool, they came in number one.

281
00:13:35,065 --> 00:13:37,273
They came in number one with 2760 points.

282
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:40,593
Good job guys.

283
00:13:41,564 --> 00:13:43,680
(audience applauding)

284
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,860
And also we have cool prizes to give away,

285
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,480
if you don't mind, can we do that here?

286
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,440
- [Kabes] Yeah, do it.

287
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,640
- Perfect.

288
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:55,503
Right, these guys are winners
for Microsoft's Office Pro 2.

289
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,683
Yeah.

290
00:13:58,683 --> 00:13:59,940
Would you like to share your experience?

291
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,053
If you don't mind?

292
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:04,320
They got to know me now,

293
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,820
they're gonna kick me in
the other room out there.

294
00:14:10,117 --> 00:14:12,428
(audience member talking indistinctly)

295
00:14:12,428 --> 00:14:13,261
Woo hoo.

296
00:14:13,261 --> 00:14:14,094
Congrats guys.

297
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:19,080
Perfect.
(audience applauding)

298
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,100
Cool.

299
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,713
The second team was team Pinja,

300
00:14:22,713 --> 00:14:24,843
I think we have, yeah, come on on stage.

301
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:28,300
Yeah, awesome.

302
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:31,110
(audience applauding)

303
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:34,410
These guys win a Nintendo Switch.

304
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:36,120
- [Shubrum] Yeah, you have
been playing games with us

305
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,460
so you win a gaming console.

306
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,293
There you go.

307
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:45,960
- Right, unfortunately the
third team is not here.

308
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:49,350
They were playing somewhere
from France, team Delaware.

309
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:54,350
They are winners of a RGB
keyboard that we have,

310
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:56,610
so I think we're gonna ship it to them.

311
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:58,950
All right, yeah, it was pretty fun.

312
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:01,590
It was our sixth year doing this thing,

313
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:03,450
and we'll be back probably next year again

314
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:05,842
and make it a fun event again.

315
00:15:05,842 --> 00:15:07,260
I'll hand it over to Shubrum.

316
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:08,093
- [Shubrum] No, I'm good, thank you.

317
00:15:08,093 --> 00:15:10,623
Just see you next year, have fun guys.

318
00:15:15,973 --> 00:15:17,931
- [GOON] So these guys didn't know this,

319
00:15:17,931 --> 00:15:21,300
but DEF CON is throwing in a free pass

320
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:25,311
for the winning team
for next year as well.

321
00:15:25,311 --> 00:15:29,561
(audience applauding and cheering)

322
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:43,290
- [Kabes] Did someone
forget their mask up here?

323
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:45,450
Anyone that came up with a mask

324
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:46,950
that is no longer wearing one?

325
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:49,343
Come.

326
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:53,133
- Apologies, sorry.

327
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:57,540
- [Kabes] All right.

328
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,073
Wow, damn I'm short.

329
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:05,103
Red Alert CTF, are you here?

330
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,620
Maybe.

331
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:09,960
You had such a sweet setup,

332
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:13,500
and that is one of my biggest
regrets about not knowing

333
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,690
that I had to put up these slides,

334
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:18,420
is that you guys can't
see how awesome it looked.

335
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:22,290
So you have got to come back
to my contest room next year

336
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:25,173
and see a lot of the awesome
things that were happening.

337
00:16:26,658 --> 00:16:28,592
Yay.

338
00:16:28,592 --> 00:16:31,507
(audience applauding)

339
00:16:31,507 --> 00:16:32,688
- [Red Alert Speaker] Thank you so much.

340
00:16:32,688 --> 00:16:33,521
- [Kabes] Thank you.

341
00:16:33,521 --> 00:16:34,800
- [Red Alert Speaker] Thank you.

342
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,860
Hey guys, we are the Red Alert ICS CTF,

343
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,210
we've come from South Korea.

344
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:41,280
We've had a, like she was just saying,

345
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:43,980
we've come with a couple of
good toys, nice looking toys.

346
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:45,180
If you've come to the contest area,

347
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:48,840
if you've seen a lot of
lights, most of it is us.

348
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,687
- [Kabes] It's true.

349
00:16:49,687 --> 00:16:52,260
- [Red Alert Speaker] And we had 61 teams,

350
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,430
I hope they had a good time.

351
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:56,208
We got our first place winners right here,

352
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:57,910
it will not take much time.

353
00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:02,010
The first prize was team
XX with 2050 points.

354
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:06,630
The second was Screaming Fist with 1355.

355
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:10,320
And ranked three was
Taint with 1255 points.

356
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:13,710
So that's a couple of Korean hats

357
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:15,693
and Korean fans for the first team.

358
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:22,733
Thank you.

359
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:37,089
(Red Alert Speaker chuckling)

360
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:41,339
(audience cheering and applauding)

361
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:51,240
All right, thank you very much.

362
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,953
- [Kabes] Thank you guys.

363
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:58,200
Another contest that makes
me look good, thank you.

364
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:02,610
Do I have anyone here from

365
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:05,223
America's Next Top Threat Model?

366
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:07,343
No?

367
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:09,443
Maybe.

368
00:18:24,615 --> 00:18:25,448
Thank you so much.

369
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:28,650
- [Nass] Hi, I'm Nass,

370
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:31,680
this is DEF CON's Next Top Threat Model.

371
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,100
We put together a contest

372
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:37,440
where we built the design
and a fake company.

373
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,173
And basically had contestants
go through the design,

374
00:18:41,154 --> 00:18:43,350
and look for threats,

375
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:45,993
and report those back to the dev teams.

376
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:48,040
This is our third year,

377
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,320
our first year we were here at DEF CON 27,

378
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,200
and it was the threat modeling challenge.

379
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,000
I was not very creative with the name,

380
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,070
and Grifter pointed that out,

381
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:00,953
hopefully we did a better job this year.

382
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:04,080
We had two winners.

383
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,660
We had, sorry.

384
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:07,493
Conjecture.

385
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:16,440
Yeah, so they found a lot of good threats.

386
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,830
And one of the best things
during our challenge,

387
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:23,460
we actually produced JSON format
that we had people provide.

388
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:26,490
And one of his best
threats was use of JSON

389
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:28,890
in the threat model is a
breach of human rights.

390
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:33,990
This may lead to excessive
alcohol consumption,

391
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:38,283
griping and in extreme cases
hurling of items to organizers.

392
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:41,490
When I emailed him, he already left,

393
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:45,205
I sent a congratulation email all in JSON.

394
00:19:45,205 --> 00:19:47,524
(audience laughing)

395
00:19:47,524 --> 00:19:48,903
Yeah.

396
00:19:48,903 --> 00:19:53,903
Thank you.
(audience applauding)

397
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:56,100
Yeah, thanks very much for everything.

398
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,800
We plan to be back here next year.

399
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,890
Like I said, third year,

400
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:05,520
the company we put
together was Drone Online.

401
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,020
It was a company that was in

402
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:10,860
military and warehouse
supply chain logistics.

403
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:13,214
They've decided to get into
the food delivery space

404
00:20:13,214 --> 00:20:14,853
for last mile delivery.

405
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:19,230
What could go wrong with
consumers ordering drones,

406
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:22,293
mixed with military
drones in a mesh network?

407
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:24,790
Thank you very much.

408
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:38,210
- [Kabes] The Gold Bug, crypt
and privacy village puzzle.

409
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:40,050
Do I have have Gold Bug here?

410
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:40,883
Yay.

411
00:20:42,286 --> 00:20:44,010
I feel like this is coming together guys,

412
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:45,903
thanks for sticking around.

413
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:58,770
- [Kevin] Hey everybody,

414
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:01,800
I am Kevin with the Gold Bug puzzle.

415
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:05,940
The Gold Bug puzzle is a
series of crypto puzzles,

416
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:09,300
not really your modern
crypto, but more your stego.

417
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,800
Here's a picture, figure out

418
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,170
what the hell you're supposed
to do with it type puzzles.

419
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:15,120
So this year we had a really good showing,

420
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:19,050
we had 230 teams participate
from around the world.

421
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:21,330
We did a hybrid contest this year,

422
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:26,220
of those 230 teams 29
actually scored points.

423
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:30,480
We had 1,573 wrong answers submitted,

424
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,600
and 77 correct answers submitted.

425
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,130
And if you're interested,

426
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:39,030
there are still two puzzles
that remain unsolved.

427
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:42,741
Congratulations to team
Psychaholics for taking first place.

428
00:21:42,741 --> 00:21:45,900
(audience applauding)

429
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:49,290
By the way, they spent
their entire CON doing this,

430
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:52,353
and I think they violated the
three hours of sleep rule.

431
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:56,850
(audience applauding)

432
00:21:56,850 --> 00:21:58,300
Do y'all wanna talk?

433
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,490
- [Winner] No, I'm good.

434
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:00,833
- [Kevin] Thanks everybody.

435
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:11,373
- [Kabes] All right, tinfoil hat contest.

436
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,640
Anybody?

437
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,893
Hey Crux, you wanna come back up here?

438
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:18,803
Nope.

439
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,533
Don't go too far.

440
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,233
Aww.

441
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,353
Okay, am I going?

442
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:30,983
Yay.

443
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:39,720
What's actually great about
these two is that last year,

444
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:43,410
the last time I was faking
things till I figured it out,

445
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:46,140
they saved my ass multiple times.

446
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:47,673
So love these guys.

447
00:22:49,315 --> 00:22:50,490
- [Tin Foil Hat Organizer]
Oh shit, hello everybody.

448
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:52,297
- [Kabes] No pressure.

449
00:22:52,297 --> 00:22:53,130
- [Tin Foil Hat Organizer] So yeah,

450
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:56,520
this is our fifth year doing tin foil hat.

451
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:59,160
This started as a total labor of love,

452
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,383
it started because we
wanted to put a contest in

453
00:23:01,383 --> 00:23:04,890
that had zero entry barriers.

454
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:06,750
Depending on your skill level,

455
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:09,600
your physical ability
level, your age level,

456
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,190
everybody can play.

457
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:12,930
And I see we got some tin foil hats

458
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:14,493
in the audience over here.

459
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:18,960
Let's see.

460
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,680
I gotta go back to my Twitter
here to check everybody out,

461
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:26,100
but I believe that's Stay
Skulls right here, correct?

462
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,870
Yep, so that's our first place winner.

463
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:29,722
- [Kabes] Get up here.

464
00:23:29,722 --> 00:23:33,222
(audience applauding)
Woo.

465
00:23:38,586 --> 00:23:39,780
- [Tin Foil Hat Organizer]
This was a tough choice,

466
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:43,230
we have winners for, this
is a classic tinfoil hat.

467
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:44,310
This is all tinfoil,

468
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:47,670
there's no other elements to this.

469
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:49,860
This one our substance
award this attenuated

470
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:51,423
the signal the best.

471
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:56,340
We also had Yoga.

472
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:57,840
Now I gotta look at my Twitter here,

473
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:02,840
but who won the unlimited category.

474
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:05,460
Their hat contained
tinfoil and other items

475
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:06,933
for structure and style.

476
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:12,660
And then we also had,
oh, I mispronounced that.

477
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:15,693
Yagoth, so Yagoth, are you here anywhere?

478
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:20,383
- [Kabes] He has a plane.

479
00:24:20,383 --> 00:24:23,070
- Oh okay, I'll reach
out to him on Twitter.

480
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:26,250
And then we also have Melissa Miko,

481
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:28,500
are you here for style category?

482
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,583
Our style winner.

483
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:32,253
No.

484
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:34,658
Well, and the style,

485
00:24:34,658 --> 00:24:37,920
this was a second place
in our style category.

486
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,330
Our winner style was this huge,

487
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:40,350
you can check out our Twitter.

488
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:42,960
But it was this huge elaborate Flamingo,

489
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,260
with the Flamingo tinfoil hat and braids.

490
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:47,400
It was extravagant.

491
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,950
So hopefully we can
get you back next year,

492
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:52,260
but congratulations to our winners.

493
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:53,919
And we'll see you again.

494
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:57,086
(audience applauding)

495
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:04,653
- All right Wireless CTF.

496
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,733
Anyone wanna come up
here and talk about it?

497
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,033
No?

498
00:25:11,033 --> 00:25:11,866
All right.

499
00:25:11,866 --> 00:25:13,140
Moving on.

500
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:14,763
IOT Village.

501
00:25:17,189 --> 00:25:20,356
(audience applauding)

502
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:26,400
- [Teo] Thank you.

503
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,290
I'm Teo from IOT Village.

504
00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:30,450
We had two contests running
in our village this year,

505
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:32,574
the first is the IOT CTF,

506
00:25:32,574 --> 00:25:34,980
which I think you're all familiar with.

507
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:37,980
We had awesome turnout this year,

508
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:40,230
we had over 100 teams that were competing.

509
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:42,390
This was the biggest CTF
that we've ever put on

510
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:45,900
in the IOT Village this year
with over 48 challenges.

511
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:48,570
We expanded beyond the
typical Soho devices

512
00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:51,360
that you've seen at
previous DEF CON IOT CTFs.

513
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,090
We had things like the emergency
alert broadcast systems

514
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:57,360
that you could exploit, and
pop a message on our screen.

515
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,690
We had BLE, we had glow
comm satellite units,

516
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:03,525
so it was an awesome CTF.

517
00:26:03,525 --> 00:26:05,790
The top three teams were only

518
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:07,920
separated by a couple of challenges.

519
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:11,910
In third place was Leaked The Hard Way.

520
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:15,060
In second place was Colonel Panic,

521
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:18,333
and in first place was team Emojis.

522
00:26:24,022 --> 00:26:24,855
(audience applauding)
Congrats.

523
00:26:24,855 --> 00:26:27,469
So the second contest that we run,

524
00:26:27,469 --> 00:26:29,970
there's a ton of great,
talented researchers out there

525
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:31,890
that work on IOT devices,

526
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:33,762
we wanted to recognize some of their work.

527
00:26:33,762 --> 00:26:37,290
But also, putting together
an IOT CTF is hard,

528
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:39,690
and we just really wanted to
crowdsource some of their work

529
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:41,400
to bring it into our CTF.

530
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,560
So we came up with the
CTF creator's contest,

531
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,300
you could submit devices that would

532
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,590
become part of the CTF.

533
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:48,808
And we'd grade those
devices based on difficulty,

534
00:26:48,808 --> 00:26:53,808
and CVSS, and discretionary
modifier based on other factors.

535
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:56,070
Such as the rarity of the device,

536
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:59,160
the difficulty of the
exploit, and stuff like that.

537
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,650
So the winner of that contest Noah,

538
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:03,780
submitted a video doorbell.

539
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:05,550
It had an off bypass that allowed you to

540
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:07,950
trigger a relay that was meant to unlock

541
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:10,800
the electronic deadbolt that's
attached to that device.

542
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,000
A pretty awesome exploit

543
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,710
that would get you into somebody's house.

544
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:15,690
But what really triggered the max

545
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:17,910
on the discretionary multiplier,

546
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:19,170
is something that I think a lot of us

547
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:20,310
researchers can relate to.

548
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:23,670
Is the issues he had when
trying to responsibly disclose

549
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:26,040
to the vendor his findings.

550
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,330
And the fact that he had to go out

551
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:29,400
and get a lawyer to cover himself

552
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,920
when the vendor tried to sue him for

553
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,690
responsibly disclosing his findings.

554
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:36,030
That triggered the max
multiplier on our score.

555
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:37,910
So congratulations Noah.

556
00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:41,077
(audience applauding)

557
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:48,630
And I hope that that doesn't prevent you

558
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:51,090
from responsibly disclosing in the future.

559
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:52,140
So thank you very much.

560
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:53,433
- [Kabes] Why (indistinct) EFF.

561
00:27:53,433 --> 00:27:54,900
- [Teo] That's it.
- [Kabes] That's just a

562
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,567
plug for the EFF.

563
00:27:56,567 --> 00:27:58,020
- [Teo] All right, thanks.

564
00:27:58,020 --> 00:27:59,020
- [Kabes] Thank you.

565
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:04,200
All right, another crew
that I love a whole lot,

566
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,520
so I hope they're here.

567
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,177
Car Hacking Village CTF.

568
00:28:08,066 --> 00:28:12,316
(audience cheering and applauding)

569
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,630
- [Presenter] I'm here.

570
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,356
Hey, should I unplug now?

571
00:28:25,356 --> 00:28:26,763
Okay, if you want.

572
00:28:27,903 --> 00:28:31,193
- [Kabes] Here.
- [Presenter] All right.

573
00:28:31,193 --> 00:28:33,723
It's gonna do something.

574
00:28:33,723 --> 00:28:36,690
Do something, it's gonna work.

575
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:37,530
- [Kabes] Do the damn thing.

576
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:39,255
- [Presenter] Do the damn thing.

577
00:28:39,255 --> 00:28:42,030
- [Kabes] All right.
- [Presenter] Look at this.

578
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:42,873
Always works.

579
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:46,440
It worked, no really?

580
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,490
Why didn't that work?

581
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,930
Okay, anybody got...

582
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:56,283
There it is, yay, woo, live demos.

583
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,880
All right, I've always wanted to do this,

584
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:02,730
so I've got a board that's
saying everything I want.

585
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:04,050
That's it, it's rewriting it,

586
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:05,308
so I'm gonna do that.

587
00:29:05,308 --> 00:29:06,263
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

588
00:29:07,861 --> 00:29:09,570
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

589
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:10,403
No?

590
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:13,350
Yeah.

591
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:15,849
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck,
fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck,

592
00:29:15,849 --> 00:29:19,076
fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck,
fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck,

593
00:29:19,076 --> 00:29:21,740
fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck,
fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

594
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:22,573
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

595
00:29:23,896 --> 00:29:24,817
Fuck.

596
00:29:24,817 --> 00:29:28,230
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck,
fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

597
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:29,520
I said make me look good dude.

598
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,353
Oh.

599
00:29:30,353 --> 00:29:32,310
Yeah, all right.

600
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:34,260
I just wanted to see what would happen.

601
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,380
It does a real good job, okay.

602
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:39,540
All right, so I'm gonna continue on.

603
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:44,540
Okay, we had a few teams join our CTF.

604
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:46,230
- [Kabes] Just a few.

605
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:48,390
- [Presenter] This year, a little over 92.

606
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:52,953
Yeah, like IOT, we had a ton
of teams join us this year,

607
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:55,560
so we're gonna bring up our first place.

608
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,600
If you don't mind coming up Zerophon,

609
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,570
the GM Cyber Security team joined us.

610
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:02,910
So these gentlemen did a great job,

611
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:07,083
they finally got first,
so they're excited.

612
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:15,273
And yeah, so as you can see
our teams are really small.

613
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,600
They did a great job,

614
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:21,780
they spent the entire time working on

615
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:23,610
a host of challenges that we did.

616
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:26,733
We even made a full virtual 3D car,

617
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:29,785
I think you played.

618
00:30:29,785 --> 00:30:31,100
So yeah, come out behind me,

619
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:34,110
I've already given their award.

620
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:37,230
It was some go-karts, some
segue go-kart scooters,

621
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:39,150
so they were pretty excited about them.

622
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:42,870
So one of 'em may have been
damaged in a car accident,

623
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:45,150
so we apologize.

624
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:46,350
They're pre-used.

625
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:49,050
So thank you very much for joining us,

626
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:51,505
and come check out the village next year.

627
00:30:51,505 --> 00:30:52,624
Thank you.

628
00:30:52,624 --> 00:30:55,791
(audience applauding)

629
00:30:57,849 --> 00:30:59,599
Thank you, thank you.

630
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:07,913
Photo IDs.

631
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:18,450
- [Kabes] It occurred to me after

632
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:21,030
that the design is usually
that you come up one side,

633
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:22,290
and down the other.

634
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:24,993
But I forgot to do that.

635
00:31:27,015 --> 00:31:30,765
(GOON speaking indistinctly)

636
00:31:34,811 --> 00:31:36,978
- [Audience] Eddie, Eddie.

637
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:39,603
- [Kabes] Eddie.

638
00:31:41,269 --> 00:31:43,794
(audience applauding)

639
00:31:43,794 --> 00:31:47,043
Oh no.

640
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:49,413
Hold please.

641
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:55,563
Wow buddy, no.

642
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:59,640
- [GOON] Perfect.

643
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,780
- [Kabes] Oh it's back?

644
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:01,613
Perfect.

645
00:32:01,613 --> 00:32:04,080
Wait, no, I can't see it though bud.

646
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,343
What is happening?

647
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:09,153
So do I just go?

648
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:13,413
Let's see.

649
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,853
Oh, another contest near
and dear to my heart.

650
00:32:18,059 --> 00:32:19,516
DarkNet.

651
00:32:19,516 --> 00:32:23,766
(audience cheering and applauding)

652
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:29,793
This is family guys, I love this.

653
00:32:31,026 --> 00:32:33,030
- [DarkNet Organizer] Thank
you for the introduction.

654
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:35,580
Hello to all of the doers of DarkNet,

655
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:36,510
of DEF CON.

656
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:38,400
But DarkNet's great too.

657
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,950
So DarkNet is many things,

658
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:44,250
we can't really sum it all
up in one small little thing.

659
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:47,921
We're an in-person
online role playing game,

660
00:32:47,921 --> 00:32:50,430
and we're a contest that's
accessible to beginners

661
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:52,140
and challenging for experts.

662
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:55,230
We're one of the most
prolific badge producers,

663
00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:58,540
and a thorn in the contest
GOON's side for all of our lives.

664
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:02,004
- [Kabes] That's absolutely
not true, are you kidding me?

665
00:33:02,004 --> 00:33:03,180
- [DarkNet Organizer] We get 500 people

666
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:04,451
lined up every morning.

667
00:33:04,451 --> 00:33:06,360
- [Kabes] Yes, like I said
you make me look good.

668
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,872
Thank you.

669
00:33:07,872 --> 00:33:10,740
- [DarkNet Organizer] We try,
we'll do it again next year.

670
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:12,780
And we're a year round community

671
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:14,703
of teaching and learning and fun.

672
00:33:17,347 --> 00:33:18,450
- [Older DarkNet Organizer]
This is our 11th year

673
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:21,660
and it was another highly
successful year for DarkNet.

674
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:23,910
For our homecoming we went back to basics,

675
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:26,730
teaching circuit design
and expanding badge life

676
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:31,730
to a record 1300 new unique designs.

677
00:33:32,128 --> 00:33:35,295
(audience applauding)

678
00:33:37,614 --> 00:33:40,753
We had over 200 players in our online CTF.

679
00:33:42,461 --> 00:33:45,210
- [DarkNet Organizer] Standings
will come out at closing.

680
00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:47,700
First, thank you to all
the dark net operatives

681
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:48,720
who made this happen,

682
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,420
it's definitely a labor of
love throughout the year.

683
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:54,570
And many thousands of
dollars in circuit components

684
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:57,543
that we put together to
produce all of those badges.

685
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:00,540
Thank you to the contest GOONS

686
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:03,750
for giving us the
opportunity to put 500 people

687
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:06,510
in line in the morning, and
helping us manage all of that.

688
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:08,070
And thank you to all
of our fellow contests

689
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:12,150
for your patience as we
flood the contest area.

690
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:14,430
And finally, and last but not least,

691
00:34:14,430 --> 00:34:15,570
thank you to all of our players,

692
00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:17,790
you are absolutely the reason we are here.

693
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:19,380
And we look forward to doing more of this

694
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:20,880
for another 10 years.

695
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,136
Thank you.

696
00:34:22,136 --> 00:34:25,303
(audience applauding)

697
00:34:29,010 --> 00:34:30,690
- [Kabes] All right.

698
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:35,670
Do I have EFF Tech Trivia around?

699
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:38,993
Hey.
(audience applauding)

700
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,400
- [Cyber Tiger] How's it going, everyone?

701
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:50,070
I'm the Cyber Tiger from EFF Tech Trivia.

702
00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:52,641
How many of y'all are familiar with EFF?

703
00:34:52,641 --> 00:34:54,390
(audience cheering)

704
00:34:54,390 --> 00:34:55,618
Awesome, if any of you are
not, we are a nonprofit

705
00:34:55,618 --> 00:34:58,620
at the defense of digital civil liberties,

706
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:01,440
your rights online and hackers at DEF CON.

707
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,180
And we've been doing
it since about one year

708
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:05,370
before DEF CON started.

709
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:06,870
We've been around for 31 years now,

710
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:10,865
and we love the CON
and we come every year.

711
00:35:10,865 --> 00:35:12,450
EFF Tech Trivia this year,

712
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:16,110
we ran and had 15 teams all participating

713
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:19,593
in what somebody called hacker
jeopardy for kindergartners.

714
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:25,353
We had 15 wonderful teams
and I have the winners here.

715
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:27,143
One second.

716
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:30,700
The third place team

717
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:35,814
was the defending champions
Ballads As A Service.

718
00:35:35,814 --> 00:35:37,200
- [Audience] Woo.

719
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,443
- Also the runners of the
beverage cooling contest.

720
00:35:41,421 --> 00:35:43,200
They were a little too drunk to win.

721
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:46,500
The second team, EFF The System,

722
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:49,800
and the first place team Flord Landia.

723
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,723
So thanks to everybody who played,

724
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,393
it's a lot of fun.

725
00:35:53,393 --> 00:35:56,100
And it's a way for us to give
back to the DEF CON community,

726
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:58,650
which does so much to support EFF.

727
00:35:58,650 --> 00:35:59,483
Thank you all.

728
00:35:59,483 --> 00:36:00,630
Come check it out again next year,

729
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:02,280
we wanna make it bigger and bigger.

730
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,280
We wanna be bigger than Hacker Jeopardy.

731
00:36:06,519 --> 00:36:08,820
(audience member booing)

732
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:11,008
- [Kabes] Damn, that was like

733
00:36:11,008 --> 00:36:12,990
you're gonna throw down with them now.

734
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:14,220
Sounds intense.

735
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:15,333
All right.

736
00:36:16,890 --> 00:36:18,960
Last but not least.

737
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,943
We have Command Control.

738
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,333
No?

739
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:25,680
All right.

740
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,980
That works for me because
it's very important.

741
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:30,303
Oh yes.

742
00:36:31,206 --> 00:36:33,833
- [Evil Mog] We have a
winner for DEF CON MUD.

743
00:36:33,833 --> 00:36:34,666
- [Kabes] What?

744
00:36:34,666 --> 00:36:36,210
- [Evil Mog] DEF CON
MUD actually has winner.

745
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:39,390
- [Kabes] Oh, okay, come on up.

746
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:41,100
- [Evil Mog] All right, so
of course Grifter forgot us,

747
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:42,030
but that's all right.

748
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:43,430
Everyone forgets who we are.

749
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,570
For those who don't know I'm Evil Mog,

750
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:47,070
we run the DEF CON MUD.

751
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:48,647
We partnered with (indistinct)

752
00:36:48,647 --> 00:36:50,583
with Snacky the vending machine.

753
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:55,380
Oh yeah, I'm not Command and Control,

754
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:56,213
I am Evil Mog.

755
00:36:56,213 --> 00:36:57,046
- [Kabes] A completely different thing

756
00:36:57,046 --> 00:36:58,140
that did not get a slide.

757
00:36:58,140 --> 00:36:59,220
- [Evil Mog] Yeah,
sorry, there's no slides

758
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:00,970
because we're not that cool, sorry.

759
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:04,020
Anyway, so here had a chance to go

760
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:06,462
play with Snacky the vending machine?

761
00:37:06,462 --> 00:37:07,350
(audience cheering)

762
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:08,820
Excellent.

763
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:10,920
We combined in with the DEF CON MUD,

764
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,570
and we ran a whole F load of challenges.

765
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:15,120
You had to hack a raspberry
pie that was in there,

766
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:17,100
we were dispensing badges.

767
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:18,330
Now, there's a little bug in the game

768
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:21,150
in that people couldn't
actually win some of challenges,

769
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:23,190
unless they cheated and hacked the game.

770
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:25,200
The DEF CON MUD had crippling bugs,

771
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,190
it was fantastic.

772
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:28,710
But we do actually have
a winner, so one team,

773
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:31,259
we told people we didn't but we do now.

774
00:37:31,259 --> 00:37:34,173
Chargen, are you here, Jonathan?

775
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:36,833
Come on up.

776
00:37:36,833 --> 00:37:38,790
(audience cheering)

777
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:42,300
These guys completed every
single challenge on Snacky,

778
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:44,190
and the MUD, and took over the admin,

779
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:46,950
and found fire disclosure
plugs and everything else.

780
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:48,540
It was absolutely beautiful,

781
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:50,580
so they definitely did a wicked job.

782
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:52,980
They must have spent easily

783
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:54,933
two full days in the contest area.

784
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:00,720
Say hi, (indistinct).

785
00:38:03,631 --> 00:38:07,380
- [MUD Winner] We met
the (indistinct) guys

786
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:09,810
at about three in the
morning at DEF CON 27,

787
00:38:09,810 --> 00:38:13,110
and bonded over a mutual
love of Matt Damon.

788
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:16,320
And ever since then we've
been following them,

789
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,680
and we knew, we heard, we'd
get a picture taken with them

790
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:20,760
if we won this.

791
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:24,420
So we devoted our entire
conference to winning,

792
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:25,830
which we did.

793
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:27,080
Waiting for that picture.

794
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:37,620
- [Kabe] All right, very much
in the spirit of fuck it,

795
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:39,120
we're doing it live.

796
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,980
There are several slides I don't have,

797
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:44,820
I'm just going to be
bringing up more contests

798
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:47,670
that have winners to announce.

799
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:48,843
Bear with me a second.

800
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:00,467
- [PTFS Presents Speaker]
Good afternoon everyone.

801
00:39:00,467 --> 00:39:03,960
We are PTFS Presents Mayhem Industries,

802
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:06,180
PTFS is a CTF team.

803
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:09,270
We decided after a couple
years of doing quite well,

804
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:11,010
let's say, that we
wanted to run something.

805
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:13,140
Can we get our winning representative

806
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:14,590
or our winning teams up here?

807
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,340
If you all were in contests,

808
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:19,260
and you saw the oil rig flashing away,

809
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:21,930
or maybe something flashing
under a sheet, that was us.

810
00:39:21,930 --> 00:39:24,630
We had over 80 teams
with points on the board

811
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:26,730
by the end of the weekend, very exciting.

812
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:29,223
And a lot of people starting things out.

813
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:32,850
The top three teams.

814
00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:35,553
Do we have a representative
of team Auto Fill here?

815
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,290
Can we have Auto Fill come up please?

816
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:45,060
In third place team Auto Fill.

817
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:47,271
Congratulations.
- [Team Auto Fill] Thank you.

818
00:39:47,271 --> 00:39:48,104
- [PTFS Presents Speaker] Giving you a

819
00:39:48,104 --> 00:39:49,438
set of bumper keys here.

820
00:39:49,438 --> 00:39:53,340
(audience applauding)

821
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:57,633
Second place team Oil
Rig, come on up please.

822
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:02,313
We've got a fresh set of
tubular lock picks for you.

823
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,820
Now, during the course of our competition,

824
00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:08,790
people got a chance to hack an oil rig,

825
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:11,940
open an alien vault and
discover what was inside.

826
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:15,300
In this case, this wonderful
alien artifact here,

827
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:18,600
and this is going home
with our first place winner

828
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:19,743
Elbin Wifi.

829
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:22,200
Congratulations.
(audience applauding)

830
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,033
Welcome.

831
00:40:28,530 --> 00:40:29,940
Thank you so much.

832
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:31,740
I hope we'll be back here next year.

833
00:40:33,102 --> 00:40:36,269
(audience applauding)

834
00:40:57,810 --> 00:40:58,643
- [Man In Black] Thank you for coming,

835
00:40:58,643 --> 00:40:59,550
we're the Red Team CTF.

836
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:01,650
We just wanna say thank
you for all the players

837
00:41:01,650 --> 00:41:02,483
that we had playing this year,

838
00:41:02,483 --> 00:41:04,623
we had over 200 teams playing.

839
00:41:05,474 --> 00:41:06,683
One of my favorite parts here is just

840
00:41:06,683 --> 00:41:09,420
you get to meet all of
the different players,

841
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:10,980
helping them through the challenges.

842
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:12,810
And that's, I think, why we do it,

843
00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:15,665
we just love building the relationships.

844
00:41:15,665 --> 00:41:18,870
Meeting all the players and
all the hard work that they do.

845
00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:20,970
With that, there is a lot of
great competition this year,

846
00:41:20,970 --> 00:41:23,250
we saw a lot of movement on the board.

847
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:25,050
We'll talk a little bit about
the players here in a second,

848
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:29,400
but we had 85 challenges
spread out over two days.

849
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,810
And there was just a lot of teams

850
00:41:30,810 --> 00:41:32,190
working hard on 'em each and every day.

851
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:34,560
So it was really great to see that.

852
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:38,130
We had roughly over
10,000 flag submissions,

853
00:41:38,130 --> 00:41:40,770
so a lot of competition,
a lot of things going on,

854
00:41:40,770 --> 00:41:42,420
it was great to see everything.

855
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:44,070
And with that, I'm Alf Researcher,

856
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:45,562
and I'll turn over to (indistinct).

857
00:41:45,562 --> 00:41:46,395
- [Red Team Organizer]
Hey, I'm (indistinct).

858
00:41:46,395 --> 00:41:48,990
I just wanna introduce
the top three teams,

859
00:41:48,990 --> 00:41:50,580
they're coming up right now.

860
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:54,180
Third place, we have
international players,

861
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:56,040
they came all the way
down here, they focused.

862
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:58,050
We did in-person only this year,

863
00:41:58,050 --> 00:42:00,270
and they were down in the contest area.

864
00:42:00,270 --> 00:42:03,505
So CTF Singapore, third place.

865
00:42:03,505 --> 00:42:07,755
(audience cheering and applauding)

866
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:13,563
Then in second place we
had the Poner Puff Girls.

867
00:42:15,477 --> 00:42:18,644
(audience applauding)

868
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:24,513
I believe you're from all over, right?

869
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:28,177
- [Kabes] From planet Earth.

870
00:42:28,177 --> 00:42:30,923
- [Red Team Organizer] Planet Earth.

871
00:42:34,479 --> 00:42:38,040
We were very fortunate to
have over $70,000 in prizes,

872
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:40,290
we split that up amongst the top 10 teams.

873
00:42:40,290 --> 00:42:43,830
And taking home gold for the Red Team CTF,

874
00:42:43,830 --> 00:42:47,671
all the way from Norway is team EPT.

875
00:42:47,671 --> 00:42:51,921
(audience applauding and cheering)

876
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:56,753
And as they're coming up,

877
00:42:56,753 --> 00:42:59,280
I just wanna say thank
you to DEF CON organizers

878
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,866
for having us here,
this is our third year.

879
00:43:01,866 --> 00:43:04,290
It's great, every experience that we have.

880
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:06,300
Thank you for the GOONS,

881
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:08,670
they ensured that our
contest was very smooth.

882
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:11,100
We had no issues, thank you so much.

883
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:13,530
And last but not least,
thanks to all the players,

884
00:43:13,530 --> 00:43:15,780
they keep us motivated
to work on the challenges

885
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:16,613
throughout the year.

886
00:43:16,613 --> 00:43:18,120
And put in all this effort,

887
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:19,740
because it's just great to hang out.

888
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:22,410
This is the meeting place every year.

889
00:43:22,410 --> 00:43:24,021
Thank you.

890
00:43:24,021 --> 00:43:27,188
(audience applauding)

891
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:34,793
- [Kabes] All right,

892
00:43:34,793 --> 00:43:36,620
I think I'm forgetting
someone else, right?

893
00:43:50,370 --> 00:43:51,420
- [Dave] Hey DEF CON.

894
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:55,920
Dave here, we've been running
the maritime hacking CTF,

895
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:58,830
so it's SEATF, which works
better when there's a slide.

896
00:43:58,830 --> 00:44:01,740
But it's an opportunity
for teams to come in

897
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:02,970
and hack real maritime equipment.

898
00:44:02,970 --> 00:44:04,140
We brought about half a million dollars

899
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:06,120
worth of equipment for folks to hack on.

900
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:07,470
Most people don't get to attack a ship,

901
00:44:07,470 --> 00:44:10,140
so we had all the bridge
equipment, propulsion

902
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:12,390
and steering systems and Bala systems

903
00:44:12,390 --> 00:44:14,043
running the actual OT protocols.

904
00:44:15,212 --> 00:44:16,590
Had 22, 23 teams,

905
00:44:16,590 --> 00:44:19,040
hold on, I actually took
notes, give me a second.

906
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:26,550
We had 22 teams participating,

907
00:44:26,550 --> 00:44:29,490
they captured 186 flags
throughout the weekend.

908
00:44:29,490 --> 00:44:32,280
And spent a total of 1,871 minutes

909
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:33,960
actually connected to the hardware.

910
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:36,870
And so the first place team,
if they would come on up,

911
00:44:36,870 --> 00:44:40,410
it is the emoji team Ship
Wolf, Fire, Fire, Fire.

912
00:44:40,410 --> 00:44:45,053
And woo.
(audience applauding)

913
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:49,080
So this team actually spent the entire CON

914
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:51,120
sitting in our spaces
over in the ICS village.

915
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:54,390
It was a great opportunity
and a lot of fun here,

916
00:44:54,390 --> 00:44:56,460
and you want to give 'em
a good round of applause.

917
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:59,578
And thank you for letting us
run this great competition.

918
00:44:59,578 --> 00:45:02,745
(audience applauding)

919
00:45:23,595 --> 00:45:24,540
- [Trace Labs Presenter] Sorry about that.

920
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:27,240
I was complimenting
someone wearing our merch,

921
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:29,640
'cause it's really is all about me.

922
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:33,150
We are Trace Labs, we were
here for our fifth year,

923
00:45:33,150 --> 00:45:35,280
running our search party CTF.

924
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:38,520
This is a CTF that gamifies the collection

925
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:39,990
of open source intelligence

926
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:42,810
around actual missing persons cases.

927
00:45:42,810 --> 00:45:45,210
The end result is that data being

928
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:47,610
turned back over to law enforcement,

929
00:45:47,610 --> 00:45:50,220
hopefully aiding in the investigation

930
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:52,050
of that missing person.

931
00:45:52,050 --> 00:45:54,660
We made some really big
changes to our contest

932
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:58,560
right before DEF CON,
because that makes sense.

933
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:01,920
It went great, the quality
of the intel submitted

934
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:05,280
was better than any CTF we've ever run.

935
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:08,940
We saw 650 contestants...

936
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:12,420
Form 250 teams.

937
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:16,470
Investigating eight real
missing persons cases,

938
00:46:16,470 --> 00:46:20,583
submitting almost 4,000
pieces of intelligence.

939
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:24,420
Just a mind blowing experience.

940
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:27,780
We found missing persons
that were no longer missing,

941
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:29,250
hopefully law enforcement will be able

942
00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:31,653
to take those missing
people off their books.

943
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:33,920
Really just a great experience.

944
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:37,087
(audience applauding)

945
00:46:40,350 --> 00:46:41,220
Yes.

946
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:42,813
We have an amazing community,

947
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:45,720
personally, to me, the
points of the winners

948
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:48,270
are secondary to the
mission, but it is a CTF.

949
00:46:48,270 --> 00:46:51,303
So someone is going to win, Alex who won?

950
00:46:53,250 --> 00:46:57,900
- [Alex] Yeah, so we have
winners based on point values,

951
00:46:57,900 --> 00:47:00,000
and then our highest winner

952
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,730
is the one that submits the
most valuable (indistinct),

953
00:47:02,730 --> 00:47:05,280
so the most valuable
piece of intelligence.

954
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:08,820
So in our third place, we
had People of Osin Land.

955
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:11,700
Second place, we had B Berlin.

956
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:14,253
First place we had the FSBs.

957
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:18,240
For our MVO, we had received a photo taken

958
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:21,390
of the missing person stating
they had been found safe.

959
00:47:21,390 --> 00:47:25,170
So while many contestants
had found this flag,

960
00:47:25,170 --> 00:47:27,480
they had articulated the flag

961
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:31,590
and had cross-referenced it to
validate the source of truth.

962
00:47:31,590 --> 00:47:33,490
And with this, this is the type of

963
00:47:34,590 --> 00:47:37,260
significant advancement to the timeline,

964
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:39,090
and the type of submission and results

965
00:47:39,090 --> 00:47:41,343
that align heavily with our mission.

966
00:47:42,390 --> 00:47:45,963
Our winning team was
OX (indistinct) squad.

967
00:47:47,346 --> 00:47:50,513
(audience applauding)

968
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:00,123
- [Kabes] All right, thank you.

969
00:48:04,230 --> 00:48:09,230
- All right, so I feel like I
have to introduce this crew.

970
00:48:09,270 --> 00:48:11,330
They came here...

971
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:13,973
Not really knowing

972
00:48:13,973 --> 00:48:17,880
where they were gonna
land, because like this,

973
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:19,170
making it up as we go.

974
00:48:19,170 --> 00:48:22,650
And by the time we got them set up,

975
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:23,850
even though they didn't have a sign,

976
00:48:23,850 --> 00:48:26,430
even though initially they
didn't have a projector.

977
00:48:26,430 --> 00:48:28,530
Very, very...

978
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:30,060
Big crowd draw,

979
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:32,970
because they've been working
on this stuff all year.

980
00:48:32,970 --> 00:48:33,803
You know what?

981
00:48:33,803 --> 00:48:34,950
I'm just gonna let them tell you.

982
00:48:36,748 --> 00:48:37,620
- [Atomic Security
Team] What's up DEF CON?

983
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:39,240
We're Atomic Security Team,

984
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:40,920
this is our first time running an open CTF

985
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:42,750
at DEF CON the contest area.

986
00:48:42,750 --> 00:48:44,700
Like Kabes said, we wanna
give her a awesome shout out,

987
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:47,100
'cause she's been super
helpful this whole time.

988
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:50,400
We showed up with nothing,
we started on the ground,

989
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,290
and then as the time
progressed we got a table,

990
00:48:52,290 --> 00:48:55,050
and then we got a projector
and then we got a screen.

991
00:48:55,050 --> 00:48:55,883
It was awesome.

992
00:48:56,935 --> 00:48:58,533
- [Kabes] Next year you can have a sign.

993
00:48:58,533 --> 00:48:59,366
- [Atomic Security
Team] Next year we might

994
00:48:59,366 --> 00:49:02,283
have a sign she says, it'll be artistic.

995
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:06,030
So we ran a jeopardy-style
CTF with 16 challenges.

996
00:49:06,030 --> 00:49:07,830
We had different types of challenges,

997
00:49:07,830 --> 00:49:10,020
we had web challenges,
we had crypto challenges,

998
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:14,040
we had programming challenges
and backend server challenges.

999
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:17,280
We gave away around 200
PCB challenge coins,

1000
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:18,750
we had 60 shirts giveaway.

1001
00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:20,580
We were about to give
hundreds of dollars away

1002
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:23,550
at Amazon gift cards
to the top 10 streams.

1003
00:49:23,550 --> 00:49:27,933
And I'll let Jiva here announce the stats.

1004
00:49:28,770 --> 00:49:30,600
- [Jiva] Hey everybody, just a few stats,

1005
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:34,140
we had 200 flags captured across 42 teams.

1006
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:36,210
The first place winner was Huber,

1007
00:49:36,210 --> 00:49:38,540
they solved almost all the
challenges except for one.

1008
00:49:38,540 --> 00:49:39,960
In second place was Coco.

1009
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:41,820
And third place was Buzz.

1010
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:43,200
We wanna give a special shout out

1011
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:48,200
to the fourth place contestant, Percent S.

1012
00:49:48,270 --> 00:49:50,670
This person was a single
player high schooler

1013
00:49:50,670 --> 00:49:53,130
that dominated for most,

1014
00:49:53,130 --> 00:49:54,570
the majority of the competition.

1015
00:49:54,570 --> 00:49:56,982
So shout outs to wherever you are.

1016
00:49:56,982 --> 00:49:59,700
(audience applauding)

1017
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:03,600
The final leaderboard is
available at ctf.atomic.financial.

1018
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:04,980
The top three teams, wherever you are,

1019
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:06,360
please meet us over there somewhere,

1020
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:08,730
we'll give you some hats, shirts.

1021
00:50:08,730 --> 00:50:09,990
Thank you to the GOONS,

1022
00:50:09,990 --> 00:50:13,050
thank you to Kabes once
again for hooking us up.

1023
00:50:13,050 --> 00:50:14,250
Thank you DEF CON,

1024
00:50:14,250 --> 00:50:16,043
hopefully we'll be here next year, see ya.

1025
00:50:28,530 --> 00:50:29,760
- [Presenter] The tele challenge is one of

1026
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:32,013
the hardest contests at DEF CON.

1027
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:36,090
People spend their entire DEF CON to play,

1028
00:50:36,090 --> 00:50:40,630
and I'm very, very proud
of Fox Box Dialing Services

1029
00:50:40,630 --> 00:50:43,184
who won the tele challenge this year.

1030
00:50:43,184 --> 00:50:45,990
(audience applauding)

1031
00:50:45,990 --> 00:50:47,433
Come on up on stage guys,

1032
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:55,440
These guys gave up 1,489 minutes.

1033
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:58,650
To become the winners of the
tele challenge this year.

1034
00:50:58,650 --> 00:51:01,380
We spend pretty much all year building it,

1035
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:04,500
and part of the puzzle is
learning that you're in a puzzle.

1036
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:06,510
We showed up as Red Sea Cruises this year,

1037
00:51:06,510 --> 00:51:10,260
so you may have won a free
cruise flyer, that was us.

1038
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:12,270
That's actually a sequel of our 2018 game,

1039
00:51:12,270 --> 00:51:14,520
where we also showed
up as Red Sea Cruises.

1040
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:15,960
just a couple of stats.

1041
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:19,690
3,940 calls came into our systems

1042
00:51:22,365 --> 00:51:24,807
across the 20 registered
teams that played,

1043
00:51:24,807 --> 00:51:25,640
with 294 unique callers.

1044
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:28,980
Total time spent on hold was 955 minutes,

1045
00:51:28,980 --> 00:51:32,190
and one person sat on hold for 90 minutes.

1046
00:51:32,190 --> 00:51:35,970
There were 4,402 attacks
on voicemail boxes,

1047
00:51:35,970 --> 00:51:39,660
and we built a casino inside
the game, if you played.

1048
00:51:39,660 --> 00:51:42,780
The total Telecoin
casino slot machine polls

1049
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:44,223
were 6,163.

1050
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:49,296
Red box, red box, red box.

1051
00:51:49,296 --> 00:51:53,250
We'd like to invite everybody
to look for us next year.

1052
00:51:53,250 --> 00:51:55,410
Keep in mind, We never show
up as the tele challenge,

1053
00:51:55,410 --> 00:51:57,090
we show up as something else.

1054
00:51:57,090 --> 00:51:58,590
You need to be prepared to play,

1055
00:51:58,590 --> 00:52:01,230
and you must play in a
team if you wanna win.

1056
00:52:01,230 --> 00:52:04,260
So I'm so proud of Fox
Box Dialing Services,

1057
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:07,530
they've been trying to play
and win for five years,

1058
00:52:07,530 --> 00:52:09,630
and this year they finally got it.

1059
00:52:09,630 --> 00:52:10,752
Congratulations.

1060
00:52:10,752 --> 00:52:13,919
(audience applauding)

1061
00:52:29,220 --> 00:52:31,260
- All right, we are Crash Compile,

1062
00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:34,410
which is we create programming challenges,

1063
00:52:34,410 --> 00:52:35,820
make you do them live on stage

1064
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:38,280
while we try to feed you a lot of beer

1065
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:41,013
and try to distract you
in any other way possible.

1066
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:46,500
We had 70 teams register
to do qualifications,

1067
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:48,090
and then we did the top nine teams

1068
00:52:48,090 --> 00:52:49,710
on the main contest floor.

1069
00:52:49,710 --> 00:52:52,770
If you were there last night
there was a lot of chaos.

1070
00:52:52,770 --> 00:52:56,730
For the first time ever
every team competing,

1071
00:52:56,730 --> 00:53:00,510
both scored points and scored
points on the final challenge.

1072
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:01,980
Which means despite all the beers,

1073
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:04,980
all of the distraction, all of the chaos,

1074
00:53:04,980 --> 00:53:07,730
every team was still there
and competing until the end.

1075
00:53:08,580 --> 00:53:10,050
For our final problem this year

1076
00:53:10,050 --> 00:53:13,620
teams were competing with each
other in a multiplayer arena.

1077
00:53:13,620 --> 00:53:15,240
They had to write a
program that could explore,

1078
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:18,480
take over and maintain
their stake of the arena

1079
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:21,153
for the entire duration
of the competition.

1080
00:53:22,470 --> 00:53:26,760
Team Jam was our winner
this year with 406 points,

1081
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:29,818
and took home the custom
fabricated Crash Compile trophy,

1082
00:53:29,818 --> 00:53:32,850
our giant metal D10 covered
in programming language

1083
00:53:32,850 --> 00:53:34,200
from Crash Compile history.

1084
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:39,570
Second place with 368 Pro Game Moves,

1085
00:53:39,570 --> 00:53:44,157
and third place at 258 was
Advanced Persistence Sweats.

1086
00:53:44,157 --> 00:53:47,324
(audience applauding)

1087
00:53:58,380 --> 00:54:02,370
- All right, before they start
playing the music that...

1088
00:54:02,370 --> 00:54:05,010
Oh man, I have fucked it up again.

1089
00:54:05,010 --> 00:54:06,653
- [Jeff] The last one, I promise.

1090
00:54:09,930 --> 00:54:12,060
- [Kabes] It's okay, I'll drink later.

1091
00:54:12,060 --> 00:54:13,350
I'll do it, I promise.

1092
00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:14,940
- Hey guys, my name is Jeff,

1093
00:54:14,940 --> 00:54:16,110
I go by the handle Morph here.

1094
00:54:16,110 --> 00:54:18,060
If anyone is in the room who is competing

1095
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:20,520
in the king of the hill
challenge for Tamper Evident,

1096
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:23,760
can you start making your
way up to the stage please?

1097
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,350
You, you, yep.

1098
00:54:25,350 --> 00:54:26,900
Any of my guys come on up here.

1099
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:31,800
So Tamper Evident, I'm gonna
try to keep this quick.

1100
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:33,510
Tamper Evident is right
next to lock picking,

1101
00:54:33,510 --> 00:54:35,730
we tamper seals.

1102
00:54:35,730 --> 00:54:37,500
This is what a seal looks like.

1103
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:40,500
These guys have been competing
in five separate categories

1104
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:42,300
over the course of the weekend

1105
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:45,530
to open these seals that are locked...

1106
00:54:47,850 --> 00:54:49,380
In a one way manner, right?

1107
00:54:49,380 --> 00:54:50,610
They're not supposed to be unlocked,

1108
00:54:50,610 --> 00:54:53,640
there is no picking here,
this is a one way seal.

1109
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:55,428
These guys have been devising defeats

1110
00:54:55,428 --> 00:54:57,240
through the entire weekend,

1111
00:54:57,240 --> 00:55:00,000
cutting each other down second by second,

1112
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,160
trying to get to the fastest possible open

1113
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:04,710
without leaving any detectable trace.

1114
00:55:04,710 --> 00:55:06,510
Guys, start making your way up here.

1115
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:10,500
We have five different
categories of entry,

1116
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:12,640
these different categories were

1117
00:55:13,590 --> 00:55:17,520
a red and black little zip seal.

1118
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:21,300
We have a yellow padlock
seal, we have a red zip tie,

1119
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:23,883
which looks a little bit like this.

1120
00:55:24,750 --> 00:55:26,250
And we had a white plunger.

1121
00:55:26,250 --> 00:55:29,070
And of these different
categories these guys

1122
00:55:29,070 --> 00:55:32,040
started by opening them in
a couple minutes, right?

1123
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:34,080
People were bleeding all over the seals,

1124
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:37,680
not quite evident, you might say.

1125
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:39,743
- [Kabes] Safety third is so important.

1126
00:55:39,743 --> 00:55:41,850
- So by the end of it some of these guys

1127
00:55:41,850 --> 00:55:46,530
were opening these seals in
less than 20 seconds, at speed.

1128
00:55:46,530 --> 00:55:48,360
Leaving absolutely no trace left behind,

1129
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:51,150
with homemade tools
macgyvered at the competition.

1130
00:55:51,150 --> 00:55:54,420
So to announce our winners L. E. Aser

1131
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:57,663
opening the red and black
seal in 12.97 seconds.

1132
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:01,140
Zebb, if you're out there or up here,

1133
00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:03,840
opening the yellow padlock at a 9.5,

1134
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:05,283
damn near perfect open.

1135
00:56:06,510 --> 00:56:08,670
Let's go with Cardinal, if you're here.

1136
00:56:08,670 --> 00:56:09,690
Right here.

1137
00:56:09,690 --> 00:56:11,490
One of our number one guys,

1138
00:56:11,490 --> 00:56:16,490
beating down everyone you see
here in every category slowly,

1139
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:21,243
at a 23 second open on
this particular seal.

1140
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:25,890
And finally Ian, with
a white plunger open,

1141
00:56:25,890 --> 00:56:27,390
again, these things are used

1142
00:56:27,390 --> 00:56:29,340
to lock weapons in the military.

1143
00:56:29,340 --> 00:56:32,040
They're used to do your meters at home

1144
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:35,710
for electricity and
water, that type of thing.

1145
00:56:35,710 --> 00:56:38,460
These guys were able to
open these in seconds

1146
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:40,230
with homemade tools,

1147
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:43,800
and do so in a way that
leaves no trace whatsoever.

1148
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:45,960
Guys, thank you so much for
competing at Temper Evident,

1149
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:47,594
shout out.

1150
00:56:47,594 --> 00:56:50,820
And lastly, we also allegedly

1151
00:56:50,820 --> 00:56:53,340
were maybe the guys involved with

1152
00:56:53,340 --> 00:56:55,353
the counterfeit badge contest.

1153
00:56:56,679 --> 00:57:00,360
So that you might have seen
some of these floating around,

1154
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:02,644
there's also a few out there right now.

1155
00:57:02,644 --> 00:57:05,970
Shout out to Cookie Fairy with a near

1156
00:57:05,970 --> 00:57:08,730
perfect replica of a HUMAN badge.

1157
00:57:08,730 --> 00:57:13,200
Shout out to the CJer for a
perfect replica of a GOON badge.

1158
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:16,549
Good job getting into
the knock, impressive.

1159
00:57:16,549 --> 00:57:19,716
(audience applauding)

1160
00:57:22,313 --> 00:57:25,307
Yeah, that's Tampa Evident
village for you guys.

1161
00:57:25,307 --> 00:57:26,490
Thank you very much,

1162
00:57:26,490 --> 00:57:28,020
and congratulations to our winners.

1163
00:57:28,020 --> 00:57:29,402
Thank you.

1164
00:57:29,402 --> 00:57:32,569
(audience applauding)

1165
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:43,440
- [Kabes] All right, I think
I got it right this time.

1166
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:48,440
I think that covers all of the
contests and events that...

1167
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:56,460
Well, they put on great contests.

1168
00:57:56,460 --> 00:57:58,950
Sorry, really stressing here.

1169
00:57:58,950 --> 00:58:01,050
But something that I really wanted to say,

1170
00:58:01,050 --> 00:58:02,580
even though I know I have to wrap up here

1171
00:58:02,580 --> 00:58:05,700
is my reminder every year,

1172
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:08,763
if there was a contest
that you didn't see,

1173
00:58:09,630 --> 00:58:12,780
that's a place for you to
become a part of this community.

1174
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:16,350
Everyone here wanted to
create something new,

1175
00:58:16,350 --> 00:58:17,880
so they made it happen.

1176
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:22,113
I don't have contests and
events without you guys.

1177
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:27,870
For every time a contest thanks me,

1178
00:58:27,870 --> 00:58:30,993
I'm just doing my job,
sometimes not even that well.

1179
00:58:32,454 --> 00:58:34,713
But thank you so much everybody.

1180
00:58:37,470 --> 00:58:42,180
I don't know, go enjoy
the rest of your DEF CON.

1181
00:58:42,180 --> 00:58:44,130
I hear there's another closing ceremony,

1182
00:58:44,130 --> 00:58:46,215
I don't know, this is the good one, right?

1183
00:58:46,215 --> 00:58:48,688
(audience applauding)
