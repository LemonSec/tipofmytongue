1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,190
- Hi everybody, my name is Xan North,

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:04,530
I'm a member of Distributed
Denial of Secrets,

3
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:07,023
and you are here at Leak The Planet,

4
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:11,883
or How You Learned To Stop
Worrying And Love The Leak.

5
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:19,713
Who we are, well, we are
a bunch of cat lovers,

6
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:26,223
as you can see, and dog lovers.

7
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:34,950
And then there are a bunch
of humans that don't matter,

8
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:37,650
we have Emma Best right here,

9
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:39,720
and the rest of these are people

10
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,303
that also work with
Distributed Denial of Secrets,

11
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:45,470
but I all know you want
us to bring back pets.

12
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:49,620
So first of all, we have
Types of Leaks and Leakers,

13
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:52,650
leaking is as value
neutral as pharmacology,

14
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:55,680
it comes down to intent and application.

15
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,680
We have Insiders, Hactivists, Spillage,

16
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,780
State Affiliated Actors, and Ransomware,

17
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,670
and we'll go through all of those,

18
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:04,833
what they are, what they mean.

19
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,910
Insiders, so cognitive
dissidence addresses itself

20
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:11,200
through leaks, a lot of
people when they join

21
00:01:12,038 --> 00:01:15,180
an organization, they may have ideas

22
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:17,160
about how that organization works

23
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:20,313
that don't necessarily come to fruition.

24
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:25,440
Examples of insiders are Daniel
Ellsberg, Chelsea Manning,

25
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:28,890
Edward Snowden, Reality
Winner, Natalie May Edwards,

26
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:30,693
and Johanna Stefansson.

27
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:34,410
Next we have hactivists,
not all whistleblowers

28
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:37,470
are insiders, some of them
come in from the outside.

29
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:40,230
Good examples of that
are RedHack, Anonymous,

30
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:43,290
Jeremy Hammond, Phineas Fisher, ACABGang,

31
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:45,333
Cyber Partisans, and donk_enby.

32
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:49,740
Next we have spillage,
which is pretty much

33
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,240
when a stereo falls off a truck

34
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,863
on the information superhighway.

35
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,640
This is typically an
accidental release of data

36
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,370
that's a result of user error.

37
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:01,320
Examples are Heritage Foundation,

38
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,950
Police aerial surveillance
footage, and GiveSendGo,

39
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:08,010
GiveSendGo, particularly,
they were warned repeatedly

40
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:10,050
that their S3 buckets were misconfigured,

41
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:11,670
they never took any action,

42
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:15,690
and well, they got leaked.

43
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:17,430
Services like Grayhat
Warfare make misconfigured

44
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:20,640
S3 buckets easy to find in search.

45
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,240
Many leaks are avoided
by disclosure protocols,

46
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,945
again, going back to GiveSendGo,

47
00:02:26,945 --> 00:02:29,820
they were warned repeatedly
and they did nothing.

48
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:32,730
And then when their leak
finally did come out,

49
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:34,893
they denounced it as fake news,

50
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:39,720
nothing, they weren't really hacked.

51
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:43,320
So, next we have state affiliated actors,

52
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:46,080
you probably love them when they're yours.

53
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,880
We have Sabu, Popov,
CyberBerkut, Guccifer 2.0,

54
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,523
DC Leaks, IT ARMY, and Conti.

55
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:58,800
And then ransomware,
very little of this data

56
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,990
merits journalistic or academic review,

57
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:03,690
but there are some gems,
example, Jones Day,

58
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:08,280
Chicago City Hall, Metropolitan
Police Department DC,

59
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,743
Illinois Attorney General, and Perceptics.

60
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,610
Some declared political stances following

61
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:16,890
the Russian invasion of Ukraine,

62
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:19,920
and financial motives
mean they can be hired

63
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,223
by state actors, example
of that would be Conti.

64
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:34,500
- So next we move on
to Publication Models,

65
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:38,760
which also serves as a
brief, all too brief history

66
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:43,760
of recent leaks and
ways of leaking, thanks.

67
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:47,280
First up, one of the
oldest leaking institutions

68
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,860
that's still active in the Western world,

69
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:53,910
Cryptome, everybody's best friend.

70
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:58,110
They've been publishing
censored and leaked material

71
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:03,000
online since 1996, using
basic HTTP listings,

72
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,210
and for a time an FTP server as well.

73
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:08,970
They helped found WikiLeaks,
they were on the initial

74
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:13,620
advisory board and they helped
register the domain name,

75
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,810
but like I said, they criticize freely,

76
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:18,300
and that includes WikiLeaks,

77
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:21,420
although they strongly
oppose the extradition

78
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:25,800
and prosecution of
Assange and gave testimony

79
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,430
in one of the cases against him

80
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:32,100
for the extradition attempt.

81
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:35,700
And to this day, Cryptome
continues to be active,

82
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:39,930
which is a minor miracle
considering it's been

83
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:43,920
nearly 30 years, and they've faced threats

84
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,890
from multiple corporate entities,

85
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:50,610
as well as government agencies
that have visited them

86
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:53,190
and had all sorts of questions,

87
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:55,080
and were often angry at them

88
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,650
for making public documents too public,

89
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:01,713
because what if people read them.

90
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:07,650
Cryptome very naturally
brings us into WikiLeaks,

91
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:11,550
they wore every hat until
they wore virtually none.

92
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:13,470
They were revolutionary at times,

93
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:15,360
a lot of debate was sparked,

94
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,260
and then they were used
by Russian intelligence.

95
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:22,260
We know from exchanged
messages that they received

96
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:25,410
the DNC emails from Guccifer 2.0,

97
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:29,280
and they appear to have
received the Podesta emails

98
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,240
from DC Leaks, also based on messages

99
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,670
that we know of.

100
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:39,720
Their last original leak
was, I believe, late 2019,

101
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:44,310
and that was one of the OPCW leaks,

102
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:47,880
which that series has been
tied to Russian intelligence,

103
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:51,690
again, by a series of articles
written by Daily Beast,

104
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:53,610
New Lines Magazine, and Bellingcat,

105
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:55,590
those are all very worth reading,

106
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:58,650
because Russian embassies and diplomats

107
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:02,310
are directly involved,
and a sting operation

108
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:04,620
was able to reveal quite a bit.

109
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:07,500
And unfortunately, WikiLeaks
throughout its history

110
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,560
has suffered a lot of instability

111
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,513
and periods of inoperability.

112
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:16,710
There was the 2010 incident
where their infrastructure

113
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:20,767
was taken down, there was 2011 or 2012

114
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:26,280
through 2015, I believe where
they had no submission portal,

115
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,740
they recently lost their
submission portal again,

116
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:33,413
and only very recently launched
a portal that almost works.

117
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,910
It will upload files, but
sources will never know

118
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:40,683
if it succeeded in uploading them.

119
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:46,050
Which brings us next to
Anonymous' answer to WikiLeaks,

120
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:49,950
launched during a feud in 2012 and 2013,

121
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:53,610
they called it Paranoia,
short for Potentially Alarming

122
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:57,630
Research from the Anonymous
Intelligence Agency.

123
00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:01,020
Anonymous was frustrated by
WikiLeaks' slow releases,

124
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,420
and WikiLeaks for their part of the feud,

125
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:07,353
was accusing Anonymous
of insecure methods.

126
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:11,070
And at this time,
WikiLeaks' submission system

127
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:14,910
was offline while Paranoia
was meant to be a quick,

128
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:17,880
simple leak platform, but unfortunately,

129
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,160
that was one of the problems with Paranoia

130
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,700
as it was very easily exploited.

131
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:27,450
Some of the release notes
were highly inaccurate,

132
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:29,850
and given the context
of those inaccuracies,

133
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:32,970
that certainly had an agenda with them,

134
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:36,810
and it was in particularly
used by Maksym Popov

135
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:38,703
to help launder some of this data.

136
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,210
Next we have groups like the Intercept

137
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:44,580
where they're literally
building journalism

138
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,530
from the ground up around leaks,

139
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:50,220
and I know we all have
thoughts about the Intercept,

140
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:54,450
and certain people that
worked there and no longer do,

141
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:57,450
mistakes they've been
made by individuals there,

142
00:07:57,450 --> 00:08:00,810
and yeah, we could say
that about any outlet,

143
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:05,010
but the lessons from the
Intercept are still very useful,

144
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:07,950
because they built it from the ground up

145
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:10,500
to allow this kind of research.

146
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:14,820
And they even tried to extend
it beyond their own borders

147
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,440
a bit with the Snowden archive,

148
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,020
which unfortunately was closed,

149
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:21,780
but they continue to be active
and report on large leaks

150
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:24,780
to this day, including
partnering with regional outlets

151
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:27,810
in some instances, such
as data sets relating

152
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:30,393
to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

153
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:33,960
Which brings us to the Consortium Model,

154
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:38,000
where we have groups like
ARIJ, EIC, Forbidden Stories,

155
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,060
ICIJ, and OCCRP, you can see on the slide

156
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:44,430
a list of a number of
high profile projects,

157
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:46,920
most of them dealing with finance

158
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,620
that the consortium model all dealt with,

159
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:53,190
and because of the international
nature of these projects,

160
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:56,940
consortiums are uniquely
able to go after the data,

161
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:00,360
because you need local
experience for each realm,

162
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,750
you need multiple experts,
you need boots on the ground,

163
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:07,533
and no one outlet can
realistically handle that.

164
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:10,560
They rarely publish raw data,

165
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,770
but sometimes they do
publish relational data,

166
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:18,570
which you see with ICIJ,
and some of their databases,

167
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:20,163
which are publicly available.

168
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:25,593
And then there's these
people called DDoSecrets,

169
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:32,340
that's us, in the last four years,

170
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:34,890
we've published leaks
from over 50 countries

171
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:39,890
and over 200 releases, that
number's a bit out of date,

172
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,610
but we're constantly trying to balance

173
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:46,830
source protection with
source transparency,

174
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:50,580
which is a major issue,
especially with things like

175
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,770
the Russian Ukrainian war, we have people

176
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:56,850
sending us data sets, and
there's a very obvious

177
00:09:56,850 --> 00:10:00,510
question when it's something
that gets the cyber war tag

178
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:03,330
that we created, awarding
people to the context

179
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:07,770
and that there's no specific
suspicion for these data sets,

180
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:10,170
but it's still something
that you should look at

181
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:11,973
more closely and be more aware of.

182
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:17,550
We also strongly focus
on separating editorial

183
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:22,260
and what the meaning of the leak is,

184
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:25,140
from what we do, which
is presenting the data

185
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:28,770
we will help journalists
interpret it as best we can,

186
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:30,480
but we don't tell them what to write,

187
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:35,347
we don't present our own
analysis of it, because one,

188
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:38,430
we have data from over 50 countries

189
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:41,820
and over 200 organizations
that range from topics

190
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:46,310
of artificial intelligence to manufacture

191
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:51,570
of nuclear power plants, we are not,

192
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:56,040
and cannot ever be experts
on all of these subjects,

193
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,230
nevermind the language barriers.

194
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:01,260
It is better left for the
people who are already experts

195
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:05,010
in that than for us to
try to become everything.

196
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:07,443
Oh, I seem to have hit, sorry about that.

197
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,310
And this also helps prevent our biases

198
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:15,210
from getting in the way
of what the data says,

199
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:17,040
because when you touch this much data

200
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,840
and you bring it to the public,

201
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:22,860
it is very easy to infect
it with your point of view

202
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:26,550
and your messaging, and it can't become

203
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:29,250
an inherent part of the data.

204
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:32,250
One thing we witnessed with
WikiLeaks and the Vault 7

205
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:36,660
releases was, they wrote about

206
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:41,340
how certain devices could be exploited

207
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:43,920
and how that could then be leveraged

208
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:48,540
to get past the encryption on things like

209
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:51,270
Signal and WhatsApp, by
making the encryption

210
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:54,990
literally irrelevant, but people took away

211
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:57,510
the wrong message from
that for several articles

212
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:59,520
and a large number of people on Twitter,

213
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:04,080
because of a imperfectly crafted tweet.

214
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:07,830
And so we have a great
responsibility to not do that,

215
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:12,600
our goal is to collect
the data, review it,

216
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,810
and then entrust local
reporters, investigators,

217
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:19,050
and hactivists, and
experts to follow through,

218
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:23,073
and in many situations to
find the right consortium.

219
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:29,400
Moving on, we get into
actual state hackers.

220
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:33,480
DC Leaks was an exercise in
Persona and Access Management,

221
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,060
while some of the data was
public, not all of it was,

222
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:38,460
which was a way of playing favoritism,

223
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:41,700
a way of creating mystique, and hiding

224
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:45,540
some of the overlap
between various releases.

225
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,400
DC Leaks was later linked to fake

226
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,550
journalist personas by investigations

227
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:54,840
and especially forensic ones,

228
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:58,110
which followed different digital accounts,

229
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,930
and there were early, and unclear,

230
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:03,200
and inconsistent ties to Guccifer 2.0

231
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,870
established publicly
early on, for instance,

232
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:10,860
the email in which Guccifer
2.0 said that DC Leaks

233
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:14,370
was a WikiLeaks sub-project,
and they provided

234
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:18,243
restricted access to DC Leaks' releases.

235
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:24,360
Thus, we have Guccifer
2.0 selling the narrative,

236
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,390
which was launched obviously to

237
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,060
counter the revelation that was then

238
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:40,800
new of Russian hacking of
the DNC, DCCC, et cetera.

239
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,890
They used a combination of
blog and social media posts

240
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:47,130
with individual documents, some
of which had been tampered,

241
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:49,020
and larger dumps.

242
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:52,740
We know from government
investigations that Guccifer 2.0

243
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:56,853
communicated with over
12,000 Twitter accounts,

244
00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:01,080
exchanging over 15,000 messages.

245
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,360
We've only managed to identify so far

246
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,110
about 10% of those messages, and far fewer

247
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:09,674
than 10% of the accounts

248
00:14:09,674 --> 00:14:12,600
that communicated with Guccifer 2.0,

249
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:17,160
but the known discussions
are part of the transcript

250
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:21,690
cited at the end of this,
thus spoke Guccifer 2.0,

251
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:24,720
and we also know from the
messages that they were active

252
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,420
nearly 24 hours a day
when they were active,

253
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:28,720
which is another giveaway.

254
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:33,210
So what does State-Affiliated
actually look like?

255
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:37,710
Because everyone has ideas
of what they think it is

256
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:41,370
or what they think other
people think it is,

257
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:44,910
and you especially see
that as a political weapon,

258
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:47,553
which is nonsense and infuriating.

259
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:53,550
Popov, Maksym Igor Popov
was a Russian contractor

260
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:57,993
who infiltrated Anonymous,
and before that, the FBI.

261
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,730
He was arrested by the FBI
and turned into an asset,

262
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:06,000
and on his first job, he
was sent after the people

263
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,790
that he used to work with, but the FBI

264
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:10,950
didn't actually watch very closely

265
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:14,550
what he said in Russian,
and by using some unique

266
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:19,550
idioms that were a little
less known to the translators,

267
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:21,570
he warned them what was happening

268
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:25,470
and they were able to get away free,

269
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:27,360
but he then went on to
help them with a number

270
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,790
of other things before being let go

271
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:33,540
under questionable circumstances,

272
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:35,933
and when I say questionable,

273
00:15:35,933 --> 00:15:38,130
I mean the FBI agent responsible

274
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:41,973
was investigated and
nearly indicted over it.

275
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:48,150
He was involved in the
2004, 2005 FBI email hack,

276
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:49,980
didn't get a lot of coverage at the time,

277
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:53,010
but they didn't hack the FBI directly,

278
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:57,270
but rather the AT&T
servers that the FBI used

279
00:15:57,270 --> 00:16:00,750
for a number of their things,
including their emails,

280
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:03,630
and these were sensitive emails.

281
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:08,430
And Popov was never so much a technical

282
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:11,850
hacker himself, but he
was the person on the crew

283
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:14,760
that made things happen,
he developed relationships

284
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:19,410
and he monetized things,
and so he got the FBI

285
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:22,890
to pay him and his people $10,000

286
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:27,870
for a meaningless lead on the hack

287
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:30,990
that they had just
committed against the FBI.

288
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,210
They identified one of
the people involved,

289
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:36,900
Leonid Sokolov, who cannot be indicted

290
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:41,130
and is never going to leave
to go to an indictable area.

291
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:44,070
Popov used numerous false personas,

292
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:48,270
and some of them are linked
to some very interesting

293
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:52,350
other hack and leak
situations, for instance,

294
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:56,040
the hack and leak of
Ukrainian Prosecutor-General,

295
00:16:56,040 --> 00:17:00,390
which was done by Popov,
overlaps significantly

296
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:02,940
with CyberBerkut's similar release,

297
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:05,733
right down to the same
office and timeline,

298
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,420
although, their release
was much more limited

299
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:13,050
to a few documents, Popov released several

300
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:16,890
gigabytes from that
office and several others.

301
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:20,040
And he's obviously financially motivated,

302
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,380
but aside from his own admissions

303
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:25,890
to being a state contractor for Russia,

304
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:27,900
which he said to Jeffrey Carr,

305
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:30,330
and has implied to other journalists,

306
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:33,900
there is the fact that if
you are living in Russia

307
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:38,250
and you hack the FBI, and it is that

308
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:41,820
high profile, and you do not pay patronage

309
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:46,773
to mother Russia, you lose all protection.

310
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,410
It is exceedingly unlikely,
simply based on that,

311
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:56,490
but also the reward, there's no reason

312
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:58,090
they wouldn't have pursued that.

313
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:02,040
Which brings us to Sabu,
everyone's favorite

314
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,233
American state sponsored hacker.

315
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,400
A member of Anonymous
turned to an FBI asset,

316
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,010
while he was active, the
FBI closely monitored

317
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:13,170
and controlled him after his arrest,

318
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:15,150
they watched what was on his monitor,

319
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:19,260
they took pictures of it,
they were involved every day,

320
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:21,690
and they had the opportunity to direct him

321
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:24,603
to do things differently,
or to stop entirely.

322
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,740
Through their observation, control,

323
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:32,043
and failure to stop, they directed him.

324
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:37,500
That is beyond a doubt,
and those directions

325
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,680
included having Sabu direct cyber attacks

326
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:43,650
on foreign government
and commercial systems,

327
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:47,040
as well as orchestrating
the Stratfor hack and leak,

328
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:50,043
and his unwitting
collaboration with Popov,

329
00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:53,430
which is a very fun thing to discover

330
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:56,400
when you're going through leaked chats.

331
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,190
But Sabu was more than
just a criminal informant,

332
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:01,710
by doing these things,
the FBI was using him

333
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:05,163
for foreign and domestic
intelligence gathering for the FBI.

334
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,220
So what about the links between

335
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,663
people like Popov and Sabu?

336
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:15,090
When the lines blur, these
people enable each other,

337
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:18,330
and that's not just Popov and Sabu,

338
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:20,730
that's a general trend.

339
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:24,720
Sabu and Paranoia both
laundered Popov's leaks,

340
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,690
we can see in chats where
Popov literally gives them

341
00:19:30,039 --> 00:19:32,947
to Sabu, and Sabu puts them forth saying,

342
00:19:32,947 --> 00:19:35,820
"It's an AntiSec release,
it's a LulzSec release,"

343
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:39,150
and they're the most shady
ones, and in several instances,

344
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:41,640
people who were actually
involved in those groups

345
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,680
then became very concerned afterwards

346
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:47,130
about issues with those data sets.

347
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:49,740
Sabu also offered Popov early access

348
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:53,400
to the Syria emails released by WikiLeaks,

349
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,960
and that's significant as well,

350
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,350
because not only was
the one banking transfer

351
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:01,800
email missing from the WikiLeaks release,

352
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:05,790
but over 1 million of
the 2.4 million emails

353
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:09,750
is not been published by WikiLeaks.

354
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,690
You can review this on
the WikiLeaks website,

355
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:17,280
or I wrote about it on my site, emma.best,

356
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,750
where you can also download a script

357
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,703
and manually verify it yourself.

358
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:25,050
And that is one mystery that they have

359
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:28,503
failed to follow up on or comment on,

360
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:31,950
but maybe it's the same
secret lizards thing

361
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:35,010
that they commented
about the Clinton leaks,

362
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:37,910
it's a true story, you can
find it in the Wayback Machine.

363
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,370
While they were working together,

364
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:44,730
Popov and Sabu actively
discussed using cyber attacks

365
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:48,390
on government systems, and
using false flag cyber attacks

366
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:51,420
to quote, create real cyberwar.

367
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:54,840
Keep in mind, during this time,

368
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:58,230
Sabu was under the FBI's control.

369
00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:01,110
He was having ongoing
discussions with people

370
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:03,570
about false flag cyber attacks,

371
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:06,240
with the goal of creating, not just chaos,

372
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:11,240
but conflict, and Popov's activities

373
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:16,520
included faking funding of terrorism,

374
00:21:16,571 --> 00:21:21,060
by one country he is actually
one of the only people who,

375
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:23,880
in the modern era can
say he has pissed off

376
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:28,140
both the FBI and the KGB, because Belarus

377
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:31,740
does not like him after
some of the shit he pulled.

378
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:34,500
And Popov even gave Sabu targets,

379
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,600
targets and credentials,
and we know that those

380
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,610
were passed on, some
of them were even given

381
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:42,240
to Jeremy Hammond, and if
you look at the unredacted

382
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,460
paperwork for his court case,

383
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:47,280
some of which was leaked to
me as part of his discovery,

384
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,410
you'll see that those are in fact,

385
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:52,053
the same ones that Popov gave to Sabu.

386
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:57,480
So we have a former FBI asset
and a Russian contractor

387
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:02,480
giving a FBI asset, who
is under FBI control,

388
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:06,360
credentials to attack
foreign government systems

389
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:09,300
to an American hactivist
who is then convicted

390
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:13,740
for doing those things, and
these are the kinds of state

391
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:18,240
sponsored actions that
are never looked at,

392
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:23,070
they are not understood,
and why would they

393
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:26,580
be looked at, there's already a scapegoat,

394
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:29,163
Jeremy Hammond did the fucking thing,

395
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:34,320
and we don't need
accountability beyond that,

396
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:38,940
because that would just
make everyone look bad,

397
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:43,830
and no one could stand that, looking bad

398
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:47,043
is worse than people dying,

399
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:50,280
at least in the eyes of the government.

400
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:55,080
We move on to Guccifer
2.0, one of the most

401
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,850
telling quotes about Guccifer 2.0

402
00:22:56,850 --> 00:22:59,497
comes from Julian Assange, where he said,

403
00:22:59,497 --> 00:23:02,280
"These look very much like
they're from the Russians,

404
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:05,370
they almost look too
much like the Russians."

405
00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:07,710
It was of course, a
persona managed by Russian

406
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:09,930
intelligence services,
they were the source

407
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:12,750
of the DNC emails, we know
this from public statements,

408
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:15,750
as well as private statements
they made in their chats

409
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:20,100
with WikiLeaks, the transcript
shows the communications

410
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:22,320
with and submissions to
WikiLeaks' discussion

411
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:26,010
about timeline, and WikiLeaks, of course,

412
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:28,780
explicitly stating we want to do this

413
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:32,670
in time for the DMC, so
we can have this specific

414
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:35,670
political impact, but
despite the overwhelming

415
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:38,460
amount of evidence about Guccifer 2.0,

416
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:41,430
there are still truthers
out there who insist

417
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:45,780
on Seth Rich this or VIPS that,

418
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:50,250
or Forensicator, something or other,

419
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:52,590
and that is one of the things that happens

420
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:54,270
when there's a failure to communicate

421
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:59,220
beyond thick incomprehensible reports,

422
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:01,530
which are also unfortunately very easy

423
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:04,233
to manipulate in terms of media.

424
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:08,850
A much more recent example
that I think many of you

425
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:11,250
may not have heard of is Free Civilian,

426
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:15,060
the data merchant that was a terrorist.

427
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:18,210
They claim to sell data,
but they posted it freely,

428
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:21,690
including Ukrainian medical
data and about 1 million

429
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:23,460
government emails from Ukraine

430
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:25,083
for their internal development.

431
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:29,280
They used Cloudflare to
protect their Swiss servers

432
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,803
for distribution, and after the servers,

433
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:36,210
the company was notified,
the Private Layer Inc

434
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:39,330
took their servers offline,
however, Cloudflare,

435
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:43,500
last I checked, continued to
protect the now defunct domain,

436
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:47,040
despite being told explicitly what it was,

437
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:49,440
being provided proof of what it was,

438
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,830
and outside analysis
that confirmed that, yes,

439
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:56,340
this was almost certainly
Russian state-affiliated actors,

440
00:24:56,340 --> 00:25:00,120
and it was almost certainly
a hack and leak psyop

441
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:03,870
to create fear as part of the
Russian invasion of Ukraine,

442
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:08,283
making it not a criminal
act, but an act of war.

443
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:11,767
Cloudflare simply responded,

444
00:25:11,767 --> 00:25:14,250
"We are not hosting the content,

445
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:16,977
we're simply helping them host it."

446
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:22,380
This brings us to the issue
of Misidentifications,

447
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:24,750
because it happens both
ways, where we either

448
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:27,420
miss someone who was a state actor,

449
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:30,360
or we look at someone
that wasn't a state actor,

450
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:34,200
and someone decides they were.

451
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,753
And for Sabu, the answer is simple,

452
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,930
agent Brutus says he was a hero,

453
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:41,640
agent Brutus is an honorable man,

454
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:45,210
and he has brought many
captives home to Rome.

455
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:49,140
So when he said Sabu did great,

456
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:52,080
he prevented all these attacks,

457
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:55,413
I mean, he started them, but
he prevented them in the end,

458
00:25:56,280 --> 00:26:00,690
that's so great, he's the
terrorist and the hero.

459
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:05,690
And normally that's a
crime, but not this time.

460
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:11,400
And for the most part, people,
especially in the mainstream,

461
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,860
especially mainstream
outlets, went with it,

462
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:18,860
they trusted agent Brutus,
because he was an honorable man,

463
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:23,310
and he had arrested many people, so surely

464
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:25,503
he knew what he was talking about.

465
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:32,070
Then we have Popov, he was simply missed

466
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:36,540
because he was a con artist
with too many fake IDs,

467
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:41,380
that and the FBI agent responsible

468
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:45,720
kind of just stonewalled when he was asked

469
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,793
to help solve what was going on.

470
00:26:51,545 --> 00:26:53,700
And then we have people like donk_enby

471
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:57,127
who are hit with the
worst kind of reasoning.

472
00:26:57,127 --> 00:27:01,380
"Only a state actor could have done this."

473
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:03,510
Which you inevitably hear from the least

474
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:06,510
educated people when it
comes to how computers

475
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:09,210
and networks and hacks work,

476
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:12,000
because they will look at something big,

477
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,310
some big accomplishment, and for donk_enby

478
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:17,760
it was the Parler stuff, and
they'll say this was big,

479
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:21,280
so it had to be something equally big

480
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:25,470
to do it, and this sort of
thinking is also what leads

481
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:28,440
to a lot of conspiracy theory thinking,

482
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:31,320
like the assassination
of JFK was a big event,

483
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,660
so something big must have been behind it,

484
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:37,800
it could not have been a crazy dude,

485
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:41,670
to be way overly brief,
I've gone into that stuff

486
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:43,890
a whole lot, please
don't think I'm actually

487
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:46,233
simplifying it that much for realsies.

488
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:53,370
But yeah, people simply not knowing

489
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:55,260
what they're talking about,
you'll see an article

490
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:57,180
that says maybe they
did this with the help

491
00:27:57,180 --> 00:28:00,570
of whatever country, there was one article

492
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:03,960
recently about the NAIRU
police force league,

493
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:08,910
and a cyber firm pointed out some issues

494
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:13,910
that they thought were inconsistent,

495
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:17,730
and they mentioned me
several times in the report,

496
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:19,920
never reached out to me,

497
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:23,160
which I thought was an interesting choice,

498
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,470
but they did say I didn't appear to have

499
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:28,740
any involvement in anything,
it was a very sloppy report,

500
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:31,470
but it pointed out some
things with timestamps,

501
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:33,480
and then a journalist saw that,

502
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:36,120
took that to someone who
worked at a think tank,

503
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:39,687
and that person said,
"It was probably China,"

504
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:44,583
because China would want
to do something like that.

505
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:48,090
And then that became the headline,

506
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:51,390
and several other people
reported that headline,

507
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:56,103
and there was zero evidence
of China's involvement,

508
00:28:57,510 --> 00:29:00,660
but that's how that sort
of thing can get started.

509
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:05,580
It's, "Oh, this was a complicated leak

510
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:08,400
and things look a little fishy,

511
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,500
so it's gotta be a state hacker,"

512
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:15,000
no, it looks fishy
because it's complicated

513
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,443
and you don't understand it.

514
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:21,240
Which brings us to the big question,

515
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,940
or the big questions, first off,

516
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:26,943
are they, you know, spies?

517
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:30,120
And it's a surprisingly broad question,

518
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,460
and it's not actually
even the right question,

519
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:35,220
because both sources can be exploited

520
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:38,130
and material can be exploited.

521
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:41,310
And if the answer to either is, yes,

522
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:43,890
it's not necessarily
an emergency shutdown,

523
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:48,870
it's a red flag, because something

524
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:53,010
just being exploited doesn't
make it untrue or dangerous,

525
00:29:53,010 --> 00:29:55,890
Soviet propaganda used to point out racism

526
00:29:55,890 --> 00:30:00,273
in the US a lot, and they were right,

527
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:05,670
it's not a problem if it is accurate,

528
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:10,670
and not being embellished or
twisted towards foul ends,

529
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:13,980
and there are ways you can
help make sure that it's not,

530
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:16,353
or that there are counterbalancing forces,

531
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:22,110
but usually the first clue
is the source themselves.

532
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:25,260
If you have contact
with the source at all,

533
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:30,260
any questions without getting
into their security at all,

534
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:35,610
can tell you a lot, one, are
they trying to micromanage?

535
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:37,260
Are they trying to tell you what to do,

536
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:40,410
how to handle things, when
it needs to be released,

537
00:30:40,410 --> 00:30:42,993
how it needs to be labeled?

538
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:48,900
Are they trying to turn
you into their agent?

539
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:52,230
If so, that's a problem.

540
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:55,050
Next up is, can the
source answer questions

541
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:57,576
coherently and consistently?

542
00:30:57,576 --> 00:31:01,710
And it's amazing how often

543
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:05,280
bad actors are not able to
do this, we had one source

544
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:09,300
submit a group of emails,
allegedly from China,

545
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:12,720
and they were unable to
tell us what email accounts

546
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:16,260
they were from, or what
agencies the email accounts

547
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:19,500
were from, or anything about the contents,

548
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:23,010
other than a lot of stuff.

549
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:26,010
And while we don't expect
sources to necessarily

550
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:29,400
have a total knowledge
of every single thing

551
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,600
that are in these data sets,

552
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,513
'cause some of them are terabytes in size,

553
00:31:35,938 --> 00:31:37,770
if you are a leaker or a hacker,

554
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:41,700
you presumably know the basics

555
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:46,170
of what the information
is when you've got it,

556
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:48,900
you're not just picking
up trash off the floor

557
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:51,753
and then bringing it
to us and saying here,

558
00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:56,430
and those kinds of failures often mean

559
00:31:56,430 --> 00:31:59,220
you're dealing with a
cutout or with someone

560
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:03,843
who just, there's some other red flag.

561
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:07,290
And again, we come to the question of,

562
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:10,020
are they trying to sell a narrative?

563
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:13,170
And that doesn't mean, are
they trying to shine a light

564
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:16,140
on an issue, because
there's a big difference

565
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:20,460
between saying, "These
refugees are being abused,

566
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:23,130
and treated horrendously,
and denied their rights,

567
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:24,540
and the police are part of it,

568
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:26,517
and the government knows about it,"

569
00:32:27,391 --> 00:32:30,547
there's a big difference between that and,

570
00:32:30,547 --> 00:32:35,547
"The CIA is bad and
needs to be turned into

571
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:38,820
something else because
of these exact things

572
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:42,750
that also further this person's political

573
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:46,560
narrative and goal and whatnot,"

574
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:50,040
you know, could see a
narrative being formed now,

575
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:52,830
not related to leaks so much,
but the kind of narrative

576
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:54,870
I'm talking about just by watching

577
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:57,333
the fallout from the Mar-a-Lago raid,

578
00:32:59,724 --> 00:33:02,160
it's the same kind of concept,

579
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,260
people trying to build a narrative,

580
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:07,740
and once you publish, that's
going to be unavoidable,

581
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:09,783
you are releasing it into the world,

582
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:15,600
even if you restrict it to just
journalists and researchers,

583
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,340
which is one thing DDoSecrets does

584
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:21,840
on sensitive data sets,
you're still letting go

585
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,210
of how it's going to be interpreted

586
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:25,980
and what they're going to do with it,

587
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:28,890
but if the source is
clearly trying to sell

588
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:31,353
or push a narrative, you have a problem.

589
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:35,253
Other questions include timing,

590
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:39,093
does the situation or the
timing force your hand?

591
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:42,840
Are you being given information three days

592
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:45,600
before it becomes crucially relevant?

593
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,840
And if so, why right then?

594
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:52,380
What relevant external
events are going on?

595
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:55,200
Elections or armed conflicts.

596
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,290
And what is the goal for those things?

597
00:33:58,290 --> 00:34:00,900
Is it to shed light on
it, or is it to intervene?

598
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:02,763
Because both can be valid,

599
00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:06,960
intervention through
freedom of information

600
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:11,960
is absolutely a fair way of
participating in the world.

601
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:18,210
That's what journalism is,
that's what academia is,

602
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:20,640
that's how the world
gets changed by people

603
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:22,623
who don't carry guns.

604
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:28,770
The next question brings
us to counterbalances,

605
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:31,380
it's their time for it,
because one of the things

606
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:35,880
we saw with the DNC leaks
and the Macron leaks was,

607
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:39,360
no, they were purposely
released right before

608
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:43,770
an event that they would
have maximum shock impact on,

609
00:34:43,770 --> 00:34:48,770
and they would have very
little time for, one second,

610
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,510
they would have very
little time for anyone

611
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:58,500
to then go through and
review the initial findings,

612
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:01,980
or critique them, or get
a better understanding

613
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:05,580
of what's going on,
because you're just giving

614
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:08,620
people the tiniest bit of

615
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,310
information and time to
analyze it, and it'll naturally

616
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:16,920
always go to the most shocking things

617
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:20,130
and things that are devoid of context.

618
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:21,690
Next question is, why now?

619
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:23,403
Which is pretty self explanatory.

620
00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:27,150
So now the really big question,

621
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:29,013
how the hell were they caught?

622
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:33,420
Chat logs is gonna be
a recurring theme here

623
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:38,250
for most of them, Sabu,
caught by chat logs,

624
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:43,250
he kept trying to entrap
people and the chat logs,

625
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,423
if you're a participant in things,

626
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,150
it's a bad idea to keep chat logs,

627
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:52,080
but if you're a defendant in
things, they're useful to have,

628
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,780
but they started
communicating with each other,

629
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:57,510
different hactivists, and
they noticed patterns,

630
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:59,850
and they shared it within
the larger community,

631
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:02,850
and then later leaked files confirmed

632
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:07,850
the allegations and what was going on.

633
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:12,150
For Popov, again, we have chat logs,

634
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:14,460
but this time reviewed in hindsight,

635
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:19,330
several years after Popov had
stopped using those targets.

636
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:23,700
His big problem that got him noticed

637
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:27,000
most recently was extorting
too many, not most recently,

638
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,890
there were other things since then,

639
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:31,620
but one of the things that
caused him real problems,

640
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:35,070
and as well as his former FBI handler,

641
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:37,860
was he began extorting
simultaneous targets

642
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:40,050
that he wanted revenge on.

643
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:43,273
And when the FBI

644
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:47,550
was trying to get at the bottom
of this, and in particular,

645
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:50,880
the US attorney at Boston
wanted to get into it,

646
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,500
they were asking for information

647
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:56,250
on his pseudonym Dennis Pinhouse,

648
00:36:56,250 --> 00:37:00,000
which agent Hilbert,
Popov's former handler,

649
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,300
knew what that was and who he was,

650
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:05,763
and Hilbert refused to cooperate.

651
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:09,450
Popov was also identified by looking

652
00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:12,243
in the footnotes of certain DOJ filings,

653
00:37:13,507 --> 00:37:15,649
he just seemed connected to something,

654
00:37:15,649 --> 00:37:18,990
and so a good journalist
just started following up

655
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:21,630
on that and found a
very interesting story,

656
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:25,020
was also identified through
his posting to Jeff Carr,

657
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:27,990
and simply the Russian
operating environment, again,

658
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:31,233
if you are in Russia and you hack the FBI,

659
00:37:32,610 --> 00:37:35,580
you give that to the government

660
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:38,043
and you have a very nice life.

661
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:42,690
How were Guccifer 2.0
and DC Leaks identified?

662
00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:45,300
I combined this, because they share a lot.

663
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:48,447
Chat logs again, the
money in Bitcoin trail

664
00:37:48,447 --> 00:37:53,447
was a huge portion, Linguistic
analysis, Stylometry,

665
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:57,060
forensic analysis
provided more confirmation

666
00:37:57,060 --> 00:38:00,480
as at least once Guccifer
2.0 mistakenly logged in

667
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:03,990
without a VPN, and analysis of files

668
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:08,990
shows overlap between
Guccifer 2.0 and DC Leaks

669
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:12,630
and their files, and that
one of the first documents

670
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:15,540
that Guccifer 2.0 published came from

671
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:18,123
an attachment to one
of the Podesta emails.

672
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:24,900
Free Civilians identification
was fairly straightforward,

673
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:27,930
given the circumstances,
the inconsistent behavior,

674
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:31,380
being more interested in selling
proof than in selling data,

675
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:36,150
posting already sold data for reputation,

676
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:39,630
as well as the timing, their attacks began

677
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:43,860
right around the beginning of the Russian

678
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:46,500
invasion of Ukraine within a day or two,

679
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:49,560
and they exfiltrated the data

680
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,903
just prior to the wiper attacks.

681
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:57,800
So now's the part where
I get to yell at you.

682
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:04,680
I'll be gentle, hopefully most of this

683
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:08,040
will come across as
constructive criticism,

684
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:10,263
and not actual aggression.

685
00:39:11,730 --> 00:39:14,220
Newsrooms, you all need to get ready

686
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:15,903
for the next big leak now.

687
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:19,443
There's a lot happening,

688
00:39:20,970 --> 00:39:22,773
a lot more is going to happen,

689
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:26,400
and most of you are not equipped

690
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:31,400
to deal with any sizeable leak.

691
00:39:33,810 --> 00:39:38,310
DDoSecrets, thankfully is relaunching

692
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:40,740
Hunter Memorial Library,
and we'll be making it

693
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:43,920
available to journalists and researchers,

694
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:48,300
but that is not a full
replacement for newsrooms

695
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:51,300
investing in themselves, because
you need the proper staff,

696
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:53,040
the technology, and the training,

697
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,590
and it is lacking on all three

698
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:57,963
in pretty much every major newsroom,

699
00:39:58,950 --> 00:40:02,940
that goes for Associated
Press, the New York Times,

700
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:07,020
the Washington Post, the list is pretty

701
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:10,890
hard to come up with an end point.

702
00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:12,723
You need to focus on the long view,

703
00:40:13,913 --> 00:40:16,020
because I'm tired of seeing articles

704
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:20,253
that examine leaked data for two weeks,

705
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:24,633
because you're looking at
emails from the last month,

706
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:29,010
y'all are better than that,

707
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:31,563
y'all have data that's better than that,

708
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:35,880
you have 100 terabytes of leaked data

709
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:40,320
that a lot of it overlaps,
dozens of mining companies,

710
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:43,170
of agencies that work with
them that enable that stuff,

711
00:40:43,170 --> 00:40:46,740
the world is literally
on fire and the data sets

712
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:51,740
behind the people who are doing
it are open and available,

713
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:55,833
but where's the investment?

714
00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:02,790
I see newsrooms with climate teams,

715
00:41:02,790 --> 00:41:07,110
climate data teams of
three, maybe four people,

716
00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:10,650
and none of them are real tech experts.

717
00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:13,200
And remember that a
collaboration that makes the cut

718
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,480
is worth two exclusives that get shelved,

719
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:18,150
and way too much of your nonsense stuff

720
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:19,743
just gets shelved anyway.

721
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:23,670
American newsrooms have definitely trended

722
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:26,400
toward the wrong column in the last year,

723
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:30,120
we've seen a lot of reporting
on fake hacks with no proof,

724
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:32,130
very little reporting on the trial

725
00:41:32,130 --> 00:41:34,200
of the largest CIA leak in history,

726
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,600
which revealed a lot of
information about the leak,

727
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:40,983
about WikiLeaks, about how CIA works.

728
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:45,750
Y'all dropped the ball
on that, and there's no,

729
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:47,583
there's no goddamn excuse.

730
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:49,890
I've seen a lot of reporting on

731
00:41:49,890 --> 00:41:52,710
and promoting worthless NFTs, but not much

732
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:56,910
following the money
beyond, it went somewhere,

733
00:41:56,910 --> 00:41:59,043
and that is not useful reporting.

734
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:02,700
I see a lot of emotional
headlines being made out

735
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:05,550
of the opinions of
inherently biased people,

736
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:09,390
the mother of so and so,
the father of so and so,

737
00:42:09,390 --> 00:42:12,543
they have these opinions,
that doesn't matter.

738
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:16,353
You need to focus on recent inform,

739
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:20,550
sorry, I skipped ahead a number,

740
00:42:20,550 --> 00:42:22,500
what you need to focus
on is informing people

741
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,720
what they need to know
before they need to know it,

742
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:27,570
because otherwise when
the next thing comes,

743
00:42:27,570 --> 00:42:30,120
they won't know what to make of it,

744
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:31,773
and they'll be playing catch up,

745
00:42:33,090 --> 00:42:35,490
and that's a problem for everyone,

746
00:42:35,490 --> 00:42:37,470
that's a problem for your outlets too,

747
00:42:37,470 --> 00:42:40,200
because if people are
trying to play catch up

748
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:41,670
when they're reading your articles

749
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:44,013
or watching your video presentations,

750
00:42:45,210 --> 00:42:48,150
they're already going away,
because you didn't give them

751
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:50,253
the tools to understand it and follow it.

752
00:42:51,510 --> 00:42:54,570
See a lot of people
confusing news with stories

753
00:42:54,570 --> 00:42:57,600
instead of reporting on non-breaking news

754
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:59,220
that might not have closure,

755
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:02,580
even though it has
crucial data and context,

756
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:04,650
and way too much investing in production,

757
00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:07,683
instead of investing
in the newsroom itself.

758
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:10,893
It's absurd.

759
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:16,260
Cable news is absurd, print
news is becoming worse,

760
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:19,020
and yet there's so many talented people,

761
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:21,330
stop shooting yourselves in the foot,

762
00:43:21,330 --> 00:43:25,023
and editors, rethink your shit.

763
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:31,680
Government, hi, come see the cognitive

764
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:33,723
dissonance inherent in the system.

765
00:43:34,830 --> 00:43:37,500
Y'all love to look at
security and address that,

766
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:39,540
but the incongruences are what cause

767
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:43,383
and amplify leaks, everyone is,

768
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:46,470
let's say, very impressed with the size

769
00:43:46,470 --> 00:43:51,470
of your legal case against Assange,

770
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:54,960
go ahead and drop the publication charges,

771
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:58,830
'cause it's bullshit.

772
00:43:58,830 --> 00:44:03,450
I'm a critic of his, do
not like him, he hates me,

773
00:44:03,450 --> 00:44:06,090
but I'm up here saying it's bullshit,

774
00:44:06,090 --> 00:44:08,430
and it seems like y'all are compensating

775
00:44:08,430 --> 00:44:12,180
for something, do better.

776
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:14,880
Also, just pardon all whistleblowers,

777
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:18,510
and never let anyone hear you say

778
00:44:18,510 --> 00:44:21,450
that talking to journalists
and selling t-shirts

779
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:25,833
is a part of a CFAA violation again, ever,

780
00:44:26,910 --> 00:44:31,110
ever, I don't know how
you can look at yourself

781
00:44:31,110 --> 00:44:36,110
in the mirror after writing
that or filing it with whoever,

782
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:41,430
that's bananas.

783
00:44:41,430 --> 00:44:44,250
Industry, you just need
to own your own shit,

784
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:48,750
security theater is going to
get your companies killed,

785
00:44:48,750 --> 00:44:50,640
it is going to get people wrecked,

786
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:54,240
it is going to destroy personal data,

787
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:57,900
and not even in a way
that lets journalists

788
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:01,980
use leaks productively, be someone

789
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:06,690
who isn't worth leaking,
and never pay the ransom,

790
00:45:06,690 --> 00:45:09,300
one area I actually agree with FBI on,

791
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:11,070
for a lot of reasons
that we don't have time

792
00:45:11,070 --> 00:45:14,733
to get into here, but it's not
just 'cause I want that data.

793
00:45:16,650 --> 00:45:19,110
Leakers and Leak Publishers, real quick,

794
00:45:19,110 --> 00:45:22,320
study mosaic theory,
stay focused on results,

795
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:24,150
not splash or ego.

796
00:45:24,150 --> 00:45:26,790
Learn what the law actually
lets journalists do

797
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:31,110
and what it doesn't,
because a lot of sources

798
00:45:31,110 --> 00:45:34,170
seem to want to ask publishers

799
00:45:34,170 --> 00:45:37,650
to do things that they can't do,

800
00:45:37,650 --> 00:45:39,810
and you need to understand
that state actors

801
00:45:39,810 --> 00:45:42,450
can and will look to
exploit you and your leaks,

802
00:45:42,450 --> 00:45:45,030
whether you want them to or not.

803
00:45:45,030 --> 00:45:48,540
Talk to a lawyer, listen
to your conscience,

804
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:51,933
and honestly,

805
00:45:54,450 --> 00:45:57,510
leak the planet, there's no way

806
00:45:57,510 --> 00:46:00,213
that we're gonna be saved through secrecy,

807
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:04,110
recent report from CIA
found that something like

808
00:46:04,110 --> 00:46:07,710
90% of classified documents
could be safely released

809
00:46:07,710 --> 00:46:11,550
to the public, that shit's absurd,

810
00:46:11,550 --> 00:46:13,233
it's the same with corporate.

811
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:21,270
There is no reason why we can't turn

812
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:24,570
to leaks as a vital source when the world

813
00:46:24,570 --> 00:46:29,310
is literally on fire, and
we don't have enough data

814
00:46:29,310 --> 00:46:32,280
to figure out, well, what's causing it,

815
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:35,310
specifically in these areas
and what's making it worse,

816
00:46:35,310 --> 00:46:37,230
at this rate, we don't have enough data

817
00:46:37,230 --> 00:46:40,773
to refine the projections, except we do,

818
00:46:41,610 --> 00:46:46,610
and people aren't fully engaging with it,

819
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:49,500
and that's a problem, because leaks

820
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:52,653
are only as valuable as you let them be.

821
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:57,300
People have risked their
lives and their freedom

822
00:46:57,300 --> 00:46:58,743
to bring us this data.

823
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:06,860
And it would be irresponsible
and unconscionable

824
00:47:07,470 --> 00:47:11,813
if we let them down by just,
oh yeah, this came out,

825
00:47:11,813 --> 00:47:14,763
I found an interesting
document and now that's it.

826
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:21,210
So leak the planet, magic is real,

827
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:24,663
have fun, thanks for listening.

828
00:47:25,594 --> 00:47:28,594
(crowd applauding)
