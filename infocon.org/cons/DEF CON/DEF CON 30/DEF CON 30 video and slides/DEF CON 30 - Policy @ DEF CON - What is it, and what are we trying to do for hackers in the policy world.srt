1
00:00:03,494 --> 00:00:06,180
- So this is the talk about
the public policy department.

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:07,500
By show of hands,

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,920
how many of you have heard of
the policy department before?

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:14,340
Oh man, that's a lot more
than I expected it to be.

5
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:15,173
That's good.

6
00:00:15,173 --> 00:00:17,040
How many of you have been to policy talks

7
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,053
at DEFCON in years past?

8
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,880
Fewer people, good.
Room to grow this year.

9
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,883
So we are one of the newest
departments at DEFCON.

10
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,870
We are kind of focused on the idea

11
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:35,010
that you can bring public policy
makers and hackers together

12
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:38,070
in the same space and
have them collaborate,

13
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:43,050
cooperate, build trust,
and start to cause things

14
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:46,530
to happen in a better way than
they would have otherwise.

15
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:48,680
And we're gonna have
the Dark Tangent come on

16
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,330
in a couple of minutes and elaborate more

17
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:55,650
on his vision for what
the policy department

18
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:56,880
should look like.

19
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,580
And some of the history
of the policy department

20
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:02,043
and policy itself at DEFCON.

21
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:07,230
We've got an interesting program.

22
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:09,720
We've got three very distinguished folks

23
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,573
over here on my right, your left,

24
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,160
that have spent the last 30 years,

25
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,470
in some way, shape, or form,

26
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:22,380
as hackers transforming public policy,

27
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:27,030
engaged in conversation
with members of Congress,

28
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,843
with the executive
branch, globally as well,

29
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,500
to try and bridge the gap,

30
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,290
to close the expanse between public policy

31
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:39,063
and the hacking community.

32
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:46,413
For those of you who aren't aware,

33
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,750
DEFCON has had a little bit
of a tenuous relationship

34
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,306
with government in the past.

35
00:01:53,306 --> 00:01:55,470
(crowd laughing)

36
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:57,633
Requisite pause for laughter.

37
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:01,110
But I think we're closing those gaps.

38
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:04,170
We're changing the way
that things get done in DC

39
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:06,930
and around the world in
public policy centers

40
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:08,610
and centers of power.

41
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:10,890
And I think that we've
got a huge opportunity

42
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:12,003
to expand on that.

43
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:15,480
I myself live in downtown DC.

44
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,710
By the way, I'm Beau Woods.

45
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:18,560
I run the policy department this year

46
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,590
and I'm excited to have you all here.

47
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:26,750
I live in DC and I've seen the change

48
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:29,160
in just the last five or six years

49
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,630
in public policy and the way

50
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:32,490
that they look at hackers.

51
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:34,290
You know, a decade ago,

52
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:37,140
public policy folks thought
we were all criminals.

53
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:40,050
And now they have a much more

54
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:41,973
in-depth and nuanced understanding.

55
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:47,040
And the reason is partly
because of some of the folks

56
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,520
over here to my right, your left.

57
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:54,330
And so I wanna start off
and give them an opportunity

58
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:59,330
to give a little perspective
and context and history

59
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:01,200
in the past 30 years,

60
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,450
what's happened in the hacking community

61
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:07,080
and public policy and how
have they seen that change.

62
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,050
So just immediately to my right,

63
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:14,610
we have Jay Healey and then
Jack Cable and Space Rogue.

64
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:16,383
So Jay, do you wanna kick us off?

65
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,110
- [Jay] Yeah, sure thing.

66
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:21,090
So, hi everyone, Jay Healey.

67
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:25,260
And one of the reasons
that I've gotten involved

68
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:28,260
and to really start thinking about policy

69
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:33,187
was I came across a great quote that said,

70
00:03:33,187 --> 00:03:35,520
"Few, if any contemporary
security controls

71
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,350
can stop a dedicated red team

72
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:39,210
from easily accessing any information."

73
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:40,203
So we know that.

74
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,600
The red team's gonna get through,

75
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,620
the hacker is gonna get through,

76
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:46,710
the offense has the
advantage over defense.

77
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:49,263
That quote was from 1979.

78
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,533
Since before DEFCON,

79
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:55,680
the attackers had the advantage.

80
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,140
And so hackers do what we
do for a lot of reasons.

81
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:00,000
We know a lot do it for curiosity,

82
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,213
a lot of it because we
hack 'cause it's there,

83
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,300
but a lot do it because we think

84
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,400
we're making the world better.

85
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,980
That doing this is gonna
lead to more security,

86
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:13,890
to more privacy that our
kids and our grandkids

87
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:15,240
aren't gonna have to deal with the shit

88
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,913
that we've been dealing
with for 30 DEFCONs.

89
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:20,190
But it's not working, right?

90
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:23,913
That quote from 1979 is still relevant.

91
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,050
So that's one of the things
that we try and do on policy.

92
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:29,790
Is saying, all right,

93
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:32,550
people are working super hard

94
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:34,830
to find vulnerabilities and fix them.

95
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:37,230
And we're not making any progress.

96
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:39,243
So what else can we do differently?

97
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,240
What else can we try to do out of DC,

98
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,140
out of other governments,

99
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:46,080
out of things like "I am the Cavalry,"

100
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,720
so that the work the hacker's
doing is having more impact

101
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,060
and that we can find
other ways to have impact.

102
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:52,383
And that that's really driving me

103
00:04:52,383 --> 00:04:54,133
in the way I think of the problems.

104
00:04:56,319 --> 00:04:57,152
- Yeah, Jack.

105
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,600
- Hi everyone. I'm Jack Cable.

106
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,050
I'm a hacker. I'm also
a security researcher,

107
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:09,570
which is what I call myself
in front of policy people

108
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:12,930
to make myself appear more professional.

109
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:14,640
Good tip out there.

110
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:18,570
So I got into the world of policy,

111
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:19,590
kind of my foray into that,

112
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:21,180
started when I was in high school.

113
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,627
I got an email titled,

114
00:05:22,627 --> 00:05:26,190
"What if I had told you the
Pentagon wanted you to hack it?"

115
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:29,040
This was the first US government,

116
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,680
I believe the first
government bug bounty program,

117
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,080
where they were inviting hackers

118
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,320
to find vulnerabilities
in Pentagon systems.

119
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,020
Something that even a few years before

120
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,880
you could only go to jail for.

121
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:45,030
So now there was a legal
pathway for doing this.

122
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:48,360
Government was recognizing
the value of people like us

123
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:52,020
in helping secure their systems,
helping secure our country.

124
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:55,890
So I participated in that,
got involved in a couple more,

125
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:58,680
went to work for the
Defense Digital Service,

126
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,440
which is an agency that put this on.

127
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,510
And before that I'd
never really considered

128
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:06,570
working in government or
doing anything policy related.

129
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:09,570
I had been kind of
immersed in this community

130
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:11,400
and really enjoyed what I did,

131
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,400
but that never really crossed my mind.

132
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,090
Until I went and saw the
potential for change.

133
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:23,040
The idea that there are places
in government you can do,

134
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,990
where you can actually make change,

135
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:27,093
where you can get around the bureaucracy.

136
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:30,870
I won't say that's
everywhere in government,

137
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:33,570
but there are certainly
places where that can be done.

138
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:39,270
Second instance was when
I was registering to vote,

139
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:42,420
I came across a pretty
serious vulnerability.

140
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:45,150
I did not know much about election systems

141
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:46,680
or who administered elections,

142
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,510
but I knew this was pretty serious.

143
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:52,830
I went about trying to figure
out who to disclose this to.

144
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:56,130
Was a long and confusing path.

145
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:59,340
Eventually after around six or so months,

146
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:01,080
found the right people,
was able to get to them

147
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,310
so they could fix it.

148
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:04,260
That was not at all transparent.

149
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:06,480
I got connected with the folks at CISA,

150
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,600
the US Cybersecurity
Infrastructure Security Agency,

151
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,320
along the way, who were able
to help make those connections

152
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,400
in order to be able to

153
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,200
effectively disclose the vulnerability.

154
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:19,140
I then went to work for CISA
working on election security,

155
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:22,710
helping secure both state
and local election systems,

156
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:26,043
as well as some of their
disinformation work.

157
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:28,680
So through this work,

158
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,770
I've been able to engage
with election officials,

159
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:36,030
election manufacturers, policy
makers across the country.

160
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:41,030
And I can say that the
conversation is changing.

161
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,140
If you want to engage
with this conversation,

162
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,670
which I think is critically important,

163
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:52,530
because us here in Vegas,
wherever we usually are,

164
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:55,740
do not typically intersect
with the folks in DC.

165
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,420
There's a disconnect there.

166
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:00,420
And I think of policy
on the technical side

167
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:02,643
is really two sides of the same coin.

168
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,410
Almost all policy problems have
underlying technical truths

169
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:11,010
that we all know, that unless
we're there in the room

170
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:15,240
helping them get it right,
aren't gonna get right.

171
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,700
So a couple takeaways. I think one,

172
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:21,000
policy is really about
creating change at scale.

173
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,070
That's part of why I got into this,

174
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:26,730
is because I saw the ability
to take the technical work

175
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:30,060
I'd done and raise that to a
level where I could apply that,

176
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:33,060
not just for say one
company or one organization,

177
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:34,893
but at a more national scale.

178
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:37,800
A second thing is being able

179
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,990
to speak the language of policy makers.

180
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:44,820
We have very different lingo
and what we all do is great

181
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,080
and what they all do is great.

182
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,630
But unless we're able to
effectively communicate,

183
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:51,630
we're not gonna be able to
effectively make change.

184
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:52,980
So it goes both ways, of course,

185
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:55,761
we must speak their language,
they must speak ours.

186
00:08:55,761 --> 00:08:59,370
But making an effort to
meet them in the middle

187
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:02,880
will go a long way in order
to make progress here.

188
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,010
And third is just to get involved,

189
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:07,410
and fortunately it's
easier than ever to do so.

190
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:10,920
You could walk over back
there to the policy village

191
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:14,970
where Beau's done a great
job of putting this together,

192
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:16,947
conversation after conversation

193
00:09:16,947 --> 00:09:20,190
on really important policy topics

194
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:22,680
with top policy makers across the country.

195
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,590
So I encourage everyone here
to take a moment step in there,

196
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:27,420
participate in some of those discussions

197
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:30,690
and see how you can apply your expertise

198
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:32,823
to help advance policy in our country.

199
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:37,427
- All right, and before we go to the last,

200
00:09:37,427 --> 00:09:42,427
wanted to bring up Dark Tangent
to give us some perspective,

201
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,850
what his vision is for
the policy department

202
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:47,430
and some of the policy interactions

203
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:50,523
at DEFCON over the past
30 years. So, Jeff.

204
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:55,650
- I didn't expect this many
people (crowd applause)

205
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:57,123
to be interested in policy.

206
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:02,823
Thanks for coming early on
a chaotic day after a flood.

207
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:07,320
So we want to just give you
a little bit of an idea,

208
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,840
I'm sure Beau's been orienting you.

209
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:13,020
The big sort of picture is
that DEFCON was doing policy

210
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:15,720
without realizing we were doing policy.

211
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,760
And we thought we should probably

212
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,860
be a little more intentional about that.

213
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:22,653
So it's sort of like that old saying that,

214
00:10:23,677 --> 00:10:27,000
"if you're not doing policy,
it's being done to you."

215
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,170
And we think it's important

216
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:29,970
that we have a seat at the table.

217
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:31,140
And if we're not at the table,

218
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:35,370
we're gonna be skeptical of
the outcomes of the policy.

219
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:36,900
And over the years,

220
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:39,780
a lot of informal interactions
would happen between

221
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:42,150
different policy makers,
different governments,

222
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:46,260
and them trying to get an
idea of what is going on.

223
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:50,430
And it turns out that our
community's superpower

224
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:53,520
is basically speaking truth to power,

225
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:56,100
but also giving a more unbiased,

226
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,743
sort of third party perspective.

227
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:02,010
When you're here, you're not
really working for your vendor,

228
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:07,010
you don't have to have your
day job vendor perspective.

229
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:10,020
You can be a little bit more open.

230
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:12,240
And that turns out to be in short supply

231
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,780
for people in policy who
generally get pitched information

232
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:20,780
from trade groups and vendors
and other private interests.

233
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:26,100
And they need information
to balance it out.

234
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,680
They need another voice,
civil society's voice,

235
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,440
maybe not commercial America's voice,

236
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,660
to give them another perspective.

237
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:36,120
And so that's one of the things
we're trying to do, right,

238
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:40,563
is build a countervailing
force to be considered.

239
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:45,910
Over the years when we would
interact with law enforcement

240
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:50,430
and say, "no, no, this
lock is very insecure,"

241
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:53,310
or "don't worry about
this safe cracking thing,

242
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:55,767
it's not feasible."

243
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:57,937
You can see the relief.

244
00:11:57,937 --> 00:11:58,770
"Oh my gosh.

245
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:00,450
Somebody told me what's really happening."

246
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:02,610
The vendor would never
tell me that. Okay, great.

247
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:04,410
That's what I needed to know."

248
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:05,910
And building those bridges,

249
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:08,610
builds trust between our communities.

250
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:11,070
And it's gotten to the point
over the last five years

251
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:13,920
since we started doing
policy more intentionally,

252
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,040
that its time to upscale it
into these maiden stage talks

253
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,990
that we've scheduled this year.

254
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:20,430
It's time to have a real department

255
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:23,520
that Beau took the lead of this year,

256
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:26,880
built an incredible team of goons.

257
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,220
And we're trying out a lot
of new things this year.

258
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:31,410
And so your feedback is
gonna be very important

259
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:34,950
for helping us correct and
decide what we do next.

260
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:37,200
And did you talk about the three tiers

261
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,033
of what we're doing?

262
00:12:38,033 --> 00:12:38,880
- [Beau] No, not yet.

263
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,530
- So we're trying three different tiers.

264
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:43,740
Why try one thing when
we can try three things?

265
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,750
We're trying the main stage talks.

266
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:49,110
We're trying the policy village,

267
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:53,070
where we dive in deeper
on specific topics.

268
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:56,490
And this is where you can
debate section 320 or DMCA

269
00:12:56,490 --> 00:13:00,840
or whatever it is with experts.

270
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,030
And this is essentially
a new track at DEFCON,

271
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:04,170
it's like a policy track.

272
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:05,370
And then in the evening,

273
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:07,140
we want to facilitate, off the record,

274
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:09,270
Chatham house rules conversations.

275
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:11,550
So you can get a more honest assessment

276
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:14,070
and not have to maybe do it so publicly.

277
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:15,510
And that's our evening program

278
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:18,513
and we have some evening
lounges, much smaller.

279
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:22,200
And last night we had our
first, it was an invite,

280
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,063
but we had our first policy dinner.

281
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,990
And so we hope to grow all of these

282
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:32,880
in an environment where
we can interact, honestly.

283
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,540
And if you think it's for
you, we want you involved.

284
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:37,830
And if you'd for somebody else,

285
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:39,843
please point them our direction.

286
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:41,940
We're gonna be learning a lot.

287
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:44,880
And our goal is to grow the policy,

288
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,490
just like the rest of the CON has grown.

289
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:49,290
There were villages,
the original villages,

290
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:52,830
hardware hacking village and wifi village.

291
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:54,360
The original villages have grown

292
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,450
into over 30 something villages.

293
00:13:57,450 --> 00:14:02,450
We're hoping to take the policy
department and turn it into,

294
00:14:02,737 --> 00:14:04,710
"there's a section over here

295
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:05,850
talking about aviation security,

296
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:09,330
there's a think tank Atlantic
Council doing a cyber 912,

297
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:12,600
there's an EFF talking
about online privacy."

298
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:16,590
We want to create that
kind of environment.

299
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:19,290
So it's not just our perspectives.

300
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:24,290
We're bringing other groups
in and you can participate.

301
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:27,510
And so I think in the early days

302
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:32,100
it was policy tourists coming in from DC,

303
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,650
wanting to see the crazy hackers

304
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:36,210
and kind of get a flavor of it.

305
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:37,440
But there was no real chance

306
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,570
to have a substantial interaction.

307
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:43,710
And the hackers are like, "oh,
look a policymaker, great."

308
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:46,440
But there was no real way
for them to interact either,

309
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,420
but we survived those initial contacts

310
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,980
without killing each other.

311
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:52,500
And so it's time to go a little deeper.

312
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,623
And that's what we're
signifying by kicking this off.

313
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:58,020
So with that said,

314
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:00,914
I wanna pass it back over to Beau

315
00:15:00,914 --> 00:15:03,390
and we'll end up taking
some of your questions.

316
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:06,750
And we really hope that you
check out some of the policy.

317
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:11,750
And if you have ideas for
workshops, hands-on, white papers,

318
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:15,090
anything where we can show
what our community can do,

319
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:18,690
I guess that, let me leave
one thought with you.

320
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:20,550
The voting village,

321
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:23,280
when I said we accidentally
ended up doing policy,

322
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,990
the voting village was really

323
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:27,540
the best shining example of this.

324
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:30,120
Again, no master strategy,

325
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:35,120
but what happened was after 2015 and 2016,

326
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:38,940
we decided to hack voting machines

327
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,950
and they'd never been available.

328
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:42,600
And nobody had hacked on them.

329
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:47,600
And there had been a storm,
much like last night,

330
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:50,070
that caved in the roof of a warehouse

331
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:53,220
that was holding voting
equipment for our county.

332
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:55,560
And it destroyed the voting
equipment. It got wet.

333
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:59,220
The insurance company wrote
off the voting equipment,

334
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,830
and the insurance company being green,

335
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:03,870
shipped all the voting equipment,
'cause they owned it now,

336
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:07,200
shipped it to a RE-PC recycler.

337
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,510
Recycler got all these
pallets of voting machines

338
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,110
and started trying to sell them.

339
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,540
And we found them on eBay
and we're like, "oh my god,"

340
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:16,860
and we started buying them.

341
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:21,097
The manufacturer caught on
and contacted them and said,

342
00:16:21,097 --> 00:16:23,820
"great, we want our voting machines back."

343
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:27,667
And the RE-PC place was like,
"great, they're $200 each."

344
00:16:27,667 --> 00:16:29,130
"No, no we want them for free."

345
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:31,260
You shouldn't have them. You
didn't sign the contract."

346
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:33,900
And he was like, "whatever, they're $200."

347
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,940
They said, "okay, well
you have to destroy them."

348
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:40,050
He's like, "okay, well it's
$200 an hour to destroy them."

349
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:40,890
He's like, "well we don't wanna pay."

350
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:43,380
And he's like, "okay, well
they're for sale 200 bucks.

351
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:44,760
How many pallets do you want?"

352
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:47,340
And so we bought them,
as many as we could.

353
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,980
And we got our hands on these machines.

354
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:51,990
And it just so happened the year before,

355
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:55,530
the DMCA has an exemption that was added,

356
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:57,030
had never been added before,

357
00:16:57,030 --> 00:17:00,030
for good faith security research.

358
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:02,040
So had that storm not happened,

359
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,470
had the library of Congress not put in

360
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:07,350
a research exemption for
critical infrastructure

361
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:10,530
and specifically called
out voting infrastructure,

362
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:14,130
we would've not been able to
hack those voting machines.

363
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:15,690
Just crazy coincidence.

364
00:17:15,690 --> 00:17:19,770
We hacked the voting
machines and in policy land,

365
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:21,120
this was very controversial.

366
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,190
There were some interest groups

367
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:25,440
that were pro-voting machine reform,

368
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:28,650
pro-transparency that did not want us

369
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:30,120
to hack the voting machines.

370
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,440
And they were trying to talk us out of it

371
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,640
because their concern was,

372
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,983
if we could not hack the voting machine,

373
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:39,633
they could not argue that
voting machines were unsafe.

374
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,540
So it was for them,

375
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:44,460
this litmus test, this existential threat.

376
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:45,810
If the hackers did not succeed,

377
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:49,230
their whole lobbying effort would go away.

378
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:52,230
And we're like, "whatever
we're hacking the machines."

379
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:53,340
The first machine fell

380
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:56,850
in like three minutes, (Jack
laughing) and then 90 minutes.

381
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:58,890
And I mean everything got taken over

382
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:01,290
and I'm telling you that
group within minutes,

383
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:02,940
went from hiding in the back of the room

384
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:05,340
to jumping in front of the TV cameras.

385
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:08,103
Right, now the whole point
of existence was validated.

386
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:13,110
We got more done in hacking
village to advance awareness

387
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:17,313
in that one weekend than their
organization had in 15 years.

388
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:21,240
Once people see it and can touch it,

389
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,820
it's like touching a hot plate.

390
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,560
You know it's hot, your
mom told you it's hot,

391
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:28,260
but until you touch it and burn
your finger, doesn't count.

392
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,820
And what we're trying to figure out is,

393
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:32,100
how many other hot plates can we set up

394
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:35,190
for people to touch so they
can learn things very quickly,

395
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:36,660
and we don't have to wait 15 years

396
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:37,560
for people to believe them

397
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:40,003
that maybe a voting machine's not safe.

398
00:18:40,003 --> 00:18:42,990
We released a report
for the voting village.

399
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:44,610
That ended up influencing a lot

400
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:47,580
of different elections in counties.

401
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:50,130
I think Virginia was probably
the most famous for us

402
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:51,480
because they referenced our report

403
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,520
when they changed back
to paper marking devices,

404
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,590
paper ballot marking devices.

405
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:57,120
And that's our shining example

406
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,980
of what we want to try to accomplish.

407
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:00,720
It's not always gonna happen,

408
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,310
but I think that's the power

409
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:05,910
of combining the two communities,
is that kind of change.

410
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:08,910
And then being a positive
example for other conferences

411
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:10,890
to copy what we're doing,

412
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:14,310
and really foster this
relationship around the world.

413
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:16,923
So, okay sorry, I got sidetracked.

414
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:20,580
Take it away, Beau.

415
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:21,730
- All right, thank you.

416
00:19:22,712 --> 00:19:25,629
(crowd applauding)

417
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:29,573
Thank you, Jeff.

418
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:36,150
All right, so we'll go to
our third and last person

419
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:37,530
over there on the right

420
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:39,960
to give their historical perspective.

421
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,860
- I'll try to be quick 'cause
Jeff took up a lot of time.

422
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:43,693
(everyone laughing)

423
00:19:43,693 --> 00:19:46,577
I'm Space Rogue, and some of you know me.

424
00:19:46,577 --> 00:19:50,130
It was like 25 years ago, I guess in 1998,

425
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:53,370
I was with a group called
L0pht Heavy Industries,

426
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:55,200
group of hackers outta Boston.

427
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,700
And we somehow ended up
in front of what is now

428
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,970
the Homeland Security
Committee in Washington, DC,

429
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:05,220
testifying on weak computer
security in government.

430
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,470
- [Attendee] Space Rogue!

431
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:08,543
- There he is.

432
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:13,380
So that was, I mean, up until that point,

433
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:17,130
really the only policy that
had happened was like CFAA

434
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:18,750
and some other laws that had been passed.

435
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:21,120
And if you go back and you
read the original CFAA,

436
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,410
you can tell the people who wrote it,

437
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:24,300
did it basically in a vacuum.

438
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:26,880
They had no concept of what was real

439
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,180
and what was really gonna
make any difference.

440
00:20:30,014 --> 00:20:32,430
That law has been amended
several times since then,

441
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:33,780
thank goodness, it still needs work.

442
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:37,170
But anyway, so we went to
Congress and we testified

443
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:38,370
and we basically told them their pants

444
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:40,530
were down around on their
ankles and the internet was weak

445
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:42,610
and everything was open

446
00:20:43,813 --> 00:20:46,170
and peoples' eyes just
opened up really wide,

447
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:47,320
like, "oh my goodness."

448
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:50,040
But not a lot changed after that.

449
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:53,673
That was really my
first foray into policy.

450
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:56,670
Over the years, since then,

451
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:59,070
I've been involved at various companies

452
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:01,020
where we would do briefings on the Hill

453
00:21:02,521 --> 00:21:05,460
and talk to lawmakers in DC.

454
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:06,570
And Beau was very instrumental

455
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:08,430
in doing his "Hackers on the Hill,"

456
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:10,590
where we would get a
bunch of hackers together

457
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:14,220
and go visit representatives
and their staff

458
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:16,260
and senators and their staff,

459
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:20,460
and try to discuss issues of the day

460
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:23,670
and try to bring their knowledge level up.

461
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:26,220
Not so much as to actually write policy,

462
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,390
but so that when they do

463
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:30,210
go to write their policies
and pass their laws,

464
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:33,150
that they do so with a
little bit more knowledge.

465
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:38,150
I wanna paraphrase something
that DT said over at Black Hat,

466
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:43,290
that we have struggled for a long time

467
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:45,273
as a community, as a group,

468
00:21:48,001 --> 00:21:50,279
as people who are trying
to make the world safer,

469
00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:52,857
and make the world a better
place and trying to do that.

470
00:21:52,857 --> 00:21:55,893
And we've started out
trying to educate the user.

471
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,580
And say, "hey, don't click stuff,"

472
00:22:00,829 --> 00:22:02,160
or "be wary of this email."

473
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,740
And that has had limited success.

474
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:07,890
It really hasn't gone very
far. Its made some progress.

475
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:09,630
And so we sort of changed our focus

476
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:10,767
and we went over to companies.

477
00:22:10,767 --> 00:22:13,530
And we said, "hey, you
need to secure your stuff.

478
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:15,870
You need to work on this or that."

479
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:17,580
And by proxy with companies,

480
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:19,290
we also relied on insurance companies.

481
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:21,090
We're like, "oh insurance
companies gonna have to pay out

482
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:21,923
when there's a breach,

483
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:23,850
so they're gonna force
companies to be secure."

484
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:26,850
And it hasn't really worked
out the way we'd hoped either.

485
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:29,340
Its made some progress again,
like educating the user.

486
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:31,350
And then the third thing
we've been relying on

487
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,603
is legislation or regulation.

488
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:36,450
Not necessarily laws,

489
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:40,800
but self-regulation industry
groups coming together,

490
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,540
and we've met with
limited success with that.

491
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:45,090
So we sort of have a three-pronged area

492
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:48,150
that we need to focus on
to get security to a point

493
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:51,630
where the user is safe, educate the user,

494
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:54,720
push companies and insurance
companies and the policy.

495
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,920
Which is why we're here now.

496
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,680
Its to try to focus on
policy, advance the narrative,

497
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,960
educate the people who
are writing the policies

498
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,183
and get to a point where things are safe.

499
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:07,860
Beau?
- Cool. Thank you.

500
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:11,040
So obviously Jeff talked about

501
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,650
his vision for the policy department

502
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:16,980
and a little bit of the nuance
that went into forming it,

503
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:21,210
but DEFCON has a long history
of doing public policy

504
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:24,180
even before the voting village.

505
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:25,950
And that was a really
good story that you told

506
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:29,613
about how you accidentally
changed things in Washington.

507
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:32,610
But even at DEFCON one,

508
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:34,860
there were policy conversations
that were going on.

509
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:37,041
There were legal conversations
that were going on.

510
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:38,247
There were a lot of
these same conversations

511
00:23:38,247 --> 00:23:41,130
and I think we kind of tend to forget

512
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:45,510
that public policy is just
a way to change the world.

513
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:48,360
And a lot of hackers really
want to change the world.

514
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:51,120
I won't say "Hack the
Planet" just for Space Rogue,

515
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,349
but "Hack the Planet."

516
00:23:52,349 --> 00:23:55,951
- [Space Rogue] I really
hate that. (chuckling)

517
00:23:55,951 --> 00:23:58,830
- And there's been a lot of other things.

518
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:01,830
How many people remember when
they were members of Congress

519
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:03,123
who came out to DEFCON?

520
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:07,200
Yeah, so we've had many,
many members of Congress

521
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,560
come out to DEFCON and give talks,

522
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:13,680
give sessions over in the
crypto and privacy village

523
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:17,520
or here on the main stage.

524
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,480
I think there have been

525
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,600
five members of Congress
now who have done that.

526
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,713
It's kind of epic.

527
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:29,150
We've also had high ranking
members of the government,

528
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:30,723
the executive branch come in.

529
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:36,030
And today on this same stage,
the National Cyber Director,

530
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:38,220
Chris Inglis is gonna be here.

531
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:40,320
And in case you don't know,

532
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,420
the National Cyber Director's
office was stood up

533
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,280
through a congressional act,

534
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:50,490
fueled by a report that a lot
of hackers contributed to.

535
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:52,490
And a lot of people who are in this room

536
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:56,310
helped advise and build that up.

537
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:58,860
We're also gonna have Director
Jen Easterly from CISA

538
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:00,870
here on the stage.

539
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:03,930
She will also be talking about

540
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:06,660
getting more hackers
involved in public policy.

541
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:09,630
So I think it's kind of in our
DNA at this point at DEFCON.

542
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:10,920
And so it only seems right

543
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:15,920
that we should have an
outward, more visible,

544
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:19,263
more overt and planned response to it.

545
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:23,700
But it's not just about me.

546
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:26,400
It's not just about the
folks on the stage now,

547
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,050
but we've got a really, really,

548
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:31,200
really talented policy department team.

549
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,930
And I wanted to bring some of them up now

550
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:36,720
to talk about some of their experiences,

551
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,210
what got them into public policy,

552
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:41,190
why they think you're
gonna get something out

553
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:45,570
of these sessions and hopefully
inspire you to come out

554
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:47,790
and participate in some of
the public policy discussions

555
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:52,790
that we're having, which is
over in rooms 224 through 226,

556
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:56,970
the policy department on your map.

557
00:25:56,970 --> 00:26:01,830
So I'd like to introduce some
of the amazing policy team.

558
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:03,930
There are many others in the policy team

559
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:07,050
who are holding down the fort
over at the policy department

560
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:09,093
or waiting for their shifts to start.

561
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,610
And so I want to give each of these folks

562
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:14,010
a couple of minutes to
introduce themselves

563
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:16,050
and give you some perspective

564
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:18,600
and then we'll have a few
minutes to take questions.

565
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:21,191
So Jenny, do you wanna come up?

566
00:26:21,191 --> 00:26:22,441
- [Jenny] Sure.

567
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:31,803
- Hi y'all. I'm Mosfet.

568
00:26:32,878 --> 00:26:36,180
I've been coming to DEFCON
for just over a decade,

569
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:38,190
for as long as I've been a hacker.

570
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:41,280
I was a hardware hacker,
I was a packet hacker,

571
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,933
and now I'm a policy hacker.

572
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,410
A few years ago in pre-pandemic times,

573
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:49,050
I had the opportunity to
jump into the deep end

574
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:54,050
of policy making not knowing
anything about cyber policy.

575
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:58,080
I earned a spot in a
fellowship called TechCongress,

576
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:02,760
uprooted my life, quit my
day job, and moved to DC.

577
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:07,760
After a two week crash course,
I went to work for Congress.

578
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:12,900
On day one, my hacker friends informed me,

579
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,550
to my existential dread,

580
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:15,843
that I was now a fed.

581
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,000
But it didn't take long, I was hooked.

582
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,150
Public policy, the laws,
and the regulations

583
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:26,730
that governments all over
the world were making,

584
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:31,020
played such a big role in my
hacker job and in my life,

585
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:33,180
and I had no idea.

586
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:37,350
So DEFCON policy for me is here.
So you don't have to be me.

587
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:38,880
You don't have to jump in the deep end.

588
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,770
You don't have to quit your day job.

589
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:42,840
You can come to our talks
and come to our village

590
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:45,060
and interface with those policy makers

591
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:47,970
and learn a little more
about how public policy

592
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:50,670
might be affecting your job
and how you can change it

593
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:52,980
and how you can influence it.

594
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:54,900
We can help you make those discussions

595
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,580
and get in the conversation.

596
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:59,700
And if you wanna quit your
day job and come to Congress,

597
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:02,780
we can talk too. (chuckling)

598
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:03,613
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

599
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:07,558
(crowd applauding)

600
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,560
Hello everyone.

601
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:13,563
My mask is stuck on my earring.
My name is Sarah Powazek.

602
00:28:13,563 --> 00:28:17,040
It's really nice to meet
you all and I wanna say

603
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:21,450
that we absolutely cannot make
good policy without you all.

604
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:23,160
In fact, good, impactful,

605
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:26,460
thoughtful policy about
cybersecurity is only possible,

606
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:28,200
if we have the folks
who are actually doing

607
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,800
the day-to-day work integrally
involved in that process.

608
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:34,230
And that is why it is so, so important

609
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:36,570
that you all are here,
interested in policy,

610
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:38,610
coming to our talks.

611
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:40,080
I got my start in policy

612
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,930
helping a group of cyber
practitioners put together

613
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:46,530
recommendations on how to
combat ransomware as a nation.

614
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:50,610
And I think that having a
group of practitioners there

615
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:53,550
made an incredible difference
in the sorts of proposals

616
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:55,680
that we actually ended up putting out.

617
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:58,320
We had a whole section of
the report that we put out

618
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,230
that was only focused
on helping organizations

619
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:04,950
improve their cybersecurity
maturity, giving them funding,

620
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:06,570
creating funds to help them

621
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:08,880
with response if they're attacked.

622
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:12,660
And I think that that
victim centric viewpoint

623
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:14,670
is something unique to
the hacker community,

624
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:17,970
that spends day in day
out actually helping folks

625
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:21,240
recover and defend themselves
against these attackers.

626
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,700
And that was having
those folks in the room,

627
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:26,280
absolutely change the course
of the sorts of proposals

628
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,360
that we put out.

629
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:32,360
Folks also strayed away from
recommending punitive measures.

630
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:35,370
We were much more focused on attacking

631
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:37,290
the threat actors through sanctions,

632
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:39,690
attacking cryptocurrency launderers,

633
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:42,240
and focusing on positive incentives

634
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,790
for organizations and for individuals,

635
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:47,880
tying funding to improving
cybersecurity maturity.

636
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,370
And absolutely all of
that is due to the fact

637
00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:51,900
that we had folks who were on the ground

638
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,347
coming into these discussions and saying,

639
00:29:53,347 --> 00:29:56,070
"no, we need to make sure that
people have the resources,

640
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:59,520
that they need, the
education that they need."

641
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,950
And that's the sort of
voice that you folks

642
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:03,060
bring to public policy.

643
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:05,250
It is absolutely crucial.

644
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:08,550
We have a bunch of big problems coming up.

645
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:09,750
Ransomware is one of them,

646
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:13,560
protecting critical infrastructure,
securing our elections.

647
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,393
And I would say that

648
00:30:14,393 --> 00:30:17,400
there isn't a right policy
solution for those problems,

649
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,500
but there's absolutely a right process

650
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:21,090
to create that policy.

651
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:23,940
And that process is one where
you are all at the table.

652
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:25,350
So I really hope you'll join us

653
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:27,930
at the public policy talks
in the policy village

654
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:29,100
and in track two today.

655
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,120
Again, Sarah Powazek,

656
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,260
it's really nice to meet you all

657
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:33,250
and I'll give it up for Harley.

658
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:36,167
(crowd applauding)

659
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:42,870
- Hi everybody. I hope that
you're having a great time.

660
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:44,670
Thanks very much for coming.

661
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:49,440
So my name is Harley and I
am a cybersecurity attorney.

662
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,540
I've been working in cybersecurity law

663
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:53,610
and technology policy for several years.

664
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:55,110
I'm a former congressional staffer

665
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:57,570
and now I'm the Senior
Public Policy Director

666
00:30:57,570 --> 00:31:00,210
at a cybersecurity company called Rapid7.

667
00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:03,840
I wanted to get into policy
because I wanted to help people.

668
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:07,560
I wanted to protect consumers
and advance human rights.

669
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:10,770
And cybersecurity is consumer protection.

670
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:13,500
Hacker rights are human rights.

671
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,690
What the security community does

672
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:19,080
in finding vulnerabilities
that can then be fixed,

673
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,820
protects everybody in society

674
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:22,800
and especially the most
vulnerable among us, right?

675
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:26,730
To consumers, vulnerable
populations, dissidents, users,

676
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:29,790
including enterprises and everybody else,

677
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:31,110
it's really important.

678
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:34,350
And its never really been a better time

679
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:37,950
to be a hacker interested
in policy than right now.

680
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:40,650
The barriers to getting
your input to government

681
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:42,750
have arguably never been lower.

682
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:44,760
And I'll just give you an example.

683
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:47,340
Just yesterday, the Federal
Trade Commission put out

684
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:50,280
a call for public comments on privacy,

685
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,680
data security, and
commercial surveillance.

686
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:55,470
They would love to hear
from a community like this

687
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:57,990
that has an outside DC perspective,

688
00:31:57,990 --> 00:31:59,970
and a lot of technical savvy.

689
00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:02,400
Government really does want
to hear what you are saying.

690
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:05,010
And there's lots of activity like this

691
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:07,110
on cybersecurity policy happening

692
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:08,190
within government right now.

693
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:09,690
They get that it's a problem

694
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:11,280
and they're trying to
figure out how to fix it

695
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:13,320
and they need your input.

696
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:17,190
And I know that this community
has a lot of valuable input

697
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:18,750
that they can provide to governments.

698
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:23,190
I think though that often,
what becomes a challenge is,

699
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:25,500
understanding where to comment,

700
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,060
to whom should the comments be sent,

701
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:28,500
how it'd have the most impact,

702
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,480
what sort of format
and that kind of thing.

703
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,150
And that is part of what DEFCON policy

704
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:35,490
is here to help solve.

705
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:37,207
So to help build that connective tissue

706
00:32:37,207 --> 00:32:40,530
by bringing in policy makers
to the hacker community,

707
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:42,480
bringing hackers to policy makers,

708
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,240
and identifying those
venues for collaboration.

709
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:48,270
So that policy going
forward has your input

710
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:51,541
and it makes us all more
secure. Thank you all very much.

711
00:32:51,541 --> 00:32:54,458
(crowd applauding)

712
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:58,620
- Good morning, everybody.

713
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:00,090
My name is Will Loomis,

714
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:03,030
and I am the Associate Director
of the Cyber Policy Program

715
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:05,850
at a DC think tank called
the Atlantic Council.

716
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:07,590
I've been working on cyber policy issues

717
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:09,117
for about five years now.

718
00:33:09,117 --> 00:33:10,380
And one thing that I've seen

719
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:12,600
over the course of the
last two or three years

720
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,640
is a serious increase in momentum

721
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:17,310
when it comes to policy
making around InfoSec

722
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:19,290
and cybersecurity issues.

723
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:21,780
I think we've seen a couple of
really high profile incidents

724
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:22,920
in the last couple years.

725
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:26,460
Stuff like Solar Winds,
Colonial Pipeline and Log4J,

726
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:27,330
that have really functioned

727
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:30,030
as the proverbial kick in the ass needed

728
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:33,900
to get kind of action going
within government here.

729
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:36,870
And right now these
folks within government

730
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:39,480
are writing the legislation and the policy

731
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,970
around InfoSec and cybersecurity issues

732
00:33:41,970 --> 00:33:44,010
that will really kind of manage the way

733
00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:45,540
that we deal with these
issues over the course

734
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:46,770
of the next decade.

735
00:33:46,770 --> 00:33:48,450
And I really, really, really,

736
00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:50,520
really strongly believe that hackers need

737
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,560
to be a part of that conversation.

738
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,120
And that's really why I got involved

739
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,880
with DEFCON policy this year.

740
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:57,810
So just quickly,

741
00:33:57,810 --> 00:33:58,890
I think DEFCON policy

742
00:33:58,890 --> 00:34:02,130
is really trying to do three
main things, at least to me.

743
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:04,500
The first is lowering barriers to entry

744
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,760
to these types of government folks

745
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:08,970
and making it easier to
have these conversations.

746
00:34:08,970 --> 00:34:12,027
The second is really
working to translate both,

747
00:34:12,027 --> 00:34:15,630
to make sure that hackers
can understand policy makers

748
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:17,340
and vice versa.

749
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:18,720
And the third is just making sure

750
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:21,270
that we're establishing
meaningful connections

751
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:23,490
and building communities
around these issues.

752
00:34:23,490 --> 00:34:25,470
These can't be one off conversations.

753
00:34:25,470 --> 00:34:27,780
They need to be sustained to make sure

754
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:29,400
that we're making the
right types of changes

755
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,110
in conversations here.

756
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:33,180
So we have a lot of really good content

757
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:36,780
going over the next three days
at the DEFCON policy village.

758
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:38,580
Some talks that are focused more on

759
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:40,440
specific substantive issues like

760
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,630
open source software supply chain security

761
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:45,000
and others that are
kind of more focused on

762
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,920
that building relationships bit.

763
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,907
Like the "Meet ONCD" and

764
00:34:48,907 --> 00:34:52,110
"Meet Cybersecurity and
Infrastructure Security Agency"

765
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:54,900
sessions that Beau was talking
a little bit about earlier.

766
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:57,000
So I really encourage you all to stop by

767
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,350
over the course of the next three days,

768
00:34:58,350 --> 00:34:59,640
we got a lot of really good programming

769
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:00,690
that we're really excited about

770
00:35:00,690 --> 00:35:03,633
and hope you guys enjoy
it too. Thanks y'all.

771
00:35:03,633 --> 00:35:07,380
(crowd applauding)

772
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:10,860
- Thanks Will. Hi, I am Doug Duck.

773
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:12,660
My voice hopefully will
come back by the end of CON

774
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:14,940
if I don't shout and
make a whole too much.

775
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:17,850
I have a bunch of stuff I wrote down here.

776
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:19,830
I think a lot of it's been covered,

777
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:21,060
but really what I'm here to do

778
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:23,820
is to call out to the hacker family here.

779
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:25,350
I know many of you,

780
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:28,020
most of you perhaps want
to make a difference,

781
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:29,670
like we were saying.

782
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:30,690
You wanna make the world better.

783
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:33,360
You wanna make it safer,
make it more secure.

784
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:38,360
And if you don't engage with
the right aspects of security,

785
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,660
you're not gonna get security.

786
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:41,160
If you're in a corporation,

787
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,290
you talk about securing the systems.

788
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:44,610
And I think we all know at this point

789
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:45,810
that it's also the human factor,

790
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,820
it's also security awareness.

791
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:49,320
When it comes to policy,

792
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:52,398
when it comes to the
statutory restrictions,

793
00:35:52,398 --> 00:35:56,490
and the legislation, the
regulatory environment,

794
00:35:56,490 --> 00:35:59,430
that has gotten more and more complex

795
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:02,580
and more burdensome over
the last three decades.

796
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:05,970
And I've been involved
in it longer than that.

797
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:10,970
And I am concerned that
if you don't engage

798
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,080
and we don't engage,

799
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:15,480
then you're not gonna get
what you want out of it.

800
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,907
Not because the folks involved in that

801
00:36:17,907 --> 00:36:19,473
are not well intentioned,

802
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:24,630
but because they need to
hear additional perspectives.

803
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:27,990
And we have a lot of potential

804
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:31,080
to make huge, huge, positive impact.

805
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:35,760
We also have a lot of potential
with some of those burdens

806
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:40,680
that are imposed on companies,
on people, on communities.

807
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:43,110
We have a lot of potential
to make things worse,

808
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:47,070
and we wanna make sure
that we are articulating

809
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:49,140
the right approaches that are gonna allow

810
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:51,120
for a risk based solution,

811
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,250
that are gonna allow for nimble solutions.

812
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:55,020
So I would encourage you,

813
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:57,600
if you are sitting there and saying

814
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:00,720
maybe in your hotel
room listening on DCTV,

815
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,677
because I know a lot of people are saying,

816
00:37:02,677 --> 00:37:04,980
"oh my goodness, there's flooding,

817
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:07,440
there's hangovers, whatever
you're not here right now,"

818
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:12,150
come over to the policy
village, have a chat, listen in.

819
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:14,100
I think you're gonna like what you see.

820
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:16,850
Welcome to DEFCON.

821
00:37:16,850 --> 00:37:19,767
(crowd applauding)

822
00:37:21,946 --> 00:37:22,779
- Thank you.

823
00:37:22,779 --> 00:37:25,863
And we've got a few
minutes left for questions.

824
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:27,750
I don't see any mics,

825
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:29,580
but if we've got mics and mic runners,

826
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,140
I'm sure they're coming around.

827
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:32,700
But while we wait on people

828
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:34,170
to generate them from the audience,

829
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:35,910
maybe I'll just throw
a couple of questions

830
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:39,033
into the folks here on my right.

831
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:44,990
So as folks who went into public policy,

832
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:48,030
before that you were kind
of in the hacking community,

833
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:53,010
what was your kind of emotional journey

834
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:54,930
the first time you talked
to a policy person?

835
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:57,570
Was like, "oh, they don't
get it. I need to help."

836
00:37:57,570 --> 00:37:59,820
Or maybe the opposite.
- [Space Rogue] Fear.

837
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:01,950
- Fear? Yeah.

838
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:03,273
- I mean the first time,

839
00:38:04,831 --> 00:38:06,210
that was probably one
of the very first times

840
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:07,440
I'd ever been publicly speaking.

841
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,773
So in 1998, it was a long time
ago. It was definitely fear.

842
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,970
And if you ever watched the CSPAN video,

843
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:17,373
you can see I'm hopelessly
looking at the floor.

844
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:24,110
More recently I think it's
a feeling of education

845
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:30,260
or trying to communicate what is real

846
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:33,480
or that the truth on the
ground, the facts of the case,

847
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:37,770
and trying to make sure
that they understand

848
00:38:37,770 --> 00:38:39,243
your point of view.

849
00:38:41,827 --> 00:38:44,580
And that's the hardest part for me.

850
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:47,580
I'll get in a room with a
staffer or a policy person,

851
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:49,260
and we're having a discussion

852
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:52,140
and I'm explaining whatever
I think is going on.

853
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:54,630
And I'm trying to gauge
their reaction on their face

854
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:57,360
as to whether or not they
actually get it or not.

855
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,527
And sometimes I get that
glimmer in their eyes like,

856
00:38:59,527 --> 00:39:00,630
"oh, this guy understands."

857
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:01,800
And sometimes I don't get that.

858
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,037
And sometimes I get,

859
00:39:03,037 --> 00:39:04,082
"oh, this guy has no clue what's going on,

860
00:39:04,082 --> 00:39:05,793
or gal," excuse me.

861
00:39:11,697 --> 00:39:13,170
So that's the feeling that I get anyway.

862
00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:14,880
I dunno if anybody else wants to --

863
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:18,990
- Yeah. I'd say the first
feeling I had was of frustration

864
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:22,470
because I had seen these
problems out there.

865
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:25,080
There would be ways to fix them,

866
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:27,750
but clearly something wasn't working.

867
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:31,680
And so I wanted to know
why this had happened

868
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,600
and what we could do to make it better.

869
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:36,810
I would echo a lot of Space Rogue's points

870
00:39:36,810 --> 00:39:41,810
that this really is you
need to be persistent,

871
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,700
because policy makers want to learn.

872
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:46,830
They want to know how to do this right.

873
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:49,650
And over time you can help them learn,

874
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:52,200
but it's not gonna change overnight.

875
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:56,130
It's a process that has
taken years, decades,

876
00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:57,930
for us to even get to
the point we are today.

877
00:39:57,930 --> 00:40:00,210
And there's still a lot of room to go.

878
00:40:00,210 --> 00:40:05,210
So have patience but know
that policy makers and hackers

879
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:08,700
share the same goal of
wanting to make progress.

880
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:10,923
And we will get there even if it is slow.

881
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:15,120
- And two things to ask your patience for,

882
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,380
people that are in policy,

883
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:18,630
we tend to say two
relatively douchey things,

884
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:20,070
and thank you for putting
up for it with them.

885
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:21,900
One is we tend to say "cyber" a lot

886
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:25,620
and thank you for your
patience on that issue.

887
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:27,150
It's a DC thing.

888
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:28,590
We also tend to say,

889
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:30,150
we're speaking on our own capacity

890
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:34,170
and not any kind of official
job and speaking as a person.

891
00:40:34,170 --> 00:40:36,390
So thanks for letting us
get that out of the way.

892
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:37,710
And one of the things
that really struck me,

893
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:38,543
I was a veteran,

894
00:40:38,543 --> 00:40:41,181
so I came up kind of dealing with policy

895
00:40:41,181 --> 00:40:43,920
as a little bit more of a natural thing.

896
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:47,490
I got started in doing
this work at the Pentagon,

897
00:40:47,490 --> 00:40:50,130
helping set up the very
first joint cyber command

898
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:51,540
back in the nineties,

899
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:52,440
but what really struck me,

900
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,670
'cause after not long after that,

901
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:57,060
I was at the White House
working these issues

902
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:59,460
and it really struck me on
how much the government folks

903
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:03,030
thought what they did really
mattered into this space.

904
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:06,930
That we were gonna solve this
by setting up some new office

905
00:41:06,930 --> 00:41:10,620
and hiring a couple of civil
servants to do something

906
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:13,440
that I knew the private sector
and the hacker community

907
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:18,210
were already doing and
had been doing for years.

908
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:20,650
And so that's a lot of where I'm in on

909
00:41:21,570 --> 00:41:23,670
and I'm going the policy
makers now to say,

910
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:25,477
I hate sports analogies, but I'm like,

911
00:41:25,477 --> 00:41:27,390
"look, there's a lot of
players on the field.

912
00:41:27,390 --> 00:41:30,090
And generally it's gonna be a hacker.

913
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:32,790
It's gonna be someone
that at a tech company,

914
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:35,460
at a information security company,

915
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:37,860
that's in the position
to most make the play."

916
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:39,630
And so that's one of the
things I really think

917
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:41,160
that they need some help with too.

918
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:43,560
There's a lot of other
people that can help.

919
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:46,350
- One other point, you
mentioned frustration.

920
00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:49,263
This is a looooooong process.

921
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:51,323
I mean, I've been doing this for 25 years

922
00:41:51,323 --> 00:41:53,400
and the needle has moved,

923
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:56,100
but you can't jump into doing policy work

924
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:57,840
and thinking you're gonna
solve everything next week,

925
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,590
'cause that is not going to happen.

926
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:01,710
And everybody agrees.

927
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:05,070
- Anybody on the policy department team

928
00:42:05,070 --> 00:42:06,720
want to answer the same question?

929
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:14,520
- Like Space Rogue said,

930
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:16,830
it was definitely a process

931
00:42:16,830 --> 00:42:19,200
because I was only there
for a year and a half,

932
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:23,220
but the first time I
spoke to a policymaker

933
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:25,770
about a cyber issue,

934
00:42:25,770 --> 00:42:29,160
why TikTok is a national security issue,

935
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:33,780
I realized I needed to learn
from them who CFIUS was,

936
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:35,910
I had as much to learn from them

937
00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:38,280
as they had to learn from the community.

938
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:43,280
And the optimism of all the policy makers

939
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:45,360
to make a difference, to move that needle,

940
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:47,730
even if it's a little bit at a time,

941
00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:51,030
was just off the charts,

942
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:53,760
off the charts how much
they wanted to help.

943
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:56,220
And so this engagement
is wanted and needed

944
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:59,613
and we can learn as much from
them as they can from us.

945
00:43:02,970 --> 00:43:05,970
- So I have maybe a little
bit of a different perspective

946
00:43:05,970 --> 00:43:09,120
insofar as I'm not coming
at policy as an outsider,

947
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:11,370
I'm coming at it as an insider.

948
00:43:11,370 --> 00:43:13,500
This is my career is public policy

949
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:16,200
and living in DC and
talking to policy makers.

950
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:18,900
And my experience has
been largely positive.

951
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:21,480
They've been actually very receptive

952
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:22,770
and there are a lot of ways

953
00:43:22,770 --> 00:43:25,490
that you can communicate
your input to government.

954
00:43:25,490 --> 00:43:29,340
It is not just that there is a lack

955
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:30,780
of technical understanding.

956
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:33,210
In some cases you'll be
surprised by how well

957
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:35,190
they actually understand technology

958
00:43:35,190 --> 00:43:37,050
and may be surprised that government

959
00:43:37,050 --> 00:43:39,480
is already trying to
solve certain problems.

960
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:42,000
If you do try to communicate
your input to government,

961
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,890
I do encourage you to try to look

962
00:43:43,890 --> 00:43:47,520
into what government may
already be doing about that.

963
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:51,030
It's important not to
just appreciate a problem.

964
00:43:51,030 --> 00:43:53,970
We ask our government
officials to solve problems

965
00:43:53,970 --> 00:43:55,560
and that is actually much higher,

966
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:57,090
a much higher level of advocacy

967
00:43:57,090 --> 00:43:58,770
than just identifying a problem.

968
00:43:58,770 --> 00:44:01,560
So bringing to them your
thoughts on a workable solution,

969
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:03,300
it doesn't have to be very polished,

970
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:06,300
but it actually really
advances the ball quite a lot.

971
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:08,910
And then there is one
other uncomfortable truth

972
00:44:08,910 --> 00:44:10,620
in all of this, which is again,

973
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:13,230
not just a lack of
technical understanding,

974
00:44:13,230 --> 00:44:17,730
but there will be lobbying
groups and parties

975
00:44:17,730 --> 00:44:22,380
from corporations or from interest groups,

976
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:24,690
things like that that may
disagree with your position

977
00:44:24,690 --> 00:44:26,130
and run interference.

978
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:29,370
Don't underestimate the power
of that to stall things out

979
00:44:29,370 --> 00:44:32,490
and drag things and problems
and solutions out a lot longer

980
00:44:32,490 --> 00:44:35,373
than you may anticipate. It's
a very profound influence.

981
00:44:37,470 --> 00:44:38,303
- [Beau] Cool. All right.

982
00:44:38,303 --> 00:44:41,253
I saw at least one hand
over here. Yes, sir?

983
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:44,250
- [Attendee] I love the
idea. I think it's great.

984
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:46,607
A lot of us have been doing
policy work (indistinct).

985
00:44:51,210 --> 00:44:54,797
One of the things I think, I
listened to this introduction,

986
00:44:54,797 --> 00:44:58,890
that's fantastic, and my
question is really about,

987
00:44:58,890 --> 00:45:01,852
are you really global,
right? So I hear a lot of US,

988
00:45:01,852 --> 00:45:05,730
I know from my friends
traveling the world,

989
00:45:05,730 --> 00:45:09,671
there's Singapore, UK, what have you,

990
00:45:09,671 --> 00:45:12,018
and they're doing some
incredible stuff as well.

991
00:45:12,018 --> 00:45:16,950
And I think your point about
you all need to work together

992
00:45:16,950 --> 00:45:18,593
and look at other people's work.

993
00:45:18,593 --> 00:45:22,320
I mean, we're seeing some of
this GDPR the last few years.

994
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:25,380
Now in cybersecurity,
you've got a number of facts

995
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:27,154
that are happening in Europe.

996
00:45:27,154 --> 00:45:31,500
How are we at DEFCON on taking
a more global perspective?

997
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:34,653
Not just the US, but a global perspective.

998
00:45:34,653 --> 00:45:36,537
- Yeah. I'll repeat the question

999
00:45:36,537 --> 00:45:40,440
and then add a short thing
and then throw it open.

1000
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:43,350
So the question was, "a lot of
people have been doing policy

1001
00:45:43,350 --> 00:45:46,230
for a long time, which I
think is awesome. Thank you.

1002
00:45:46,230 --> 00:45:49,620
And a lot of the accents on stage here

1003
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:51,660
are gringos, we're Americans.

1004
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:55,830
So what are we doing at
DEFCON, as well as beyond,

1005
00:45:55,830 --> 00:45:57,957
to make things more global?"

1006
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:00,960
And I'll say this year
has been very challenging

1007
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,160
for DEFCON in particular

1008
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:05,250
because we're still in
the aftermath of COVID

1009
00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:08,580
and some of the travel restrictions

1010
00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:10,680
and costs and everything else.

1011
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:13,020
But we actually do have quite a few folks.

1012
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:15,180
We've got a panel coming up today later,

1013
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:17,040
that is an international panel

1014
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:20,520
that has Singapore and the UK represented.

1015
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:21,750
And we've tried to weave in

1016
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:23,700
international perspectives where we can.

1017
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:27,660
Some of the conversations
over in the policy department

1018
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:30,630
are very internationally focused.

1019
00:46:30,630 --> 00:46:33,060
So we're trying, we would
love to have more help

1020
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:35,010
getting better at being more international

1021
00:46:35,010 --> 00:46:38,160
and maybe bringing the
message of DEFCON more broadly

1022
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:39,810
and bringing more
international folks here.

1023
00:46:39,810 --> 00:46:42,083
So for the rest of the group?

1024
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:44,430
- [Jay] Yeah, I would just add that,

1025
00:46:44,430 --> 00:46:47,160
so I'm on the CFP review board,

1026
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:50,387
so in the people that submit talks

1027
00:46:50,387 --> 00:46:53,520
through the main process
rather than through the DEFCON.

1028
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:55,350
It comes up a lot also for Black Hat,

1029
00:46:55,350 --> 00:46:57,177
I'm on the Black Hat policy.

1030
00:46:57,177 --> 00:46:59,130
And it comes up a lot of
just trying to make sure

1031
00:46:59,130 --> 00:47:02,670
that we're not just picking the US talks.

1032
00:47:02,670 --> 00:47:03,660
It's really difficult.

1033
00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:07,140
We're not always getting
the talks submitted,

1034
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:09,090
but thanks for helping
keep our attention to it.

1035
00:47:09,090 --> 00:47:10,803
And so we appreciate it.

1036
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,723
- [Beau] All right, I
see one way over there.

1037
00:47:18,184 --> 00:47:19,360
- [Attendee] Good
morning. Can you hear me?

1038
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:20,193
- Yes.

1039
00:47:21,427 --> 00:47:23,658
- I'm curious about
the panel's perspective

1040
00:47:23,658 --> 00:47:27,457
on the question of policy
and also regulations.

1041
00:47:27,457 --> 00:47:28,587
Should we be restricted

1042
00:47:28,587 --> 00:47:31,545
on the types of controls that we use?

1043
00:47:31,545 --> 00:47:33,895
Or should we take a (indistinct) approach

1044
00:47:33,895 --> 00:47:35,028
in terms of just addressing risks.

1045
00:47:35,028 --> 00:47:37,689
So for example, should policy mandate

1046
00:47:37,689 --> 00:47:40,743
passwords or multifactor authentication?

1047
00:47:40,743 --> 00:47:42,870
- Okay. So I'll just repeat the question,

1048
00:47:42,870 --> 00:47:44,820
then throw it to the group.

1049
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:48,780
How prescriptive versus
descriptive should policies be?

1050
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:52,113
For instance, mandating
multifactor authentication?

1051
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:56,280
- [Jack] So I can start
with taking a crack at that.

1052
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:58,800
I think that, and especially
when we're thinking of,

1053
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:00,330
for instance law,

1054
00:48:00,330 --> 00:48:02,940
we have to keep in mind that
something we write today

1055
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:05,220
is gonna apply 10 years from now.

1056
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:07,980
And we have to make sure that what we do

1057
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:10,440
doesn't lead to unintended consequences.

1058
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:13,230
So multifactor authentication

1059
00:48:13,230 --> 00:48:14,820
might be a best practice today.

1060
00:48:14,820 --> 00:48:17,850
We don't know if it'll be a
best practice 10 years from now.

1061
00:48:17,850 --> 00:48:20,070
So I think this is very
similar in a lot of ways

1062
00:48:20,070 --> 00:48:23,460
to what we're seeing
with security compliance,

1063
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:25,800
where we don't want to just make something

1064
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:28,860
where it's check off these
boxes and then you're secure,

1065
00:48:28,860 --> 00:48:31,350
because as everyone in this room knows,

1066
00:48:31,350 --> 00:48:34,650
compliance doesn't actually
equate to security.

1067
00:48:34,650 --> 00:48:37,620
So I think it's a very
similar model with policy

1068
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:40,140
where we want to think
about what are the goals

1069
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:42,930
we can set out that get
us to where we want to be,

1070
00:48:42,930 --> 00:48:44,790
without having to be over prescriptive,

1071
00:48:44,790 --> 00:48:49,790
without having to, say
codify, like these X controls,

1072
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:53,790
but rather what is the end state and then

1073
00:48:53,790 --> 00:48:56,303
can there be a kind of
flexible approach to get there.

1074
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:01,560
- Oh please.

1075
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:03,313
- [Jay] Oh no, please go ahead Harley.

1076
00:49:03,313 --> 00:49:05,940
- So the question of whether regulation

1077
00:49:05,940 --> 00:49:08,790
should be prescriptive
or just very flexible

1078
00:49:08,790 --> 00:49:13,050
is actually a perennial
problem in DC policy making.

1079
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:16,470
And you see this endlessly
battled on both sides

1080
00:49:16,470 --> 00:49:17,340
and it's one of those reasons

1081
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:20,250
why the process gets drawn
out, as we discussed.

1082
00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:21,750
I think that there is a move now

1083
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:26,640
towards more risk based regulation,

1084
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:29,400
recognizing that one enterprise's risks

1085
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:31,860
or one community's risks
are not the same as another.

1086
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:35,280
The problem there though is
that sometimes it is easier

1087
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:39,300
to fudge enforcement
on risk based security.

1088
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:41,730
And so I think we're also
seeing a bit of a movement

1089
00:49:41,730 --> 00:49:43,830
towards some minimum baselines.

1090
00:49:43,830 --> 00:49:47,040
So that, you know, you have
to do this minimum baseline

1091
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:48,690
if you want to address your risk.

1092
00:49:48,690 --> 00:49:51,000
But the rest of it is a process
of identifying your risk

1093
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,860
and having safeguards around it.

1094
00:49:52,860 --> 00:49:55,740
Most of the new regulations
around safeguards

1095
00:49:55,740 --> 00:49:57,030
seem to be built that way,

1096
00:49:57,030 --> 00:49:59,040
but it also depends on what
you're trying to address.

1097
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:00,930
So things like incident
reporting tend to be

1098
00:50:00,930 --> 00:50:03,270
a lot more prescriptive
and less risk based.

1099
00:50:03,270 --> 00:50:05,470
So I think it's both,
I think it's a hybrid.

1100
00:50:09,794 --> 00:50:11,610
- And I think to that last point,

1101
00:50:11,610 --> 00:50:14,010
it's precisely for that reason,

1102
00:50:14,010 --> 00:50:15,720
that we need you in the conversation

1103
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:19,830
because just because
there's a lot of folks

1104
00:50:19,830 --> 00:50:20,790
in the room that think they're very,

1105
00:50:20,790 --> 00:50:23,280
very smart hackers doesn't,
mean you are always right.

1106
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:25,230
But it does mean that if you listen

1107
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:27,030
to the other side of the equation

1108
00:50:27,030 --> 00:50:29,070
and we think about the consequences,

1109
00:50:29,070 --> 00:50:30,870
both intended and unintended,

1110
00:50:30,870 --> 00:50:32,870
we're gonna likely get a better outcome.

1111
00:50:35,010 --> 00:50:38,010
- [Jay] And I'll just say, the very first,

1112
00:50:38,010 --> 00:50:39,560
as far as we know in the world,

1113
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:44,020
national policy document
that really tackled this,

1114
00:50:44,020 --> 00:50:46,440
especially for a critical
infrastructure protection,

1115
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:49,440
was 1998; it was from the
Clinton administration.

1116
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:52,770
And it said we don't wanna regulate,

1117
00:50:52,770 --> 00:50:55,140
but if market forces aren't
obviously solving the problem,

1118
00:50:55,140 --> 00:50:56,100
we might need to.

1119
00:50:56,100 --> 00:51:00,377
So that was almost 25 years
ago that we came up with that.

1120
00:51:00,377 --> 00:51:02,040
And so we're still here, right?

1121
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:02,873
We're at DEFCON 30

1122
00:51:02,873 --> 00:51:05,280
and we know the problems
haven't been solved.

1123
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:06,330
And I think you'll see a difference

1124
00:51:06,330 --> 00:51:07,590
between existing regulation.

1125
00:51:07,590 --> 00:51:08,820
We've got a ton of regulation,

1126
00:51:08,820 --> 00:51:10,650
the finance sector, the energy sector,

1127
00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:12,510
a lot of 'em are already
heavily regulated.

1128
00:51:12,510 --> 00:51:13,950
You've got things like the SCC

1129
00:51:13,950 --> 00:51:15,960
going to publicly traded companies.

1130
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:18,180
So hope that after you do see regulation,

1131
00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:20,820
it's gonna be locking in and
looking these different areas.

1132
00:51:20,820 --> 00:51:22,290
And especially it's great
to see the frameworks

1133
00:51:22,290 --> 00:51:23,850
that are coming out.

1134
00:51:23,850 --> 00:51:25,770
The NIST Cybersecurity
Framework is not a regulation,

1135
00:51:25,770 --> 00:51:30,303
but boy it's really helped
drive a lot of positive change.

1136
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:32,940
- [Beau] All right.

1137
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:34,757
Yes. Over here.

1138
00:51:34,757 --> 00:51:39,757
- [Attendee] Oh hey (indistinct)
crypto privacy village.

1139
00:51:45,657 --> 00:51:49,943
We put out some guidance yesterday
that doesn't require MFA,

1140
00:51:49,943 --> 00:51:54,943
but (indistinct) to MFA,
may be illegal? (indistinct)

1141
00:51:56,894 --> 00:51:58,908
I also have a question
for the whole panel,

1142
00:51:58,908 --> 00:52:03,325
one by one your favorite
female or non-binary hacker?

1143
00:52:05,227 --> 00:52:09,150
- Before we do that, for
those who didn't hear,

1144
00:52:09,150 --> 00:52:10,893
you said tomorrow 4:00 PM?

1145
00:52:12,314 --> 00:52:15,150
Today 4:00 PM today,
crypto privacy village

1146
00:52:15,150 --> 00:52:16,083
talking about MFA.

1147
00:52:18,450 --> 00:52:19,740
- [Beau] Okay. You wanna start.

1148
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:23,490
- My favorite female or non-binary hacker?

1149
00:52:23,490 --> 00:52:28,490
Can I give you three? BIA,
Katie Moe, and Window.

1150
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:33,450
- [Jack] Stole one of mine there,

1151
00:52:33,450 --> 00:52:35,520
I'll go with Jen Easterly.

1152
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:37,680
I think Director Easterly
has done a great job

1153
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:39,630
kind of taking the helms at CISA

1154
00:52:39,630 --> 00:52:42,483
and I'm looking forward to
see where she continues it.

1155
00:52:44,030 --> 00:52:45,197
- [Attendee] I can't
tell what you're saying.

1156
00:52:45,197 --> 00:52:46,863
- Sorry, Jen Easterly.

1157
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,710
- [Jay] And I'll add Amélie Koran to that,

1158
00:52:49,710 --> 00:52:51,780
especially 'cause Beau and
I have done a lot of work

1159
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:54,087
on hacker film festival called "Defrag,"

1160
00:52:54,087 --> 00:52:57,120
and the knowledge that
Amélie brings of hacking

1161
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:59,040
and of just so many other

1162
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:02,913
awesome nerdy stuff like
soundtracks, fabulous.

1163
00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:06,750
- [Beau] Yeah, couple
of mine also got stolen,

1164
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:07,980
but that's great.

1165
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:11,733
I'd say Alyssa Knight is
another one who's awesome.

1166
00:53:12,570 --> 00:53:15,600
And I'll go with maybe
an unconventional one.

1167
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:17,457
I really like Jen Ellis.

1168
00:53:22,650 --> 00:53:25,500
She's not a hacker herself,

1169
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:27,267
but comes from the hacker community

1170
00:53:27,267 --> 00:53:29,790
and has done a lot to
really advance public policy

1171
00:53:29,790 --> 00:53:31,440
and to bridge those gaps as well.

1172
00:53:33,510 --> 00:53:34,360
Anybody up there.

1173
00:53:36,690 --> 00:53:39,330
- [Doug] Hey, I'm gonna
go for Grace Hopper.

1174
00:53:39,330 --> 00:53:42,663
I know that's an old one but
she was freaking awesome.

1175
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:48,270
- I'll give you three.

1176
00:53:48,270 --> 00:53:50,460
I think Grace Hopper is great,

1177
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:52,623
Katie Moussouris and Emily Velasco.

1178
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:57,390
- I'm also gonna cheat and do two,

1179
00:53:57,390 --> 00:54:00,153
I'll say Amélie Koran and Katie Hegemon.

1180
00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:07,179
- [Jenny] Me!

1181
00:54:07,179 --> 00:54:10,179
(crowd applauding)

1182
00:54:11,610 --> 00:54:14,370
But my hero is Dr. Lorrie Cranor,

1183
00:54:14,370 --> 00:54:18,069
password researcher at Carnegie Mellon.

1184
00:54:18,069 --> 00:54:19,830
(clapping)

1185
00:54:19,830 --> 00:54:22,773
- [Beau] All right, I saw
another hand, here's one.

1186
00:54:25,350 --> 00:54:29,237
- [Attendee] So I work in policy,
I used to work in Congress

1187
00:54:32,008 --> 00:54:35,380
and at some point I
think we're frustrating,

1188
00:54:35,380 --> 00:54:40,380
and at times, did I stick
with it? Yes, but (indistinct)

1189
00:54:56,344 --> 00:54:58,761
(indistinct)

1190
00:55:02,610 --> 00:55:03,840
- Great question.

1191
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:06,153
So the question for the cameras is,

1192
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:09,930
there's a lot of really good
technical people in here.

1193
00:55:09,930 --> 00:55:12,720
How do you convince them
to get started talking

1194
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:14,670
with policy folks and stay with it,

1195
00:55:14,670 --> 00:55:17,463
since it can be a long drawn out process?

1196
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:28,598
- [Jay] A lot of it is
getting to know the staffers.

1197
00:55:28,598 --> 00:55:30,840
A lot of times you're working
with a member of Congress

1198
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:32,010
or your local equivalent.

1199
00:55:32,010 --> 00:55:34,260
Like do this thing at your city council.

1200
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:36,270
Do this for your town, your village,

1201
00:55:36,270 --> 00:55:41,270
do this for your legislature,
for your state or your region.

1202
00:55:44,310 --> 00:55:47,040
The attention of the policymaker
is gonna drift, right?

1203
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:49,950
If something happens that day,

1204
00:55:49,950 --> 00:55:51,000
they're not gonna have your attention.

1205
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:54,330
It's really the staffers
like Harley had mentioned,

1206
00:55:54,330 --> 00:55:57,900
like Mosfet had been
helping that they're there.

1207
00:55:57,900 --> 00:56:00,480
They are there year in year out

1208
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:03,990
and they need to know the
ask the right questions,

1209
00:56:03,990 --> 00:56:06,420
and so I think staying in with them.

1210
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:07,830
And I always try and tell myself,

1211
00:56:07,830 --> 00:56:10,443
like please, to help you on the patience,

1212
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:13,590
I suck at billiards.

1213
00:56:13,590 --> 00:56:15,630
And so whenever I'm
playing pool with a buddy,

1214
00:56:15,630 --> 00:56:17,010
my job is just to get the ball

1215
00:56:17,010 --> 00:56:19,770
a little bit closer to the hole.

1216
00:56:19,770 --> 00:56:21,510
'Cause if I actually try
and hit it in the hole,

1217
00:56:21,510 --> 00:56:23,820
I'm never gonna get it.

1218
00:56:23,820 --> 00:56:25,950
And it's just gonna ricochet off.

1219
00:56:25,950 --> 00:56:28,410
So just trying those half measures

1220
00:56:28,410 --> 00:56:29,880
and being happy with a half measure

1221
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:32,730
that the ball is a little
bit closer to the pocket.

1222
00:56:32,730 --> 00:56:34,170
And then a little bit closer after that.

1223
00:56:34,170 --> 00:56:35,670
And then the third time I'm hopefully

1224
00:56:35,670 --> 00:56:37,140
gonna be able to sink it.

1225
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:40,380
If you go in thinking
I'm gonna just roll in

1226
00:56:40,380 --> 00:56:42,420
and we're just gonna get this done in one,

1227
00:56:42,420 --> 00:56:46,890
it's almost never gonna happen
unless you get really lucky.

1228
00:56:46,890 --> 00:56:48,930
Sometimes with that political moment,

1229
00:56:48,930 --> 00:56:50,100
like we had this report called

1230
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:51,810
the Cyberspace Solarium Commission,

1231
00:56:51,810 --> 00:56:53,430
the political moment was there

1232
00:56:53,430 --> 00:56:56,490
and shit just lined up and it happened.

1233
00:56:56,490 --> 00:57:00,990
So when you have those
moments, be ready for them.

1234
00:57:00,990 --> 00:57:04,140
When we have the bad thing
happen, as always does,

1235
00:57:04,140 --> 00:57:06,690
and you have the attention
of these policy makers,

1236
00:57:06,690 --> 00:57:09,930
that's when you need to
be ready with your ideas.

1237
00:57:09,930 --> 00:57:11,467
So that you can come in and say,

1238
00:57:11,467 --> 00:57:13,050
"here's what we need to do,"

1239
00:57:13,050 --> 00:57:14,287
rather than beating them up with,

1240
00:57:14,287 --> 00:57:16,487
"we told you this is
what was gonna happen."

1241
00:57:18,750 --> 00:57:19,850
- [Beau] And I'll say,

1242
00:57:22,530 --> 00:57:25,057
I help organize an initiative called,

1243
00:57:25,057 --> 00:57:27,090
"I am the Cavalry" as well.

1244
00:57:27,090 --> 00:57:28,470
And one of the things that we found,

1245
00:57:28,470 --> 00:57:32,400
was the most effective
at bridging the gap,

1246
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:34,230
and I think is actually really helpful,

1247
00:57:34,230 --> 00:57:36,450
for encouraging people to stick with it,

1248
00:57:36,450 --> 00:57:39,240
is starting with building empathy, right?

1249
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:40,740
Get to understand the person,

1250
00:57:40,740 --> 00:57:42,273
why they're doing something.

1251
00:57:43,230 --> 00:57:45,660
For me anyways, it's a
lot more interesting.

1252
00:57:45,660 --> 00:57:47,790
It keeps me a lot more
encouraged to go back

1253
00:57:47,790 --> 00:57:49,590
if I understand their motivations,

1254
00:57:49,590 --> 00:57:52,770
if I understand them as a human being.

1255
00:57:52,770 --> 00:57:54,600
And it gives me a lot more patience

1256
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:56,100
to be able to stick with them,

1257
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:58,920
to work with them, to know
what they're going through.

1258
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:01,000
So maybe just start with

1259
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,690
not just diving into the technical content

1260
00:58:03,690 --> 00:58:05,640
or the policy content,

1261
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:07,740
but hear what's going on

1262
00:58:07,740 --> 00:58:09,810
and understand what
they're trying to achieve

1263
00:58:09,810 --> 00:58:13,080
with either the particular
thing they're working on

1264
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:17,043
or overall is a longer term
career goal or life goal.

1265
00:58:18,450 --> 00:58:20,040
- I would just add super quickly,

1266
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:22,890
that I think where we see some
of the most tangible effects,

1267
00:58:22,890 --> 00:58:26,220
is where we kind of create
either programs or venues

1268
00:58:26,220 --> 00:58:28,410
to really foster these
types of conversations

1269
00:58:28,410 --> 00:58:31,080
and bring both the policy
and the tech folks together.

1270
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:32,760
So whether it's "I am the Cavalry,"

1271
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:34,020
whether it's DEFCON policy,

1272
00:58:34,020 --> 00:58:36,330
whether it's programs like TechCongress,

1273
00:58:36,330 --> 00:58:38,310
or Hackers on the Hill,

1274
00:58:38,310 --> 00:58:40,800
these are the types of
venues and opportunities

1275
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:42,840
where we can really have
these meaningful conversations

1276
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:44,160
that can help drive impact.

1277
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:46,050
So wherever we can create
more of these types

1278
00:58:46,050 --> 00:58:48,131
of opportunities, programs, events,

1279
00:58:48,131 --> 00:58:50,970
that's really, really
increasing the opportunities

1280
00:58:50,970 --> 00:58:53,100
for these types of things
to happen and manifest.

1281
00:58:53,100 --> 00:58:54,210
- And just on the global side,

1282
00:58:54,210 --> 00:58:56,670
since a lot of this was
just "Digital Peace Now."

1283
00:58:56,670 --> 00:58:57,697
So if you're interested in this,

1284
00:58:57,697 --> 00:59:00,637
"Digital Peace Now" is kind
of a youth movement to say,

1285
00:59:00,637 --> 00:59:01,860
"we need to do better on these."

1286
00:59:01,860 --> 00:59:04,680
And they can use a lot
of tech expert expertise

1287
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:06,360
and it is a global movement.

1288
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:09,986
- All right, so we got
the five minute sign

1289
00:59:09,986 --> 00:59:11,610
a few minutes ago.

1290
00:59:11,610 --> 00:59:14,160
So unfortunately I think
we're not gonna be able

1291
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:18,270
to take any more questions, but
I've got a question for you.

1292
00:59:18,270 --> 00:59:19,470
How many of you are gonna come

1293
00:59:19,470 --> 00:59:21,510
and see us at the policy department today,

1294
00:59:21,510 --> 00:59:23,130
tomorrow or Sunday?

1295
00:59:23,130 --> 00:59:23,979
All right.

1296
00:59:23,979 --> 00:59:26,250
(crowd applauding)

1297
00:59:26,250 --> 00:59:27,150
Thank you everybody.

1298
00:59:27,150 --> 00:59:31,530
Let's continue the
conversation over there and --

1299
00:59:31,530 --> 00:59:32,363
What's that?

1300
00:59:32,363 --> 00:59:33,210
- [Jenny] Follow @DEFCONPolicy.

1301
00:59:33,210 --> 00:59:36,090
- [Beau] Follow @DEFCONPolicy on Twitter.

1302
00:59:36,090 --> 00:59:38,430
We're trying to get to a
thousand by the end of CON,

1303
00:59:38,430 --> 00:59:40,710
so you can help us make that happen.

1304
00:59:40,710 --> 00:59:42,315
Thank you very much.

1305
00:59:42,315 --> 00:59:43,148
- [Jay] Thanks everyone.
