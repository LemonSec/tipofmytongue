1
00:00:00,541 --> 00:00:03,540
- So we have a great panel
to start for you guys today,

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,400
something that we're probably
all really concerned about

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:06,850
and want to talk a lot about.

4
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:10,800
The talk is called Brazil Redux,

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,720
Short Circuiting Tech-Enabled Dystopia

6
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,700
with the Right to Repair.

7
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,950
So please give a big hand to these guys

8
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:18,221
for coming here today.

9
00:00:18,221 --> 00:00:20,640
(crowd applauding)

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,792
And let hand it over to Paul.

11
00:00:23,792 --> 00:00:24,625
All right.

12
00:00:25,467 --> 00:00:26,753
- Hey everybody.

13
00:00:26,753 --> 00:00:28,260
Thanks for showing up early.

14
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:29,340
My name is Paul Roberts.

15
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:32,340
I'm the founder of
SecuRepairs, which is a group

16
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,440
of information security,
information technology

17
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,360
professionals who support
the right to repair.

18
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:41,220
And we're here today to
talk about right to repair.

19
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:46,220
And the first thing I
want to do is to clarify

20
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,730
why the title of the talk is Brazil.

21
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:54,780
'cause Brazil is something that actually,

22
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:56,820
the movie "Brazil", something that sort of

23
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,170
has a lot of tie ins with our talk.

24
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:01,500
So I'm gonna play a
clip from the 1980 film,

25
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,847
1985 film, "Brazil".

26
00:01:06,381 --> 00:01:09,723
- What, what are you doing?

27
00:01:12,259 --> 00:01:14,501
- Harry Tuttle, heating
engineer, at your service.

28
00:01:14,501 --> 00:01:17,501
(furniture banging)

29
00:01:19,197 --> 00:01:20,030
- Tuttle?

30
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:23,430
Are you from Central Services?

31
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:24,263
- Ha.

32
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:31,849
- I called Central Services.

33
00:01:31,849 --> 00:01:33,630
- Well, they're a little
overworked these days.

34
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:35,389
Luckily I intercepted your call.

35
00:01:35,389 --> 00:01:37,370
(tools whizzing)

36
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:38,203
- You did-

37
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:41,460
Just a minute.

38
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,370
What is that business with the gun?

39
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:45,690
- This just the precaution, sir.

40
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:46,999
Just a precaution.

41
00:01:46,999 --> 00:01:48,740
(power drill whizzing)

42
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:50,831
I've had traps set to me before now.

43
00:01:50,831 --> 00:01:53,340
There are plenty of people
in Central Services who

44
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:54,720
would love to get their
hands on Harry Tuttle.

45
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,553
Ha.

46
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:59,941
- Are you telling me that this is illegal?

47
00:01:59,941 --> 00:02:02,858
(heater exploding)

48
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:07,703
- Well, yes and no.

49
00:02:07,703 --> 00:02:09,479
Officially, only Central Service operators

50
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:10,450
are supposed to touch this stuff.

51
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:12,450
Would you hold this please?

52
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:14,670
But nowadays with all the
new rules and regulations,

53
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:16,740
they can't get decent staff anymore.

54
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:20,040
So they tend to turn a blind
eye as long as I'm careful.

55
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,690
Mind you (indistinct) they can
prove that I've been working

56
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:25,590
on their equipment, well, (indistinct)

57
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,450
- But wouldn't it be
simpler just to, you know-

58
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:28,283
- Do you mind holding this, please.

59
00:02:28,283 --> 00:02:29,116
- Sorry, yes.

60
00:02:30,101 --> 00:02:30,934
- I was saying, "Wouldn't
it be simpler to work

61
00:02:30,934 --> 00:02:32,239
for Central Services?"

62
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:33,399
- Argh.

63
00:02:33,399 --> 00:02:38,101
Couldn't stand the work, paperwork.

64
00:02:38,101 --> 00:02:41,070
Couldn't stand the paperwork.

65
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:44,370
Listen, this whole system
of yours could be on fire

66
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:45,990
and I couldn't even turn on a kitchen tap

67
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:50,313
without filling out a 27 B
stroke six, bloody paperwork.

68
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:54,120
- I suppose one has to
expect a certain amount.

69
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:54,953
- Why?

70
00:02:54,953 --> 00:02:56,311
I came into this game for
the action, the excitement.

71
00:02:56,311 --> 00:02:59,310
Go anywhere, travel
light, get in, get out.

72
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:00,143
wherever there's trouble.

73
00:03:00,143 --> 00:03:00,976
A man alone.

74
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:04,170
Now they got the whole
country sectioned off.

75
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:05,820
Can't make a move without a form.

76
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:13,853
- Okay.

77
00:03:14,689 --> 00:03:17,850
So Brazil is a movie
about a dystopian future,

78
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:21,300
in which Central Services,

79
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,760
a repair organization run by the state,

80
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,610
basically controls everything.

81
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:28,230
And if you want to get your, in this case,

82
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:29,670
air conditioner repaired,

83
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:31,380
you have to go through Central Services.

84
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:34,260
And Harry Tuttle is kind
of a rogue repairman

85
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,660
who, like, repels down
the sides of buildings

86
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:38,430
and sweeps into people's apartments

87
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:40,740
to do rogue repairs.

88
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:42,510
And the whole movie kind of hinges

89
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:44,520
on trying to catch Harry Tuttle

90
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,440
and a whole bunch of stuff that happened

91
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:49,110
as a result of the state
trying to arrest him

92
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:51,360
and stop him from doing what he's doing.

93
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,510
So the big picture of
this panel is to talk

94
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:57,543
about how Brazil is our current,

95
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:00,270
our present is a lot closer

96
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:02,580
to the future imagined in Brazil

97
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:03,450
than you might think.

98
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:07,200
And we've got an amazing
panel here to talk about that.

99
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,310
The goals of the panel,

100
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:10,710
to get you informed as a community.

101
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:13,260
I think the DEF CON
community is really important

102
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:14,610
in this struggle,

103
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:16,320
to get you engaged in this problem,

104
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,300
because some of you might kind of know

105
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,440
a little bit about right to repair,

106
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,470
but you're gonna know a lot
more by the time we're done,

107
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,330
and hopefully to get you involved,

108
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:27,090
because we need people
involved to get this done

109
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:29,613
as a society and as an economy.

110
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:33,930
And so what I'd like to do, oh, sorry,

111
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:37,863
is fool around with PowerPoint
and make you watch me.

112
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,340
No, what I'd like to do is first of all,

113
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:44,050
introduce our panel and

114
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,760
I'm sorry

115
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,223
my Window skills are
terrible at this point.

116
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:52,373
Here we go.

117
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:56,340
So why don't we do that?

118
00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:00,300
So if I can just figure
out, yeah, there we go.

119
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,133
Sorry.

120
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:04,080
I'm gonna go down the down our table

121
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,150
and let each of them
introduce themselves to you

122
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:07,260
and say hello.

123
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:10,320
And then we've got some discussing to do.

124
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,370
I'll start with you, Corynne.

125
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:12,240
- Okay.

126
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,750
Hi, I'm Corynne McSherry,
and I'm the Legal Director

127
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:18,069
at the Electronic Frontier Foundation.

128
00:05:18,069 --> 00:05:19,340
- [Audience Member] Woo!

129
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:22,507
(audience applauding)

130
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:25,380
- I'm Kyle Weems.

131
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,240
And I started, iFixit.

132
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,560
I've been involved with right to repair

133
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,439
for a good while now.

134
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:33,606
(audience applauding)

135
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,480
- I'm Louis Rossmann.

136
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,430
I have a repair shop in New York City

137
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:40,500
that is component-level
repair on Apple products.

138
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,550
And I have a YouTube channel

139
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:44,119
where I make an enemy of
lobbyists professionally.

140
00:05:44,119 --> 00:05:47,286
(audience applauding)

141
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,290
- My name is Joe Grand,
also known as Kingpin,

142
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:54,180
and I'm a hardware hacker

143
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,850
and this is definitely
the most serious panel

144
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:58,023
I've ever been on,

145
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,270
but very important as well.

146
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:01,628
So thanks for being here.

147
00:06:01,628 --> 00:06:04,795
(audience applauding)

148
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,257
- I'm really excited to have all of them

149
00:06:07,257 --> 00:06:09,990
and I'm very thankful
that they took time away

150
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:11,220
from their busy lives to come

151
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,900
and talk to you about this.

152
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,810
So I think to start, probably
a good place to start,

153
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:17,850
would be with the problem,

154
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:21,570
and so why do we need to have this talk?

155
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:23,460
Why is there even a question

156
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,810
about our right to repair stuff

157
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:26,460
'cause we own it, right?

158
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:29,040
And I thought to start,
I just sort of toss that

159
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,750
to Corynne, 'cause I
think you're the lawyer

160
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,490
on the panel, and you're the best suited

161
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:34,050
to talk to us about this.

162
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:37,500
If I have a thing, let's
say I'm an Xbox owner,

163
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,490
PlayStation owner,

164
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:40,890
and some discrete component on my Xbox

165
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:43,110
or PlayStation breaks,

166
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:44,520
why can't I just repair it?

167
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,570
What's standing in my way?

168
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:46,870
Why is that a legal issue?

169
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,880
- Let me count the ways.

170
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,963
Okay.

171
00:06:51,963 --> 00:06:55,590
So, let me say first that
this is a conversation

172
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:58,200
where I'm really sorry that
the lawyers are showing up.

173
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,940
You know if the lawyers are showing up,

174
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,020
it's probably not good.

175
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:01,853
Probably not.

176
00:07:01,853 --> 00:07:03,030
And when it comes to repair,

177
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:05,163
that is very, very true.

178
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,640
So, do you want to hit my
slides or should I just, oh.

179
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,573
- Sure, sorry.

180
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:12,510
- All right, but I'll just get started.

181
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:16,350
So, the key problem is that

182
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:19,680
if there's software in
your thing, in your device,

183
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,620
in your refrigerator, in your car,

184
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:25,000
in anything that makes it smart

185
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:29,340
also makes it a copyrighted work.

186
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,470
That software is going
to be a copyrighted work,

187
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:34,893
very likely, and with
copyright comes problems.

188
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:37,163
So, yeah.

189
00:07:37,163 --> 00:07:38,130
So if software, then copyright, okay.

190
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:40,649
So what are the different problems?

191
00:07:40,649 --> 00:07:42,300
Do the next one?

192
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,700
Yeah. So if copy copyright
comes with restrictions.

193
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,110
The reason you have a copyright

194
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:48,240
is you can then license the work,

195
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,950
and it gives you a lot of control

196
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:53,910
over how that work is used,
how that software is used.

197
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:56,400
Now there's limits on that, like fair use,

198
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,630
and a lot of other limits.

199
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:58,780
It's not unlimited,

200
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:01,320
unlike what many copyright owners think.

201
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:04,110
But still, it comes with restrictions.

202
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:05,430
So it's a practical matter

203
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:07,140
that looks like problems for repair.

204
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:10,770
So, the first thing is end
user license agreements.

205
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:13,230
So very often you will buy a device,

206
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:15,660
and again by device, think
car, think refrigerator,

207
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:16,770
not just your phone.

208
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:18,033
And you own the thing,

209
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:21,450
but the software in it is licensed to you.

210
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:23,020
And somewhere along the line,

211
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:26,220
something is gonna pop up
and you're gonna agree to it

212
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:28,410
because everyone does, as everyone knows,

213
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:30,690
no one will read it,
but it will be a thing,

214
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:32,640
and it will have a limit.

215
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,690
It will have all kinds of limits

216
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:36,000
on how you can interact with the software

217
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,380
in your device.

218
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,240
Now, as a practical matter,

219
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,980
people often ignore these rules

220
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,570
and that's not the end of the world,

221
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:45,210
but if you are a third party

222
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:48,600
and you are helping
somebody ignore those rules

223
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,510
by providing some kind
of interoperable service

224
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:52,800
or something like that,

225
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,480
well then they can sue you

226
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,370
for interfering with that contract.

227
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,560
'Cause that license
agreement is a contract,

228
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,850
whether or not you read it.

229
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:01,250
The law on this is terrible.

230
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:03,990
So that's a problem,

231
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:05,760
and if you think those
lawsuits won't happen,

232
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,050
they already have happened.

233
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:09,570
So that's a thing that chills everybody.

234
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:10,710
So for example,

235
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:12,240
this is of a classic example,

236
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,370
but there's a million of them.

237
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:17,700
So the Xbox EULA says you can't modify it,

238
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,460
e.g. through unauthorized repairs,

239
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:23,520
or unauthorized upgrades or downloads.

240
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,500
So, it's like we want to be in charge

241
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,120
of how you use the thing.

242
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,920
So that's problem one.

243
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,420
Problem two.

244
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:32,310
Often that software's going be locked down

245
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:33,463
with some kind of DRM.

246
00:09:33,463 --> 00:09:34,950
I think people probably in this room

247
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:36,570
are very familiar with this problem,

248
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:38,460
but just quickly at this point,

249
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:40,080
they weren't 10 years ago when
we started talking about it,

250
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,730
but people know about it now.

251
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:46,110
So, if you've got a lock on
the software and you break it,

252
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:49,230
which is often trivially easy
to do, so you can get access

253
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:51,210
to that software and mess with it,

254
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:53,760
well then, you have engaged
in an active circumvention,

255
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,720
very likely.

256
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,520
And if you tell people what you did,

257
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,800
you have now trafficked,

258
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,030
you've engaged in trafficking.

259
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:01,620
And both of those things are illegal

260
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:04,050
under Section 1201 of the DMCA,

261
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:05,880
the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.

262
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,460
So that further limits,

263
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:09,540
it doesn't matter if you're doing it

264
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,400
for an otherwise lawful
purpose, to be clear,

265
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,233
You could be engaged-

266
00:10:12,233 --> 00:10:14,071
Reverse engineering for the
most part is a fair use.

267
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:15,240
It is protected.

268
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,440
You're allowed to do it.

269
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,800
But the DMCA will stop you even, again,

270
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,010
if it's a very trivially
easy lock to break.

271
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:23,040
Okay.

272
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,703
Lastly, other, and this really
is the most irritating thing.

273
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,190
Basic stuff.

274
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:31,890
Maybe you just want to
have access to a manual.

275
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:34,500
Maybe somebody might
like to take that manual

276
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,390
and scan it and make it available online

277
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:37,920
so people could use them more easily,

278
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,660
compare different manuals,
just get access to it.

279
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,090
You could use a search and you can find

280
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:44,340
the right thing that you need
and not try to flip through.

281
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:45,540
Maybe you don't have your manual anymore.

282
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:47,130
- Might be somebody in this panel

283
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:48,475
who wants to do those very-

284
00:10:48,475 --> 00:10:49,308
- Could be.

285
00:10:49,308 --> 00:10:50,141
- I don't know.

286
00:10:50,141 --> 00:10:50,974
- Person.

287
00:10:50,974 --> 00:10:52,860
So just one second,
just working through it.

288
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:56,520
So the manufacturers very often will claim

289
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,830
those manuals are copyrighted

290
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:02,640
and they have gone after
people for posting them online.

291
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,770
Or, they'll claim that they have,

292
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:05,970
they involve trade secrets.

293
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:08,190
Now this isn't the manual
that is made necessarily

294
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:11,250
available to the consumer,

295
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,170
but rather the manuals
that they make available

296
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:14,667
to their authorized repair people.

297
00:11:14,667 --> 00:11:16,020
And they will say that is,

298
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:19,080
even if they make it available
to thousands of people,

299
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:22,080
they will say it's still
confidential business information

300
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:25,110
because we only share it
with them subject to an NDA.

301
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:28,053
So I'm very sorry to have to be here,

302
00:11:29,031 --> 00:11:31,650
but I'm glad to tell you that
now I've told you bad news,

303
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:34,950
but there is good news and
we will talk about that next.

304
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:35,783
- Thank you.

305
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,060
There is good news indeed.

306
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:42,660
And the good news really is
the right to repair movement.

307
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,930
And on the panel we have
what I consider kind of

308
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:48,360
the prime mover of the
right to repair movement,

309
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:51,240
which is Kyle Weems of iFixit,

310
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,740
who not only started iFixit,

311
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,990
which is, of course, just a
huge and valuable resource

312
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:56,970
for people who want to do repair,

313
00:11:56,970 --> 00:11:59,640
but has also really helped promote

314
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,470
right to repair laws in the States,

315
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:02,850
not only actually in the States,

316
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:05,700
but actually in the EU as well.

317
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:06,533
And so Kyle,

318
00:12:06,533 --> 00:12:08,370
I thought I'd toss it to you to give us

319
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:10,500
the TL:DR on right to repair laws

320
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,890
and what are they, what
do they try and do,

321
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:15,090
and why are they important?

322
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:15,923
- That's great.

323
00:12:15,923 --> 00:12:16,950
Do you mind if I click through myself?

324
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:18,050
- Yeah, no, I'm sorry.

325
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,594
- All right. So we have
been working on this.

326
00:12:22,594 --> 00:12:24,810
I like to say I've been tilting
at this particular windmill

327
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:25,953
for a while now.

328
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:28,860
Fundamentally, we need to find a way

329
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:31,260
to reset expectations

330
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,393
back to where things used to be.

331
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:37,200
And so that's why I started
iFixit in the first place.

332
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,080
We've built a open source
repository repair information

333
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:44,010
with the goal of attempting
to enable everybody

334
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:45,540
to repair all their things.

335
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:48,226
But there's a lot of problems with that.

336
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:51,030
And so let me tell you about
a buddy of mine, Tim Hicks,

337
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:52,500
who we really need to get here sometime.

338
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,450
Tim would be awesome,
but Tim is in Australia.

339
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:56,640
It's a bit of a walk to get here.

340
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,830
Tim runs a very creatively named website

341
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:01,260
called Tim's Laptop Repair Manuals,

342
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:02,730
and on it he posts service manuals

343
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:04,170
from all kinds of different things.

344
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:09,170
And, of course, he is facing
the brunt of the issue

345
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,500
that Corynne describes.

346
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,290
So this is a letter that Toshiba sent him.

347
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:14,580
They said, "Hey, on your website

348
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:16,620
we can see that you're
distributing by download

349
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:19,260
copyright repair manuals that
are proprietary to Toshiba.

350
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,810
These are only available to
Toshiba authorized service

351
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:24,097
providers under strict
confidentiality agreements."

352
00:13:24,097 --> 00:13:26,085
[Panel Member] Ooooo!

353
00:13:26,085 --> 00:13:27,817
This is where I, they're like,

354
00:13:27,817 --> 00:13:30,885
"You are not a Toshiba
authorized service provider."

355
00:13:30,885 --> 00:13:31,860
(laughs) Okay?

356
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:32,693
No, duh.

357
00:13:32,693 --> 00:13:33,930
Thanks guys.

358
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:36,810
So Tim, in response to this,

359
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:38,850
Tim, he's just a kid running the website.

360
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:41,220
He went ahead and took
the manuals offline,

361
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,860
and we decided this cannot stand.

362
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,030
This is ridiculous.

363
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:47,793
And so we launched Operation Fix Toshiba,

364
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:52,050
and we crowdsourced and
we went on GoFundMe.

365
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:54,480
We said, "Hey guys, we need $10,000 to buy

366
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,730
one of every laptop
that got taken offline."

367
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:57,840
We were buying them used.

368
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,790
And then we disassembled all of them.

369
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:01,530
We wrote new open source service manuals.

370
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:02,730
We put them online.

371
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:03,780
And then in the process

372
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:05,980
we decided we would
make Toshiba a new logo,

373
00:14:07,276 --> 00:14:08,109
(audience laughs)

374
00:14:08,109 --> 00:14:10,710
which I think they were
super thrilled about.

375
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:13,877
(audience applauding)

376
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:21,060
So we're chipping away
at this around the edges.

377
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:24,060
There's a variety of challenges
that we're running into.

378
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:26,340
One problem that we see
with all kinds of gizmos

379
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:28,170
is you say, well, why do
you need the service manual?

380
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:30,320
Because this stuff is
crazy glued together.

381
00:14:31,201 --> 00:14:34,680
Anyone here have the original
AirPods, raise your hand.

382
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,300
Bought the original AirPods.

383
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,133
Okay?

384
00:14:37,133 --> 00:14:39,093
Now keep your hand up if they still work.

385
00:14:40,209 --> 00:14:41,580
Eww, we got one.

386
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,560
Okay. Very impressive.

387
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,035
A guy who didn't use
his AirPods very much.

388
00:14:46,035 --> 00:14:47,663
- [Audience Member] I've
taken them out of the box.

389
00:14:48,646 --> 00:14:52,140
- So these gizmos have, the
moment you glue in a battery

390
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:54,720
to a device you're attaching
a death clock to it.

391
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,190
It's absolutely insane.

392
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:59,190
And the way that we buy gadgets today is

393
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:02,040
if you bought cars and the
tires were welded to the frame.

394
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,380
It's like, when the tires
wear out, just buy a new car.

395
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:05,430
No one will put up with that.

396
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:08,553
But we put up with this for
electronics, and it's not okay.

397
00:15:09,846 --> 00:15:14,846
So I started doing the
we're just gonna write

398
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:16,846
our own repair manuals.

399
00:15:16,846 --> 00:15:18,060
And we wrote lots of manuals.

400
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:21,257
We were creating everything
ourselves, created comments,

401
00:15:21,257 --> 00:15:23,820
and our cameras.

402
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,680
And we just got really tired.

403
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,970
We'd been doing it over and over.

404
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:29,430
Our community has written
75,000 repair guides.

405
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:30,630
We're gonna keep going.

406
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:31,650
We're not gonna stop.

407
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:33,930
But every year at CES
manufacturers introduce

408
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:35,520
like 15,000 new gadgets.

409
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,390
It's very hard to keep up.

410
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:39,570
So we have to bring
manufacturers into the ecosystem.

411
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:41,670
And then when you get into the
world of embedded software,

412
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:43,440
we need access to schematics.

413
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,910
We need access.

414
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:48,360
We need to be legally bypass DRM.

415
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,040
So that's where we've started working on

416
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,840
right to repair legislation.

417
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,060
We've gone to the powers
that be (chuckles)

418
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:56,070
and it turns out some
of them agree with us,

419
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:57,123
which is pretty cool.

420
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:00,570
So we went to the Federal Trade Commission

421
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:02,227
a couple years ago and said,

422
00:16:02,227 --> 00:16:04,443
"Hey, what's the deal with those Warranty

423
00:16:04,443 --> 00:16:06,450
Void if Removed stickers
that we see everywhere?"

424
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:07,283
And I think we're all here,

425
00:16:07,283 --> 00:16:08,820
and we like breaking rules,

426
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,470
and I've seen people walking around here

427
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,540
with the I Void Warranties T-shirts.

428
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:13,373
Cool.

429
00:16:13,373 --> 00:16:16,440
But why is it voiding warranty
if you disassemble a thing?

430
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:19,890
It turns out, I guess
we could ask the lawyer,

431
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:20,823
is it legal?

432
00:16:25,004 --> 00:16:25,837
- [Corynne} Go for it.

433
00:16:25,837 --> 00:16:26,890
Break the warranty.

434
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:29,880
- So it turns out there's a law that says

435
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,620
it's perfectly fine to open stuff up.

436
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:32,453
And it does.

437
00:16:32,453 --> 00:16:33,570
If you remove a sticker that says

438
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:34,500
Warranty Voided if Removed,

439
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,000
it doesn't actually void the warranty.

440
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,400
And the Federal Trade
Commission has asked all of us

441
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,100
if you see those stickers
to send them pictures

442
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:44,787
to www.reportfraud.ftc.gov.

443
00:16:44,787 --> 00:16:47,954
(audience applauding)

444
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:55,200
I mean, you're welcome to
send it to the FTC directly.

445
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:59,520
As a matter of fact,
the FTC has launched a,

446
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:02,700
they just reached a
settlement with Weber Grills

447
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,980
and Harley-Davidson where
the terms of their warranty

448
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:07,740
were explicitly banning
people's right to tinker.

449
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:09,900
And then what's crazy is just this week,

450
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,150
the state of Wisconsin, where
Harley-Davidson is built,

451
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:15,120
the AG of Wisconsin is
suing Harley-Davidson

452
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,260
for screwing over their customers

453
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,790
and voiding their warranties.

454
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:18,720
This kinda hits home for me

455
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,640
'cause my dad was actually
Harley-Davidson dealer.

456
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,260
So I know a little bit about this world,

457
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:24,933
and I think Harley-Davidson has it coming.

458
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,170
So we're going beyond that,

459
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:29,730
and we're working on actual legislation

460
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:32,430
that will enshrine the right to repair.

461
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:33,870
And I've been working on this

462
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:35,697
with Louis and Paul and Corynne

463
00:17:35,697 --> 00:17:39,150
and we've all been, it has been a journey.

464
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:42,270
We're up to the point where
this year 25 different states

465
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:44,220
introduced right to repair laws.

466
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:47,073
And I have here a little bit
of a grid of where we're at.

467
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,770
Nevada, I don't think is on this.

468
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:51,030
So someone was asking me last night

469
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:51,960
where we're at with Nevada.

470
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,300
Someone who lives here
is welcome to get Nevada

471
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,395
on the list.

472
00:17:55,395 --> 00:17:56,955
- [Audience Member] (indistinct)

473
00:17:56,955 --> 00:17:58,290
- Yeah, we had it last
year and then it died.

474
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:00,240
It didn't get reintroduced this year.

475
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,350
This is a slog.

476
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:03,690
We're trying to do this in
parallel across all of these.

477
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:06,570
But the thing, as all of you
in the security research world

478
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:11,010
knows, you try to attack on
a number of different fronts.

479
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:13,230
You really only need to get root once.

480
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:14,850
We don't have to get on all of these,

481
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:17,160
we just need to win one of these things,

482
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,230
because what right to repair laws say is,

483
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:21,990
if you make a product and
you're gonna sell in this state,

484
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:24,990
you have to make service manuals
available online for free.

485
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:27,300
You have to sell parts online.

486
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,220
You have to make the
tools available online.

487
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:30,990
Once one state passes this,

488
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:34,350
we're going to get right
to repair for the world.

489
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:38,250
And, fortunately, we think
we've got that in New York

490
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,270
right now.

491
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:41,070
So the New York state,

492
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:44,577
and this is thanks in much part to Louis,

493
00:18:44,577 --> 00:18:46,740
who has been in New York on the ground,

494
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,780
going to Albany regularly,

495
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,910
New York, it has passed the House,

496
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:51,960
it has passed the Senate,

497
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,700
and it is sitting on the Governor's desk,

498
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:54,690
waiting for her to sign it.

499
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:57,204
We're hopeful she will sign it any day.

500
00:18:57,204 --> 00:18:58,056
Now this is huge.

501
00:18:58,056 --> 00:19:01,223
(audience applauding)

502
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,470
The New York law applies to all products

503
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:08,790
that have electronics in them

504
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:10,950
that are not agriculture equipment,

505
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:13,170
motor vehicle, a medical device,

506
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:14,587
and costs more than $10.

507
00:19:14,587 --> 00:19:15,959
[Panel Member] Home appliances.

508
00:19:15,959 --> 00:19:16,792
- Home appliances.

509
00:19:16,792 --> 00:19:18,270
We didn't get home appliances included.

510
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:19,650
We'll get that next time.

511
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:21,240
But that's a pretty broad swath, right?

512
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,890
That's most of the
things that we deal with,

513
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:27,810
that's satellite uplinks, that's boats.

514
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:29,340
There's a large number of products

515
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:30,640
that are included in this.

516
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:33,330
So it'll be very, very interesting

517
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:35,340
to see how this goes

518
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,770
and how we can take advantage of this.

519
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:40,680
We're hopeful that we will
see more states pass this.

520
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,910
In addition to New York,

521
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:43,320
we're also going back to the slide,

522
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:46,440
we also got an electric
wheelchair right to repair bill

523
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:49,470
passed in Colorado this year,
and that one has been signed.

524
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:50,620
So that's exciting.

525
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:54,450
(audience applauding)

526
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:56,070
And that's really important.

527
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:58,530
Unfortunately, we're at exactly opposite

528
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,910
a medical right to repair panel

529
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:00,840
that's happening right now,

530
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,040
and there's some doctors talking.

531
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,450
And we were just before this panel,

532
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:04,298
we were talking about how

533
00:20:04,298 --> 00:20:06,510
if you have an electric wheelchair

534
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:08,970
and you want to change the
traction control settings,

535
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:10,500
it's hidden behind a service password

536
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,120
that they don't give the owners.

537
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,400
And bypassing that service password,

538
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,540
do I need to consult a lawyer

539
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:17,390
before I bypass the service password?

540
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:19,913
- [Corynne] Actually, don't.

541
00:20:19,913 --> 00:20:20,746
Don't ask.

542
00:20:22,336 --> 00:20:23,203
Don't ask, don't tell.

543
00:20:23,203 --> 00:20:24,036
- I'm telling you.

544
00:20:24,036 --> 00:20:24,869
Just do it.

545
00:20:24,869 --> 00:20:26,910
She'll have a more nuanced answer.

546
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:27,743
Yeah (laughing).

547
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:31,350
This is how to make Corynne feel awkward.

548
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:32,310
- [Panel Member] Perfect.

549
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:33,360
- So we're super jazzed.

550
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,920
I want to mention,

551
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,360
I know there's a lot
of international folks.

552
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,590
This is an international movement.

553
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:39,720
The European Parliament has been on board

554
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,160
with this as well.

555
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:44,550
So there there's a lot
of momentum happening,

556
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:46,320
but we still have a long way to go.

557
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,320
I mean, we are in a
Brazil-style dystopia now.

558
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,550
We're trying to get to a world

559
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:55,170
where maybe stickers like this are not

560
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:56,040
the law of the land.

561
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,810
I think these stickers are so insidious

562
00:20:57,810 --> 00:21:00,150
because they're, I
mean, all of us are here

563
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:01,860
'cause we like breaking rules.

564
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,330
Most people follow rules.

565
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:05,340
And so when you have a rule
that's on every device,

566
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,448
people tend to follow it.

567
00:21:06,448 --> 00:21:09,870
I do repair workshops where
we'll give a kid a tool

568
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:11,910
and we'll say, "Hey, do you
want to take apart this iPod?"

569
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:13,410
And they look at me like I'm crazy,

570
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:15,390
because the rules, their
teachers, their parents,

571
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:16,867
everyone in society has been telling them,

572
00:21:16,867 --> 00:21:18,450
"Don't take that thing apart."

573
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:19,860
Where does that come from?

574
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:22,200
Where does this desire to be
sheep and follow these rules?

575
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,480
I swear it's these rules
printed on every single thing.

576
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,960
So getting rid of these
stickers is going to be huge.

577
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,850
I want to mention one other
thing about John Deere,

578
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:31,290
and there's going to
be a John Deere session

579
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,600
at five o'clock today.

580
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,176
Which track?

581
00:21:35,176 --> 00:21:36,510
This one.

582
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:37,638
Okay.

583
00:21:37,638 --> 00:21:39,690
Here at five o'clock today,
epic John Deere news.

584
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:40,523
You have to be here.

585
00:21:40,523 --> 00:21:42,810
It will be much more technically in depth.

586
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:44,310
It's gonna be awesome.

587
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:46,890
I have been kinda fighting
John Deere for a while.

588
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:48,420
They don't like me very much.

589
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:50,640
Along with EFF and others,

590
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,610
we applied for an exemption
to Section 1201, a copyright.

591
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:56,070
We applied for the ability
for tractors to be,

592
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:58,560
or for farmers to be able
legally fix tractors.

593
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:01,320
And I wrote this article
in "Wired Magazine"

594
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,520
about how they were saying

595
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,350
you don't really own your tractor.

596
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:07,080
And then John Deere sent this
letter to all their dealers

597
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,300
telling them that I was a liar,

598
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,920
which was kind of awesome.

599
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:14,280
And in it they said,
similar to a car computer,

600
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,590
ownership of equipment
does not include the right

601
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:18,360
to copy, modify, or distribute software

602
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,800
that is embedded in that equipment.

603
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,660
And their example here is perfect.

604
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:23,490
A purchaser may own a book,

605
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:26,100
but here she does not have
a right to copy the book,

606
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:28,020
to modify the book, or to distribute

607
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:30,360
unauthorized copies to others.

608
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,890
Do you want to comment on that?

609
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:34,128
- [Corynne] You can totally
do all of those things.

610
00:22:34,128 --> 00:22:36,973
- [Kyle] (laughing)

611
00:22:36,973 --> 00:22:39,180
So I mean, these people are living

612
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:40,350
in a totally different world.

613
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:42,030
They're like, you buy a tractor

614
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:43,890
and you don't own the
software on the tractor.

615
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:46,500
You have an implied right
to operate the software.

616
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,333
What?

617
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:48,510
This is is nonsense.

618
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:51,420
So, we need to take back
our right to tinker.

619
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:52,950
And that's what I'm super jazzed,

620
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:56,400
excited to be here with everybody
here today to talk about.

621
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,273
- Thank you Kyle.

622
00:22:58,146 --> 00:23:02,026
(audience applauding)

623
00:23:02,026 --> 00:23:03,150
- [Joe] Hey, Hey Paul.

624
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:04,350
- Yes.

625
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:06,330
- I just want to make a comment about this

626
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:09,033
from the hacker world,

627
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:14,400
what these kind of heavy-handed
tactics that we're seeing

628
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,000
from mostly consumer product vendors.

629
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,220
This is not new for most of us, right?

630
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:22,110
If you've ever found some
sort of vulnerability

631
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:23,820
and you've reported that to a company

632
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,680
and they try to squelch
you or they sue you

633
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,210
or they threaten to sue you.

634
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:29,880
This has been going on for 30, 40 years

635
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,820
of people trying to and
to enlighten companies

636
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:34,380
about problems, right?

637
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:37,200
So the thing that's
important about this is

638
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,260
it's not just sort of
security-related hackers.

639
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:42,000
It's the mainstream, everything.

640
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,220
Its, every company is going to see

641
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:46,470
what one company's tactics
are and say, oh, that works.

642
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:47,303
We're gonna do that also.

643
00:23:47,303 --> 00:23:49,470
We're gonna prevent people
from modifying something

644
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:51,090
which then ends up coming back to us

645
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:53,160
because it's going to
make it harder for us.

646
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,870
And what you'll also mention is,

647
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:57,180
and as you'll see, is these
lobbyists are basically

648
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:59,850
going up anti-right to repair saying,

649
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:02,670
kind of blaming the reason
why we can't repair our stuff

650
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:07,620
on security, which effectively
is giving us a bad name,

651
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:08,790
giving hackers a bad name,

652
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:10,410
which we've also had to deal with forever.

653
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:12,510
So none of these issues are really new.

654
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:14,820
It's just, they've gotten
bigger and broader.

655
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:17,640
And most people believe
them just like the sticker.

656
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,160
I had no idea that you couldn't actually

657
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,120
take the sticker off,

658
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,740
because people, which of course I do,

659
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:24,390
but most people don't.

660
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:27,060
And if you have something
that you've paid money for,

661
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:28,770
you would like to assume you own it.

662
00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:30,150
But then you see something
like that, you're like,

663
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:31,617
I don't want to void
my warranty like that,

664
00:24:31,617 --> 00:24:33,660
and I don't want to get in trouble.

665
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:36,900
So yeah, we're kind of pawns in this thing

666
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,730
as the lobbyist and as these corporations

667
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:41,430
are using us as hackers
and us as researchers

668
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:43,290
and us as end users to gain

669
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:44,940
their kind of political advantage

670
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:45,810
and their legal advantage,

671
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:47,280
which is like total crap.

672
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,450
- [Paul] Correct.

673
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:49,590
- [Corynne] Yeah.

674
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:53,430
I would be remiss, the John
Deere reference reminded

675
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:55,170
me of something that I
meant to mention earlier

676
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:57,393
that's also hopefully good news, which is,

677
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:00,210
so the John Deere, that
whole letter came up

678
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:03,090
in the context of us
applying for exemptions

679
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:06,720
from Section 1201 DMCA,
which every three years

680
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,460
you can go hat in hand
to the copyright office

681
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:11,130
and say, please, please,
can I do this thing?

682
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:13,080
And this is ridiculous.

683
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:13,913
It's stupid.

684
00:25:13,913 --> 00:25:16,650
And we've been fighting
that at EFF for 20 years,

685
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:19,890
and next month we have a hearing before

686
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:22,050
the DC Court of Appeals and our challenge

687
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:24,930
on behalf of Matt Green and Bunnie Huang

688
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:26,790
challenging that whole law.

689
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:29,640
And if we win, we at least
get rid of that piece.

690
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,043
So fingers crossed.

691
00:25:31,043 --> 00:25:32,760
(audience applauding)

692
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,050
- Indeed. Yeah, that would be huge.

693
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,803
Okay. So the question is why at DEF CON?

694
00:25:38,803 --> 00:25:39,636
And I think one of the reasons

695
00:25:39,636 --> 00:25:40,830
that I wanted to bring
this to this conference

696
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:42,690
is that cybersecurity actually figures

697
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:44,700
pretty prominently in the debate,

698
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:48,150
both pro and con on right to repair.

699
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:51,780
I founded SecuRepairs because
I was told, Nathan Proctor

700
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:53,070
at US PIRG told me, listen,

701
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:56,370
we're in these hearings with legislators

702
00:25:56,370 --> 00:25:57,510
on right to repair laws.

703
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:59,560
And what we're hearing from the opponents

704
00:26:00,638 --> 00:26:02,460
is cyber, hackers, you know.

705
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:04,890
One lobbyist told Nebraska lawmakers

706
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:06,210
that if you pass this right to repair law

707
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:09,030
then Nebraska will become
a mecca for hackers.

708
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:10,110
They're gonna move to this state

709
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,643
just so they can hack stuff.

710
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:15,570
And so I thought, but that's not all.

711
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:16,737
I mean, so cybersecurity
is a big part of it.

712
00:26:16,737 --> 00:26:18,990
And I thought just to
give you kind of a flavor

713
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:20,250
of what we hear,

714
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:22,740
Louis has gone around to
hearings all over the country,

715
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:24,150
Kyle and I as well,

716
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:27,780
Joe's testified on behalf
of right to repair,

717
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:30,690
give you a sense or a
flavor of the arguments

718
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:33,450
that we hear from the other side.

719
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:35,820
So if you don't mind, we're
gonna just take a journey

720
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:40,140
down the anti-right to
repair rabbit hole here.

721
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:43,680
- Has anybody here ever
seen a magtrometer explode?

722
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:46,080
To point out, it's interesting,
this whole discussion,

723
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,800
I think, underscores the
evolution in the notion

724
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:54,010
of ownership that we're seeing
in the economy right now.

725
00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:57,600
You know, it used to be
before software was embedded

726
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,900
in these devices, ownership
was very cut and dried.

727
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:03,150
You owned it or you didn't.

728
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:05,160
But now with software, that has become

729
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:08,040
a little bit more complicated,
and then another twist,

730
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:12,030
and I think this is true of a
lot of the folks in this room,

731
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:13,920
now we have services.

732
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:17,610
So the combination of
hardware, of software,

733
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:20,070
and services is an interesting mix.

734
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:23,160
And I think it does put
some of these topics

735
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,500
or issues into the gray area.

736
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:28,770
- OK, so the first idea is
on the part of the OEMs,

737
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:30,300
ownership is complicated.

738
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:33,690
And by that they mean you
actually don't own this stuff,

739
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:34,650
you are licensing it.

740
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:35,820
I mean, you might own the hardware,

741
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,230
but you're licensing the software,

742
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:40,528
and therefore we still
have a seat at the table.

743
00:27:40,528 --> 00:27:42,120
Really common.

744
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,920
That was from the Nixing to Fix Conference

745
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:47,643
that the FTC ran, sorry, in 2019.

746
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:50,130
Here's the other argument,

747
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:53,070
which is that security and repairability

748
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:54,720
are actually in tension with each other,

749
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,490
that if you want to make
something repairable,

750
00:27:56,490 --> 00:28:00,003
by definition, you're not
going to make it securable.

751
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:06,660
- Forcing repair on third
parties like enterprise customers

752
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:09,000
and manufacturers can make security worse

753
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,770
and not better for all of us.

754
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:12,270
And here's how.

755
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:15,930
First is the loss of
accountability for security.

756
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:18,870
It's difficult to hold OEM's
accountable for security

757
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:21,690
of their products if we also
legislate design changes

758
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:24,150
that'll negatively impact security.

759
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:27,330
Second is the risk of
backsliding the security progress

760
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:28,443
that we've made.

761
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:33,750
So consumers have plenty of
choices in the marketplace

762
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:35,370
and they can choose some manufacturers

763
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:36,720
that prioritize security

764
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,360
and others that prioritize repairability.

765
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,950
But there's no reason that legislation

766
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:44,070
should mandate repairability
and take away consumer choice

767
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:46,490
between repairability and security.

768
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:50,130
- [Panel Member] I wish this
guy would show up to DEF CON.

769
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:51,450
Cool to have him on our panel panel.

770
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:54,810
- That's Dr. Earl Crane who is a PhD and,

771
00:28:54,810 --> 00:28:58,020
I think, is a adjunct
professor or teaches somewhere.

772
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:59,430
But he was for this group called

773
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:02,220
the Security Innovation Center
that I think still exists.

774
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:03,951
It was basically a lobbying front group.

775
00:29:03,951 --> 00:29:05,023
- [Panel Member] Astroturf.

776
00:29:05,023 --> 00:29:07,470
- Yeah, it was astroturf
group of security experts

777
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:09,750
who support, I don't know what they call,

778
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:12,030
responsible repair or something like that.

779
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:13,320
He showed up to a bunch of hearings,

780
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,520
including that FTC hearing,

781
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:17,492
but he's, that whole group's
kind of gone on the downlow.

782
00:29:17,492 --> 00:29:19,290
- [Kyle] Manufacturers
tend to hire experts

783
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:20,732
so they show up and do stuff like this.

784
00:29:20,732 --> 00:29:22,320
And then I think they realize
that they're going to be

785
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:25,140
on stage at DEF CON saying
stupid shit like that.

786
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:26,010
And they quit.

787
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:26,843
- Yeah.

788
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:30,200
So we had, SecuRepairs had Gary McGraw

789
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:34,200
on the same panel as
Earl, and that was great.

790
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,310
Okay.

791
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:36,690
Third idea.

792
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:39,840
Just a whole bunch, just a word salad of

793
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,643
scary sounding cyber stuff.

794
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:52,620
- It says, if you are
changing out any component

795
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:54,240
at the hardware level

796
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,100
with another piece of hardware,

797
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:59,610
you're not able to provide
the same level of assurance

798
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:01,443
that something else didn't happen.

799
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:04,263
So that's the first key piece of that.

800
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:07,613
- [Paul] What does that mean?

801
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:14,070
- The second one is it's a
fundamental rule of security

802
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:18,450
that the best security is
that with a crypto algorithm

803
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:19,860
that it's open to the public,

804
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:20,940
it's open for inspection.

805
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:23,250
Good crypto algorithms are
those that are open for the

806
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:24,960
public and for inspection.

807
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:28,590
What's not okay is when you
open up the signing keys,

808
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:32,070
the secrets inside, and
the challenge has been

809
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:36,120
that in the repair conversation,

810
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,370
it has not been articulated enough.

811
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:40,980
We haven't had enough
of a security discussion

812
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:44,970
in here to make clear
what will be mandated

813
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:49,970
to be released and where the overreach is.

814
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:54,870
- Okay. So as you can
tell, he kind of got lost

815
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:56,010
in the woods here at the end of that,

816
00:30:56,010 --> 00:30:59,820
because he was pretty far removed

817
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:02,010
from what right to repair is about.

818
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:03,030
Okay.

819
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:05,910
And the final one, well actually, yeah,

820
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:10,910
the final argument you
hear a lot is this idea

821
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:13,503
about source code and
intellectual property.

822
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:15,623
I'm sorry.

823
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,520
- My name is Daniel Carson

824
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:23,640
and I represent Schmidt
Equipment Incorporated.

825
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:27,750
Our dealership represents John
Deere construction equipment.

826
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:29,490
However, to the extent that the owner

827
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:32,580
has the right to lawfully
repair his or her equipment,

828
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:37,410
John Deere recommends against
unauthorized modification of

829
00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:39,900
the embedded software code.

830
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:42,000
Providing access to the source code

831
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,300
would not only undermine the
manufacturer's innovation

832
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:47,190
and intellectual property rights,

833
00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:51,060
would also risk data privacy,
and allow unauthorized

834
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:56,060
and illegal tampering of safety
and emissions requirements

835
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:58,230
for the equipment.

836
00:31:58,230 --> 00:31:59,063
- Okay.

837
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:06,320
So that's kind of a taste of
what I think we're up against

838
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:08,460
in the right to repair movement.

839
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:12,090
And so I thought we'd start, first of all,

840
00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:13,500
with the person on the panel

841
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,090
who actually is most involved

842
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:18,360
in just the trenches of repair,

843
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:21,570
and that's Louis who
does this for a living.

844
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:24,180
And I mean, I guess, Louis,
could you talk to some

845
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:26,070
of the arguments that you heard there

846
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:31,070
about this cybersecurity risk in repair,

847
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:36,080
and whether the work that you
do as a repair professional

848
00:32:36,810 --> 00:32:39,480
really poses a cybersecurity
risk to your customers

849
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,220
or to the public?

850
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:43,140
- The one question that
I've had at every single one

851
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:45,840
of these hearings is can you
provide one single example?

852
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,390
I mean, repair is a 4 billion
dollar industry per year.

853
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:50,490
So surely you should be
able to give one example

854
00:32:50,490 --> 00:32:52,350
of one time anything
like this has happened.

855
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:54,180
Usually they can't, but I can.

856
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:56,430
So for instance, when
they say that independents

857
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:58,440
may be able to hack into
your data and do bad things,

858
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:00,150
I'd point out how in June of 2021,

859
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:02,160
there was an article
released on how somebody

860
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,140
who had sent a phone to Apple wound up

861
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:08,280
having their sex tape
uploaded not only to Facebook,

862
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,270
but to their Facebook,

863
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:11,100
because the person logged
into their Facebook,

864
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:11,933
so it would look like they were

865
00:33:11,933 --> 00:33:13,230
uploading their own sex tape.

866
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:14,970
That happened at Apple, not at us.

867
00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:17,280
Or in 2019, when the
"Washington Post" showed

868
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,980
that this one horny
person at the Genius Bar

869
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:21,480
was texting himself raunchy photos

870
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,860
from that customer's phone.

871
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:24,480
That happened at the Genius Bar, not here.

872
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,920
There are a number of examples

873
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,000
of things like this happening.

874
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,190
And there's this idea that
there's this magical human being

875
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:31,830
that exists, this magic
Soviet man that you get

876
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:33,120
when you go to an authorized repair center

877
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,580
where they just magically
screens out creeps and weirdos,

878
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:37,200
and anybody that's gonna
do anything like that.

879
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,390
You'd think with the industry
being as large as it is

880
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:41,340
that you'd be able to
find a single example

881
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:42,600
of us doing something like that.

882
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,310
And yet you can't.

883
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:47,310
Some of the other arguments
that wind up getting used is

884
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:48,930
there's typically safety and security.

885
00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:51,330
So, for instance, in
Massachusetts, in 2020,

886
00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:53,760
there was a ballot initiative
for right to repair

887
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:54,593
for motor vehicles.

888
00:33:54,593 --> 00:33:56,190
And they would have
commercials where you'd have

889
00:33:56,190 --> 00:33:57,330
a woman in a parking lot,

890
00:33:57,330 --> 00:33:59,730
always with a really scary
blue fluorescent lights.

891
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:01,800
And there'd be some string
music playing in the background

892
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,990
and somebody walking
very slowly behind her.

893
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:07,080
And then you'd have it go
to a crescendo as his hand

894
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:09,210
shows up on the screen as if
he's about to knock her out.

895
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:10,500
Because if you're a mechanic is able

896
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,030
to get an error code from your car,

897
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:13,470
apparently you're going
be sexually assaulted

898
00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:14,430
in a parking lot.

899
00:34:14,430 --> 00:34:16,680
There was another one where you'd have

900
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:18,180
a man in a flannel shirt,

901
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:19,620
because that's how you
know the guy's a creep,

902
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:21,870
walking up on somebody's
garage really slowly,

903
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:23,970
the flannel shirt
getting slowly into focus

904
00:34:23,970 --> 00:34:25,950
so you could see all the
green and the black in there,

905
00:34:25,950 --> 00:34:28,110
and he's walking into her garage

906
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:29,730
because that's what
happens when you get access

907
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:31,320
to an error code in a car.

908
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:34,749
Has anybody here ever seen a
magtrometer explode before?

909
00:34:34,749 --> 00:34:36,030
A show of hands.

910
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:37,530
That's cause it doesn't exist.

911
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:39,960
But AM was telling people
that if appliance technicians

912
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,000
work on your devices in your
home, that a magtrometer,

913
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,400
which doesn't exist, is going to explode.

914
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,233
It's called a magnetron,

915
00:34:45,233 --> 00:34:46,230
and it's in a microwave,

916
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:47,280
and they don't explode.

917
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,720
The people that make these
arguments don't even know

918
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:51,090
what the names of the
gear inside of them are.

919
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:52,680
The scariest argument for me came

920
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:55,320
from Katherine at the ESA in 2020,

921
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,330
where she said that if
this gets implemented,

922
00:34:57,330 --> 00:34:59,280
the game will play the console,

923
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,980
which I think is the
scariest one of them all.

924
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:03,960
But this is the level of
knowledge that we're dealing with.

925
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,250
And at the end of the day,

926
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:08,100
the most frustrating part is
listening to these arguments,

927
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:10,590
realizing you have 90 seconds
to get your point across.

928
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:12,750
They get their point across afterwards,

929
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:14,190
and you don't get to say anything.

930
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:16,640
Oh, actually one of my personal favorite

931
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,150
was a person named Charlie Brown

932
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:20,280
from CTA who represents Samsung.

933
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,113
He showed up and said,

934
00:35:21,113 --> 00:35:22,981
"We have a network of
authorized people to make sure

935
00:35:22,981 --> 00:35:25,170
that when you get your phone fixed,

936
00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:27,000
you don't have TikTok installed on it."

937
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,790
Well, three months ago on the
budget series Samsung phones,

938
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:32,580
they now pre-install TikTok
whether you like it or not.

939
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:35,040
So many of the things that
they wind up accusing us of are

940
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,330
not only things that they're doing,

941
00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:37,770
but things that they're
getting in trouble for

942
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:38,850
in the news for doing,

943
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:41,190
and they never seem to face
any sort of accountability

944
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:42,390
or responsibility for it.

945
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:44,160
If I make things up, then I'm going to get

946
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,000
a one-star Yelp review.

947
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:45,870
I'm gonna get a chargeback.

948
00:35:45,870 --> 00:35:47,010
My store is gonna close.

949
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:48,720
They get to make things
up on a regular basis

950
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:51,180
and make hundreds to
$400,000 a year to do it.

951
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:52,530
And for some reason, people believe them.

952
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:54,120
So those are some of the
arguments that I hear.

953
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:57,330
And there's my, actually one
more, my personal favorite,

954
00:35:57,330 --> 00:35:59,670
2015, this is the one that
actually got me started in this,

955
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:01,680
'cause I'm not a political professional

956
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,060
or lobbyist or anything.

957
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:05,280
One of the assembly people
in New York state said

958
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,440
that the Apple lobbyist had said that

959
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,840
when I replace a fuse on
a MacBook motherboard,

960
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:12,360
that what I've done is I've
now converted it into a PC,

961
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,070
because I changed the fuse.

962
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:16,350
And when I give it back to my customer,

963
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:18,360
I'm still letting them
think it's a MacBook,

964
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,010
when in reality it's a PC.

965
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:20,850
That's fraud.

966
00:36:20,850 --> 00:36:22,290
And if so, if you want to prevent fraud,

967
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:24,690
you won't let Louis get access
to that through this bill.

968
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:25,680
I just stared at him.

969
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,750
I'm trying my best not to
just fume and curse him out

970
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:28,583
because he is my assembly person.

971
00:36:28,583 --> 00:36:30,120
And I don't want to get audited again.

972
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,867
And I'm just thinking about, I said,

973
00:36:31,867 --> 00:36:33,930
"Why did you believe this horse shit?"

974
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:36,210
And he says, "Nobody else came
here to tell me otherwise.

975
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:37,043
Now you did."

976
00:36:37,043 --> 00:36:39,000
And he actually signed
and co-sponsored the bill

977
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:39,840
right in front of me.

978
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:42,510
And that got me to realize
there are all these people

979
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:44,010
that think there's no point to bothering.

980
00:36:44,010 --> 00:36:45,990
Why would I call my
assembly person or Senator?

981
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:47,010
Why would I say anything?

982
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:49,005
And the reality is, the
reason these people win

983
00:36:49,005 --> 00:36:51,210
is nobody else shows up.

984
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:54,510
- And yeah, I mean, one of the big lies,

985
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:56,940
which is the same lie that
your car dealership tells you

986
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:59,460
is that their repair
people are walking around

987
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:01,257
in lab coats with PhDs,

988
00:37:01,257 --> 00:37:04,770
and the corner garage are
criminals and never do wells,

989
00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:07,320
when in fact, you know,
you get excellent quality

990
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,780
from the corner garage
more often than not.

991
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:10,800
And you get good quality

992
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,690
from the authorized repair provider.

993
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:15,810
And that's a great
example of Apple talking

994
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:17,190
about their authorized repair

995
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:19,560
as if these people are
all highly, highly vetted.

996
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:22,200
And what we learned actually
only through a lawsuit

997
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,190
was that, in fact,

998
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:26,460
Apple just outsources their device repair

999
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:28,560
when you ship a device out to a company

1000
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:31,080
that actually outsourced
it to a third company

1001
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:33,840
where these obviously not
very well vetted employees

1002
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:36,093
stole images and posted them.

1003
00:37:36,093 --> 00:37:38,460
Louis, I mean, maybe
if you could just talk

1004
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:42,660
about the restrictions on
your business for repair,

1005
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:45,180
like what are some of the hurdles
that you need to get over?

1006
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:48,000
I know there's one just
around, you have parts

1007
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,060
that you might have to order from China,

1008
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:51,900
replacement screens.

1009
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:54,330
They might be original Apple parts,

1010
00:37:54,330 --> 00:37:56,400
but they're getting seized at the border

1011
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,800
because they're being declared counterfeit

1012
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,140
and some of those types of things.

1013
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:02,340
- Yes, so one of the largest problems

1014
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:03,450
that I'm facing right now is,

1015
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:04,530
let's just get by a show of hands,

1016
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:05,760
how many people have had a device,

1017
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,710
they plug it to charge it, and it dies?

1018
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:09,690
Okay, common problems.

1019
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:11,880
Let's say you have a $3,000
device that does that.

1020
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:14,380
What would you guess the
repair price for that is?

1021
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:17,786
So, yell out any guesses.

1022
00:38:17,786 --> 00:38:21,227
- [Audience Members] (indistinct)

1023
00:38:21,227 --> 00:38:22,060
- Close.

1024
00:38:22,904 --> 00:38:25,440
It's about $1500 to $1,700.

1025
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:28,050
And the chip that winds
up dying is about $5

1026
00:38:28,050 --> 00:38:29,160
from Texas Instruments.

1027
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,570
Now when that particular chip dies,

1028
00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:32,070
you used to be able to just buy this chip.

1029
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:33,930
You could buy from a Texas
Instruments reseller,

1030
00:38:33,930 --> 00:38:34,920
or an Interstellar reseller,

1031
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:37,470
go to Mouser, Digi-Key,
Newark and spend five bucks,

1032
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:39,060
buy it, and then bring it to any one

1033
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:40,590
of the smorgasbords of repair shops,

1034
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:43,470
some charge 75, some charge
400, some charge 200,

1035
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:44,670
and they would all be competing

1036
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:45,960
in the market for your business.

1037
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,700
Now what they do is
they tell Interstellar,

1038
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:48,870
they tell Texas instruments,

1039
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:51,150
don't sell this basic
chip to anybody but us.

1040
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:54,990
So they'll take a chip that
is a basic normal function,

1041
00:38:54,990 --> 00:38:56,430
but modify it in one small way

1042
00:38:56,430 --> 00:38:57,960
like what address it communicates on.

1043
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,000
So now you can't buy
the off-the-shelf chip,

1044
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,710
and then they will make the chip that they

1045
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:04,080
slightly modify not
available to anybody else.

1046
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:07,890
So what we will have to do
is wait for donor boards

1047
00:39:07,890 --> 00:39:08,723
to come from China.

1048
00:39:08,723 --> 00:39:11,190
So what people will do is
they will take these boards

1049
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:13,140
that are being thrown away
because they're defective

1050
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:15,900
and that are about to get
recycled, and we will buy them.

1051
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,700
Now, five years ago, Apple started to get

1052
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:18,660
a little bit smart about that.

1053
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:19,830
So they started searching people

1054
00:39:19,830 --> 00:39:20,910
as they're leaving the facility

1055
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:22,920
and they started shredding
up all the devices

1056
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:23,910
that they throw away.

1057
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:27,143
So now you can't buy a donor
board to get that chip anymore.

1058
00:39:27,143 --> 00:39:29,820
They sneak it out in their underwear.

1059
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:32,715
They'll be a wing, a breast, a thigh.

1060
00:39:32,715 --> 00:39:36,810
You'll get a little box of
bits and pieces of board.

1061
00:39:36,810 --> 00:39:38,370
And you have to see if
the chip is on there

1062
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:41,130
that you need to put it on
the board to be able to fix it

1063
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:42,000
for a customer.

1064
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,350
And although the people that are

1065
00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:44,460
making this stuff available,

1066
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:45,900
I imagine are not exactly doing it

1067
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:47,160
in the most legal of ways.

1068
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,720
So when I explain this to senators,

1069
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,600
I'll say I signed up to be a
nerd, a device repair person.

1070
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,310
I wasn't trying to be
Nicholas Cage's character

1071
00:39:53,310 --> 00:39:56,100
from "Lord of War," running
guns all around the world for,

1072
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:57,390
but that's what it feels like.

1073
00:39:57,390 --> 00:39:59,377
When you hear your supplier say,

1074
00:39:59,377 --> 00:40:01,290
"Yeah, the reason we're
cutting these things up is

1075
00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:03,600
because they have to sneak
it out in their underwear

1076
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:04,620
before it comes to you."

1077
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:05,760
I mean, obviously, the
first thing I did is

1078
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:06,960
I dropped a donor board in front of me

1079
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,035
and I went to wash my hands.

1080
00:40:08,035 --> 00:40:08,868
(audience laughing)

1081
00:40:08,868 --> 00:40:09,780
But this is part of the process,

1082
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:11,910
or let's say the schematic diagram.

1083
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:14,250
That winds up getting taken from somebody

1084
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:16,290
when their computer is free.

1085
00:40:16,290 --> 00:40:19,440
And somebody walks in the
room and plugs in USB,

1086
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,280
and then sneaks out

1087
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:22,020
and then makes it available to all of us.

1088
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:24,150
I mean, you used to have
repair manuals written

1089
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:25,380
on the back of the device.

1090
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:27,150
Now, you can't get access to this,

1091
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:28,600
even if you're an
authorized repair center.

1092
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,900
So if I get authorized by
any of these companies,

1093
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:32,130
I still can't buy those chips.

1094
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:33,420
I still can't buy those manuals,

1095
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:34,560
even if I'm willing to pay

1096
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,901
and go through all of
their vetting process.

1097
00:40:36,901 --> 00:40:38,400
- [Paul] Yeah. Joe, you
talked about that as well.

1098
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:42,770
Yeah. Just kind of the talk about that.

1099
00:40:42,770 --> 00:40:43,650
Go ahead.

1100
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:44,922
- [Joe] Oh, I just wanted
to comment on your thing

1101
00:40:44,922 --> 00:40:47,730
about vendors trying to make
off the shelf components

1102
00:40:47,730 --> 00:40:51,060
inaccessible to small companies,
which just reminded me.

1103
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:51,900
So I'm working on,

1104
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,850
and you might even have
something to say about this,

1105
00:40:53,850 --> 00:40:54,990
I'm working on a project right now.

1106
00:40:54,990 --> 00:40:59,130
So extracting raw NAND flash
from a MacBook motherboard,

1107
00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:01,350
and we take it off standard footprint,

1108
00:41:01,350 --> 00:41:03,810
looks like any other regular
type of memory device,

1109
00:41:03,810 --> 00:41:07,727
but it turns out that Apple
has worked with Toshiba

1110
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:12,330
to actually change the
pin out in such a way

1111
00:41:12,330 --> 00:41:15,600
that all of the available
sockets and interfaces

1112
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:16,800
don't work with it.

1113
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:20,393
So there's stuff you can
buy in China, on AliExpress,

1114
00:41:20,393 --> 00:41:22,470
and different sockets that
have pins coming up to touch

1115
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:24,810
on different pads of a standard chip.

1116
00:41:24,810 --> 00:41:25,643
That doesn't work.

1117
00:41:25,643 --> 00:41:27,240
So you have to manufacture or create

1118
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:30,150
all your own custom stuff
just to read a pin out.

1119
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:31,380
Functionally, it's exactly the same,

1120
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:33,660
but they've changed that
pin out for no other reason,

1121
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:36,300
I believe, other than
to make it impossible

1122
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:38,580
to get the parts other
than from donor boards,

1123
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:41,190
and for somebody like me to
actually get the contents off,

1124
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:42,360
to do something with it,

1125
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:45,570
which I'd never even
experienced that before.

1126
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:46,740
Have you seen that on-

1127
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:48,027
- Most of the, I mean the
most insidious part of this

1128
00:41:48,027 --> 00:41:50,490
is that they don't actually
even offer these services

1129
00:41:50,490 --> 00:41:51,540
that they would be competing with you on.

1130
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:53,490
So let's say that you'd be
offering data recovery services

1131
00:41:53,490 --> 00:41:55,170
and they make it impossible
for you to do it.

1132
00:41:55,170 --> 00:41:56,347
If Warren Buffet walks in there and says,

1133
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:58,260
"Here's a hundred million
dollars, try to get my stuff,"

1134
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:00,690
and it's a basic problem,
they would say no.

1135
00:42:00,690 --> 00:42:01,860
- Yeah. And they just make it hard.

1136
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:04,230
So now what would've been
an easy problem to help

1137
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:06,960
somebody with is now
a multi-month process.

1138
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,640
You have to buy donor boards and test it

1139
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:11,160
and build circuit boards to
interface with other stuff.

1140
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:13,193
And it's almost a lot of times,

1141
00:42:13,193 --> 00:42:18,087
security we know is how hard is something,

1142
00:42:18,087 --> 00:42:20,550
and is it worth the adversary from doing?

1143
00:42:20,550 --> 00:42:23,190
And I think a lot of these
tactics are just to slow us down,

1144
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:24,990
to be like, it's not worth the effort.

1145
00:42:24,990 --> 00:42:27,390
So then they just kind
of get their way with it.

1146
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:28,223
- Yeah.

1147
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:30,720
I think some of this
conversation is we're concerned

1148
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:31,920
about the repair monopoly

1149
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,680
and they're screwing over
the independent repair shops

1150
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:36,600
to monopolize repairs.

1151
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:37,893
That's certainly what John Deere is doing.

1152
00:42:37,893 --> 00:42:39,810
What I think Apple is doing is,

1153
00:42:39,810 --> 00:42:41,460
it's a flat out war on repair.

1154
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:43,170
They don't want this
stuff fixed by anyone,

1155
00:42:43,170 --> 00:42:44,490
including Apple folks.

1156
00:42:44,490 --> 00:42:46,920
It's a cycle of disposability.

1157
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:48,960
The AirPods were never
designed to be serviced

1158
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,340
by Apple or anyone else.

1159
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:54,030
They're designed, you buy
it, you use it for 18 months,

1160
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:57,240
and then you go back and
you hand them another $179.

1161
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:58,734
- That's what they want, right?

1162
00:42:58,734 --> 00:43:00,390
And, actually, right to
repair laws are sort of

1163
00:43:00,390 --> 00:43:01,223
silent on that.

1164
00:43:01,223 --> 00:43:02,940
If you want to make a
product like the iPods

1165
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:06,720
that are not repairable or
serviceable, knock yourself out.

1166
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:07,920
Presumably, that would be,

1167
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:10,650
it would fall to consumers
to sort of put pressure

1168
00:43:10,650 --> 00:43:12,180
on manufacturers to-

1169
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:13,013
- [Kyle] Consumers.

1170
00:43:13,013 --> 00:43:13,846
And Europe is working.

1171
00:43:13,846 --> 00:43:15,870
France rolled out a repairability label,

1172
00:43:15,870 --> 00:43:18,120
where it rates products from zero to 10

1173
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:19,230
on how fixable it is.

1174
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:21,261
It's right next to the price.

1175
00:43:21,261 --> 00:43:22,823
And that's starting to have an impact.

1176
00:43:22,823 --> 00:43:25,530
- I mean, Joe, talk a
little bit about the concept

1177
00:43:25,530 --> 00:43:26,610
of jail breaking devices.

1178
00:43:26,610 --> 00:43:29,670
'cause I kind of feel like
this is sort of the future,

1179
00:43:29,670 --> 00:43:33,450
which is, I would love a future
in which it's sort of like,

1180
00:43:33,450 --> 00:43:35,190
hey, thanks to the hardware, John Deere,

1181
00:43:35,190 --> 00:43:36,450
this is a really nice tractor.

1182
00:43:36,450 --> 00:43:40,470
I'm now gonna load my own OS
on it and my own services.

1183
00:43:40,470 --> 00:43:42,960
I'm gonna keep my data and
instead of sending them

1184
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,820
to your cloud to monetize.

1185
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:47,850
And, but great job on the tractor.

1186
00:43:47,850 --> 00:43:48,713
Works great.

1187
00:43:48,713 --> 00:43:53,070
So talk about this notion of
just sort of jail breaking

1188
00:43:53,070 --> 00:43:57,480
and what role that might play in creating

1189
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:59,700
a more repairable ecosystem.

1190
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:02,430
- Sure. I mean, I think
from a general perspective,

1191
00:44:02,430 --> 00:44:03,720
if you're not familiar with jail breaking,

1192
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:06,300
I kind of think about it
as just bypassing controls

1193
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:09,480
of some system to give you
access to other resources,

1194
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,850
and those resources are already available,

1195
00:44:11,850 --> 00:44:13,020
but not to you, right?

1196
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:15,830
So it's something where I
think a lot of companies are

1197
00:44:15,830 --> 00:44:18,871
implementing heavy security
so they can rely on DMCA

1198
00:44:18,871 --> 00:44:21,420
and rely on legal action.

1199
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:22,890
But if you're buying a product,

1200
00:44:22,890 --> 00:44:24,750
why should you not be able to gain access

1201
00:44:24,750 --> 00:44:26,190
to all of the resources?

1202
00:44:26,190 --> 00:44:30,480
John Deere tractor, which,
you know, 5:00 PM stay tuned.

1203
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:32,520
It's sort of like, if you
can't modify your hardware,

1204
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:33,353
do you actually own it?

1205
00:44:33,353 --> 00:44:34,380
And it comes back to all of that.

1206
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:37,200
So it really is breaking out of a sandbox.

1207
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,582
Or I thought about today in the shower,

1208
00:44:38,582 --> 00:44:39,930
it's not even a sandbox.

1209
00:44:39,930 --> 00:44:41,370
It's like a playpen.

1210
00:44:41,370 --> 00:44:43,650
They're trying to keep
all the children inside

1211
00:44:43,650 --> 00:44:47,100
and not letting you out to
actually use their hardware.

1212
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:49,740
But I still cannot wrap my head around

1213
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:52,920
why that shouldn't be, other than the fact

1214
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:54,960
that we know they want to really,

1215
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:55,920
they want to make a lot of money

1216
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:57,270
and they don't want you
to use their hardware.

1217
00:44:57,270 --> 00:44:59,250
So they want you to buy new stuff.

1218
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:01,860
But, you know, it's just another way

1219
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:04,050
to make things difficult for us

1220
00:45:04,050 --> 00:45:05,310
that is not necessary,

1221
00:45:05,310 --> 00:45:07,440
other than they want to make money

1222
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:09,420
and they want to maintain control

1223
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:11,460
of what people do with their stuff,

1224
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:14,520
which is exactly why I
think we're at DEF CON

1225
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:18,180
to have control of things and
break things and make things,

1226
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:20,217
do things that they weren't intended to.

1227
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:24,270
And this is just another
step in that process.

1228
00:45:24,270 --> 00:45:26,070
- I mean, this affects all
different kinds of products.

1229
00:45:26,070 --> 00:45:27,420
We talk a lot about smartphones.

1230
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:28,620
We talk a lot about laptops,

1231
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:30,960
'cause those are just
things that everybody uses,

1232
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,600
but it's also home appliances,
agricultural equipment,

1233
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:34,620
heavy equipment.

1234
00:45:34,620 --> 00:45:39,480
Can we just talk, are there
companies, vendors, OEMs

1235
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:41,253
that are doing this right?

1236
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:46,140
And are there OEMs who
are maybe on the road

1237
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:47,370
to doing things right?

1238
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:50,040
And are there OEMs who are totally

1239
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:51,390
lost in the woods on this?

1240
00:45:51,390 --> 00:45:53,670
Kyle, I think that's a
good question for you.

1241
00:45:53,670 --> 00:45:57,330
- Yeah. Well, I mean, the heroes
are probably the startups,

1242
00:45:57,330 --> 00:45:59,880
the folks like Fairphone
out of Netherlands

1243
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:03,750
has a super repairable modular phone.

1244
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:06,090
Then you have Framework with-

1245
00:46:06,090 --> 00:46:07,800
Anyone Framework customers here?

1246
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:08,633
No?

1247
00:46:08,633 --> 00:46:09,466
Awesome.

1248
00:46:09,466 --> 00:46:10,502
In the back.

1249
00:46:10,502 --> 00:46:11,335
Yeah.

1250
00:46:11,335 --> 00:46:12,403
- [Louis] Check out Framework laptop.

1251
00:46:12,403 --> 00:46:14,250
- Framework is killer.

1252
00:46:14,250 --> 00:46:16,890
What I love about Framework,
I mean, amongst other things

1253
00:46:16,890 --> 00:46:19,080
is super modular, modular
parts, everything else.

1254
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:20,880
But if you upgrade the laptop,

1255
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,890
you take your board
out of your old laptop,

1256
00:46:22,890 --> 00:46:25,470
put the new board in and then
the board that you upgraded

1257
00:46:25,470 --> 00:46:27,150
is a full blown standalone PC.

1258
00:46:27,150 --> 00:46:28,200
You could 3d print a case

1259
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:29,950
and you use it as another computer.

1260
00:46:30,810 --> 00:46:32,790
This, computers are modular,

1261
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:34,620
why the hell aren't we
doing this all the time?

1262
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:37,890
So, you have startups paving the path,

1263
00:46:37,890 --> 00:46:42,481
but now as right to repair laws
are starting to get passed,

1264
00:46:42,481 --> 00:46:45,540
we are starting to see
some companies come to us.

1265
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:48,060
So far this year, iFixit
has launched partnerships

1266
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:52,350
with Microsoft, with
Google and with Samsung,

1267
00:46:52,350 --> 00:46:54,750
and Valve with the Steam Deck,

1268
00:46:54,750 --> 00:46:56,913
which is probably the most important one

1269
00:46:56,913 --> 00:46:59,460
where we're distributing parts for them.

1270
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:02,910
So we're starting to see movement,

1271
00:47:02,910 --> 00:47:05,580
but we have to get this from
the fringe to mainstream,

1272
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:07,410
and having some of these
large manufacturers

1273
00:47:07,410 --> 00:47:10,253
very grudgingly come on board
and start to work with us

1274
00:47:10,253 --> 00:47:12,163
is important.

1275
00:47:12,163 --> 00:47:13,650
- Corynne, I mean, one of the things

1276
00:47:13,650 --> 00:47:17,360
that companies are doing
a lot now is things like

1277
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:22,360
putting little trademarks or logos

1278
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:26,542
on even really tiny
parts so that they can,

1279
00:47:26,542 --> 00:47:29,940
to the point about counterfeit
parts versus authentic parts

1280
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:30,773
and whatever.

1281
00:47:30,773 --> 00:47:34,350
Talk about how they're
really trying to frustrate

1282
00:47:34,350 --> 00:47:38,462
the repair, the aftermarket
ecosystem for parts

1283
00:47:38,462 --> 00:47:42,900
around what you need to do repair,

1284
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:45,630
and what the legal theory behind that is.

1285
00:47:45,630 --> 00:47:49,350
- Yeah, so it's a longstanding practice

1286
00:47:49,350 --> 00:47:51,660
from sort of the creative industries,

1287
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:55,001
the traditional Hollywood
copyright industries,

1288
00:47:55,001 --> 00:47:57,382
if you can't get it via copyright,

1289
00:47:57,382 --> 00:47:59,100
see what you can get via trademark.

1290
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:02,520
The good thing about trademarks
is they last forever.

1291
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:03,810
As long as you maintain them,

1292
00:48:03,810 --> 00:48:05,100
as long as you're using the mark

1293
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:06,210
in connection with whatever

1294
00:48:06,210 --> 00:48:09,230
the good is in commerce,
there's no term limit.

1295
00:48:09,230 --> 00:48:11,070
As you all probably know,
the copyright term limit

1296
00:48:11,070 --> 00:48:13,140
is ridiculous anyway,

1297
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:15,270
'cause it can be up to 90 years,

1298
00:48:15,270 --> 00:48:17,760
but trademark, Coca-Cola
has had trademarks

1299
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,230
for 120 years now.

1300
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:22,080
They're maintaining, maybe close to 120.

1301
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:25,440
So the idea is, yeah,
okay, well maybe copyright

1302
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:28,470
isn't completely helping us,
but if we put our trademark

1303
00:48:28,470 --> 00:48:30,542
on every single little bitty thing,

1304
00:48:30,542 --> 00:48:34,110
then we can go after folks

1305
00:48:34,110 --> 00:48:36,243
who might be providing an alternative,

1306
00:48:37,110 --> 00:48:41,340
but maybe are also using
the work or using the object

1307
00:48:41,340 --> 00:48:43,590
in a way that we didn't authorize.

1308
00:48:43,590 --> 00:48:44,497
And then we can say,

1309
00:48:44,497 --> 00:48:46,780
"Okay, well that is a trademark violation

1310
00:48:47,910 --> 00:48:50,640
'cause we have the
right to control the use

1311
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:52,200
of our market and how it's used."

1312
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:54,552
And so you can use it downstream

1313
00:48:54,552 --> 00:48:56,490
or you can go after people

1314
00:48:56,490 --> 00:48:58,770
who are trying to resell those parts,

1315
00:48:58,770 --> 00:49:00,210
who have managed to break things apart

1316
00:49:00,210 --> 00:49:01,860
and they want to sell
it on eBay or whatever.

1317
00:49:01,860 --> 00:49:05,377
And then so they'll go
and go after them and say,

1318
00:49:05,377 --> 00:49:08,640
"You're not an authorized
seller of this good,"

1319
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:10,500
and they'll shut you down.

1320
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:13,200
And the thing about it that
is worth thinking about

1321
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:16,920
is because very often a
lot of this doesn't happen

1322
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:19,170
one to one, but rather via platforms.

1323
00:49:19,170 --> 00:49:21,540
So if you're making parts available,

1324
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:23,190
maybe you make it available on eBay,

1325
00:49:23,190 --> 00:49:24,669
well then, they're not
going to talk to you.

1326
00:49:24,669 --> 00:49:25,680
Why are gonna talk to you?

1327
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:26,580
That's too much trouble.

1328
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:28,620
They're just going to send a note to eBay,

1329
00:49:28,620 --> 00:49:30,512
and eBay will take it down.

1330
00:49:30,512 --> 00:49:33,420
They will take down the
shop or Etsy or whatever.

1331
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:36,570
It's a way of bypassing
actually trying to go

1332
00:49:36,570 --> 00:49:39,390
after the individual directly,
you go after the platform,

1333
00:49:39,390 --> 00:49:42,240
who's much more vulnerable
and less interested

1334
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:44,913
probably in defending any given seller,

1335
00:49:48,630 --> 00:49:50,100
because the seller's probably not

1336
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:51,180
giving them very much money, right?

1337
00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:52,890
They want to preserve
their entire platform

1338
00:49:52,890 --> 00:49:54,600
and they don't want to get in litigation.

1339
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:57,120
So it's just better to take it down.

1340
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:58,134
- If you open an iPhone or if you look at

1341
00:49:58,134 --> 00:50:02,850
one of iFixit's teardowns,
you'll see just about every part

1342
00:50:02,850 --> 00:50:05,460
inside the iPhone has
the Apple logo on it.

1343
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:09,123
And I met some engineers
who had worked on iPhone,

1344
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:11,497
were out of their seven
year NDA, and I was like,

1345
00:50:11,497 --> 00:50:12,810
"Why do you guys do that?

1346
00:50:12,810 --> 00:50:13,950
Is there any engineering?

1347
00:50:13,950 --> 00:50:15,540
Is there any supply
chain reason for that?"

1348
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:17,400
And then he said, "I have no idea why."

1349
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:19,080
Well, I'll tell you the reason why is

1350
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:21,510
to make it difficult for
people like Louis and I

1351
00:50:21,510 --> 00:50:23,370
to get parts across borders.

1352
00:50:23,370 --> 00:50:25,770
The presumption at US Customs is

1353
00:50:25,770 --> 00:50:27,900
that you are guilty until proven innocent.

1354
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:30,390
And you have to show
that you have permission

1355
00:50:30,390 --> 00:50:32,580
from the trademark holder
to be moving that trademark

1356
00:50:32,580 --> 00:50:33,900
across the border.

1357
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:38,130
So when they put the Apple
logo on a flex on a display,

1358
00:50:38,130 --> 00:50:39,840
how does that limit you?

1359
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:42,420
- So let's say somebody
buys an iPhone in China,

1360
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:44,460
they take all the parts
of that legally purchased

1361
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:45,390
iPhone in China,

1362
00:50:45,390 --> 00:50:46,980
and then they sell them separately

1363
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:48,420
to someone in America.

1364
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:52,050
They will be seized because they'll say

1365
00:50:52,050 --> 00:50:54,390
that all of those parts were counterfeit

1366
00:50:54,390 --> 00:50:55,590
because it has an Apple logo on it.

1367
00:50:55,590 --> 00:50:56,880
And since you're not on the list of people

1368
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:57,900
that should be getting those parts,

1369
00:50:57,900 --> 00:50:59,730
then surely that must mean
that it is counterfeit.

1370
00:50:59,730 --> 00:51:02,160
It's assumed counterfeit unless you are

1371
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:03,450
on that particular list.

1372
00:51:03,450 --> 00:51:04,896
So even if I'm importing parts, whether

1373
00:51:04,896 --> 00:51:07,830
they're used or they came
from an actual device

1374
00:51:07,830 --> 00:51:08,970
that somebody bought in that country

1375
00:51:08,970 --> 00:51:10,620
that they're parting out for profit,

1376
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:11,760
you can't import them.

1377
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:13,800
They have to find a way to
grind the logo off of it.

1378
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:15,450
And if they don't grind
the logo off of it,

1379
00:51:15,450 --> 00:51:16,950
then you wind up getting in trouble.

1380
00:51:16,950 --> 00:51:18,810
This is a particular
problem when you're talking

1381
00:51:18,810 --> 00:51:20,130
about something like a display assembly,

1382
00:51:20,130 --> 00:51:23,370
where they grind the logo
into the back of the case

1383
00:51:23,370 --> 00:51:25,290
so that you're not able
to actually import it.

1384
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:27,660
So you usually wind up
having to make the package

1385
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:29,940
so annoying that they just don't open it

1386
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:31,200
to see what the logo is.

1387
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:33,570
And you'll see, you probably
get packages like this,

1388
00:51:33,570 --> 00:51:34,650
where it's been taped over

1389
00:51:34,650 --> 00:51:37,590
and has 10 or 20 layers of cardboard.

1390
00:51:37,590 --> 00:51:39,630
My personal favorite
was when they actually

1391
00:51:39,630 --> 00:51:40,680
shipped me display assemblies.

1392
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:43,290
What they did is they put them inside

1393
00:51:43,290 --> 00:51:44,430
of laptop coolers.

1394
00:51:44,430 --> 00:51:45,510
So they have these laptop coolers,

1395
00:51:45,510 --> 00:51:47,190
little fans that you put under the laptop,

1396
00:51:47,190 --> 00:51:49,050
they broke it, they broke the fan blades,

1397
00:51:49,050 --> 00:51:51,180
and they put my parts inside of it.

1398
00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:53,310
Just find all these
ridiculously creative ways

1399
00:51:53,310 --> 00:51:54,210
to get around Customs.

1400
00:51:54,210 --> 00:51:55,200
And it's not that hard.

1401
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:57,180
I mean, it's kind of getting
something past the TSA,

1402
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:58,847
which is, you know, fairly simple.

1403
00:51:58,847 --> 00:52:00,846
- [Paul] Corynne, how can they do that?

1404
00:52:00,846 --> 00:52:05,503
Why is Customs and Border
Protection in the business

1405
00:52:07,620 --> 00:52:12,620
of helping Apple to suppress
the total legal movement

1406
00:52:12,787 --> 00:52:14,430
of aftermarket parts?

1407
00:52:14,430 --> 00:52:15,880
- [Joe] Federal jobs program.

1408
00:52:17,130 --> 00:52:22,130
- Well actually you'd be
shocked how much federal money

1409
00:52:22,620 --> 00:52:25,300
and resources are spent policing IP

1410
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:28,920
when you think they should
be doing something else,

1411
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:30,390
and really you think Homeland Security,

1412
00:52:30,390 --> 00:52:31,500
what does that have to do with anything?

1413
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:34,688
Homeland security is seizing websites

1414
00:52:34,688 --> 00:52:36,990
that are involved in
copyright infringement.

1415
00:52:36,990 --> 00:52:39,870
This is because they're
under tremendous pressure

1416
00:52:39,870 --> 00:52:43,020
from major IP owners to be engaging

1417
00:52:43,020 --> 00:52:44,100
in this kind of activity.

1418
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:45,990
And they're responsive to that,

1419
00:52:45,990 --> 00:52:47,460
because what will happen is

1420
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:49,207
IP owners will come to them and say,

1421
00:52:49,207 --> 00:52:53,760
"You have no idea that the
piracy, the counterfeit,

1422
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:56,190
the fraud, you have to protect."

1423
00:52:56,190 --> 00:52:57,660
And the argument will be,

1424
00:52:57,660 --> 00:53:00,060
you are protecting consumers

1425
00:53:00,060 --> 00:53:01,500
from getting counterfeit parts.

1426
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:05,370
You're protecting consumers
from accessing pirate sites,

1427
00:53:05,370 --> 00:53:07,140
not realizing it, you are protecting.

1428
00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:09,420
That will be the idea, you are protecting

1429
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:12,120
the security of Americans.

1430
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:13,170
And I do think most of us,

1431
00:53:13,170 --> 00:53:14,940
when we think of Department
of Homeland Security,

1432
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:16,350
we actually don't think
that's what they're doing

1433
00:53:16,350 --> 00:53:17,183
with their time.

1434
00:53:17,183 --> 00:53:19,119
And also when we think
of the Customs and Border

1435
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:21,270
enforcement, I mean,
yeah, they are going to

1436
00:53:21,270 --> 00:53:22,860
police counterfeits across borders.

1437
00:53:22,860 --> 00:53:24,369
That's not a crazy thing for them to do.

1438
00:53:24,369 --> 00:53:26,283
It's just perhaps-

1439
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:28,110
- gone a little too far,

1440
00:53:28,110 --> 00:53:30,210
- maybe gone a little
too far in priorities,

1441
00:53:30,210 --> 00:53:32,079
- And they, I mean.
Customs is a thing where,

1442
00:53:32,079 --> 00:53:35,100
as a big company, you
can pay Customs money

1443
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:37,740
to pay for their staff
to do their enforcement.

1444
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:40,620
It's very convenient if
you have buckets of money.

1445
00:53:40,620 --> 00:53:41,550
- [Paul] Okay. Final question.

1446
00:53:41,550 --> 00:53:42,630
And then I want to go to some questions

1447
00:53:42,630 --> 00:53:43,697
from the audience.

1448
00:53:43,697 --> 00:53:46,890
And this, I think Joe, Kyle, Louis,

1449
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:48,849
probably good question for you.

1450
00:53:48,849 --> 00:53:53,849
How do we promote this not
only right to repair, so yes,

1451
00:53:54,097 --> 00:53:57,420
promote right to repair
laws, get them passed,

1452
00:53:57,420 --> 00:54:00,000
but kind of what Kyle was
talking about, this idea,

1453
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,470
and Joe, that you talk about a lot,

1454
00:54:01,470 --> 00:54:03,270
of getting people to start thinking

1455
00:54:03,270 --> 00:54:05,610
about their devices in a different way,

1456
00:54:05,610 --> 00:54:09,450
not being afraid to open
them up, not buying the lie,

1457
00:54:09,450 --> 00:54:11,220
like it's cheaper to just replace it,

1458
00:54:11,220 --> 00:54:14,250
it's cheaper to just replace
it, and actually kind of start

1459
00:54:14,250 --> 00:54:17,310
thinking about these
as things that they own

1460
00:54:17,310 --> 00:54:19,960
and things that they have
the right and the ability

1461
00:54:20,987 --> 00:54:22,770
to fix themselves or get a neighbor to fix

1462
00:54:22,770 --> 00:54:23,883
or get Louis to fix.

1463
00:54:24,930 --> 00:54:27,267
- I mean, I think what Louis is doing

1464
00:54:27,267 --> 00:54:31,380
and what Kyle is doing are
sort of the main kind of things

1465
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:32,640
of getting people to realize, oh,

1466
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:34,016
you can fix stuff.

1467
00:54:34,016 --> 00:54:38,910
Ever since being a kid, most
of us want to open stuff up

1468
00:54:38,910 --> 00:54:39,990
and see how it works,

1469
00:54:39,990 --> 00:54:41,190
but not everybody does that.

1470
00:54:41,190 --> 00:54:43,687
Most people buy a device, they
take it for granted and say,

1471
00:54:43,687 --> 00:54:46,020
"Oh, some magical engineers
created this thing.

1472
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:47,550
It's perfect."

1473
00:54:47,550 --> 00:54:49,140
And not realizing they can open it up.

1474
00:54:49,140 --> 00:54:50,670
And, of course, when vendors are

1475
00:54:50,670 --> 00:54:52,950
making things harder to open and they add

1476
00:54:52,950 --> 00:54:55,440
all sorts of problems from
a trademark perspective

1477
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:58,170
or anti-tamper mechanisms
to make it self-destruct

1478
00:54:58,170 --> 00:55:00,000
or delete something when you open it,

1479
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,450
there's all these things that
prevent us from doing it.

1480
00:55:03,450 --> 00:55:07,350
But again, it all comes
down to profit and control.

1481
00:55:07,350 --> 00:55:10,867
And I think really spreading
the message to people of

1482
00:55:10,867 --> 00:55:13,110
"Look, you can open stuff,
you can modify stuff."

1483
00:55:13,110 --> 00:55:15,570
You shouldn't have to go to Shenzhen

1484
00:55:15,570 --> 00:55:18,630
to find components that
you can bring back.

1485
00:55:18,630 --> 00:55:21,213
If you've seen Strange
Parts YouTube channel,

1486
00:55:22,149 --> 00:55:25,200
there's people repairing
things and modifying things,

1487
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:27,450
but it shouldn't be this difficult to do.

1488
00:55:27,450 --> 00:55:30,090
Like Louis shouldn't have to have people

1489
00:55:30,090 --> 00:55:31,260
smuggle parts through.

1490
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:34,200
It should be as accessible to
us as it is to other people.

1491
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:36,360
When I, talking about
Shenzhen, I was there

1492
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:39,810
and if you've ever can
go to the SEG market

1493
00:55:39,810 --> 00:55:41,430
and Bunnie Huang has
written about this a lot,

1494
00:55:41,430 --> 00:55:44,190
and you go and it's floors
and floors and floors

1495
00:55:44,190 --> 00:55:47,040
of different components
for different projects.

1496
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:48,960
And the repair culture
is a lot different there.

1497
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:51,960
And the access to information
and information sharing

1498
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:53,130
is a lot different there.

1499
00:55:53,130 --> 00:55:54,540
And I kind of put it on myself.

1500
00:55:54,540 --> 00:55:56,490
I showed up and I had 90 minutes

1501
00:55:56,490 --> 00:55:59,520
and I wanted to see
could I find schematics

1502
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:00,870
for like an iPhone?

1503
00:56:00,870 --> 00:56:02,460
'Cause I had heard you could do it.

1504
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:05,400
And through talking to different
people at different booths,

1505
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:07,080
and talk to this person,
talk to this person.

1506
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:08,640
I had my iPhone trying to translate

1507
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:10,680
'cause even the Chinese
word for schematics

1508
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:11,850
is not schematic.

1509
00:56:11,850 --> 00:56:14,040
It's like visual drawing of something.

1510
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:16,971
So I ended up going through
and finding books of schematics

1511
00:56:16,971 --> 00:56:21,690
that had confidential
information, blah, blah, blah.

1512
00:56:21,690 --> 00:56:24,180
But either somebody had taken
those out of the factory

1513
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:25,860
or they had reverse engineered the board,

1514
00:56:25,860 --> 00:56:27,387
but it shouldn't be that hard, right?

1515
00:56:27,387 --> 00:56:29,370
And I finally got them and, I guess,

1516
00:56:29,370 --> 00:56:31,050
technically smuggled them over the border

1517
00:56:31,050 --> 00:56:33,270
and brought them back to the US,

1518
00:56:33,270 --> 00:56:34,170
but why?

1519
00:56:34,170 --> 00:56:35,760
Most people are not going
to be able to do that.

1520
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:39,210
So they're going to rely on
Louis and iFixit and other-

1521
00:56:39,210 --> 00:56:41,070
like iFixit shouldn't
have to reverse engineer

1522
00:56:41,070 --> 00:56:43,170
old Toshiba laptops to
make their own manuals.

1523
00:56:43,170 --> 00:56:44,520
That's just ridiculous.

1524
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:46,710
The whole thing is just mind boggling,

1525
00:56:46,710 --> 00:56:48,520
but I think it all sort of boils down to

1526
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:50,730
why we're hackers in the first place

1527
00:56:50,730 --> 00:56:53,139
and why we're here is to educate people

1528
00:56:53,139 --> 00:56:55,650
and push against corporations that are

1529
00:56:55,650 --> 00:56:59,730
trying to do something
to make the world a place

1530
00:56:59,730 --> 00:57:01,780
that's better for them than it is for us.

1531
00:57:03,150 --> 00:57:04,500
- [Paul] Louis, Kyle, anything to add?

1532
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:05,880
- I think it comes down to getting people

1533
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:06,713
personally invested in it.

1534
00:57:06,713 --> 00:57:08,520
You know, I think that
there's two different types

1535
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:09,353
of activism.

1536
00:57:09,353 --> 00:57:11,280
There's the Greta Thunberg
type of activism with

1537
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:14,640
how dare you, which results
in more Ford F350 diesels

1538
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:15,990
rolling coal on my electric car.

1539
00:57:15,990 --> 00:57:17,880
And I run through
Pennsylvania than ever before.

1540
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:19,380
And then there's the type
where you try to get people

1541
00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:20,370
personally invested.

1542
00:57:20,370 --> 00:57:23,490
So part of what I try to do
with my YouTube channel is

1543
00:57:23,490 --> 00:57:24,900
turn it into a little bit of performance,

1544
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:26,280
like Mr. Rogers or Bob Ross.

1545
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:28,508
You know, when I started posting
repair videos to YouTube,

1546
00:57:28,508 --> 00:57:30,330
I was looking for them myself

1547
00:57:30,330 --> 00:57:32,070
and they would always be 90 seconds

1548
00:57:32,070 --> 00:57:34,939
have techno music playing
super fast, very boring,

1549
00:57:34,939 --> 00:57:37,980
there was no soul, nothing fun about it.

1550
00:57:37,980 --> 00:57:40,470
So I would try to make these
little nine to 15 minute clips

1551
00:57:40,470 --> 00:57:41,850
where it seemed interesting.

1552
00:57:41,850 --> 00:57:44,340
We explain the entire concept
in a way that a seventh grader

1553
00:57:44,340 --> 00:57:45,300
could understand.

1554
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:47,070
We would go through every
single thing that we did.

1555
00:57:47,070 --> 00:57:48,360
We try to make it a
little bit interesting.

1556
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:49,920
Talk about current events
while we're doing it

1557
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:52,590
and also not leave anything out.

1558
00:57:52,590 --> 00:57:55,530
So when I say make it, get
people personally invested,

1559
00:57:55,530 --> 00:57:57,810
I mean also do it in a
way that is profitable.

1560
00:57:57,810 --> 00:58:00,210
Somebody who watches this
stuff could start charging

1561
00:58:00,210 --> 00:58:02,490
two or three hundred dollars
for 15 minutes of their time

1562
00:58:02,490 --> 00:58:04,350
to do that type of work themselves.

1563
00:58:04,350 --> 00:58:06,030
Or they could use that
to fix their own device

1564
00:58:06,030 --> 00:58:07,080
and save a few thousand bucks.

1565
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:09,090
And once you've saved
somebody a thousand bucks

1566
00:58:09,090 --> 00:58:10,230
they're personally invested,

1567
00:58:10,230 --> 00:58:12,330
or once somebody is actually watching,

1568
00:58:12,330 --> 00:58:14,190
going this is kind of
entertaining, this is kind of cool.

1569
00:58:14,190 --> 00:58:15,690
And then they watch a
hundred of those videos.

1570
00:58:15,690 --> 00:58:18,810
And then I say, by the way,
these may no longer exist

1571
00:58:18,810 --> 00:58:21,840
because the company is taking
away our ability to do that.

1572
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:24,330
You've kind of gotten
their personal investment.

1573
00:58:24,330 --> 00:58:26,400
You said that this is what
is gonna be taken away.

1574
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:28,320
You're gonna stop being able to enjoy this

1575
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:29,490
if this goes away.

1576
00:58:29,490 --> 00:58:31,680
So I think you have to get
people as personally invested

1577
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:32,520
as humanly possible.

1578
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:34,590
And that starts by allowing
them to save money,

1579
00:58:34,590 --> 00:58:35,790
allowing them to make money,

1580
00:58:35,790 --> 00:58:37,320
and allowing them to be entertained

1581
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:38,970
through sharing your passion.

1582
00:58:38,970 --> 00:58:41,550
And I think that that's something that is

1583
00:58:41,550 --> 00:58:43,800
more going be on the cultural
side than the legal side.

1584
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:46,050
I do a lot for right to
repair on the legal side.

1585
00:58:46,050 --> 00:58:47,040
But at the end of the day,

1586
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:48,630
a right to repairable
gets released that says

1587
00:58:48,630 --> 00:58:49,860
make things available.

1588
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:52,177
Samsung tells Kyle, well,
we're gonna give you

1589
00:58:52,177 --> 00:58:55,080
$213 batteries welded to the screen.

1590
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:56,730
There's an element of malicious compliance

1591
00:58:56,730 --> 00:58:57,780
that it's always going to be there,

1592
00:58:57,780 --> 00:59:00,210
and getting people personally
invested in all of this

1593
00:59:00,210 --> 00:59:03,210
so that companies like Framework exists

1594
00:59:03,210 --> 00:59:05,130
and are actually economically viable.

1595
00:59:05,130 --> 00:59:08,100
People want to buy that because
they value repairability

1596
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:09,390
to the point where they can actually

1597
00:59:09,390 --> 00:59:11,010
make schematics available
for their products

1598
00:59:11,010 --> 00:59:12,180
and parts and everything else.

1599
00:59:12,180 --> 00:59:14,610
That's what's going to be what,
I think, moves this forward.

1600
00:59:14,610 --> 00:59:17,220
- Well, I think also the
amount of views on your channel

1601
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:19,200
sort of validates the
fact that people want to

1602
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:20,310
fix their own stuff, right?

1603
00:59:20,310 --> 00:59:23,910
It's like, that's what the
companies are afraid of

1604
00:59:23,910 --> 00:59:25,140
because if they're going to lose money

1605
00:59:25,140 --> 00:59:27,030
on their authorized
dealerships or whatever,

1606
00:59:27,030 --> 00:59:29,590
it only proves the point that, oh,

1607
00:59:29,590 --> 00:59:30,423
- Or watch empty real estate.

1608
00:59:30,423 --> 00:59:31,256
- What's that?

1609
00:59:31,256 --> 00:59:32,089
- Or watch empty real estate.

1610
00:59:32,089 --> 00:59:32,922
- Well, yeah.

1611
00:59:34,639 --> 00:59:35,984
- [Paul] Okay.

1612
00:59:35,984 --> 00:59:37,119
- [Corynne] Can I say one more thing?

1613
00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:38,167
- [Paul] Of course.

1614
00:59:38,167 --> 00:59:40,590
- So one of the things that
we talk about a lot at EFF

1615
00:59:40,590 --> 00:59:44,490
is sometimes you have a
need to speak tech to power

1616
00:59:44,490 --> 00:59:45,660
and what that means.

1617
00:59:45,660 --> 00:59:49,320
And it's kind of what, I think,
Louis did to some extent.

1618
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:51,900
There are times, particularly
at the state level,

1619
00:59:51,900 --> 00:59:54,960
where what we need is for
someone to comment and testify,

1620
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:57,360
or even just talk to their
local assembly person,

1621
00:59:57,360 --> 01:00:00,480
which most people don't do
and kind of don't want to do.

1622
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:01,860
And I don't blame them.

1623
01:00:01,860 --> 01:00:03,540
I understand it's not that fun,

1624
01:00:03,540 --> 01:00:05,670
but sometimes that's
really what's needed is

1625
01:00:05,670 --> 01:00:08,520
for us to have a
technologist on the ground

1626
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:11,707
who can go and just talk to
their representative and say,

1627
01:00:11,707 --> 01:00:13,440
"I'm gonna tell you the truth

1628
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:16,320
because I know it and
this is my profession

1629
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:17,490
and this is what I do."

1630
01:00:17,490 --> 01:00:21,540
And it's actually amazing
to me how responsive,

1631
01:00:21,540 --> 01:00:25,080
especially at the local
level, that folks can be,

1632
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:28,290
'cause they don't hear
from that many people.

1633
01:00:28,290 --> 01:00:31,650
And to be honest, also
from some crazy people.

1634
01:00:31,650 --> 01:00:33,720
And then they hear from a
bunch of really expensive

1635
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:36,660
corporate lobbyists who
are really good at talking

1636
01:00:36,660 --> 01:00:38,970
and despite the mumble mumble crazy

1637
01:00:38,970 --> 01:00:41,010
that we heard earlier, but
actually they're pretty good

1638
01:00:41,010 --> 01:00:42,600
at it and they give them money.

1639
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:45,870
So speaking tech to
power is actually a place

1640
01:00:45,870 --> 01:00:47,310
where the people in this community

1641
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:48,570
can be really effective.

1642
01:00:48,570 --> 01:00:50,670
- Yeah. I mean, that's
one thing that struck me

1643
01:00:50,670 --> 01:00:52,560
in this whole process is how,

1644
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:55,080
when you go in and talk
to legislators, you know,

1645
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:57,210
they're definitely open
to hearing your opinion,

1646
01:00:57,210 --> 01:01:02,210
but you also get a real sense
of how much their day to day

1647
01:01:03,450 --> 01:01:07,050
is occupied by lobbyists,
lawyers, PR people working

1648
01:01:07,050 --> 01:01:08,790
on behalf of moneyed interests,

1649
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:11,640
whether those are specific
corporations, industry groups,

1650
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:12,510
what have you.

1651
01:01:12,510 --> 01:01:15,000
Those people are there outside the john

1652
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,130
when they come out, like talk
to them on their way back

1653
01:01:17,130 --> 01:01:20,580
to their office, they're there
taking them out to lunch,

1654
01:01:20,580 --> 01:01:23,310
and that has an impact.

1655
01:01:23,310 --> 01:01:25,230
And you, we have lives.

1656
01:01:25,230 --> 01:01:28,380
We have work, we can't hang
around state houses and lobby.

1657
01:01:28,380 --> 01:01:30,603
So we do need to work collectively.

1658
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:32,813
Yes, Joe.

1659
01:01:32,813 --> 01:01:33,900
- I'm curious about something.

1660
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:37,290
Is there anybody in the
audience that works at a product

1661
01:01:37,290 --> 01:01:39,210
vendor, you know, somebody
that's designing products

1662
01:01:39,210 --> 01:01:40,043
and selling them?

1663
01:01:40,043 --> 01:01:43,260
So maybe, you don't have to
say if you have an opinion

1664
01:01:43,260 --> 01:01:45,900
about right to repair,
but working from that side

1665
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:50,790
actually as a consumer
product vendor or anything?

1666
01:01:50,790 --> 01:01:51,623
Yeah, there's a couple.

1667
01:01:51,623 --> 01:01:54,210
So there's something that came to mind.

1668
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:57,060
So Crowd Supply is a website promoting

1669
01:01:57,060 --> 01:01:58,557
open hardware development
and crowdfunding,

1670
01:01:58,557 --> 01:01:59,580
and they have something called

1671
01:01:59,580 --> 01:02:01,530
the Proclamation of User Rights,

1672
01:02:01,530 --> 01:02:02,790
that not only are they just

1673
01:02:02,790 --> 01:02:04,200
going take any project,

1674
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:06,123
say a Kickstarter might or Indiegogo,

1675
01:02:07,230 --> 01:02:09,270
they have a list of like certain things

1676
01:02:09,270 --> 01:02:10,680
that protect user rights.

1677
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:14,250
So I have it on here, like
curiosity and independence

1678
01:02:14,250 --> 01:02:17,130
and association and longevity
and transfer and discourse

1679
01:02:17,130 --> 01:02:18,630
and privacy and security.

1680
01:02:18,630 --> 01:02:21,750
And if you're from those
worlds of product development,

1681
01:02:21,750 --> 01:02:24,660
you should take a look at
that list of user rights.

1682
01:02:24,660 --> 01:02:27,600
And I think it's really
interesting if besides talking to

1683
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:30,217
the lobbyists, working within
the organization and saying,

1684
01:02:30,217 --> 01:02:32,430
"Look, this is how products
should be designed."

1685
01:02:32,430 --> 01:02:35,280
We can still make a profit
selling our product,

1686
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:38,850
but if we follow these rules,
like Framework and some of the

1687
01:02:38,850 --> 01:02:40,470
projects that Bunnie Huang are working on

1688
01:02:40,470 --> 01:02:42,540
and there's all of these smaller projects.

1689
01:02:42,540 --> 01:02:47,540
But if this type of mindset
can go into real company

1690
01:02:47,580 --> 01:02:49,950
consumer design, that would be amazing.

1691
01:02:49,950 --> 01:02:52,770
And then sort of its
for the people, right?

1692
01:02:52,770 --> 01:02:55,020
And I think they Crowd
Supply did a really good job

1693
01:02:55,020 --> 01:02:57,030
of sort of explaining
these different steps.

1694
01:02:57,030 --> 01:02:59,430
So even using that as a resource
or like a starting point,

1695
01:02:59,430 --> 01:03:01,410
maybe, I have no idea 'cause
I'm not in that world,

1696
01:03:01,410 --> 01:03:03,630
but maybe that's something that is worth

1697
01:03:03,630 --> 01:03:05,280
trying to start conversations.

1698
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:06,450
- [Paul] Kyle is going to
have something to say on this,

1699
01:03:06,450 --> 01:03:07,283
I think.

1700
01:03:07,283 --> 01:03:10,260
- Yeah, at iFixit we're
doing a lot of that.

1701
01:03:10,260 --> 01:03:12,750
We do a lot of consulting
work with companies.

1702
01:03:12,750 --> 01:03:16,020
There's a lot of, we're starting
to see the pendulum swing.

1703
01:03:16,020 --> 01:03:17,250
And so there's a lot of interest.

1704
01:03:17,250 --> 01:03:18,720
How do I design repairable products?

1705
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:21,480
How do I design safe,
replaceable batteries?

1706
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:23,760
What does it look like to
set up a part supply chain?

1707
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:24,930
We are at the beginning of that.

1708
01:03:24,930 --> 01:03:27,780
We need a lot more so as you
are talking with your friends

1709
01:03:27,780 --> 01:03:29,730
that work in engineering
at these companies,

1710
01:03:29,730 --> 01:03:31,950
this can be done, right?

1711
01:03:31,950 --> 01:03:33,870
We can design repairable
long lasting hardware.

1712
01:03:33,870 --> 01:03:35,127
We just have to decide to do it,

1713
01:03:35,127 --> 01:03:36,720
and we have to make
the case to management.

1714
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:38,340
And so that's what I spend
a lot of my time doing,

1715
01:03:38,340 --> 01:03:41,400
is making the case that either
the sustainability folks

1716
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:43,410
or the security folks
or the engineers want

1717
01:03:43,410 --> 01:03:45,450
helping them figure out how
to make the case to management

1718
01:03:45,450 --> 01:03:47,010
to actually shift business practices.

1719
01:03:47,010 --> 01:03:48,900
- Well, it's sort of coming
back around to how it was

1720
01:03:48,900 --> 01:03:50,940
in the '70s and '80s, where
you would buy something

1721
01:03:50,940 --> 01:03:51,900
and you get your schematic.

1722
01:03:51,900 --> 01:03:55,140
And your Apple, the first
Apple too had schematics

1723
01:03:55,140 --> 01:03:56,610
and you buy prototype cards.

1724
01:03:56,610 --> 01:03:57,750
- It was the default and it was just

1725
01:03:57,750 --> 01:03:59,820
the way everything was
done at the beginning

1726
01:03:59,820 --> 01:04:00,690
of the electronics era.

1727
01:04:00,690 --> 01:04:02,220
We have lost our way.

1728
01:04:02,220 --> 01:04:05,176
Now we have to argue our way back onto

1729
01:04:05,176 --> 01:04:06,107
the great narrow path.

1730
01:04:06,107 --> 01:04:07,620
- ]Paul] Yes. And legislate our way back.

1731
01:04:07,620 --> 01:04:10,320
Okay. Are there questions from
the audience for our panel?

1732
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:11,153
Oh great.

1733
01:04:12,030 --> 01:04:12,930
We'll start there.

1734
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:16,353
Front row green shirt.

1735
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:26,010
- [Audience Member] I'm
a father, and I learned

1736
01:04:26,010 --> 01:04:29,280
how to get curious by taking stuff apart.

1737
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:34,280
My grandfather had the
audio tubes television,

1738
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:38,070
and he taught me how to tear stuff apart.

1739
01:04:38,070 --> 01:04:42,630
And I took it on to my kids
and they became curious

1740
01:04:42,630 --> 01:04:44,130
about technology.

1741
01:04:44,130 --> 01:04:47,610
If I walk around at the
schools, I see consumers.

1742
01:04:47,610 --> 01:04:51,120
So consumers are being
created instead of creators.

1743
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:52,500
And I think as a community,

1744
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:57,500
we have like, we need to keep kids curious

1745
01:04:57,630 --> 01:04:59,130
by taking stuff apart.

1746
01:04:59,130 --> 01:05:02,790
Don't be afraid of technology
because it helps them

1747
01:05:02,790 --> 01:05:05,310
think about certain issues.

1748
01:05:05,310 --> 01:05:09,420
But it's also like we're saving the planet

1749
01:05:09,420 --> 01:05:14,420
by allowing this to, yeah,
change as a community.

1750
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:19,443
So if you can inspire someone
do like classes on school,

1751
01:05:20,490 --> 01:05:23,520
help inspire others, that really helps.

1752
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:25,800
- And those are the
next generation of kids

1753
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:27,510
that might turn into engineers that then

1754
01:05:27,510 --> 01:05:29,790
work in the companies
and have that mindset,

1755
01:05:29,790 --> 01:05:31,800
not the closed mindset,
but the open mindsets.

1756
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:32,700
That's hugely important.

1757
01:05:32,700 --> 01:05:33,968
- [Audience Member] Exactly.

1758
01:05:33,968 --> 01:05:38,730
And there's so many people
required in the industry.

1759
01:05:38,730 --> 01:05:42,300
- [Paul] Can we do, yeah, third
row and then just move back?

1760
01:05:42,300 --> 01:05:43,150
That'll be great.

1761
01:05:48,690 --> 01:05:50,190
That's a fourth row, but okay.

1762
01:05:52,680 --> 01:05:53,813
- [Audience Member] Hello.

1763
01:05:55,406 --> 01:05:57,256
I'm hoping you can connect some dots here

1764
01:05:57,256 --> 01:06:02,256
'cause the problems that
right to repair seems to face

1765
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:05,820
you listed was end user
license agreements, Customs,

1766
01:06:05,820 --> 01:06:10,820
DRM, exclusivity
agreements, and legislation

1767
01:06:11,490 --> 01:06:13,110
I've seen so far only seems to tackle

1768
01:06:13,110 --> 01:06:14,613
maybe one of those.

1769
01:06:16,620 --> 01:06:20,220
Is there any, like what
legislative solutions

1770
01:06:20,220 --> 01:06:23,463
are we looking at for
especially like EULAs.

1771
01:06:26,220 --> 01:06:27,720
- Sorry. I want to make sure
I understand the question.

1772
01:06:27,720 --> 01:06:30,780
Is it so what legislative
solutions are we seeing to the

1773
01:06:30,780 --> 01:06:33,150
various legal impediments?

1774
01:06:33,150 --> 01:06:34,756
- [Audience Member] Yeah.

1775
01:06:34,756 --> 01:06:37,320
'Cause the legislation I've seen so far

1776
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:41,100
or that you've been advocating
for only seems to say,

1777
01:06:41,100 --> 01:06:44,130
we need to make manuals
available and things like that.

1778
01:06:44,130 --> 01:06:48,000
I'm not sure how that really
solves some of the problems

1779
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:51,203
that we've had for so long,
especially with EULAs,

1780
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:57,390
where I shouldn't have to
really agree to an EULA

1781
01:06:57,390 --> 01:07:00,210
to receive it and use it.

1782
01:07:00,210 --> 01:07:03,090
- Yeah, so there's a
couple things in play.

1783
01:07:03,090 --> 01:07:05,760
So you're quite right that the
state right to repair laws,

1784
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:06,593
they're great.

1785
01:07:06,593 --> 01:07:07,650
They don't do everything.

1786
01:07:07,650 --> 01:07:08,790
There's way more to be done.

1787
01:07:08,790 --> 01:07:10,320
But it's a start.

1788
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:11,605
There is in fact-

1789
01:07:11,605 --> 01:07:12,990
- [Paul] Oh, go ahead.

1790
01:07:12,990 --> 01:07:13,823
Sorry.

1791
01:07:13,823 --> 01:07:17,940
- There is a long-standing
bill that's been in Congress

1792
01:07:17,940 --> 01:07:21,330
that was introduced by
representative Zoe Lofgren

1793
01:07:21,330 --> 01:07:24,570
that would change Section 1201 at least,

1794
01:07:24,570 --> 01:07:26,340
so that if you are circumventing,

1795
01:07:26,340 --> 01:07:27,450
if you're breaking the law,

1796
01:07:27,450 --> 01:07:30,210
in order to make a fair use,

1797
01:07:30,210 --> 01:07:32,250
to do something that's otherwise lawful,

1798
01:07:32,250 --> 01:07:34,380
then it will be lawful.

1799
01:07:34,380 --> 01:07:37,110
And that would be tremendous.

1800
01:07:37,110 --> 01:07:40,260
Unfortunately there's very,
very strong opposition to that,

1801
01:07:40,260 --> 01:07:41,760
but that would be tremendous.

1802
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:44,733
We really need some solutions
at the federal level.

1803
01:07:46,350 --> 01:07:49,590
Unfortunately, courts
have over and over treated

1804
01:07:49,590 --> 01:07:52,470
end user license agreements
like regular negotiated

1805
01:07:52,470 --> 01:07:55,290
contracts and treated
them as equally binding

1806
01:07:55,290 --> 01:07:56,850
to regularly negotiated contract.

1807
01:07:56,850 --> 01:07:58,440
And that's ridiculous.

1808
01:07:58,440 --> 01:08:01,470
And there's more and more
folks who are talking about it,

1809
01:08:01,470 --> 01:08:05,100
but that's a thing that's
also going to take some action

1810
01:08:05,100 --> 01:08:08,253
at the state level 'cause
contract law is state law.

1811
01:08:09,888 --> 01:08:14,400
So, yes, that's why I'm
actually mostly hopeful

1812
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:18,600
that we get rid of Section
1201 anyway in court,

1813
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:20,610
rather than having to rely on Congress,

1814
01:08:20,610 --> 01:08:22,380
'cause courts are slow,

1815
01:08:22,380 --> 01:08:23,940
Congress is slower.

1816
01:08:23,940 --> 01:08:26,130
- And I would call on all of you,

1817
01:08:26,130 --> 01:08:27,960
if there's something that bothers you,

1818
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:31,320
I'm just a guy who decided
I cared about repair

1819
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:33,930
and spent a while
advocating for this, right?

1820
01:08:33,930 --> 01:08:36,360
Louis started a YouTube channel.

1821
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:38,880
We're just normal people.

1822
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:39,980
We're just like the rest of you.

1823
01:08:39,980 --> 01:08:42,000
So if something bothers you, if you want

1824
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,140
to take on the EULA issue,

1825
01:08:43,140 --> 01:08:45,420
it's a major, major issue.

1826
01:08:45,420 --> 01:08:46,740
We need more people working on this.

1827
01:08:46,740 --> 01:08:49,290
There are not enough people
in the public advocacy space,

1828
01:08:49,290 --> 01:08:52,680
working to counteract these
highly-paid corporate lobbyists.

1829
01:08:52,680 --> 01:08:54,510
- And to the question on
the right to repair laws,

1830
01:08:54,510 --> 01:08:58,050
it's a little bit, it's not
just about the repair manuals.

1831
01:08:58,050 --> 01:09:00,570
They also say that you have to
provide access to diagnostic

1832
01:09:00,570 --> 01:09:01,403
software.

1833
01:09:01,403 --> 01:09:04,680
And they also say that you
need to provide tools to unlock

1834
01:09:04,680 --> 01:09:06,960
digital locks for the
purposes of doing repair.

1835
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:08,970
So it isn't just, oh, well
you'll get the manual,

1836
01:09:08,970 --> 01:09:09,840
but you're still screwed.

1837
01:09:09,840 --> 01:09:13,080
So, they're more granular than that.

1838
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:15,600
- The state law is basically
give or sell me the tool.

1839
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:18,540
The federal law that we're
working on is make it legal

1840
01:09:18,540 --> 01:09:20,040
for me to whittle my own tool.

1841
01:09:22,170 --> 01:09:23,160
- [Paul] I don't know
where the mic guy is.

1842
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:23,993
Where's the mic guy?

1843
01:09:23,993 --> 01:09:24,826
- [Mic Guy] I've got it here. Yeah.

1844
01:09:24,826 --> 01:09:26,144
- [Paul] There we go.

1845
01:09:26,144 --> 01:09:27,064
- [Audience Member]
It's really interesting

1846
01:09:27,064 --> 01:09:28,110
that you mentioned Harley-Davidson,

1847
01:09:28,110 --> 01:09:31,590
because my motorcycle
is in the shop right now

1848
01:09:31,590 --> 01:09:33,960
because I tried to tune it,

1849
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:37,080
and now they've refused
to fix the motorcycle.

1850
01:09:37,080 --> 01:09:38,190
It's not even a warranty issue.

1851
01:09:38,190 --> 01:09:41,400
They won't even allow me to
pay for a new thing or fix it.

1852
01:09:41,400 --> 01:09:42,750
They said, "Oh you broke it.

1853
01:09:42,750 --> 01:09:44,821
So we'll no longer fix it."

1854
01:09:44,821 --> 01:09:49,821
How do I go about working with
Harley-Davidson or whatever

1855
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:51,113
to say, you know,

1856
01:09:51,113 --> 01:09:53,864
"This is not legal" or what are the laws

1857
01:09:53,864 --> 01:09:56,490
that could protect me in
the state of California?

1858
01:09:56,490 --> 01:09:57,744
- [Paul] Don't go alone. I think that's-

1859
01:09:57,744 --> 01:09:59,730
- [Audience Member] Exactly.

1860
01:09:59,730 --> 01:10:01,260
Bring some muscle.

1861
01:10:01,260 --> 01:10:02,276
- Yeah.

1862
01:10:02,276 --> 01:10:03,870
- I mean, we need them to be sharing

1863
01:10:03,870 --> 01:10:05,760
their diagnostic software
so at least you've got

1864
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:08,610
an even shot at what the
dealership is going to do.

1865
01:10:08,610 --> 01:10:11,670
And that's where the
Massachusetts existing

1866
01:10:11,670 --> 01:10:13,350
right to repair law and
then the updated one

1867
01:10:13,350 --> 01:10:14,940
that's currently being
challenged in courts,

1868
01:10:14,940 --> 01:10:16,140
that will help.

1869
01:10:16,140 --> 01:10:17,460
- [Paul] Does it apply to motorcycles?

1870
01:10:17,460 --> 01:10:18,293
I don't-

1871
01:10:19,256 --> 01:10:21,483
- I think it does.

1872
01:10:22,590 --> 01:10:23,793
I believe it does, yeah.

1873
01:10:24,777 --> 01:10:26,550
But that's the right strategy.

1874
01:10:26,550 --> 01:10:27,930
It's at least to get you on an even keel

1875
01:10:27,930 --> 01:10:29,910
with the dealership so that you can maybe

1876
01:10:29,910 --> 01:10:30,960
use their tooling.

1877
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:33,030
I would mention from a
security perspective,

1878
01:10:33,030 --> 01:10:34,980
once we do have access to their tooling,

1879
01:10:34,980 --> 01:10:37,050
that's a whole nother attack
service we can investigate.

1880
01:10:37,050 --> 01:10:38,430
So that's gonna be a lot of fun.

1881
01:10:38,430 --> 01:10:42,390
So expect as right to repair
starts to become out there

1882
01:10:42,390 --> 01:10:44,580
and companies are posting
diagnostic software,

1883
01:10:44,580 --> 01:10:47,010
you may see some on iFixit soon.

1884
01:10:47,010 --> 01:10:50,280
That's going to be
interesting bites to look at.

1885
01:10:50,280 --> 01:10:53,160
- [Paul] Yes. No more
security through obscurity.

1886
01:10:53,160 --> 01:10:53,993
Yes.

1887
01:10:55,680 --> 01:10:57,125
Okay. Go ahead.

1888
01:10:57,125 --> 01:11:01,208
- [Audience Member] (indistinct)

1889
01:11:32,550 --> 01:11:35,100
- Just to recast the
question so you can all hear,

1890
01:11:35,100 --> 01:11:36,930
he said, yeah, we are a hardware vendor,

1891
01:11:36,930 --> 01:11:39,510
and the product that we sell is regulated.

1892
01:11:39,510 --> 01:11:42,720
We have to have tamperproof
mechanisms on the product

1893
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:44,400
in order to sell it.

1894
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:46,440
What's your kind take on that?

1895
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:49,560
- Yeah. I mean, if you're
following FIPS 140,

1896
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:52,260
which basically is a checklist
of things you need to do to

1897
01:11:52,260 --> 01:11:54,900
be physically secure or be secure,

1898
01:11:54,900 --> 01:11:57,963
which is anti-tamper mechanisms
to prevent physical access,

1899
01:11:58,890 --> 01:12:02,610
maybe encryption of data and
things and things like that.

1900
01:12:02,610 --> 01:12:06,510
I don't know, I mean, from my
perspective of being a hacker,

1901
01:12:06,510 --> 01:12:08,557
when I see a product that's
FIPS-140 compliant, I say,

1902
01:12:08,557 --> 01:12:10,530
"Okay, at least they've maybe
tried to take some steps,

1903
01:12:10,530 --> 01:12:13,050
but I still am going to try to hack it."

1904
01:12:13,050 --> 01:12:14,130
- [Audience Member] Right?

1905
01:12:14,130 --> 01:12:15,600
- Yeah. A lot of it's
security by obscurity,

1906
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:17,613
and a lot of it is checklists of things.

1907
01:12:18,900 --> 01:12:21,660
But yeah, if you're like,
because of those things,

1908
01:12:21,660 --> 01:12:23,760
are you now preventing
right to repair in a way

1909
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:26,550
that you would prefer to
enable that, but you can't?

1910
01:12:26,550 --> 01:12:27,480
Like, I don't know.

1911
01:12:27,480 --> 01:12:30,780
- Right to repair laws really
don't deal with design at all.

1912
01:12:30,780 --> 01:12:32,430
All they're saying, if you're a hardware,

1913
01:12:32,430 --> 01:12:33,420
if you're a security vendor,

1914
01:12:33,420 --> 01:12:35,730
you've got an authorized repair provider

1915
01:12:35,730 --> 01:12:39,000
who you send your gear to and
you provide them with tools

1916
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,700
and information to do those
repairs on your behalf,

1917
01:12:41,700 --> 01:12:44,213
all repairs, there's nothing
to how you design your product,

1918
01:12:44,213 --> 01:12:46,980
all I'm saying is you need
to make those tools available

1919
01:12:46,980 --> 01:12:50,910
to the customers themselves
and to independent repair

1920
01:12:50,910 --> 01:12:54,120
so that there can be a better
market for that service.

1921
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:56,220
And whether it's FIPs compliant or not,

1922
01:12:56,220 --> 01:12:59,070
I think the right to repair
laws are totally silent on that.

1923
01:12:59,070 --> 01:13:04,050
But if you've got an authorized
repair system network,

1924
01:13:04,050 --> 01:13:06,050
they're saying you need to open that up.

1925
01:13:07,950 --> 01:13:09,060
- [Audience Member] I
know Louis is saying Kyle

1926
01:13:09,060 --> 01:13:11,190
did good work advocating
for the New York state

1927
01:13:11,190 --> 01:13:12,060
right to repair law.

1928
01:13:12,060 --> 01:13:14,040
Last time I checked that
passed the legislator

1929
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:15,570
and is waiting for Hochul's signature.

1930
01:13:15,570 --> 01:13:18,030
Is there anything else holding that up?

1931
01:13:18,030 --> 01:13:20,080
- [Paul] No, email Kathy Hochul.

1932
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:21,263
- Email the governor, Kathy Hochul.

1933
01:13:21,263 --> 01:13:23,010
It's sitting on her desk.

1934
01:13:23,010 --> 01:13:24,270
She just needs to sign it.

1935
01:13:24,270 --> 01:13:25,650
Indications are that she will,

1936
01:13:25,650 --> 01:13:30,360
but I think requests
like friendly suggestions

1937
01:13:30,360 --> 01:13:32,880
or requests that she
sign it would be welcome.

1938
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:33,713
- [Paul] Yes.

1939
01:13:33,713 --> 01:13:35,913
- But I can say we're
actively working on it.

1940
01:13:35,913 --> 01:13:39,390
The repair.org is the
right to repair coalition

1941
01:13:39,390 --> 01:13:40,223
working on this.

1942
01:13:40,223 --> 01:13:41,253
Please join repair.org.

1943
01:13:42,540 --> 01:13:45,090
We met with the Governor's
staff this week,

1944
01:13:45,090 --> 01:13:46,980
and we're continuing that dialogue.

1945
01:13:46,980 --> 01:13:48,510
So we're hopeful.

1946
01:13:48,510 --> 01:13:50,730
You say, "Well, why
hasn't she done it yet?"

1947
01:13:50,730 --> 01:13:53,070
New York passed a
thousand bills this year.

1948
01:13:53,070 --> 01:13:55,290
She has to sign all of them by hand.

1949
01:13:55,290 --> 01:13:56,553
So that takes some time.

1950
01:13:57,390 --> 01:14:00,150
- [Paul] I think we got time
maybe for one more question.

1951
01:14:00,150 --> 01:14:02,430
- [Audience Member] So
hypothetically, if members

1952
01:14:02,430 --> 01:14:06,150
of the audience were, let's
say, involved with some

1953
01:14:06,150 --> 01:14:08,820
consortiums of hospitals
that were fighting against

1954
01:14:08,820 --> 01:14:12,360
some particularly evil and litigious OEMs

1955
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:16,890
on right to repair, how might
they get more collaborative

1956
01:14:16,890 --> 01:14:19,260
with those of you on the panel

1957
01:14:19,260 --> 01:14:21,120
and work together on some of these issues?

1958
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:23,100
- Come up and talk to me after.

1959
01:14:23,100 --> 01:14:24,360
We're we're very interested.

1960
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:25,800
We're working with hospitals.

1961
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:28,500
We have medical-focused right to repair.

1962
01:14:28,500 --> 01:14:30,300
One thing by the way, I want to mention,

1963
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:33,360
since the other panel
that's happening right now

1964
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:35,070
is talking about medical,

1965
01:14:35,070 --> 01:14:39,087
but when COVID started we
started collaborating with EFF

1966
01:14:39,087 --> 01:14:40,980
and we said, "Look, there's
all these service manuals

1967
01:14:40,980 --> 01:14:43,260
for hospital equipment
that should be out there.

1968
01:14:43,260 --> 01:14:45,720
Biomeds are handing them
around on hard drives

1969
01:14:45,720 --> 01:14:47,970
and USB sticks to get the
service manuals around.

1970
01:14:47,970 --> 01:14:49,715
Can we just get those on the internet?"

1971
01:14:49,715 --> 01:14:53,940
(indistinct) was like, do you
think you guys can back us up

1972
01:14:53,940 --> 01:14:56,616
if we stick our neck out
a little bit on this?

1973
01:14:56,616 --> 01:14:57,449
And we said, yes.

1974
01:14:57,449 --> 01:14:58,282
And so we did it.

1975
01:14:58,282 --> 01:14:59,250
And so we launched the on iFixit.

1976
01:14:59,250 --> 01:15:01,620
We got 300 archivists and
librarians that have been sent

1977
01:15:01,620 --> 01:15:04,020
home during COVID to help us comb through.

1978
01:15:04,020 --> 01:15:06,720
And we got 25,000 service manuals,

1979
01:15:06,720 --> 01:15:10,320
PDFs for everything from a
ventilator to a CPAP machine

1980
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:13,650
to hospital equipment, vital
sign monitors, you name it.

1981
01:15:13,650 --> 01:15:15,030
It's all online at www.ifixit.com.

1982
01:15:15,030 --> 01:15:15,993
It's all free.

1983
01:15:18,476 --> 01:15:21,150
And so I hope that's a useful resource.

1984
01:15:21,150 --> 01:15:22,860
Also, if you're looking
to do security research

1985
01:15:22,860 --> 01:15:24,510
on these things, the service
manual is a good place

1986
01:15:24,510 --> 01:15:25,680
to start.

1987
01:15:25,680 --> 01:15:26,513
- [Audience Member] Yes.

1988
01:15:26,513 --> 01:15:27,780
- So hopefully that helps, but yeah,

1989
01:15:27,780 --> 01:15:29,580
we're working actively with hospitals

1990
01:15:29,580 --> 01:15:31,620
around the country and we'd love to talk.

1991
01:15:31,620 --> 01:15:33,930
- [Paul] Do we have time for
one more question or not?

1992
01:15:33,930 --> 01:15:34,763
- Yes.

1993
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:36,960
- [Paul] Over here. Over here.

1994
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:38,130
Yeah.

1995
01:15:38,130 --> 01:15:39,540
He's got his hand very high up.

1996
01:15:39,540 --> 01:15:40,373
So.

1997
01:15:44,580 --> 01:15:45,827
- [Audience Member]
Thank you all for coming.

1998
01:15:45,827 --> 01:15:47,174
I was just curious.

1999
01:15:47,174 --> 01:15:49,290
There's a lot of talk
about right to repair

2000
01:15:49,290 --> 01:15:52,623
and Louis Rossmann you're a hero of mine.

2001
01:15:53,460 --> 01:15:56,640
I was curious if you had any
thoughts on focusing more on

2002
01:15:56,640 --> 01:15:58,980
kind of removing these
unelected bureaucrats like in

2003
01:15:58,980 --> 01:16:02,913
Customs, kind of reducing
their powers, focusing on that.

2004
01:16:05,430 --> 01:16:09,510
Having Congress act on that,
in particular, removing powers

2005
01:16:09,510 --> 01:16:10,910
where they don't need to be?

2006
01:16:12,090 --> 01:16:14,140
- I definitely wouldn't be opposed to it.

2007
01:16:17,310 --> 01:16:18,480
TSA, while we're at it, as well.

2008
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:20,070
Why not?

2009
01:16:20,070 --> 01:16:21,143
- [Audience Member] Beautiful.

2010
01:16:22,770 --> 01:16:23,940
- [Paul] Okay.

2011
01:16:23,940 --> 01:16:25,200
Give a big hand to our panelists.

2012
01:16:25,200 --> 01:16:26,400
They did an amazing job.

2013
01:16:29,610 --> 01:16:32,763
And thanks all of you for coming
and asking great questions.
