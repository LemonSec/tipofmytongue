1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:01,680
- All right, test, test.

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:03,597
Here we go.

3
00:00:03,597 --> 00:00:06,430
(people clapping)

4
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:12,690
It's the closing
ceremonies for DEF CON 30,

5
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:14,370
where we'll give you the seat,

6
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:16,893
but you'll only need the edge.

7
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:20,494
I tried, okay.

8
00:00:20,494 --> 00:00:23,310
We get everything going here.

9
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:25,470
We got their slides up
and I'm gonna welcome you

10
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:29,883
to the final session of
DEF CON 30, Homecoming.

11
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,970
Thank you for sticking around everybody.

12
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:35,109
Give yourself some applause.

13
00:00:35,109 --> 00:00:38,109
(audience cheering)

14
00:00:42,521 --> 00:00:44,729
This is one of the only times

15
00:00:44,729 --> 00:00:47,580
I really can enjoy drinking a beer,

16
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:50,431
'cause normally when I
do, something bad happens

17
00:00:50,431 --> 00:00:53,940
and then I'm not totally functional,

18
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:56,130
and so then bad things happen.

19
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:59,902
But now what bad thing could
happen at closing ceremonies?

20
00:00:59,902 --> 00:01:04,443
It'll be fine, I'll be fine.

21
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:10,113
Okay, here we go, next slide.

22
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,033
Look at that.

23
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,630
I wanna call out Sleestak
for designing that logo.

24
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:24,000
We are having a brainstorming session

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,110
and I woke up the next day

26
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:26,820
and that sort of just came to him

27
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,567
and it was just such
a brilliant summation.

28
00:01:29,567 --> 00:01:32,190
All the other ideas were
like, okay, that's it.

29
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:33,120
That's the logo.

30
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,913
And it just came together
really well, was awesome.

31
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,590
But before we get going, every year

32
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:43,620
I like to really call out and
have us just take a moment

33
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:45,845
of silence for all the hackers

34
00:01:45,845 --> 00:01:48,750
that came before, the people's shoulders

35
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:51,420
we've been standing on or are standing on.

36
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:54,660
And we'll just be quiet for a minute.

37
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:56,710
Think about all your friends you've lost.

38
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,330
And then we'll really kick this thing off.

39
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:02,080
So just a moment of silence please.

40
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:10,710
Yeah, it was a pretty tough year,

41
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:13,800
but coming in the escalator here,

42
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,120
when I saw all of you just
like the buzzing energy,

43
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,370
I felt like there was
this invisible weight

44
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:22,080
that was lifted from my shoulders.

45
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,130
It was invisible in the sense

46
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:24,930
that I didn't know it was still there.

47
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:28,440
I thought I'd sort of unburden
myself throughout the year,

48
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:32,190
but no, when I saw
everybody, it was awesome.

49
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,270
And so by show of hands,

50
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:37,710
did anybody else feel the same
way or am I just freakish?

51
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:39,321
Yeah.

52
00:02:39,321 --> 00:02:40,530
(audience cheering)

53
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:42,720
Yeah, it was just this really cathartic

54
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,320
like here are my people,
and this is awesome.

55
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:51,313
Another thing that was
sort of awesome is this guy

56
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:09,600
and it kind of really
reminded me of the bees

57
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,610
for those of us that
got trapped at the hotel

58
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:15,180
on the last day when the bees
were storming by the pool.

59
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,013
Yeah.

60
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,950
And so you have now experienced

61
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:23,880
some extra DEF CON mystery
lore and you are free

62
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,500
to retell the storm

63
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,993
to whatever biblical proportion you want.

64
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:34,203
And that was what made
this one really memorable.

65
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:39,363
So for homecoming theme,

66
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,777
I wanna call out 30 years of history

67
00:03:43,777 --> 00:03:48,013
and there were some people
that are still been engaged

68
00:03:48,013 --> 00:03:52,045
with DEF CON, as goons or
in support or still around,

69
00:03:52,045 --> 00:03:54,960
that attended the very first DEF CON.

70
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:59,960
And this year at 30, there's
two people we could identify

71
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,417
that were at the very first DEF CON.

72
00:04:02,417 --> 00:04:04,620
And so I wanna have a call out,

73
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,543
a shout out to the Dead Addict.

74
00:04:07,633 --> 00:04:10,633
(audience clapping)

75
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,230
And I wanna have call out to The Prophet,

76
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:21,990
who's been doing the Telefreak Challenge.

77
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:23,640
So if you're in the room Prophet.

78
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:31,920
Now we've got something a
little special right now.

79
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:35,220
If I could ask all the
red shirt goons to stand,

80
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:38,190
everybody, all the red
shirt, goon stand please.

81
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:42,163
We're all also going to
recognize and give a 30,

82
00:04:43,376 --> 00:04:45,750
30 year goon patch

83
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:48,960
for all this contributions
of gooning over the years

84
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,965
to Stealth, you didn't know
this was coming did you?

85
00:04:52,965 --> 00:04:55,965
(audience clapping)

86
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:03,410
This is a one of a kind
30 year goon patch.

87
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:05,850
You have been to every single DEF CON

88
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:07,803
you could physically get a visa for.

89
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:12,000
The countries that won't
let you in then sorry.

90
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,020
- I don't want to go there.

91
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,310
- Okay.

92
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:17,550
So why do you keep doing it, man?

93
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:18,600
- I keep asking.

94
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,480
I keep asking myself
that question every year,

95
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,800
but I think the answer

96
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,140
is that it's just such a great community

97
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:29,280
and getting involved when
I didn't know any better,

98
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,870
I guess I've just kept being involved.

99
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:33,332
And I love helping people and
being part of this conference.

100
00:05:33,332 --> 00:05:36,480
And every year we get new challenges

101
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,490
and somehow all the goons,

102
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:41,790
they rise to the occasion
and it's really just become

103
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:43,980
a family, this is truly for me,

104
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:48,540
a family reunion with my
fellow goons and all of you.

105
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:52,950
It's an exceptional
experience and it's not a job.

106
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:56,004
It's a lifestyle, I don't
know how to do anything else.

107
00:05:56,004 --> 00:05:58,200
(audience clapping)

108
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,907
Thank you so much.

109
00:05:59,907 --> 00:06:00,907
- Thank you.

110
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,270
And something we have never done before.

111
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:12,990
We figured we may as well
start now, 30th anniversary.

112
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:17,990
We have what I'm calling the
uber contributors recognition.

113
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:21,420
There's two people that we're recognizing

114
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:24,810
as uber contributors and on my right,

115
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:29,810
hidden underneath this flag are
the Uber Contributor Awards.

116
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:33,393
So I'm going to go now,
surprise you by revealing them.

117
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:47,223
There are about five
pounds of solid aluminum.

118
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:49,863
So carry that on.

119
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,530
Okay, so there are two people.

120
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:56,490
One is here.

121
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:59,310
One was supposed to be here
and due to complications,

122
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:01,410
they could not, which was sad,

123
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:04,680
but here are the recipients.

124
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,763
1057 bOy, come on up.

125
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:22,809
And I'll read your description,
Bob, you hold it up for.

126
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:25,809
(audience cheering)

127
00:07:27,064 --> 00:07:28,541
- [Speaker] Helen's on the phone.

128
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:32,490
- Oh, so if you can't, the
inscription reads, 1057 bOy,

129
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:36,840
the original puzzle master
and spirit of inspiration.

130
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,760
I think that's pretty accurate.

131
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:41,490
All the work Ryan has
done inspiring people,

132
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:45,270
taught people, the way
he's built the puzzles,

133
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:48,600
the way he's included
people and challenged us,

134
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:52,173
really I think took DEF
CON to another level.

135
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:54,743
Give us a.

136
00:08:04,769 --> 00:08:07,269
- I don't wanna get emotional,

137
00:08:09,299 --> 00:08:13,530
but DEF CON represents
many years of my life

138
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:15,330
and trying to give to this community

139
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:18,123
and to draw people together.

140
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:22,410
So those of you who've been
following my stuff, my designs,

141
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:26,130
everything I do is meant
to make you interact,

142
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:27,270
take care of each other,

143
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:31,748
and that's all I would say
is just don't be an ass.

144
00:08:31,748 --> 00:08:34,748
(audience cheering)

145
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,280
- I knew Ryan, I knew 1057 bOy

146
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,140
was a keeper when he had some hat on

147
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:16,260
with electronics and
wires sticking out of it.

148
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,283
That's what I like.

149
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:22,890
The second Uber Contributor
Award goes to Richard Theme,

150
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:24,900
neural cowboy,

151
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:29,460
who was a first year speaker
at the first Black Hat.

152
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:34,460
And I've known Richard for a long time.

153
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:38,730
And his inscription reads,
seeker of a deeper meaning

154
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:41,670
and explorer of the unknown.

155
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:44,283
If you've ever listened
to a Richard's theme talk,

156
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:46,953
please tell me what it meant.

157
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,990
Everybody that heard his talk

158
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:54,462
came away with a different message.

159
00:09:54,462 --> 00:09:57,420
And what he's trying to do is synthesize

160
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:00,270
a lot of how do you know the unknown?

161
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:04,271
And I think he forced us or encouraged us

162
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:06,061
to think differently.

163
00:10:06,061 --> 00:10:11,061
I couldn't always follow
it, but I wanted to, man,

164
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:15,240
it always felt like Richard
was channeling something

165
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,130
into a place that I wanted to be,

166
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:19,530
but I couldn't fully get there.

167
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:22,050
And that's unusual, especially for geeks,

168
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:25,290
where we think we're the
masters of all the known.

169
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:26,220
And because of that,

170
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:30,120
I think he really helped
our community progress.

171
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:33,390
And I'll be getting his award to him.

172
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:34,740
I'm gonna leave it up here in case people

173
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:36,480
wanna take pictures of
it later and everything,

174
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,440
you get a closer view of
what an award looks like,

175
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,608
but that's something new for DEF CON 30.

176
00:10:43,608 --> 00:10:44,910
And I really appreciate you being along

177
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:48,447
for the ride and seeing that, yeah.

178
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:51,447
(audience clapping)

179
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:57,277
Okay, so by show of hands,

180
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:02,010
how many people enjoyed
the musical interactivity

181
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:03,843
of the badges?

182
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,113
Yeah.

183
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:11,790
We've never done a musical
badge that I'm aware of.

184
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:15,750
And so that was really nice
and novel and all badges,

185
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:18,420
we wanted them to be interactive.

186
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:22,200
And so to tell us a
little bit of the story,

187
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,873
I'm gonna bring up
MKFactor, the designers,

188
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:27,390
CompukidMike,

189
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:30,390
and Mike's.

190
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:32,040
How do I say that?

191
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:36,210
Mike's wife, Twitter handles.

192
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:37,563
Come on up MKFactor.

193
00:11:42,286 --> 00:11:47,034
- Talk a little bit about
the brief about there.

194
00:11:47,034 --> 00:11:49,867
Any comments have you solved them?

195
00:11:52,421 --> 00:11:53,418
And then just tell a
little about it, Cool.

196
00:11:53,418 --> 00:11:54,543
- Hi, this is not scary, okay.

197
00:11:54,543 --> 00:11:57,540
- There's a lot of your beautiful faces.

198
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,790
Like a lot more than last year.

199
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:01,770
A lot more faces this year than last year.

200
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:03,020
It's a little terrifying.

201
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:09,360
So thank you to everyone who helped.

202
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,640
We had tons of people
helping assembled badges

203
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,110
this year and get it all ready.

204
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:18,110
Okay, so thank you to
everyone that helped us.

205
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:19,920
Yeah, we wanted a musical badge.

206
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,870
Something that would be fun
for everyone to interact

207
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:23,940
in a different way than
you normally interact

208
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:26,730
with the badge and with
your fellow attendees.

209
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:28,798
I hope you got to do that.

210
00:12:28,798 --> 00:12:32,520
We did have some crazy issues
for those of you who burned up

211
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,870
the audio amplifiers on
your badge, I am sorry.

212
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,640
We do have a work around
posted on Twitter,

213
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,230
a couple little solder jumpers.

214
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:42,123
And you can get audio working again.

215
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:45,570
Anything you wanna add?

216
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:48,690
- I hope some of you found a
new passion for some music.

217
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:50,700
Some that never tried it before.

218
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:54,393
That was my hope, now for our uber badge.

219
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:58,650
I don't think we have a picture
of it 'cause that's our bad.

220
00:12:58,650 --> 00:12:59,483
Yeah.

221
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:05,070
So it's kind of double
sided, so we have one side.

222
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:07,392
So this side is the back, technically,

223
00:13:07,392 --> 00:13:11,580
oh my goodness, words
are failing me so bad.

224
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:12,735
The jack, thank you.

225
00:13:12,735 --> 00:13:14,107
He's in there.

226
00:13:14,107 --> 00:13:17,040
And he is glow in the dark and
then we have pieces falling

227
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,380
like there's debris of
different components

228
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:21,720
of things for sugar boards.

229
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:25,953
It also lights up, that's you,
we're gonna go with you now.

230
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:32,880
- Then the backside is
picture frame for homecoming.

231
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,864
So you can put your
homecoming picture in it.

232
00:13:35,864 --> 00:13:40,350
- And then it also says we
have recorded Jeff's voice

233
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:43,530
saying DEF CON, Uber Badge.

234
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:45,801
Let's see if we can get
it to work, please work.

235
00:13:45,801 --> 00:13:46,798
(people laughing)

236
00:13:46,798 --> 00:13:49,388
- [Speaker 2] Congratulations,

237
00:13:49,388 --> 00:13:52,819
you're holding DEF CON 30 Uber Badge.

238
00:13:52,819 --> 00:13:54,769
(audience laughing)

239
00:13:54,769 --> 00:13:57,769
(audience cheering)

240
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:06,042
- So thank you everyone for
making this an awesome year.

241
00:14:06,042 --> 00:14:07,692
Thank you for putting up with us.

242
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:19,590
- Now, we're gonna talk a little bit

243
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:22,770
about what happened from a
transparency perspective.

244
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:24,180
For those of you who don't know,

245
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:28,980
we instituted a code of
conduct policy years ago,

246
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:31,020
and then a couple years later,

247
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:32,978
to try to hold ourselves accountable,

248
00:14:32,978 --> 00:14:37,080
we started publishing a
transparency report and the idea is

249
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:40,620
that we have these standards
and then we wanna show you

250
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:43,233
that we're actually
following our own standards.

251
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:46,200
So there's sort of a loop there.

252
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:49,950
It's not just one sided,
and so where is CJ?

253
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:51,633
CJ.

254
00:14:51,633 --> 00:14:52,680
CJ.

255
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:53,850
There you go, okay.

256
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:56,760
So CJ is the number one of our SOC team.

257
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:59,670
And so it is his responsibility
to deliver to you

258
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:01,953
the transparency report, CJ.

259
00:15:04,327 --> 00:15:07,327
(audience clapping)

260
00:15:11,691 --> 00:15:13,111
- It was an interesting year.

261
00:15:13,111 --> 00:15:15,960
I was here last year and it was probably

262
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:19,239
one of the most mellow
cons I've ever been to.

263
00:15:19,239 --> 00:15:21,570
And so I was expecting this
to be a bit kind of crazier

264
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:23,370
and it was in some regards,

265
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:27,000
but it was also still pretty
mellow in a lot of regards.

266
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,170
Like you walk down the corridor

267
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:30,570
and people were greeting
everyone like old friends.

268
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:33,780
That was really cool to see, that said,

269
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:35,680
there was a lot of stuff that went on.

270
00:15:36,599 --> 00:15:38,610
I'd also like to say,
the transparency report

271
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:41,649
is five years old today.

272
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:44,649
(audience cheering)

273
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,487
We had 12 calls for medical assistance.

274
00:15:51,487 --> 00:15:54,453
Most of those were alcohol related.

275
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:04,203
Not me, I can't drink this year.

276
00:16:05,701 --> 00:16:08,580
Masking was probably the
most challenging thing

277
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:10,110
we had to deal with this year.

278
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:14,550
It's pretty clear that
people are tired of masking,

279
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:17,730
but we still need to do
it to keep people safe.

280
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:20,132
So that led to a lot of friction.

281
00:16:20,132 --> 00:16:23,490
My team had to keep
reminding people to do it.

282
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:27,963
Some folks took offense
to that and pushed back.

283
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:31,890
We ended up with three badges revoked,

284
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:35,013
one individual who ended up
baned from the conference.

285
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,923
And what else was there?

286
00:16:41,194 --> 00:16:42,837
There was many requests to put masks on

287
00:16:42,837 --> 00:16:47,520
and at least nine people
decided to leave the conference

288
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,813
rather than wear a mask.

289
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:00,303
Members of the press,

290
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,543
three press badges were revoked this year.

291
00:17:04,411 --> 00:17:07,411
(audience clapping)

292
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,260
This is why we can't have nice things.

293
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,600
One member of the press was banned

294
00:17:33,741 --> 00:17:36,324
and one news outlet was banned.

295
00:17:40,739 --> 00:17:43,251
- [Speaker 3] You can say OAN.

296
00:17:43,251 --> 00:17:44,334
- It was OAN.

297
00:17:51,724 --> 00:17:56,299
- [Speaker 3] The second ever
banned, NBC was the first.

298
00:17:56,299 --> 00:17:57,780
- So just reminded me.

299
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:01,110
This was the only second news
outlet we've ever had to ban.

300
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:06,011
The first one was NBC, and
do any of you remember that?

301
00:18:06,011 --> 00:18:08,940
the Dateline are coming undercover

302
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:12,630
and having to be chased
out, that was fun times.

303
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:13,893
It's still on YouTube,

304
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:21,333
Hotline took 34 calls and 14 texts,

305
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:25,260
three paraprofessional consulting calls,

306
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:29,943
four code of conduct violations,
three calls about masks,

307
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:35,520
five accessibility concerns, and many,

308
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:39,543
many calls about hotel registration.

309
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:44,460
And I'd like to make it clear,
we cannot book you rooms,

310
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:47,493
cruises or anything else.

311
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:52,590
Code of conduct violations.

312
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:56,055
So we had a fair few of these,

313
00:18:56,055 --> 00:18:58,067
and these shows that we are.

314
00:18:58,925 --> 00:19:01,030
- [Speaker] The next slide, some numbers.

315
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:02,400
- I can't read that.

316
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:07,400
So we had a number of
violations that led to warnings.

317
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,710
We had one of her verbal harassment.

318
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:13,260
We had one for aggressive
and threatening behavior.

319
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:16,590
We had to remove two goons from staff

320
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:18,290
for violating the code of conduct.

321
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:22,170
And we had one person removed

322
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:25,173
by the venue security
for threatening behavior.

323
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:27,833
Unfortunately,

324
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,933
there was also a rise in
sexual misconduct this year,

325
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:37,400
mostly offenses like harassment,
none of this is acceptable.

326
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,840
And I wanna point out

327
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:43,590
that we have a zero tolerance policy here.

328
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:47,040
My team will find you
and we will delete you.

329
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:03,843
We had five cases of unwanted touching.

330
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:06,900
Two of the perpetrators were tracked down

331
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,760
with the assistance of hotel,

332
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:13,500
who gave us access to
CCTV and a lot of tracing.

333
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,990
They were identified and
they were permanently banned

334
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:16,990
from the conference.

335
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:30,960
A former attendee who had
assaulted another attendee

336
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,170
in a previous conference
about two years ago,

337
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:38,303
was identified before con and
was also banned permanently.

338
00:20:38,303 --> 00:20:41,303
(audience cheering)

339
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:50,160
And want to encourage
everyone to reach out to us.

340
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:54,570
Use our safety email
address, send us reports,

341
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:57,810
reports give us the power
to track these people down

342
00:20:57,810 --> 00:20:59,040
and remove them.

343
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:02,370
And we were more effective
this year because of reports

344
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:04,140
and because of quick reporting,

345
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:05,880
than we have been in any other year.

346
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,833
And I wanna see that trend continue.

347
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:19,620
One last personal favor.

348
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:23,550
I run an unofficial
check on how many people

349
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:26,580
pick up COVID during the
con, I did it last year.

350
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:28,920
So if anyone tests positive

351
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:32,070
or knows someone who tests
positive, reach out to me,

352
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:35,490
Twitter DM, whatever, you'll be anonymous.

353
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:36,540
We just want to get account

354
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:38,415
because it tells us how
well things are working

355
00:21:38,415 --> 00:21:41,043
and it helps us guide
us for the next year.

356
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,695
Thanks all.

357
00:21:43,695 --> 00:21:46,695
(audience clapping)

358
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,160
- Next up we're gonna get an overview

359
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,623
of what happened with the media.

360
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:03,153
To let us know I'm gonna introduce
Wednesday, head of press.

361
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,663
- Thanks, Jeff.

362
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:18,900
So the first thing I wanna know is my team

363
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,913
doesn't hate that reporters are here.

364
00:22:21,765 --> 00:22:25,664
And I know that a lot of you
also don't hate that reporters

365
00:22:25,664 --> 00:22:27,683
are here because your PR
teams keep calling me.

366
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:33,330
So this year we had over 70
credentialed individuals.

367
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:34,650
So those were people walking around

368
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:36,630
with the green press badges.

369
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:41,520
This is a smaller number than
we had in the before times,

370
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,350
but definitely a huge increase

371
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:47,370
from the handful of reporters
that we had last year.

372
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:49,950
And what I think is
significant to note this year

373
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:52,639
is that nearly half of these individuals

374
00:22:52,639 --> 00:22:55,710
are what we consider
non-traditional media,

375
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:59,850
meaning they're not coming
from a traditional news outlet.

376
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:03,365
So we have a lot of really
talented people in our community

377
00:23:03,365 --> 00:23:06,300
who are contributing
content through blogs,

378
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:08,580
YouTube channels, podcasts,

379
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:11,610
and all of these individuals
are welcome to request

380
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:15,120
press badges from our team and those,

381
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:18,480
and I'm really excited to see
that there is more of those

382
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:23,480
requesting badges from our
team and continuing to report

383
00:23:23,728 --> 00:23:26,910
and create content from the con

384
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:28,770
and give back directly to the community.

385
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:31,260
So if you didn't request one this year,

386
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,940
but you fall into that camp,

387
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:34,860
please consider requesting it next year.

388
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:38,370
We're actually going to start
creating some new programs

389
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:41,237
and opportunities to
give you even more access

390
00:23:41,237 --> 00:23:46,237
and behind the scenes
information and experiences,

391
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:48,510
because we love when
people from the community

392
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:51,693
are the ones that are reporting
back to the community.

393
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:54,725
- [Speaker] Mention that trend.

394
00:23:54,725 --> 00:23:57,725
(audience clapping)

395
00:24:04,428 --> 00:24:05,910
Yeah, may as well, that's interesting.

396
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:07,500
- Okay Jeff thinks this is interesting,

397
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,262
so I'm gonna share it.

398
00:24:09,262 --> 00:24:12,095
(people laughing)

399
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:15,600
So one of the things that I want to note

400
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:19,110
is it's actually been more than a decade,

401
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:24,110
even predating me since we
have deliberately invited

402
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,860
reporters to DEF CON,

403
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:28,980
I have never extended a single
invitation to a reporter

404
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:31,803
to come to DEF CON,
they just come anyways.

405
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:35,430
But in the early days of DEF CON,

406
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:39,180
when we were small and
hacking was less mainstream,

407
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:43,470
the press team did put a lot
of effort into inviting media

408
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:46,170
into the community and to help make sure

409
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:50,040
that we were really
addressing inaccuracies,

410
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,660
misperceptions and confusion

411
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:54,030
about what hacking was in general,

412
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:57,600
as well as the DEF CON
community, and over time,

413
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,990
the function of our team
has really shifted away

414
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:05,990
from proactive PR efforts and
more about issues management.

415
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:08,880
So that transparency report,

416
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,981
which I love that we're doing it.

417
00:25:10,981 --> 00:25:12,762
It creates a lot of work for my team

418
00:25:12,762 --> 00:25:16,710
because we get a lot
of questions about it.

419
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:20,040
And those are the types of
questions that we like to get

420
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:22,320
because we like to push the organization

421
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,240
to be even more transparent

422
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,180
and to share more
information with all of you.

423
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:30,150
I have been a reputation
management expert for a very,

424
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:33,870
very long time and secrets
are very expensive to keep.

425
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:37,680
So I love to see the
transparency that DEF CON

426
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:41,520
has been increasing over
the last couple years.

427
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,260
I'm thrilled that our transparency report,

428
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:45,558
as CJ said, is now five years old.

429
00:25:45,558 --> 00:25:48,480
It is really difficult
for organizations this big

430
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,350
to be that open,

431
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:50,940
and it's something that
I'm really proud of.

432
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:55,650
And I commend CJ and his team
and Dark Tangent and everyone

433
00:25:55,650 --> 00:25:58,170
for actually really pushing that forward.

434
00:25:58,170 --> 00:25:59,340
I also wanna note,

435
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:02,970
we had a special
contingency of journalists

436
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:06,690
from the Norwegian Institute
of Journalism this year.

437
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:09,330
This is particularly exciting for me

438
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:11,340
because they were invited by a member

439
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:13,620
of our community who has
been working with them

440
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:17,640
over several months,
got them all together,

441
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,800
worked with my team to get them registered

442
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,510
with the proper credentials,

443
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:25,470
and then took them around
the con and introduced them

444
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:26,940
to all the different villages

445
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:28,200
and helped them understand

446
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,720
what's happening within the community.

447
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,370
And so those are the types of things

448
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:35,100
that we're gonna try to
integrate more for next year,

449
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:39,150
so that there's more opportunity
to do education with press.

450
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:42,570
So you're not walking around
with a scarlet letter,

451
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:43,440
with their badge,

452
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,500
but are actually being
invited by the community

453
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,240
to learn about what we're doing.

454
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,420
The more hacking and
other cybersecurity issues

455
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:52,693
become more mainstream,

456
00:26:52,693 --> 00:26:55,830
just really important that
we're not just educating press,

457
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:57,690
but through educating press,

458
00:26:57,690 --> 00:27:00,000
we're actually educating consumers

459
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,890
and end users of all these technologies.

460
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:04,770
So it's important to us that we welcome

461
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:07,473
the reporters who come
and follow our rules.

462
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:09,630
As CJ mentioned,

463
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:14,630
there are a couple that they
will not be allowed back,

464
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:20,240
but we only have one rule for
the media that attend here.

465
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:22,320
And that is that they have to respect

466
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,480
to their privacy of our attendees.

467
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:28,770
That means advanced and explicit consent

468
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:32,700
before taking a photo
or video of everyone.

469
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:36,090
That's a very simple policy
to follow, in theory,

470
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:37,500
it's difficult for news outlets

471
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,700
because they like to get video

472
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:41,880
of everybody's faces, but
I'm really, really proud

473
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:45,900
and really appreciate that
most reporters have really

474
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:48,864
not just accepted and honored this,

475
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:50,670
but really adapted the way that they work

476
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:53,250
in order to demonstrate
respect for our community

477
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:56,341
and for all of you, that being said,

478
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:58,860
it is increasingly difficult for my team

479
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:00,413
to enforce that policy

480
00:28:00,413 --> 00:28:03,870
when we don't treat each
other with the same respect.

481
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:06,000
So when you are taking photos and videos

482
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,119
and sharing them online
and on social media,

483
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:11,021
please be mindful of the
fact that if you don't want

484
00:28:11,021 --> 00:28:13,725
a news outlet to do that to you,

485
00:28:13,725 --> 00:28:16,260
consider not doing it to your neighbor

486
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:18,183
and your fellow con attendees.

487
00:28:19,204 --> 00:28:22,204
(audience clapping)

488
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:31,170
And so, as CJ mentioned,

489
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:34,320
we did have a couple of
badges that were revoked.

490
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,676
We did have to ban an outlet.

491
00:28:36,676 --> 00:28:40,680
And I do wanna mention that the NBC ban

492
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,906
from a couple of years ago

493
00:28:41,906 --> 00:28:45,660
was actually because they
were filming in the casino.

494
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:48,390
I told you during the DEF CON 101 panel,

495
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:51,243
don't fuck with the hotel or the casino.

496
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:55,575
When you get escorted
out by casino security,

497
00:28:55,575 --> 00:28:59,280
there is nothing I can do
to get your badge back.

498
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:02,340
So we now have, we're up to two outlets

499
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:04,906
that are outlet wide bans,

500
00:29:04,906 --> 00:29:09,600
and then a couple folks that
couldn't follow the rules

501
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,602
and maybe next year,

502
00:29:10,602 --> 00:29:14,040
we will consider giving
them a second chance.

503
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:16,200
But before I close,

504
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:19,213
I wanna thank everyone
who is helping to educate

505
00:29:19,213 --> 00:29:22,521
their corporate PR and marketing teams

506
00:29:22,521 --> 00:29:26,580
about what DEF CON is
and what DEF CON isn't,

507
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:29,610
and how to engage with us appropriately.

508
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:33,510
I sincerely appreciate the
improvement that I have seen

509
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:36,810
in village sponsors who are participating

510
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:40,230
to support our community
instead of exploiting it.

511
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:41,630
So, thank you.

512
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:44,041
(audience clapping)

513
00:29:44,041 --> 00:29:45,958
- Well done, Riverside,

514
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:53,253
Riverside, calling on Riverside.

515
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:56,433
You better get up on stage.

516
00:29:57,508 --> 00:30:01,590
DevOps is the group that runs our Discord.

517
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:05,193
And the number one of DevOps is Riverside.

518
00:30:14,286 --> 00:30:15,287
You ready to go to the stats page.

519
00:30:15,287 --> 00:30:17,258
- All right, hey everyone, I'm Riverside.

520
00:30:17,258 --> 00:30:18,750
I'm gonna go through some of
the stats and talk a little bit

521
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:21,930
about the Discord and as well
as all the other activities

522
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:24,180
that the DevOps team's been doing.

523
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:27,990
So we've kind of grew out of a necessity

524
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:30,120
to keep the community
around the world together

525
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:33,630
and keep everything flowing
when all things were shut down

526
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:35,340
and make sure that we had a thing

527
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:37,560
and the thing just keeps growing.

528
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,853
And what we ended up
turning into was a team

529
00:30:39,853 --> 00:30:42,660
helping automate things and build things,

530
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:44,070
putting together combine boards

531
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:46,500
and writing code and
helping the backend team

532
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,300
that Copman and those folks

533
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:51,510
to make the DEF CON infrastructure better,

534
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:52,980
more stable, more smooth,

535
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:55,230
and automate as much as we possibly can.

536
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:57,750
And so these are some of the
stats that we threw together

537
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:59,940
on the Discord specifically,

538
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:01,440
but I'll talk about a couple other things.

539
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,510
So this year I'm knocking on the podium.

540
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:05,520
I mean, it's been kind of
crazy, but we had no downtime,

541
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,453
which was awesome.

542
00:31:07,789 --> 00:31:10,789
(audience clapping)

543
00:31:12,413 --> 00:31:16,140
And I noticed lots and lots
and lots of people on Discord,

544
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:18,270
during con, asking each
other where they're going,

545
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:19,800
where the parties are, what's going on.

546
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:22,923
How many of you use Discord
during the on, by raise of hand?

547
00:31:24,247 --> 00:31:25,080
- [Speaker] Whoa.

548
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,030
- Wow, that's impressive.

549
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:30,545
So it's pretty going solid.

550
00:31:30,545 --> 00:31:33,570
So this year I'm gonna
actually switch down

551
00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:34,830
to the bottom line.

552
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:38,610
We had 15,000 plus lines of code

553
00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:41,430
and because of the way
that the community works

554
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:42,870
and Discord and all the automation,

555
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:46,350
we actually changed 40% of the
entire code base this year.

556
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:49,680
So the team is not just
a weekend warrior team.

557
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:53,400
This team works year round
to try to make things happen.

558
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:56,640
And so they did over
6,000 lines of new code

559
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,817
to make things better for all of you.

560
00:31:58,817 --> 00:32:01,817
(audience clapping)

561
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:11,640
Three new bots created, we have
almost 500 Discord channels.

562
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:14,250
We still break records on the
amount of Discord channels

563
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:15,240
and a lot of other things.

564
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,580
I mean, we have insane
amounts of stuff going on.

565
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:20,970
There were 55,000 messages
sent in just core channels.

566
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:22,980
Not all the stuff between all of you.

567
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:25,980
We tax the hell out of
the things that we have,

568
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:27,233
but they're holding up.

569
00:32:27,233 --> 00:32:30,090
They've been a great partner
to us on making this happen

570
00:32:30,090 --> 00:32:31,619
and keeping the community together.

571
00:32:31,619 --> 00:32:35,248
77% of the members on the Discord

572
00:32:35,248 --> 00:32:37,050
have been there for more than a year.

573
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:40,200
So it's not just fake accounts
jumping on and doing a thing.

574
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,959
These are real people,

575
00:32:41,959 --> 00:32:42,959
part of the community

576
00:32:42,959 --> 00:32:44,100
that have been doing this and connecting.

577
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:45,960
Every weekend. I see people on there

578
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:48,270
on the chat talking and hanging out,

579
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:50,420
from around the world,
it's pretty awesome.

580
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,917
All the files sent, we do virus scans

581
00:32:53,917 --> 00:32:57,933
and all the things that happen
above and beyond the Discord.

582
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,963
So I think they're safe maybe.

583
00:33:01,947 --> 00:33:05,954
- [Speaker] Ready just the next slide.

584
00:33:05,954 --> 00:33:06,953
- Okay.

585
00:33:06,953 --> 00:33:10,110
33% of the people that were on there

586
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:12,030
were from outside of the US.

587
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:15,270
And that was the way that the
folks from outside of the US

588
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:18,360
were able to participate
this year, 33% of those.

589
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:21,540
And so all the international contestants

590
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:23,670
for the competitions were
going through Discord

591
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:25,590
and they really sent a lot of notes

592
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:27,690
thanking us for making sure that happened.

593
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:31,320
Three issues were issued,

594
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:33,600
or three warnings were
issued, no bands this year,

595
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,623
which is amazing.

596
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:40,530
Here are some stats you
guys can look at later.

597
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:45,530
And then right here, we helped
out the black badge raffle.

598
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:47,820
So if you notice getting disqualified

599
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:50,220
from the black badge raffle,
that was through there,

600
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:52,800
and then I'd like my DevOps team to stand

601
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:53,850
if you wouldn't mind.

602
00:33:56,153 --> 00:33:59,070
(people cheering)

603
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,430
The packet hatching village folks.

604
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:04,020
That spent all the time

605
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:06,330
testing all the bots
and doing all the stuff.

606
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:08,130
This is Fox over here with the red hat.

607
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:10,530
She's the second who's
been an absolute rock star

608
00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:12,240
on all this stuff.

609
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:14,690
I wanna just thank you
personally for everything.

610
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:19,473
And with that, thank you.

611
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,740
- All right.

612
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:30,090
Keeping us connected in
a brand new facility,

613
00:34:30,090 --> 00:34:31,983
with new infrastructure,

614
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:36,750
the number one Louise, come to stage.

615
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:39,600
Tell us what happened with our packets.

616
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,850
Where did our packets go?

617
00:34:46,188 --> 00:34:47,188
- The cloud.

618
00:34:49,671 --> 00:34:50,969
Hello everyone.

619
00:34:50,969 --> 00:34:55,530
My name is, I'm here with
Mac number two for the knock.

620
00:34:55,530 --> 00:34:58,456
We're gonna talk a little
bit about what happened,

621
00:34:58,456 --> 00:35:02,451
before I start and I can barely see you,

622
00:35:02,451 --> 00:35:04,751
but how many people use
the wifi network here?

623
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:07,983
Quite a lot.

624
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:12,753
How many new people, how many
people is their first DEF CON?

625
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:16,579
(audience clapping)

626
00:35:16,579 --> 00:35:18,000
That's excellent, well welcome.

627
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,113
It's about the same.

628
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:20,993
Okay.

629
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:24,540
We like this new place.

630
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:25,413
Thank you Jeff.

631
00:35:26,717 --> 00:35:27,550
- [Speaker] New place Good.

632
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:29,237
- Yes, new place good.

633
00:35:29,237 --> 00:35:32,310
And we still like, and
we like it even more

634
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:34,360
because it's so close to flavor town now.

635
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:38,400
So I'll turn it over to Mac,

636
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:42,840
Mac is gonna walk you through
what took us to get to here,

637
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:47,010
to get everything working, so Mac.

638
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:48,977
- A lot of, oh, thank you.

639
00:35:48,977 --> 00:35:53,130
A lot of teams work throughout
the year to get stuff going.

640
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:55,290
We get to be one of the
teams that gets on site

641
00:35:55,290 --> 00:35:57,840
a little bit early to get some stuff here.

642
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,130
So for the last couple months,

643
00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:00,660
we've actually been bringing up gear

644
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:05,660
to leave in the forum space to be ready,

645
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:09,420
such that it's not such
the kind of frantic scope

646
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:12,330
that we see as we get here.

647
00:36:12,330 --> 00:36:13,980
So that's been for the last few weeks

648
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:17,220
or last few months, once we get here,

649
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:18,360
there's a little bit of shoring up

650
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:21,180
what's there and then kind of go drop in.

651
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:23,970
We start on Monday and we are just running

652
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:27,240
everything that needs to be
there, we set up access points.

653
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:28,260
We do any patching.

654
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:31,203
We do last minute request
as it goes through the week.

655
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:35,250
And then kind of goes a little bit more

656
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:36,630
with more or last minute requests,

657
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:39,900
and then to be quite honest,
and don't tell Jeff this,

658
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:44,900
but we did nothing like Friday
and Saturday, which is first.

659
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,780
So yeah, so the rest of it has
been today is our tear down.

660
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:58,950
And then of course we're supporting

661
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:00,900
the trainings tomorrow and Tuesday.

662
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:03,550
And the last of our team is
out of here on Wednesday.

663
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:07,503
And that really is one of
those things where it's like,

664
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:11,838
it's still amazing that we
were able to enjoy ourselves,

665
00:37:11,838 --> 00:37:15,393
just to give you a high level layout.

666
00:37:18,810 --> 00:37:22,440
In this particular case, it
largely is a star network.

667
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,330
We come down from the internet,

668
00:37:24,330 --> 00:37:26,130
distribute to each of the sites.

669
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:29,030
The link is a little bit of a
satellite site to the forum.

670
00:37:30,139 --> 00:37:32,190
And then we just kind of put
all the edge switches down

671
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:34,443
and then access points below all of that.

672
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:38,827
Giving an idea of the scope of the gear.

673
00:37:38,827 --> 00:37:41,130
There were three
firewalls in that picture,

674
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:45,420
four distribution or core
switches, 21 edge switches,

675
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:50,420
hence, or politely known
as four Prius cargo loads

676
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:56,240
of edge switches,
someone managed switches,

677
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:59,490
cloud monitoring infrastructure,

678
00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:01,830
the wifi reg server for wifi,

679
00:38:01,830 --> 00:38:06,240
reg.DEF CON.org, support the media server.

680
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,190
And then a lot of it,

681
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:09,480
which is what a lot of people see,

682
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,190
is the Aruba infrastructure.

683
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:14,010
We used a total of four controllers

684
00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:17,523
between our gear and Encore's gear.

685
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:21,262
One of our partners here at Forum,

686
00:38:21,262 --> 00:38:24,330
we have 45 of our own access points.

687
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:25,890
And then up in the sky,

688
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:30,750
there's 318 access points,
which is, space is big.

689
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:32,343
It needs it, so.

690
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:39,450
We support everyone that
we can, even odd requests

691
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:42,750
that come in, last minute
requests, you know who you are.

692
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:45,900
We try to do everything
that we can for them.

693
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:46,830
If we can't,

694
00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:48,120
it's usually 'cause we're limited

695
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,860
by some physical capability

696
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:52,890
and even then we try
to break through them.

697
00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:56,463
So thanks to everyone who
helped out and worked with that.

698
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:59,043
And now for the victory parts.

699
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:04,770
- Thank you Mac.

700
00:39:04,770 --> 00:39:06,420
So just going through the numbers,

701
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:08,130
not gonna go through everything,

702
00:39:08,130 --> 00:39:11,610
the slides are gonna be
posted on knock.defcom.org.

703
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:15,153
You can download them in
about a week and a half,

704
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:18,810
but we use more traffic than before,

705
00:39:18,810 --> 00:39:20,580
which is expected and great.

706
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:23,670
And I put DC27 there
because that's when we had

707
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:26,913
a lot of people here, so
we used a couple more.

708
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:30,390
We transfer a couple
more terabytes of data

709
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:33,600
for you guys throughout this year.

710
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,283
What else is interesting?

711
00:39:36,223 --> 00:39:41,223
Over 8,000 different number
of devices on wireless

712
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:48,420
provided some of the
new phones and whatnot.

713
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:51,480
They do some Mac address
randomization and stuff like that.

714
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:52,980
So the number might be a little skewed,

715
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:54,240
but let's go with that.

716
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:58,533
There is no way to track that challenges.

717
00:40:00,210 --> 00:40:05,210
We had none, again, first time ever,

718
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:13,230
Other than Mac driving here, three,

719
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:16,650
four times to bring gear
and all that stuff, right?

720
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:20,100
He likes driving so whatnot, but yeah,

721
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:22,890
no major problems this
year, that was good.

722
00:40:22,890 --> 00:40:24,960
What is new that we implemented this year?

723
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:28,950
We finally have in new
ticketing system that we track

724
00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:31,533
the requests that we get
from the different teams.

725
00:40:33,090 --> 00:40:35,580
We were testing some
services to the internet,

726
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:37,200
continuous money, non monitoring,

727
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:40,320
but testing just to make
sure that all this not all,

728
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:44,640
but most of the stuff that
you all use is accessible

729
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:47,160
and also make sure that
our stuff here, DNS,

730
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:50,643
the HCP and all that good
jazz, the doesn't get broken.

731
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:57,650
One of the networking
goons installed Enzyme,

732
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:01,560
probably you guys know
that's better than I do,

733
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:02,730
to do some monitoring.

734
00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:05,370
We just did close to the
knock and we saw some stats.

735
00:41:05,370 --> 00:41:08,580
There is a slide with data
that I'm not gonna go through.

736
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:11,970
And there is an ESSID for WPA3,

737
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:16,110
but WPA three is fully
supported on Linux and Android,

738
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:18,690
but we had over 400 devices using that.

739
00:41:18,690 --> 00:41:23,690
So really cool, pictures,
pictures, pictures,

740
00:41:27,090 --> 00:41:29,700
and I want to thank the Knock team.

741
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:32,741
They put a lot of work here
and a little bit before,

742
00:41:32,741 --> 00:41:36,030
thanks to Mac for what he does.

743
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:38,250
And I wanna also thank our families

744
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:40,950
for allowing us to be here
for over a week sometime.

745
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:44,408
So round of applause for.

746
00:41:44,408 --> 00:41:47,408
(audience clapping)

747
00:41:51,690 --> 00:41:53,910
Last but not the least,
I wanna thank everybody

748
00:41:53,910 --> 00:41:58,680
who's on this slide. DT, Nikita, Janet,

749
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:01,440
all the department leads
for being super helpful

750
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:06,000
in understanding with us,
providing what we need.

751
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,951
QM, Caesars IT and Caesars SOC, Encore.

752
00:42:10,951 --> 00:42:14,313
Without them we cannot
do what we do either.

753
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:18,510
And all the goons here,
they're super helpful with us.

754
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:21,240
They try to help when
anyone has any questions

755
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,130
about anything, they try to help

756
00:42:23,130 --> 00:42:26,407
before coming talk to us
or their department leads

757
00:42:26,407 --> 00:42:30,033
and guy, thank you.

758
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:40,860
- So by show of hands,

759
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:44,430
how many people stayed
within the hotel block?

760
00:42:44,430 --> 00:42:46,893
All the hotels that we tried to promote.

761
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:52,923
Of those people, who watched
DEF CON TV in your TV?

762
00:42:54,090 --> 00:42:57,330
Awesome, the people that
bring you all the streaming,

763
00:42:57,330 --> 00:43:00,720
both on the interwebs
and in your hotel room,

764
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:05,720
the DCTV network, getting
up so you don't have to,

765
00:43:08,130 --> 00:43:11,580
video man number one, come on up.

766
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:13,173
Tell us what happened.

767
00:43:13,173 --> 00:43:16,173
(audience clapping)

768
00:43:21,270 --> 00:43:23,043
- And Morgan, number two.

769
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:26,343
Thanks Jeff.

770
00:43:27,317 --> 00:43:28,830
All right.

771
00:43:28,830 --> 00:43:32,520
So how many people
actually watched on Twitch,

772
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:33,510
show of hands?

773
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:34,803
A few people, okay.

774
00:43:35,730 --> 00:43:38,220
Well basically our
infrastructure is pretty big.

775
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:41,250
We also get here the Sunday before

776
00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:44,400
and we deploy out to the
seven different properties.

777
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:47,163
We deploy to 28 different
channels in the hotels,

778
00:43:48,810 --> 00:43:52,803
20,000 hotel rooms, which
I guess is significant.

779
00:43:53,910 --> 00:43:56,070
So if you wanna watch
the talks in your room

780
00:43:56,070 --> 00:43:57,920
and not have to worry about internet,

781
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,090
book in one of those hotels,

782
00:44:00,090 --> 00:44:01,490
that would be my suggestion.

783
00:44:02,490 --> 00:44:05,722
We also have six Twitch
channels that we put out

784
00:44:05,722 --> 00:44:09,483
live channels on every
year now going forward,

785
00:44:11,790 --> 00:44:15,120
we also did a stream for DEF CON China,

786
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:18,410
'cause none of the folks from
China could actually come

787
00:44:18,410 --> 00:44:20,670
to our event, which kind of sucks.

788
00:44:20,670 --> 00:44:23,443
And then we also have new to this year,

789
00:44:23,443 --> 00:44:26,040
a 360 camera in this room.

790
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:31,040
That's actually blinded off
'cause we have privacy concerns.

791
00:44:33,901 --> 00:44:35,325
So it's like a 180, yeah.

792
00:44:35,325 --> 00:44:36,576
So it's like a 180.

793
00:44:36,576 --> 00:44:37,409
We tried to find a 180 camera.

794
00:44:37,409 --> 00:44:38,580
We could not find a 180 camera.

795
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:42,990
They're all like 96 degrees
or 60 degrees, anyway.

796
00:44:42,990 --> 00:44:44,220
So we have a 360 camera.

797
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:45,896
We had it set up in black and white ball

798
00:44:45,896 --> 00:44:49,620
where the lights are low.

799
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:53,550
It's up high, it's dark,
people are wearing masks.

800
00:44:53,550 --> 00:44:56,050
You're not gonna see
people's faces at that point.

801
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:03,080
For our Twitch stats, we
had 26,000 unique viewers,

802
00:45:03,810 --> 00:45:05,463
which is pretty good, right?

803
00:45:06,750 --> 00:45:10,170
We have 15,000 followers
between all of our channels

804
00:45:10,170 --> 00:45:11,490
and apparently Hacker Jeopardy

805
00:45:11,490 --> 00:45:13,053
was the most popular program.

806
00:45:14,197 --> 00:45:17,197
(audience cheering)

807
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:26,032
422 people at one time, which
was a pretty good number

808
00:45:26,032 --> 00:45:29,403
for all of our streams for that week.

809
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:38,280
- So we have a number of
volunteers, we have, myself,

810
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:41,160
but also sandwich, skw33k,

811
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:46,160
Ghost Pepper, Eagle1 and RobbinBS.

812
00:45:47,550 --> 00:45:48,947
- Yeah.

813
00:45:48,947 --> 00:45:50,310
So without all of these
volunteers being here

814
00:45:50,310 --> 00:45:52,419
this whole week, this wouldn't happen.

815
00:45:52,419 --> 00:45:56,130
It's a huge team effort
to deploy this hardware

816
00:45:56,130 --> 00:45:57,660
into all the head ends,

817
00:45:57,660 --> 00:45:59,520
get all the infrastructure up and running.

818
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:02,460
We also have a couple of streaming servers

819
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:04,140
that we set up and
support on the back end.

820
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:06,210
We have the website on the front end.

821
00:46:06,210 --> 00:46:08,043
I mean it's a whole effort.

822
00:46:09,090 --> 00:46:10,050
Oh gosh, yeah, yeah.

823
00:46:10,050 --> 00:46:11,922
Supply chain getting the gear.

824
00:46:11,922 --> 00:46:15,120
This has been a heck of
a year to get anything.

825
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:18,060
I tried to get switches
multiple times this year.

826
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:20,070
I finally got two.

827
00:46:20,070 --> 00:46:21,840
I don't know if anybody
else is having this problem,

828
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:23,343
but it's a pain in the butt.

829
00:46:24,510 --> 00:46:26,640
And then we actually were able

830
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:30,000
to order the 360 cam, which was amazing.

831
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,036
But I think that's 'cause
they're not in demand

832
00:46:32,036 --> 00:46:34,863
and they're so expensive, right?

833
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:39,420
Shout outs to the DEF CON knock.

834
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:41,100
'Cuase if we didn't have a knock,

835
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:42,420
there would be no network for us

836
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:43,820
to stream this stuff to you.

837
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:48,680
(audience clapping)

838
00:46:50,670 --> 00:46:55,670
shout out to Caesar's
IT, Phil and his crew,

839
00:46:56,490 --> 00:46:59,670
Harry got us into all
the property head ends.

840
00:46:59,670 --> 00:47:02,340
Without them, I don't
know that we would've had

841
00:47:02,340 --> 00:47:03,690
anything up on Friday.

842
00:47:03,690 --> 00:47:06,363
So thanks to them.

843
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:13,093
And also shout out to QM.

844
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:15,420
I forgot to put him on the slide,

845
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:18,480
but QM stores a pallet of our
gear at the end of the year

846
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:21,600
and gets it to us on time on
Sunday so that we can set up

847
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:24,830
and get going on Monday
morning and we did our best.

848
00:47:28,170 --> 00:47:29,763
So thank you very much.

849
00:47:37,890 --> 00:47:39,276
- Okay.

850
00:47:39,276 --> 00:47:42,480
So trying to coordinate all
this is like herding cats

851
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,975
and we have so many channels

852
00:47:44,975 --> 00:47:48,453
and different ways to
push out the information.

853
00:47:49,830 --> 00:47:51,480
And just from the DEF CON side,

854
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:54,690
there's independent groups
that on their own effort,

855
00:47:54,690 --> 00:47:57,030
try to aggregate all the data,

856
00:47:57,030 --> 00:47:59,970
all the things that are
happening, the villages,

857
00:47:59,970 --> 00:48:01,440
the contests and events,

858
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,750
they're constantly making
changes to their schedule.

859
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:06,480
And we're trying to update
that to coordinate it all

860
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:09,090
and try to have a single point of contact

861
00:48:09,090 --> 00:48:12,480
for when things change is the info booth.

862
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:15,063
So Info Booth, come on down.

863
00:48:28,547 --> 00:48:30,000
- Hello, I'm Little Bruiser.

864
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,760
I'm the department head of Info Booth.

865
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:35,580
How many people came and
visited one of our locations

866
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:38,828
at least once and did not
ask where the restroom is?

867
00:48:38,828 --> 00:48:41,310
(audience laughing)

868
00:48:41,310 --> 00:48:44,220
'Cause this year I think is the first year

869
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:46,380
where that wasn't the number one question.

870
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:49,380
The number one question was
where do we get our tickets,

871
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:50,880
where's registration?

872
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:52,593
So that's a new one for us.

873
00:48:55,470 --> 00:48:59,190
So with that, I would like to thank DT.

874
00:48:59,190 --> 00:49:01,650
Janet, Nikita, Will, Neil,

875
00:49:01,650 --> 00:49:04,380
the rest of the HQ staff
because without you guys,

876
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:06,240
we wouldn't be here and
we really appreciate you.

877
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:07,073
So thank you.

878
00:49:08,248 --> 00:49:11,248
(audience clapping)

879
00:49:15,450 --> 00:49:17,340
I'd also like to thank all my info goons,

880
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:19,800
'cause this year we ran thin,

881
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:22,020
we really needed more people on our team,

882
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:23,190
but we made it happen.

883
00:49:23,190 --> 00:49:26,133
So thank you guys, appreciate you all.

884
00:49:32,550 --> 00:49:35,013
How many of you use
the hacker tracker app?

885
00:49:37,837 --> 00:49:39,000
- Oh, that's everybody.

886
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,930
- Right here's our team lead Lock, advice

887
00:49:42,930 --> 00:49:44,220
and null value.

888
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:45,660
And I'm gonna turn it over to Lock,

889
00:49:45,660 --> 00:49:47,580
to share some stats with you.

890
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:49,050
- So yeah, I'm the team lead.

891
00:49:49,050 --> 00:49:52,282
I do the iOS version, advice
does the Android version

892
00:49:52,282 --> 00:49:56,759
and a new value does
all the data wrangling.

893
00:49:56,759 --> 00:49:59,370
So if you like the app, tell me,

894
00:49:59,370 --> 00:50:02,490
if you don't like it,
tell advice, but please,

895
00:50:02,490 --> 00:50:04,380
please be nice to a null value

896
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:07,413
because he's the reason
that it all comes together.

897
00:50:10,410 --> 00:50:14,640
Yeah, so much work that goes into this.

898
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:17,070
There was just over 1000 total events

899
00:50:17,070 --> 00:50:19,024
with 871 speakers across all the villages

900
00:50:19,024 --> 00:50:21,570
and talks that were official,

901
00:50:21,570 --> 00:50:25,290
126 major changes within the last week

902
00:50:25,290 --> 00:50:27,810
leading up to the con and during the con,

903
00:50:27,810 --> 00:50:31,350
we had a peak of about 17,000
daily users on Saturday,

904
00:50:31,350 --> 00:50:36,030
average, about 12,000 a
day and 12K app installs.

905
00:50:36,030 --> 00:50:38,760
This was the year that
iOS overtook Android.

906
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:40,560
So yay for iOS.

907
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:41,793
We've done that as,

908
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:48,360
only by about 400 installs,

909
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:49,316
but we're gonna keep that up.

910
00:50:49,316 --> 00:50:54,316
450 million data reads
out of the app itself,

911
00:50:54,390 --> 00:50:59,220
of which there was about
480,000 bookmarked events.

912
00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:02,370
So thank you all for installing it.

913
00:51:02,370 --> 00:51:03,420
We're trying to make it better.

914
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:06,690
So feedback or hackertracker@DEF CON.org,

915
00:51:06,690 --> 00:51:09,060
if you have anything that you
would like to see in the app,

916
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:10,650
we want to know, we wanna make it better.

917
00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:12,393
It's for you, thank you.

918
00:51:16,331 --> 00:51:17,843
- With that we'll turn
it back over to you.

919
00:51:25,222 --> 00:51:26,225
- Okay.

920
00:51:26,225 --> 00:51:27,570
So speakers, speaker control,

921
00:51:27,570 --> 00:51:31,440
the core content of DEF CON
has always been our speakers

922
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:33,630
and as DEF CON evolved over the years,

923
00:51:33,630 --> 00:51:36,300
villages, contests and events grew,

924
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:38,726
but we spend an inordinate amount of time

925
00:51:38,726 --> 00:51:42,450
reviewing call for papers.

926
00:51:42,450 --> 00:51:43,770
We're one of the first conferences

927
00:51:43,770 --> 00:51:45,990
that I know of in the hacking space

928
00:51:45,990 --> 00:51:48,505
where if you were rejected as a speaker

929
00:51:48,505 --> 00:51:52,743
and you ask for feedback,
we give you the feedback.

930
00:51:53,730 --> 00:51:54,990
You might not like the feedback,

931
00:51:54,990 --> 00:51:58,113
but we try to constructively
give the feedback.

932
00:52:03,150 --> 00:52:04,770
This takes a lot of time

933
00:52:04,770 --> 00:52:06,780
from the speaking coordination team,

934
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:09,120
but it's interesting on Twitter,

935
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:11,880
you see people who are very depressed

936
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:13,590
that they were not selected,

937
00:52:13,590 --> 00:52:15,090
and then they say, but you know what?

938
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:17,713
The feedback was actually more valuable.

939
00:52:17,713 --> 00:52:20,584
So if you're involved in
a CFP program somewhere,

940
00:52:20,584 --> 00:52:23,760
really consider trying
to provide that feedback,

941
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:25,230
'cause it's one of the only ways

942
00:52:25,230 --> 00:52:27,480
the speakers can evolve and grow.

943
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:31,062
So that said, I'd like to introduce PW,

944
00:52:31,062 --> 00:52:35,185
head of the CFP speaker control.

945
00:52:35,185 --> 00:52:38,185
(audience clapping)

946
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:43,380
- Yeah, I am not PW crack.

947
00:52:43,380 --> 00:52:48,380
I am pasty. I'm giving the
speaker operations slides today.

948
00:52:48,630 --> 00:52:52,680
So hello DEF CON, in DEF CON 26,

949
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:57,060
we started collecting qualitative
metrics about the talks

950
00:52:57,060 --> 00:52:59,100
that were given on all of our main stages.

951
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:03,000
These were very simple metrics,
I think we have five or six.

952
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,250
There were all rated on
a scale of one to five.

953
00:53:05,250 --> 00:53:07,050
There was no comments
or anything like that.

954
00:53:07,050 --> 00:53:09,540
It was just a simple set of metrics

955
00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:12,720
to see how the speakers are doing.

956
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:14,340
If there was any technical difficulties,

957
00:53:14,340 --> 00:53:17,536
which there had been
quite a few in the past

958
00:53:17,536 --> 00:53:22,536
and we're in a new space this year.

959
00:53:25,350 --> 00:53:28,530
Historically whenever we got
to a new Caesar property,

960
00:53:28,530 --> 00:53:31,440
there was a learning experience
between speaker operations

961
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:33,390
and the local staff.

962
00:53:33,390 --> 00:53:37,080
There was weird issues with
the stages and stuff like that.

963
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:39,240
This is the first time
we've had a transition

964
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:42,390
to a new space where there was no issues.

965
00:53:42,390 --> 00:53:44,010
There was no technical issues.

966
00:53:44,010 --> 00:53:45,944
This is also the first time
that we actually didn't lose

967
00:53:45,944 --> 00:53:48,720
any time due to technical difficulties.

968
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:52,770
The only time that we actually
lost was because DT here

969
00:53:52,770 --> 00:53:56,070
was double booked for one of the tracks.

970
00:53:56,070 --> 00:53:58,020
So he couldn't do both at the same time.

971
00:53:58,020 --> 00:54:00,570
He had to jump between the
two and give the intros.

972
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:04,650
So we lost about 15 minutes
total and it was not something

973
00:54:04,650 --> 00:54:06,300
that we could have accounted for.

974
00:54:08,460 --> 00:54:11,430
A few more quick stats that I'd
like to explicitly call out.

975
00:54:11,430 --> 00:54:14,970
71% of our speakers this year
were brand new to DEF CON.

976
00:54:14,970 --> 00:54:16,470
They were first time speakers.

977
00:54:23,490 --> 00:54:28,490
So of all of our talks
that we gave 95 or 94%,

978
00:54:29,910 --> 00:54:33,720
sorry had a internal
rating of four or five.

979
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:35,790
Four is already exceeding expectations.

980
00:54:35,790 --> 00:54:38,430
Five is they went way above and beyond.

981
00:54:38,430 --> 00:54:41,580
So 94%, according to our internal metrics,

982
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:43,650
were just fantastic talks.

983
00:54:43,650 --> 00:54:46,260
They met all the requirements,
they asked everything that,

984
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:49,375
or they gave everything that
they gave in their abstract

985
00:54:49,375 --> 00:54:51,483
and a little bit beyond every talks,

986
00:54:52,867 --> 00:54:54,263
every talk successfully
delivered their abstract.

987
00:54:55,770 --> 00:55:00,540
So I wanna especially call
out that the CFP board

988
00:55:00,540 --> 00:55:02,460
did a fantastic job in selecting

989
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:05,483
our speakers and with the
number of new speakers,

990
00:55:05,483 --> 00:55:07,320
I want to encourage you all,

991
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:10,173
if you have a great talk idea, submit it.

992
00:55:10,173 --> 00:55:13,440
You will get that
feedback like DT mentions.

993
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:17,280
And at the very least at
the very least, and if not,

994
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:19,710
then you'll get the
feedback to improve yourself

995
00:55:19,710 --> 00:55:21,600
and become an interesting speaker

996
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:24,050
and maybe eventually join
our alumni of speakers.

997
00:55:27,870 --> 00:55:30,691
I'd like to do a quick thank you.

998
00:55:30,691 --> 00:55:33,990
We can't do what we do
in speaker operations

999
00:55:33,990 --> 00:55:36,810
without the, they control the room.

1000
00:55:36,810 --> 00:55:38,490
We control the stage.

1001
00:55:38,490 --> 00:55:40,710
They make sure that you guys
are getting in and out on time,

1002
00:55:40,710 --> 00:55:42,450
that you guys have seats.

1003
00:55:42,450 --> 00:55:44,460
They're very important to how we operate

1004
00:55:44,460 --> 00:55:46,680
and they've done a
fantastic job this year.

1005
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:50,970
I'd also like to thank Encore,
our conference AV team.

1006
00:55:50,970 --> 00:55:53,560
And of course, all of speaker operations,

1007
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:56,730
they do a fantastic job,
they always crush it.

1008
00:55:56,730 --> 00:55:58,584
They show up early every morning,

1009
00:55:58,584 --> 00:56:01,470
they deal with my weird requests

1010
00:56:01,470 --> 00:56:04,653
and they just crush it every year.

1011
00:56:05,550 --> 00:56:07,061
So thank you DEF CON.

1012
00:56:07,061 --> 00:56:09,000
Thank you speaker operations.

1013
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,483
Thank you knock and thank you Encore.

1014
00:56:11,483 --> 00:56:14,483
(audience clapping)

1015
00:56:22,110 --> 00:56:24,353
- Grifter, you're gonna
just have to keep waiting.

1016
00:56:25,452 --> 00:56:26,430
Okay.

1017
00:56:26,430 --> 00:56:27,900
Let's talk about workshops.

1018
00:56:27,900 --> 00:56:32,057
We dedicated one whole hotel
property to just workshops

1019
00:56:32,057 --> 00:56:35,730
and the idea there was,
if you're doing workshops,

1020
00:56:35,730 --> 00:56:36,870
you go to one place.

1021
00:56:36,870 --> 00:56:38,250
We don't split it amongst.

1022
00:56:38,250 --> 00:56:40,620
And so the capacity,
the number of workshops

1023
00:56:40,620 --> 00:56:42,180
that we could hold was based

1024
00:56:42,180 --> 00:56:44,400
on the physical space of the hotel.

1025
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:48,363
So, let's bring up head of workshops.

1026
00:56:50,730 --> 00:56:52,623
Megan, Megan.

1027
00:56:54,689 --> 00:56:57,275
- I changed my handle and
it's like, what do I call, oh.

1028
00:56:57,275 --> 00:56:59,010
- What do I call you?

1029
00:56:59,010 --> 00:57:02,010
- Hi, everyone, who was able
to attend a workshop this year?

1030
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:06,480
How many of you attempted to sign up

1031
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:07,923
for a workshop this year?

1032
00:57:10,590 --> 00:57:13,530
So this year we had
three days of workshops

1033
00:57:13,530 --> 00:57:16,080
between Thursday, Friday, and Saturday.

1034
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:20,651
And we sold 2330 seats

1035
00:57:20,651 --> 00:57:24,273
out in 24 minutes or 24 hours sorry.

1036
00:57:25,170 --> 00:57:26,250
Oh, so yeah,

1037
00:57:26,250 --> 00:57:29,669
we do an event right presale every year,

1038
00:57:29,669 --> 00:57:32,400
right after the 4th of
July holiday in the US.

1039
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:35,040
So that way we can, first of all,

1040
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:37,770
gauge interest in a specific topic,

1041
00:57:37,770 --> 00:57:40,410
as well as try to control
the number of folks

1042
00:57:40,410 --> 00:57:41,880
who actually show up.

1043
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:45,210
So if we didn't do pre-reg,

1044
00:57:45,210 --> 00:57:48,384
we've had instances
where we started getting

1045
00:57:48,384 --> 00:57:52,260
sideway glances from the fire marshal,

1046
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:55,830
because there was such a great
interest in these workshops.

1047
00:57:55,830 --> 00:57:57,840
So this year we had 28 workshops

1048
00:57:57,840 --> 00:58:01,140
compared to 20 workshops last year.

1049
00:58:01,140 --> 00:58:03,300
And a lot of these workshop instructors

1050
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:04,953
were brand new instructors.

1051
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:07,830
Our workshops are four hours in length.

1052
00:58:07,830 --> 00:58:10,050
So that can be really
intimidating for a lot of folks

1053
00:58:10,050 --> 00:58:13,230
who have never taught
a class for that long,

1054
00:58:13,230 --> 00:58:15,330
but they did great, we had no issues.

1055
00:58:15,330 --> 00:58:18,480
The attendees were really
interested and engaged.

1056
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:21,660
Most of our classes stayed
full the entire time.

1057
00:58:21,660 --> 00:58:25,740
So if you have any interest
in giving a workshop,

1058
00:58:25,740 --> 00:58:29,550
we open up our CFP the same
time as the main stage.

1059
00:58:29,550 --> 00:58:33,240
And we try to give you guys
as much feedback as possible.

1060
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:36,390
If it gets rejected, what
you guys can do better,

1061
00:58:36,390 --> 00:58:38,820
where you might want to
submit it in the villages.

1062
00:58:38,820 --> 00:58:40,770
And we try to share content that way.

1063
00:58:40,770 --> 00:58:44,583
So please share as much
information as possible.

1064
00:58:48,270 --> 00:58:49,500
We don't have trend data yet.

1065
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:51,930
So for everyone who did attend a workshop,

1066
00:58:51,930 --> 00:58:54,600
we did send out a Google form link.

1067
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:56,520
So that way you could
provide us with information

1068
00:58:56,520 --> 00:58:58,530
about what you thought of the instruction,

1069
00:58:58,530 --> 00:58:59,880
what you thought of the goons.

1070
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:01,680
So that way we can incorporate that

1071
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:04,680
with the CFP review
process, with the board,

1072
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:08,700
as well as improve the
experience for you all as well.

1073
00:59:08,700 --> 00:59:12,150
So please do not hesitate
to give us feedback.

1074
00:59:12,150 --> 00:59:15,570
You can also just email
workshops@DEF CON.org,

1075
00:59:15,570 --> 00:59:19,140
and we would be more than
happy to receive any feedback

1076
00:59:19,140 --> 00:59:22,599
or questions that you
have for us, thank you.

1077
00:59:22,599 --> 00:59:25,599
(audience clapping)

1078
00:59:32,190 --> 00:59:34,262
- I see this next slide
coming up, training,

1079
00:59:34,262 --> 00:59:38,040
while not technically a DEF CON event,

1080
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:39,900
we're trying something new this year.

1081
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:43,710
It's a more commercial paid
training Monday and Tuesday.

1082
00:59:43,710 --> 00:59:46,490
So some of you are gonna give it a go.

1083
00:59:46,490 --> 00:59:51,120
And so the idea here
is that from workshops,

1084
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:51,953
there were some people

1085
00:59:51,953 --> 00:59:54,450
that just wanted more in depth training.

1086
00:59:54,450 --> 00:59:55,590
They didn't want four hours.

1087
00:59:55,590 --> 01:00:00,570
They wanted eight or 16
hours and this is something

1088
01:00:00,570 --> 01:00:02,400
we've never done, it's been 30 years.

1089
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:04,943
We've never done
trainings, paid trainings.

1090
01:00:04,943 --> 01:00:06,710
And we looked around and in fact,

1091
01:00:06,710 --> 01:00:08,820
everybody's doing trainings.

1092
01:00:08,820 --> 01:00:10,488
Why aren't we doing trainings?

1093
01:00:10,488 --> 01:00:11,763
So we're gonna try it.

1094
01:00:12,656 --> 01:00:14,888
We're trying it on Monday and
Tuesday, see what happens.

1095
01:00:14,888 --> 01:00:18,180
And so I just want to call
this out because workshops

1096
01:00:18,180 --> 01:00:20,640
are not trainings and
trainings are not workshops.

1097
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:23,520
So just different, and this
is a new thing we're doing.

1098
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:24,870
So to prevent confusion,

1099
01:00:24,870 --> 01:00:25,920
I just wanted to call that out.

1100
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:30,832
Now Rock and the Beats is
arts and entertainment.

1101
01:00:30,832 --> 01:00:33,060
And if you saw this new space,

1102
01:00:33,060 --> 01:00:36,120
they worked really hard to try to create

1103
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:37,830
a more immersive sort of environment

1104
01:00:37,830 --> 01:00:39,900
so you know you're at DEF CON.

1105
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:41,340
So by show of hands,

1106
01:00:41,340 --> 01:00:43,470
who either listened to Soma FM,

1107
01:00:43,470 --> 01:00:45,090
went to the black and white balls

1108
01:00:45,090 --> 01:00:50,024
or who just enjoyed the energy
of the music we produced?

1109
01:00:50,024 --> 01:00:51,690
(audience cheering)

1110
01:00:51,690 --> 01:00:53,310
Right on.

1111
01:00:53,310 --> 01:00:58,310
Yeah, so the number one of arts
and entertainment, Chris AM,

1112
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:01,410
unfortunately could not be here.

1113
01:01:01,410 --> 01:01:04,860
So number two is taking over and I'm told

1114
01:01:04,860 --> 01:01:07,713
it's either DJ Dead or Clink, okay.

1115
01:01:16,020 --> 01:01:19,623
- Hi, move that mic check, one, two,

1116
01:01:21,375 --> 01:01:24,990
my name's Andy also known as Zekes.

1117
01:01:24,990 --> 01:01:28,932
I'm a 22 year veteran, 22 years.

1118
01:01:28,932 --> 01:01:29,873
It's been a long time, man.

1119
01:01:31,290 --> 01:01:32,130
Let's see.

1120
01:01:32,130 --> 01:01:35,290
I'm the technical director
for arts entertainment

1121
01:01:36,690 --> 01:01:40,470
and I'm currently the lead

1122
01:01:40,470 --> 01:01:42,783
for our department and Chris's absence.

1123
01:01:43,890 --> 01:01:48,890
See the department, we're
a pretty tight group.

1124
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:53,900
And yeah, we went through a lot this year.

1125
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:59,700
We had over seven crates of new stuff

1126
01:01:59,700 --> 01:02:02,973
that came in and that was a nightmare.

1127
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:06,270
We showed up Monday morning

1128
01:02:06,270 --> 01:02:10,830
and it was intense with Chris's absence.

1129
01:02:10,830 --> 01:02:12,240
I took control.

1130
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:15,300
We got through all that gear
and we got it out to you guys.

1131
01:02:15,300 --> 01:02:17,433
And man, that was tough.

1132
01:02:18,543 --> 01:02:20,253
Thank you.

1133
01:02:25,785 --> 01:02:29,130
We also booked a new
group, the Tyco Group,

1134
01:02:29,130 --> 01:02:30,870
which was really cool.

1135
01:02:30,870 --> 01:02:34,470
They were an amazing group of Tyco players

1136
01:02:34,470 --> 01:02:37,503
while away from the far
world of Los Angeles.

1137
01:02:38,370 --> 01:02:41,400
And they were fantastic to work with,

1138
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:46,110
a funny story with them
though, when we booked them,

1139
01:02:46,110 --> 01:02:47,610
we were trying to figure out a way

1140
01:02:47,610 --> 01:02:50,610
to test the structural
integrity of this building.

1141
01:02:50,610 --> 01:02:54,450
'Cause, excuse me,

1142
01:02:54,450 --> 01:02:56,779
those that remembered DEF CON 29,

1143
01:02:56,779 --> 01:03:00,450
was playing, hi, where are you?

1144
01:03:00,450 --> 01:03:03,483
Stand up, stand up, there you are.

1145
01:03:06,030 --> 01:03:08,370
When she was playing,

1146
01:03:08,370 --> 01:03:10,140
she literally brought the ceiling down.

1147
01:03:10,140 --> 01:03:14,370
So we were discussing
how we were going to see

1148
01:03:14,370 --> 01:03:16,770
if these chandelier were gonna fall.

1149
01:03:16,770 --> 01:03:20,310
And so we were trying to figure
out, oh, do we play metal?

1150
01:03:20,310 --> 01:03:22,860
Do we play, what do we play?

1151
01:03:22,860 --> 01:03:24,930
Bass, house, more drum bass.

1152
01:03:24,930 --> 01:03:27,150
We just get nothing but
drum bass out there.

1153
01:03:27,150 --> 01:03:30,120
No, we figured why don't
we do something cultural?

1154
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:32,460
And we figured out that the Tyco Group

1155
01:03:32,460 --> 01:03:34,740
would've been a great,
just giant ass drums.

1156
01:03:34,740 --> 01:03:36,990
Just, it'd be awesome.

1157
01:03:36,990 --> 01:03:40,110
So we booked them and that was amazing.

1158
01:03:40,110 --> 01:03:42,000
And my phone's gonna
die, that's wonderful.

1159
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,400
Well, fuck it, I'll wing it.

1160
01:03:46,380 --> 01:03:48,243
Yeah, fuck it, fuck it.

1161
01:03:51,035 --> 01:03:52,038
- [Speaker] Don't forget the music CD.

1162
01:03:52,038 --> 01:03:55,755
- Yes, we have the original soundtrack.

1163
01:03:55,755 --> 01:03:59,130
Dead, where are you, are you here?

1164
01:03:59,130 --> 01:04:00,030
That's DJ Dead.

1165
01:04:00,030 --> 01:04:04,087
He did your original
soundtrack, props to him.

1166
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:06,300
- [Speaker] Listen to the soundtrack.

1167
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:09,480
- How many people have
listened to the soundtrack

1168
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:10,313
or downloaded it?

1169
01:04:10,313 --> 01:04:11,440
We got a lot out there?

1170
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:15,330
Oh man, everybody else,
seriously download it.

1171
01:04:15,330 --> 01:04:16,565
It's the bomb.

1172
01:04:16,565 --> 01:04:18,363
I'm constantly listening to it.

1173
01:04:19,590 --> 01:04:21,483
Let's see, what else do we have?

1174
01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:23,640
- [Speaker] Media DEF CON.org.

1175
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:26,390
- We have media DEF CON.org.

1176
01:04:26,390 --> 01:04:31,390
We also have our own channel,
which is DEF CONmusic.org,

1177
01:04:32,220 --> 01:04:34,920
which is where you can see
the latest info that we had.

1178
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:37,830
We were having a real hard
time with getting our tweets

1179
01:04:37,830 --> 01:04:39,829
and whatnot out to you guys.

1180
01:04:39,829 --> 01:04:40,830
So we decided, you know what?

1181
01:04:40,830 --> 01:04:42,180
Let's just start our own website

1182
01:04:42,180 --> 01:04:47,100
and bring all that information
together for you guys.

1183
01:04:47,100 --> 01:04:50,220
Let's see, oh, thank
you, my phone came back.

1184
01:04:50,220 --> 01:04:51,053
Yay.

1185
01:04:53,940 --> 01:04:54,810
Oh, one story.

1186
01:04:54,810 --> 01:04:55,860
One story that was really cool.

1187
01:04:55,860 --> 01:04:57,180
That just kind of brings together

1188
01:04:57,180 --> 01:04:59,823
the whole community that I want to share.

1189
01:05:00,990 --> 01:05:04,050
I was cleaning up the
party that was at the top

1190
01:05:04,050 --> 01:05:05,940
of the escalators the other night.

1191
01:05:05,940 --> 01:05:08,460
And it was just me, middle
of the fucking night,

1192
01:05:08,460 --> 01:05:11,160
'cause that's when us
entertainment people work,

1193
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:13,710
and loading all the stuff up.

1194
01:05:13,710 --> 01:05:17,892
And I see a laptop and
this laptop is sitting

1195
01:05:17,892 --> 01:05:22,892
right next to these plants,
plugged in like, oh man,

1196
01:05:23,613 --> 01:05:25,350
somebody left their laptop, this sucks.

1197
01:05:25,350 --> 01:05:27,450
So I grab a laptop, take it in.

1198
01:05:27,450 --> 01:05:28,283
Since I'm a goon,

1199
01:05:28,283 --> 01:05:29,790
I kind of keep it with
me in my possession.

1200
01:05:29,790 --> 01:05:31,230
Put it in my lockup.

1201
01:05:31,230 --> 01:05:33,575
I go back down the next
morning to the chill out.

1202
01:05:33,575 --> 01:05:37,200
And there's this guy in
a panic, absolute panic.

1203
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:38,820
Oh my God, where the hell's my laptop?

1204
01:05:38,820 --> 01:05:40,260
Where's my laptop?

1205
01:05:40,260 --> 01:05:44,730
And he approaches me, says,
hey, I'm missing a laptop.

1206
01:05:44,730 --> 01:05:46,530
I grill him on it first off.

1207
01:05:46,530 --> 01:05:48,210
I'm like, what does it look like?

1208
01:05:48,210 --> 01:05:49,410
What kind of stickers on it?

1209
01:05:49,410 --> 01:05:52,233
'Cause it's DEF CON, you
have stickers on your laptop.

1210
01:05:53,340 --> 01:05:56,183
And then finally, can you get into this

1211
01:05:56,183 --> 01:05:59,073
and legit show me that this is your,

1212
01:06:00,104 --> 01:06:02,010
put your passcode in there
and tell me that it's yours

1213
01:06:02,010 --> 01:06:03,450
and sure enough, he did all that.

1214
01:06:03,450 --> 01:06:06,900
And it was really cool,
he got his laptop back.

1215
01:06:06,900 --> 01:06:10,680
Kind of a dull story,
but it got me thinking,

1216
01:06:10,680 --> 01:06:13,500
none of you assholes took that laptop.

1217
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:17,370
None of you assholes cracked that laptop.

1218
01:06:17,370 --> 01:06:20,130
You guys deserve a round
applause for yourself

1219
01:06:20,130 --> 01:06:22,293
for not taking somebody else's property.

1220
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:28,620
That thing, that laptop
sat there for hours.

1221
01:06:28,620 --> 01:06:32,100
So Jonathan, if you're in here, at all,

1222
01:06:32,100 --> 01:06:33,874
or you're watching me on TV,

1223
01:06:33,874 --> 01:06:36,630
don't leave your shit around DEF CON

1224
01:06:36,630 --> 01:06:38,043
'cause somebody may take it.

1225
01:06:40,641 --> 01:06:43,933
And of course just want to
thank everybody in the crew.

1226
01:06:45,163 --> 01:06:49,558
My audio engineer, first
year with our department,

1227
01:06:49,558 --> 01:06:54,558
did a phenomenal job,
dude, you're coming back.

1228
01:06:56,370 --> 01:06:59,685
We had a ton of help from you guys

1229
01:06:59,685 --> 01:07:03,660
when it came to pushing boxes,

1230
01:07:03,660 --> 01:07:05,910
when it came to unwrapping

1231
01:07:05,910 --> 01:07:08,820
those God damn fucking ninja swords.

1232
01:07:08,820 --> 01:07:09,663
Oh my God.

1233
01:07:11,010 --> 01:07:11,913
Those things were.

1234
01:07:13,459 --> 01:07:14,661
- [Speaker] It was a good idea.

1235
01:07:14,661 --> 01:07:17,011
- It was a good idea, it
was a good idea there.

1236
01:07:19,002 --> 01:07:20,957
Yeah, anybody have a sword in here?

1237
01:07:20,957 --> 01:07:21,955
Turn it on please.

1238
01:07:21,955 --> 01:07:22,952
There we go.

1239
01:07:22,952 --> 01:07:24,930
I hate that fucking sound.

1240
01:07:24,930 --> 01:07:28,533
I hate it so much, I am so sorry.

1241
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:32,280
Yeah, again,

1242
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:34,830
thank you to absolutely
everyone that showed up.

1243
01:07:34,830 --> 01:07:36,840
Thank you to everyone that helped.

1244
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:40,653
And if you are in the
entertainment field like me,

1245
01:07:42,150 --> 01:07:44,430
we need help, we are growing.

1246
01:07:44,430 --> 01:07:48,240
We have got a metric shit ton of equipment

1247
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:53,240
that we want to help distribute
it to parties, your event.

1248
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:56,580
We love loaning our stuff
out so that we get it back

1249
01:07:56,580 --> 01:07:58,350
and you guys have a good party,

1250
01:07:58,350 --> 01:08:00,303
the emphasis is getting it back.

1251
01:08:02,010 --> 01:08:03,450
And so yes.

1252
01:08:03,450 --> 01:08:05,160
Please feel free to reach out to anybody

1253
01:08:05,160 --> 01:08:08,250
from the arts entertainment,
arts entertainment department.

1254
01:08:08,250 --> 01:08:12,330
Use all the words there and contact us.

1255
01:08:12,330 --> 01:08:15,033
We'd love to have you on
our crew, so thank you.

1256
01:08:25,852 --> 01:08:26,685
- I've now switched away

1257
01:08:26,685 --> 01:08:28,680
from the central nervous
system depressants

1258
01:08:28,680 --> 01:08:29,580
and I'm now working

1259
01:08:29,580 --> 01:08:31,743
on the central nervous system stimulants.

1260
01:08:36,990 --> 01:08:38,490
I've got all my bases covered.

1261
01:08:39,450 --> 01:08:42,990
Oh wait, you forgot your
music viewing statistics.

1262
01:08:42,990 --> 01:08:44,010
Okay, here we go.

1263
01:08:44,010 --> 01:08:45,993
Look at these statistics.

1264
01:08:47,490 --> 01:08:48,963
They're very beautiful.

1265
01:08:51,660 --> 01:08:53,883
And now we're talking about the parties.

1266
01:08:55,560 --> 01:08:58,353
Parties come on down, Burt.

1267
01:09:05,970 --> 01:09:09,393
- Wow, this is scarier
than it was last year.

1268
01:09:13,560 --> 01:09:15,630
I got this, I got this.

1269
01:09:15,630 --> 01:09:17,410
Every year, the DEF CON community

1270
01:09:18,379 --> 01:09:20,760
comes together to party
and meet in the desert.

1271
01:09:20,760 --> 01:09:23,100
A and E had the black
and white ball this year,

1272
01:09:23,100 --> 01:09:25,110
but we also give the community space

1273
01:09:25,110 --> 01:09:26,790
to create their own parties.

1274
01:09:26,790 --> 01:09:29,700
And to give you all something
special and exciting.

1275
01:09:29,700 --> 01:09:32,280
Show of hands, who here
went to one or more

1276
01:09:32,280 --> 01:09:34,143
of the amazing parties at night?

1277
01:09:35,850 --> 01:09:38,850
Yes, excellent.

1278
01:09:38,850 --> 01:09:41,300
Alongside that, we
provide a place for people

1279
01:09:41,300 --> 01:09:43,920
to come together from various DC groups

1280
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:45,750
and special interests.

1281
01:09:45,750 --> 01:09:49,530
The meetups are run by
you all, by the humans.

1282
01:09:49,530 --> 01:09:51,810
And we love seeing the
community come together

1283
01:09:51,810 --> 01:09:54,690
under one roof and provide that space

1284
01:09:54,690 --> 01:09:56,970
where you can talk about those things

1285
01:09:56,970 --> 01:09:59,730
that are interesting to you
or just this is where the

1286
01:09:59,730 --> 01:10:03,933
DC group comes together once
a year to say hi in DEF CON.

1287
01:10:04,860 --> 01:10:06,720
Thank you so much for all the parties

1288
01:10:06,720 --> 01:10:08,010
and meetups.

1289
01:10:08,010 --> 01:10:11,310
On a more serious note,
the last couple of months,

1290
01:10:11,310 --> 01:10:13,530
I've been having a rough time mentally

1291
01:10:13,530 --> 01:10:15,060
and none of this would've been possible

1292
01:10:15,060 --> 01:10:18,150
without the help from all the
amazing people in my life.

1293
01:10:18,150 --> 01:10:20,700
I especially want to
thank my friend Nikita

1294
01:10:20,700 --> 01:10:23,190
for keeping me levelheaded
and picking up my slack

1295
01:10:23,190 --> 01:10:26,640
when I had no spoons
left, more importantly,

1296
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:28,980
all the hard work she puts
in to make the parties

1297
01:10:28,980 --> 01:10:30,330
and meetups happen.

1298
01:10:30,330 --> 01:10:32,130
Please give her a round of applause.

1299
01:10:34,133 --> 01:10:35,386
Thank you Nikita.

1300
01:10:35,386 --> 01:10:38,386
(audience clapping)

1301
01:10:43,260 --> 01:10:47,370
You all so much for coming out
and making DEF CON Homecoming

1302
01:10:47,370 --> 01:10:51,210
a huge success, much love
to you all and have a great,

1303
01:10:51,210 --> 01:10:54,311
great time for the rest
of your time in Vegas.

1304
01:10:54,311 --> 01:10:57,757
(audience clapping)

1305
01:10:57,757 --> 01:10:58,590
Thank you.

1306
01:11:03,731 --> 01:11:05,472
- [Audience] I love you man.

1307
01:11:05,472 --> 01:11:10,472
- [Speaker 4] Love you too.

1308
01:11:10,993 --> 01:11:14,073
- It's okay, we're all
secure in our identities.

1309
01:11:16,620 --> 01:11:17,987
Okay.

1310
01:11:17,987 --> 01:11:18,820
So something new again this year

1311
01:11:18,820 --> 01:11:22,620
and I don't know why,
this is the thing, right?

1312
01:11:22,620 --> 01:11:24,270
We've been doing this for so long

1313
01:11:24,270 --> 01:11:25,740
and then a new idea pops up

1314
01:11:25,740 --> 01:11:28,980
and you're like, why didn't
we do this 20 years ago?

1315
01:11:28,980 --> 01:11:30,405
I don't know.

1316
01:11:30,405 --> 01:11:34,260
And the idea this year is
that we've got Instagram

1317
01:11:34,260 --> 01:11:36,780
and Twitter and TikTok and people

1318
01:11:36,780 --> 01:11:38,280
are running around recording everything

1319
01:11:38,280 --> 01:11:41,100
and we try to watch it all
and see what's going on.

1320
01:11:41,100 --> 01:11:46,100
We never really created
a team or tried very hard

1321
01:11:46,517 --> 01:11:48,300
beyond photo core,

1322
01:11:48,300 --> 01:11:50,820
photo core is taking static photos

1323
01:11:50,820 --> 01:11:53,040
of what's going on to try to capture

1324
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:55,794
and we'd use it in a slideshow
or we'd put it online

1325
01:11:55,794 --> 01:11:59,190
to create some images that
people could use later.

1326
01:11:59,190 --> 01:12:01,200
We've never really done it with video.

1327
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:05,949
And we've never really tried
besides say DEF CON 20,

1328
01:12:05,949 --> 01:12:08,760
to try to really in a more organized way,

1329
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:10,320
record what's happening

1330
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:12,120
in all these villages and contests?

1331
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:14,010
How does that thing actually work?

1332
01:12:14,010 --> 01:12:17,970
What is the actual
Hack-A-Sat contest about?

1333
01:12:17,970 --> 01:12:21,540
And this year, for 30, because well,

1334
01:12:21,540 --> 01:12:25,170
we wanted to do another
DEF CON documentary for 30.

1335
01:12:25,170 --> 01:12:26,193
That was the plan.

1336
01:12:27,300 --> 01:12:31,593
But the plan ran into COVID, boo.

1337
01:12:32,460 --> 01:12:36,000
Yeah, so the group we were gonna use

1338
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,850
to do the recording kind of exploded,

1339
01:12:38,850 --> 01:12:40,328
it was too last minute to get replacement.

1340
01:12:40,328 --> 01:12:45,328
So instead we figured,
we went to the community.

1341
01:12:45,570 --> 01:12:48,420
We found people that have
experience with DEF CON

1342
01:12:48,420 --> 01:12:52,410
and with doing video and we got them going

1343
01:12:52,410 --> 01:12:54,270
and they've done a ton of interviews.

1344
01:12:54,270 --> 01:12:55,410
I think we're up to 47

1345
01:12:55,410 --> 01:12:58,800
or maybe 50 little videos on everything.

1346
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:02,550
And so they're being released on YouTube,

1347
01:13:02,550 --> 01:13:04,380
on different creators channels.

1348
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:06,210
We're gonna eventually
edit them all together

1349
01:13:06,210 --> 01:13:09,240
and sort of create a best of DEF CON 30.

1350
01:13:09,240 --> 01:13:11,280
And so that was great.

1351
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:14,340
We're gonna keep doing
that because what we found

1352
01:13:14,340 --> 01:13:16,109
is a lot of the villages don't have time

1353
01:13:16,109 --> 01:13:19,680
to capture what it is that they're doing.

1354
01:13:19,680 --> 01:13:22,920
And we want to promote
all the awesome work

1355
01:13:22,920 --> 01:13:25,590
that the creators are doing,
and so I think in the future,

1356
01:13:25,590 --> 01:13:29,250
this is just gonna be a
service where we just help them

1357
01:13:29,250 --> 01:13:32,310
spread the word of the awesome
creativity that they have.

1358
01:13:32,310 --> 01:13:34,710
So another new thing for this year,

1359
01:13:34,710 --> 01:13:36,330
we're calling it the video team,

1360
01:13:36,330 --> 01:13:38,430
but you might have seen
them, they're running around,

1361
01:13:38,430 --> 01:13:39,300
they've got video cameras,

1362
01:13:39,300 --> 01:13:41,430
they're scheduling with
the contests and events.

1363
01:13:41,430 --> 01:13:43,680
And if you go to YouTube, I think already

1364
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:47,883
we have about 20 or 20
of these videos listed.

1365
01:13:48,780 --> 01:13:50,370
So please take a look at something new

1366
01:13:50,370 --> 01:13:52,440
that you might not be aware of.

1367
01:13:52,440 --> 01:13:57,440
We have some shoutouts to Silk,
Gory, Shannon Snubs Morris.

1368
01:13:57,720 --> 01:14:01,650
I cannot pronounce that
ending with all alley snares.

1369
01:14:01,650 --> 01:14:06,247
Randomware neon temple legacy lower CVSE

1370
01:14:07,410 --> 01:14:11,250
and late to the game, Mayhem
sec did some great work.

1371
01:14:11,250 --> 01:14:12,960
And this is the capture crew this year,

1372
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:17,846
that really first year
thrown into the fire,

1373
01:14:17,846 --> 01:14:20,310
really pulled it off.

1374
01:14:20,310 --> 01:14:21,480
So thanks to them,

1375
01:14:21,480 --> 01:14:23,430
we're gonna have some
really great memories

1376
01:14:23,430 --> 01:14:25,320
of all the things behind the scenes

1377
01:14:25,320 --> 01:14:27,720
that we didn't actually get to
see, 'cause we were too busy.

1378
01:14:27,720 --> 01:14:30,180
You can go back and visit what you missed.

1379
01:14:30,180 --> 01:14:32,164
So thanks to the video team.

1380
01:14:32,164 --> 01:14:35,164
(audience clapping)

1381
01:14:39,210 --> 01:14:42,630
Now talking about all
that fantastic content,

1382
01:14:42,630 --> 01:14:44,820
I would like to introduce
you, if you don't know him,

1383
01:14:44,820 --> 01:14:47,220
Zant, the number one head of villages

1384
01:14:47,220 --> 01:14:49,370
and he's gonna let us
know what's going on.

1385
01:14:50,362 --> 01:14:53,362
(audience clapping)

1386
01:14:56,280 --> 01:14:58,230
- As always, I'm gonna
keep this nice and short

1387
01:14:58,230 --> 01:14:59,883
'cause I hate these long talks.

1388
01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:05,760
Number one, as always Jeff,
Villages needs more space.

1389
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:07,943
We'll start, we getting
that one outta the way.

1390
01:15:10,415 --> 01:15:11,413
- [Speaker] Course.

1391
01:15:11,413 --> 01:15:12,600
- All I would just like
to thank my seconds,

1392
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:16,020
which was who actually ran
everything that had to do

1393
01:15:16,020 --> 01:15:19,710
with the Flamingo hotel
and Fox who ran everything

1394
01:15:19,710 --> 01:15:21,330
that had to do with the link hotel.

1395
01:15:21,330 --> 01:15:23,880
Because I can't be in
three places at once.

1396
01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:25,500
And the rest of my team that's out there.

1397
01:15:25,500 --> 01:15:27,750
They made everything
work really smooth for me

1398
01:15:27,750 --> 01:15:29,100
by helping to support all the villages.

1399
01:15:29,100 --> 01:15:32,070
So I also wanna thank
all of the village leads

1400
01:15:32,070 --> 01:15:34,830
that brought all their great
content for you guys to enjoy.

1401
01:15:34,830 --> 01:15:36,660
I ain't even gonna bother
asking how many people

1402
01:15:36,660 --> 01:15:39,910
went to villages, 'cause
I saw, other than that,

1403
01:15:42,060 --> 01:15:44,070
I'd like to thank Jeff
Nikita and everybody else

1404
01:15:44,070 --> 01:15:46,290
for allowing us to keep bringing
this stuff in for you guys.

1405
01:15:46,290 --> 01:15:47,815
I hope you enjoyed it.

1406
01:15:47,815 --> 01:15:50,670
Of course we also villages
would love to thank

1407
01:15:50,670 --> 01:15:51,780
the knock 'cause without them,

1408
01:15:51,780 --> 01:15:53,340
none of our villages would
be able to do the stuff

1409
01:15:53,340 --> 01:15:56,040
that they do, so I hope
y'all enjoyed them.

1410
01:15:56,040 --> 01:15:57,093
Thank you very much.

1411
01:16:08,370 --> 01:16:12,630
- For some of you, this is
a village that was created

1412
01:16:12,630 --> 01:16:13,463
a number of years ago,

1413
01:16:13,463 --> 01:16:15,810
data duplication village, where are you

1414
01:16:15,810 --> 01:16:17,133
data duplication village?

1415
01:16:18,180 --> 01:16:19,203
Come on up.

1416
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:23,580
We give away free data to attendees

1417
01:16:23,580 --> 01:16:26,180
and we're hoping to continue
to do it in the future.

1418
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:33,390
- That's a big crowd.

1419
01:16:33,390 --> 01:16:35,700
So how many of you know the
data duplication village

1420
01:16:35,700 --> 01:16:36,930
by show of hands?

1421
01:16:36,930 --> 01:16:38,790
Oh cool, excellent.

1422
01:16:38,790 --> 01:16:40,743
How many of you know infocon.org?

1423
01:16:42,420 --> 01:16:44,040
He's providing all that source for us.

1424
01:16:44,040 --> 01:16:46,080
That's where that's all coming from.

1425
01:16:46,080 --> 01:16:47,340
So the data duplication village

1426
01:16:47,340 --> 01:16:49,680
has been around for
about oh seven years now.

1427
01:16:49,680 --> 01:16:52,530
And we've been putting
together all the infocon.org

1428
01:16:52,530 --> 01:16:54,180
to the drive you bring out to us.

1429
01:16:55,194 --> 01:16:56,570
And this year we were over in Flamingo,

1430
01:16:56,570 --> 01:16:59,913
kind of over the river and
through the woods, so to speak.

1431
01:17:01,290 --> 01:17:04,890
But despite being so far
away, you guys still,

1432
01:17:04,890 --> 01:17:09,780
Ms. Grant still found a
427 drives to turn into us.

1433
01:17:09,780 --> 01:17:11,100
So thank you for bringing those to us.

1434
01:17:11,100 --> 01:17:13,353
It's about 80% of our normal capacity,

1435
01:17:14,700 --> 01:17:17,040
108 of those drives Jeff, you were asking,

1436
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:19,950
this are over eight terabytes in size.

1437
01:17:19,950 --> 01:17:23,679
So we're probably going to
be making some adjustments

1438
01:17:23,679 --> 01:17:28,679
to the data next year, 420 of
them, putting that together,

1439
01:17:28,680 --> 01:17:31,350
came up to about 2.5
petabytes worth of data

1440
01:17:31,350 --> 01:17:33,120
in just the con time,

1441
01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:36,281
started off with just three
drives that were handed off

1442
01:17:36,281 --> 01:17:38,790
and multiplied out to
all those drives for us.

1443
01:17:38,790 --> 01:17:41,400
We had about 20 drives
fail, most of those,

1444
01:17:41,400 --> 01:17:44,190
we got to be successful,
got to work again.

1445
01:17:44,190 --> 01:17:46,350
We're finding that drives
are starting to age.

1446
01:17:46,350 --> 01:17:49,350
So get some new drives
after about five years,

1447
01:17:49,350 --> 01:17:52,350
you're gonna need to
get your drives updated.

1448
01:17:52,350 --> 01:17:53,973
Big, thanks out to DT.

1449
01:17:54,889 --> 01:17:59,460
Nikita, Will, Zant of
course, the QM stores,

1450
01:17:59,460 --> 01:18:01,170
all you guys, all the goons.

1451
01:18:01,170 --> 01:18:03,840
And of course you guys,
the humans, hackers,

1452
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:05,850
thanks for coming out
and getting those drives

1453
01:18:05,850 --> 01:18:07,150
and getting that data out.

1454
01:18:08,040 --> 01:18:11,010
Do, if you would please, seed the planet,

1455
01:18:11,010 --> 01:18:13,740
get those things out there,
get infocon.org out there.

1456
01:18:13,740 --> 01:18:14,610
The more seeds you have,

1457
01:18:14,610 --> 01:18:17,340
the easier it is to get
that data out there.

1458
01:18:17,340 --> 01:18:20,033
Stay tuned for those updates
for next year, thank you.

1459
01:18:27,480 --> 01:18:29,970
- How many of you are walking
down the hallway and you saw

1460
01:18:29,970 --> 01:18:33,753
those cool glass rooms
with the demo labs inside,

1461
01:18:35,160 --> 01:18:38,163
you weren't walking, you were crawling.

1462
01:18:39,780 --> 01:18:42,720
So I don't know if you
realized, but those rooms,

1463
01:18:42,720 --> 01:18:45,660
those walls are like LED blackout walls

1464
01:18:45,660 --> 01:18:48,900
and you can press a button
and the walls go opaque,

1465
01:18:48,900 --> 01:18:50,043
which is really cool,

1466
01:18:51,389 --> 01:18:54,071
so they probably got some of
the coolest space we have a con

1467
01:18:54,071 --> 01:18:57,033
and running demo labs.

1468
01:18:58,650 --> 01:19:03,090
Where's head of demo labs, Heisenberg,

1469
01:19:03,090 --> 01:19:04,740
okay, come on down Heisenberg.

1470
01:19:04,740 --> 01:19:08,730
Number one, we get a lot of submissions

1471
01:19:08,730 --> 01:19:10,620
and just like call for papers,

1472
01:19:10,620 --> 01:19:14,430
we review demo lab submissions
and to give you an overview

1473
01:19:14,430 --> 01:19:17,970
of how that went and what
we selected and how it went,

1474
01:19:17,970 --> 01:19:19,323
Heisenberg, come on down.

1475
01:19:20,256 --> 01:19:23,256
(audience clapping)

1476
01:19:25,620 --> 01:19:28,320
- Demo labs is really a cool thing

1477
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:30,510
that DEF CON does and I'm
really stoked about it.

1478
01:19:30,510 --> 01:19:33,180
And I hope you guys had
a chance to participate.

1479
01:19:33,180 --> 01:19:35,940
Demo labs is an opportunity where we bring

1480
01:19:35,940 --> 01:19:38,160
the InfoSec community together

1481
01:19:38,160 --> 01:19:40,500
with the people that
are doing the content,

1482
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:42,548
doing the development, doing the tools,

1483
01:19:42,548 --> 01:19:45,060
doing the really cool projects.

1484
01:19:45,060 --> 01:19:48,300
And we get an opportunity
for you guys to interact

1485
01:19:48,300 --> 01:19:52,270
in a close and highly interactive manner,

1486
01:19:54,690 --> 01:19:57,150
where presentations are given,

1487
01:19:57,150 --> 01:19:59,100
but it's a lot of questions and answers.

1488
01:19:59,100 --> 01:20:01,800
There's a lot of back
and forth and talking.

1489
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:05,610
And the thing that really made
it so cool for me this year

1490
01:20:05,610 --> 01:20:08,123
is almost every demo lab that came up

1491
01:20:08,123 --> 01:20:11,580
and did their presentation
came up afterwards and said,

1492
01:20:11,580 --> 01:20:14,460
I got great feedback from the community.

1493
01:20:14,460 --> 01:20:17,366
A lot of people were saying
really good suggestions.

1494
01:20:17,366 --> 01:20:19,380
This is awesome, could it do this?

1495
01:20:19,380 --> 01:20:21,690
Could we go this direction,
that sort of thing.

1496
01:20:21,690 --> 01:20:24,120
And it was absolutely fantastic.

1497
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:28,020
So kudos to all of you who gave
great feedback to Demo Labs

1498
01:20:28,020 --> 01:20:31,290
and to the people that
presented, as the slide says,

1499
01:20:31,290 --> 01:20:34,170
we had 41 call for Demo
Lab projects received.

1500
01:20:34,170 --> 01:20:36,900
We picked 30 of them, just
like a call for papers.

1501
01:20:36,900 --> 01:20:38,100
We go through and look at them

1502
01:20:38,100 --> 01:20:39,870
and screen them pretty carefully

1503
01:20:39,870 --> 01:20:43,078
and ended up 28 of them
were presented in person

1504
01:20:43,078 --> 01:20:45,600
and two of them were presented virtual.

1505
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:48,510
So if you think that you've
got a really cool project

1506
01:20:48,510 --> 01:20:50,010
that you want to actually get,

1507
01:20:50,010 --> 01:20:52,039
maybe it's just now
getting off the ground.

1508
01:20:52,039 --> 01:20:54,780
Maybe it's a pretty mature
project where you're looking

1509
01:20:54,780 --> 01:20:56,610
for direction and you really want

1510
01:20:56,610 --> 01:21:00,480
InfoSec community feedback,
Demo Labs is the place,

1511
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:02,733
I hope to see your call
for papers next year.

1512
01:21:03,668 --> 01:21:06,751
(audience clapping)

1513
01:21:10,050 --> 01:21:15,050
- Okay grifter, it's grifter
time, contest and events,

1514
01:21:15,390 --> 01:21:18,150
a large part of what happens at DEF CON

1515
01:21:18,150 --> 01:21:20,820
and a large part of the shenanigans

1516
01:21:20,820 --> 01:21:23,970
happen in contest and events,
and leading that chaos

1517
01:21:23,970 --> 01:21:27,663
is Grifter, also known as the dinosaur.

1518
01:21:36,030 --> 01:21:39,240
- Hey, I'm not nervous to see all of you.

1519
01:21:39,240 --> 01:21:41,071
I missed you very, very much.

1520
01:21:41,071 --> 01:21:42,600
Thanks for coming out.

1521
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:45,190
This has been absolutely incredible.

1522
01:21:45,190 --> 01:21:46,920
It was clear from this year

1523
01:21:46,920 --> 01:21:51,060
that you were all really
tired of being in your houses.

1524
01:21:51,060 --> 01:21:54,066
It says something that we all
crawled out of our basements

1525
01:21:54,066 --> 01:21:58,032
and literally ran onto the contest floor.

1526
01:21:58,032 --> 01:22:00,663
As the doors opened every morning,

1527
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:03,000
people headed in every direction.

1528
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,220
It wasn't one contest that was driving

1529
01:22:05,220 --> 01:22:06,750
that kind of excitement.

1530
01:22:06,750 --> 01:22:09,510
There were people flying in
every different direction

1531
01:22:09,510 --> 01:22:11,760
and that's super cool to see,

1532
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:14,430
we are seeing that on the contest floor,

1533
01:22:14,430 --> 01:22:16,200
but we know that that's also happening

1534
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:18,720
in villages all around this space.

1535
01:22:18,720 --> 01:22:21,780
So contests and events are also hosted

1536
01:22:21,780 --> 01:22:23,537
in many of the villages.

1537
01:22:23,537 --> 01:22:25,770
So thank you to Zant
as well for the support

1538
01:22:25,770 --> 01:22:28,020
around those contests and events

1539
01:22:28,020 --> 01:22:30,990
that are within his purview.

1540
01:22:30,990 --> 01:22:35,990
So I would like to thank the
contest and events goons,

1541
01:22:36,750 --> 01:22:38,850
without whom none of
these things would run.

1542
01:22:38,850 --> 01:22:43,320
But I heard Bert say
something about Nikita there,

1543
01:22:43,320 --> 01:22:46,350
where he said, she picked up
some of the slack for him.

1544
01:22:46,350 --> 01:22:50,220
And I am also one of those slackers,

1545
01:22:50,220 --> 01:22:52,590
not you were slacker Burt,
we got where you were going,

1546
01:22:52,590 --> 01:22:56,340
but sometimes I would
get a message from Nikita

1547
01:22:56,340 --> 01:22:58,620
and she would just say, hey,

1548
01:22:58,620 --> 01:23:00,600
I saw that this thing wasn't done.

1549
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:04,713
So I did it for you and I'm like, dope.

1550
01:23:06,930 --> 01:23:08,910
And then she'd send me
another message and be like,

1551
01:23:08,910 --> 01:23:11,370
I made this document,
I've arranged it this way.

1552
01:23:11,370 --> 01:23:13,470
And I think that will
be easier for it to use

1553
01:23:13,470 --> 01:23:15,090
because the one that you were using

1554
01:23:15,090 --> 01:23:18,783
didn't look so nice and I'm like, dope.

1555
01:23:20,250 --> 01:23:22,920
And that happened over
and over and over again.

1556
01:23:22,920 --> 01:23:26,463
So again, please, another
round of applause for Nikita.

1557
01:23:34,740 --> 01:23:37,980
One of my favorite people
and the heart of DEF CON,

1558
01:23:37,980 --> 01:23:39,213
if I can be so bold.

1559
01:23:40,080 --> 01:23:44,336
So a lot of different
activities going on this year,

1560
01:23:44,336 --> 01:23:47,313
a lot of new stuff and cool
things that you were doing.

1561
01:23:48,210 --> 01:23:50,021
We're really, really excited

1562
01:23:50,021 --> 01:23:51,720
to see the things that you create.

1563
01:23:51,720 --> 01:23:54,540
Please, if you have
ideas, send them to us.

1564
01:23:54,540 --> 01:23:56,220
We want to see new things.

1565
01:23:56,220 --> 01:23:59,490
We wanna see what weird
stuff you come up with.

1566
01:23:59,490 --> 01:24:01,290
But some of the best weird

1567
01:24:01,290 --> 01:24:04,953
is what we're gonna talk
about next, the black badges.

1568
01:24:06,272 --> 01:24:09,272
(audience clapping)

1569
01:24:11,220 --> 01:24:14,765
So I think the best way to kick this off

1570
01:24:14,765 --> 01:24:18,120
is with the badge challenge itself.

1571
01:24:18,120 --> 01:24:21,690
So not only do the creators of the badge

1572
01:24:21,690 --> 01:24:23,880
create the badge itself,
that gives you something

1573
01:24:23,880 --> 01:24:25,530
to look at and play with.

1574
01:24:25,530 --> 01:24:27,540
And when a talk is boring, you can tell

1575
01:24:27,540 --> 01:24:30,339
because people are staring at their badge,

1576
01:24:30,339 --> 01:24:35,339
but Lost created a tradition
where not only is the badge

1577
01:24:36,330 --> 01:24:38,040
something you wear around your neck,

1578
01:24:38,040 --> 01:24:41,250
but it's something that
keeps you up at night.

1579
01:24:41,250 --> 01:24:44,073
So with that, the badge challenge.

1580
01:25:00,840 --> 01:25:03,503
- All right, so how many of
you played the badge challenge?

1581
01:25:04,732 --> 01:25:05,565
(audience clapping)

1582
01:25:05,565 --> 01:25:06,420
Yes.

1583
01:25:06,420 --> 01:25:09,120
All right, so for those of you who didn't,

1584
01:25:09,120 --> 01:25:11,220
there were some things you
could unlock on the badge.

1585
01:25:11,220 --> 01:25:15,180
We had a bunch of telephones
set up in the contest area

1586
01:25:15,180 --> 01:25:17,460
and for those who played last year,

1587
01:25:17,460 --> 01:25:18,570
we brought back Jenny.

1588
01:25:18,570 --> 01:25:19,520
It was a big thing.

1589
01:25:21,720 --> 01:25:24,613
We had 12,771

1590
01:25:25,573 --> 01:25:30,192
phone calls made 1,128 unique
badges played the challenge

1591
01:25:30,192 --> 01:25:33,810
and 312 voicemails left for Jenny.

1592
01:25:33,810 --> 01:25:36,543
We're still combing through
that, but it was awesome.

1593
01:25:38,850 --> 01:25:42,330
And real quick, I wanna think
Redacted and his wife Boots,

1594
01:25:42,330 --> 01:25:44,370
they helped a ton with the
challenge and the hardware

1595
01:25:44,370 --> 01:25:47,070
and getting that all set
up and making it work.

1596
01:25:47,070 --> 01:25:48,693
And then here's our winner.

1597
01:25:49,664 --> 01:25:50,700
(audience clapping)

1598
01:25:50,700 --> 01:25:51,603
- Thanks, wow.

1599
01:25:52,500 --> 01:25:53,662
This is incredible.

1600
01:25:53,662 --> 01:25:56,277
Again, this was just an incredible,

1601
01:25:56,277 --> 01:25:58,830
I mean, this is a piece
of art, physically,

1602
01:25:58,830 --> 01:26:02,310
literally, you can make music
with it and you can have a lot

1603
01:26:02,310 --> 01:26:03,751
of fun with it.

1604
01:26:03,751 --> 01:26:04,890
I couldn't thank you guys
enough, you did a great job.

1605
01:26:04,890 --> 01:26:07,380
So please, once again, let's
here for MK factor in his team.

1606
01:26:07,380 --> 01:26:08,230
That was awesome.

1607
01:26:11,910 --> 01:26:14,280
With the challenge this
year, I have to say

1608
01:26:14,280 --> 01:26:16,638
that most of the credit's
gonna have to go out

1609
01:26:16,638 --> 01:26:18,360
to the community, this was a group effort,

1610
01:26:18,360 --> 01:26:22,230
big shout out to the family
at the DC30 checking Discord,

1611
01:26:22,230 --> 01:26:24,120
the Discord, the DEF CON Discord.

1612
01:26:24,120 --> 01:26:26,520
We documented almost everything.

1613
01:26:26,520 --> 01:26:28,800
We made all the answers
available on Wiki pages.

1614
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:32,850
You can find links at
those sub Discord channels.

1615
01:26:32,850 --> 01:26:36,180
And while I'm still here, I'd
like to do one more thing.

1616
01:26:36,180 --> 01:26:41,180
Could I quickly ask everyone
to just power on right button

1617
01:26:41,460 --> 01:26:44,256
and let's see what
thousands of these things

1618
01:26:44,256 --> 01:26:45,388
sound like in unison.

1619
01:26:45,388 --> 01:26:47,971
(upbeat music)

1620
01:26:53,940 --> 01:26:55,540
That's beautiful, thank you all.

1621
01:26:57,913 --> 01:27:00,913
(audience clapping)

1622
01:27:02,130 --> 01:27:03,690
- We also gave him a phone

1623
01:27:03,690 --> 01:27:06,543
to keep from one of
our phones of the many.

1624
01:27:07,620 --> 01:27:08,453
- Thank you.

1625
01:27:16,146 --> 01:27:18,777
- I handed it to him, do
you want me to put it on?

1626
01:27:18,777 --> 01:27:20,744
- It's more of a presentation.

1627
01:27:20,744 --> 01:27:21,911
- Okay, sorry.

1628
01:27:23,214 --> 01:27:24,047
(person laughing)

1629
01:27:24,047 --> 01:27:26,730
- All right, this next
one is a favorite of mine.

1630
01:27:26,730 --> 01:27:28,320
It's a favorite of yours clearly

1631
01:27:28,320 --> 01:27:29,820
because there's a significant amount

1632
01:27:29,820 --> 01:27:31,683
of space dedicated to this contest.

1633
01:27:32,653 --> 01:27:34,590
And it's full all of the time.

1634
01:27:34,590 --> 01:27:37,860
I feel safe in saying
with you bunch of weirdos

1635
01:27:37,860 --> 01:27:41,670
in this room that I really,
really like packets.

1636
01:27:41,670 --> 01:27:44,580
I like to look at them,
they wash over me in waves.

1637
01:27:44,580 --> 01:27:47,103
I could bathe in packets all day.

1638
01:27:48,060 --> 01:27:52,833
And this contest takes that
love and turns it against you.

1639
01:27:54,810 --> 01:27:55,830
It is a blast.

1640
01:27:55,830 --> 01:27:59,520
As I talk to Riverside
about this year's contest,

1641
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:02,463
I just kept saying, that's mean,

1642
01:28:03,780 --> 01:28:08,107
that's mean, that's all so mean.

1643
01:28:08,107 --> 01:28:09,360
And he was like, no, it's gonna be great.

1644
01:28:09,360 --> 01:28:10,590
And it was great.

1645
01:28:10,590 --> 01:28:12,753
So let's hear about
it, Capture the Packet.

1646
01:28:19,890 --> 01:28:20,723
- Careful.

1647
01:28:21,720 --> 01:28:22,570
- Thanks Grifter.

1648
01:28:24,270 --> 01:28:27,042
Thanks DEF CON for
letting us do this again.

1649
01:28:27,042 --> 01:28:30,240
I think the 11th year that
has been a black badge now,

1650
01:28:30,240 --> 01:28:32,160
and everybody just keeps coming.

1651
01:28:32,160 --> 01:28:33,933
As he said, is packed constantly.

1652
01:28:35,117 --> 01:28:37,082
It's a threat hunting challenge and we try

1653
01:28:37,082 --> 01:28:37,943
to bring it really hard every year.

1654
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:40,683
And it changes and changes and changes

1655
01:28:40,683 --> 01:28:41,686
based on all the threats
that are happening

1656
01:28:41,686 --> 01:28:42,519
around the world.

1657
01:28:42,519 --> 01:28:43,470
We've been adjusting to all the things

1658
01:28:43,470 --> 01:28:44,790
that the nation states are doing,

1659
01:28:44,790 --> 01:28:47,340
and we add our own extra special flavor

1660
01:28:47,340 --> 01:28:49,680
of bullshit to the thing
to make it really hard

1661
01:28:49,680 --> 01:28:52,827
for you at DEF CON, which is important.

1662
01:28:52,827 --> 01:28:56,340
Last year, we turned the knob

1663
01:28:56,340 --> 01:28:59,790
to close to 11 and people
were like, ah, too hard.

1664
01:28:59,790 --> 01:29:00,870
Don't do that.

1665
01:29:00,870 --> 01:29:05,370
And so we were dialed it back
and then somebody in Maines

1666
01:29:05,370 --> 01:29:08,550
were like, ah, we got all
these things and were like,

1667
01:29:08,550 --> 01:29:10,290
oh yeah, well try this now.

1668
01:29:10,290 --> 01:29:11,703
So yeah,

1669
01:29:12,632 --> 01:29:14,220
we rolled in some extra
special stuff in finals

1670
01:29:14,220 --> 01:29:17,343
and that ended up out
of the, I don't know,

1671
01:29:18,451 --> 01:29:19,284
three or 5,000 points or whatever.

1672
01:29:19,284 --> 01:29:21,660
I don't know, the winning
team to the left of me

1673
01:29:21,660 --> 01:29:25,140
who did awesome, got 700 points.

1674
01:29:25,140 --> 01:29:28,860
And that's extremely good
because we had prior year,

1675
01:29:28,860 --> 01:29:32,640
black badge winners goose egg this year.

1676
01:29:32,640 --> 01:29:37,350
So we definitely need to figure out,

1677
01:29:37,350 --> 01:29:40,320
do we do want to keep
it this extremely hard

1678
01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:41,880
or dial it back a little
bit, what do you think?

1679
01:29:41,880 --> 01:29:42,873
Super hard.

1680
01:29:44,061 --> 01:29:47,061
(audience cheering)

1681
01:29:47,948 --> 01:29:48,781
All right, dial it back.

1682
01:29:49,969 --> 01:29:51,203
All right, super hard it is.

1683
01:29:52,080 --> 01:29:56,103
All right, so I wanna
thank the many, many,

1684
01:29:57,358 --> 01:29:58,800
many people that helped
make all the challenges

1685
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:01,260
and keep the engines
running and all the things

1686
01:30:01,260 --> 01:30:02,970
and the folks in the
packet hacking village

1687
01:30:02,970 --> 01:30:04,860
that made all the infrastructure,

1688
01:30:04,860 --> 01:30:07,560
dropped it down, get everything together.

1689
01:30:07,560 --> 01:30:10,230
I mean, there is no way that that event

1690
01:30:10,230 --> 01:30:12,270
would be nearly as cool without the vibe

1691
01:30:12,270 --> 01:30:14,280
going from the DJs in there

1692
01:30:14,280 --> 01:30:15,928
and all the things that were happening.

1693
01:30:15,928 --> 01:30:20,928
And then if you feel like checking it out

1694
01:30:21,060 --> 01:30:23,610
and you wanna try to get
into the black badge,

1695
01:30:23,610 --> 01:30:25,169
but you're like, I don't know.

1696
01:30:25,169 --> 01:30:28,170
We take prior year stuff and
put it into packet detectives.

1697
01:30:28,170 --> 01:30:30,420
So you can sit down and try the things out

1698
01:30:30,420 --> 01:30:32,391
and kind of get a feel
of what the stuff is

1699
01:30:32,391 --> 01:30:34,017
and then go for it.

1700
01:30:34,017 --> 01:30:37,230
But this year, all the way from France,

1701
01:30:37,230 --> 01:30:42,230
their first time at DEF CON, right.

1702
01:30:42,480 --> 01:30:47,480
Rolling in and dominating and
taking a Black Badge team.

1703
01:30:50,610 --> 01:30:51,443
Good job.

1704
01:30:54,750 --> 01:30:57,480
You go guys, all right.

1705
01:30:57,480 --> 01:30:58,383
Thanks DEF CON.

1706
01:31:02,100 --> 01:31:04,300
- [Speaker] Make sure
they get the registry.

1707
01:31:06,075 --> 01:31:07,860
- Yeah, be careful if
you're walking up here,

1708
01:31:07,860 --> 01:31:09,813
if you fall, I will take your wallet.

1709
01:31:13,080 --> 01:31:14,669
Like I say, I love you guys.

1710
01:31:14,669 --> 01:31:15,840
I always say I love all of you.

1711
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:19,020
And here's why, he just
talked about how hard it was

1712
01:31:19,020 --> 01:31:22,023
and DEF CON responded
with, hurt me, daddy.

1713
01:31:25,050 --> 01:31:28,792
So the next contest up here, I went in

1714
01:31:28,792 --> 01:31:32,739
and took a look at what they
were offering up for their CTF.

1715
01:31:32,739 --> 01:31:35,580
And when you walk into the IOT village,

1716
01:31:35,580 --> 01:31:40,580
you see a ridiculous array
of devices stacked on top,

1717
01:31:40,680 --> 01:31:42,150
literally on top of each other,

1718
01:31:42,150 --> 01:31:43,833
shelf after shelf after shelf.

1719
01:31:44,987 --> 01:31:47,070
And what you're looking at
is the levels of difficulty

1720
01:31:47,070 --> 01:31:48,850
of the CTF getting harder and harder,

1721
01:31:48,850 --> 01:31:53,850
including things from
a standard IOT webcam,

1722
01:31:54,540 --> 01:31:57,600
all the way up to the
emergency broadcast system.

1723
01:31:57,600 --> 01:32:02,460
So they bring it all and
48 different challenges

1724
01:32:02,460 --> 01:32:06,390
and then continued to add
more throughout the contest

1725
01:32:06,390 --> 01:32:10,500
by sourcing them from other
nerds inside the OT village.

1726
01:32:10,500 --> 01:32:12,570
So it just got crazier and crazier.

1727
01:32:12,570 --> 01:32:15,538
So let's hear from them
the IOT village CTF.

1728
01:32:15,538 --> 01:32:18,538
(audience clapping)

1729
01:32:25,050 --> 01:32:28,590
- So I wanna go back just
a second back to DEF CON 26

1730
01:32:28,590 --> 01:32:31,680
when myself, huffy and won the black badge

1731
01:32:31,680 --> 01:32:34,740
at the last time that
the got a black badge.

1732
01:32:34,740 --> 01:32:36,630
And I actually jumped
on the mic for a second

1733
01:32:36,630 --> 01:32:39,135
when I probably wasn't supposed to.

1734
01:32:39,135 --> 01:32:40,530
And I said, I wanna be thankful

1735
01:32:40,530 --> 01:32:42,027
that for DEF CON and IOT village,

1736
01:32:42,027 --> 01:32:43,440
and we wanna come back next year,

1737
01:32:43,440 --> 01:32:45,300
make IOT village bigger and better

1738
01:32:45,300 --> 01:32:47,010
and fast forward four years later.

1739
01:32:47,010 --> 01:32:50,520
Now we are the team that is
helping build the IOTCTF.

1740
01:32:50,520 --> 01:32:54,150
And we tried to put together
the biggest baddest IOTCTF

1741
01:32:54,150 --> 01:32:56,190
that DEF CON has ever seen.

1742
01:32:56,190 --> 01:32:59,340
And I think we might have
gone a little bit overboard

1743
01:32:59,340 --> 01:33:01,632
as said, we had over 50 challenges,

1744
01:33:01,632 --> 01:33:04,860
but I think that you
guys all appreciated that

1745
01:33:04,860 --> 01:33:07,737
and I'll ask you, do you want more, less?

1746
01:33:07,737 --> 01:33:09,572
More, awesome, awesome.

1747
01:33:09,572 --> 01:33:11,163
Not only that though.

1748
01:33:11,163 --> 01:33:13,888
One thing that we wanted
to do is we wanted to help

1749
01:33:13,888 --> 01:33:17,550
bridge the gap between
players that are newbs

1750
01:33:17,550 --> 01:33:20,587
and some of the badass players
that compete in our CTF.

1751
01:33:20,587 --> 01:33:21,750
So I wanted to give a shadow to new

1752
01:33:21,750 --> 01:33:24,611
who actually helped
develop some of the labs

1753
01:33:24,611 --> 01:33:25,444
that we do in IOT village

1754
01:33:25,444 --> 01:33:28,196
so that people can get intro to IOT.

1755
01:33:28,196 --> 01:33:30,330
And I wanna see all the
people that did those labs

1756
01:33:30,330 --> 01:33:31,163
come back

1757
01:33:33,816 --> 01:33:34,816
next year and play in the IOT CTF.

1758
01:33:34,816 --> 01:33:35,649
folks that are familiar with our contest

1759
01:33:35,649 --> 01:33:37,470
night remember that we used to be called

1760
01:33:37,470 --> 01:33:40,166
the broken CTF, but we dropped that name.

1761
01:33:40,166 --> 01:33:43,339
We went just IOT village CTF

1762
01:33:43,339 --> 01:33:45,473
because IOT is so much
more than just Soho.

1763
01:33:47,272 --> 01:33:48,283
So as grifter said,

1764
01:33:48,283 --> 01:33:49,116
we expanded those CTFs include things

1765
01:33:49,116 --> 01:33:50,407
like the emergency
alert broadcast systems.

1766
01:33:50,407 --> 01:33:54,030
We haven't had an in Mars ACOMM
satellite that was retired

1767
01:33:54,030 --> 01:33:56,613
from the us secret service
that we had in the CTF,

1768
01:33:58,092 --> 01:33:59,190
as well as other things like Bluetooth

1769
01:33:59,190 --> 01:34:02,040
low energy locks, firmware challenge.

1770
01:34:02,040 --> 01:34:05,736
And we also wanted to introduce
people to the hardware side

1771
01:34:05,736 --> 01:34:06,755
of IOTs, so we had a UR boot
loader attack in the CTF.

1772
01:34:06,755 --> 01:34:11,550
We had over 175 teams register,

1773
01:34:11,550 --> 01:34:14,430
70 teams solved at least one
of the challenges in the CTF

1774
01:34:14,430 --> 01:34:17,400
and the competition was super
close throughout the contest

1775
01:34:17,400 --> 01:34:21,300
with the top teams only separated
by a couple of challenges.

1776
01:34:21,300 --> 01:34:24,960
So in third place we had 20,501 points.

1777
01:34:24,960 --> 01:34:28,746
It was Leap the Hard Way,
so congratulations to them.

1778
01:34:28,746 --> 01:34:31,746
(audience clapping)

1779
01:34:35,130 --> 01:34:38,070
In second place, with 21001 points,

1780
01:34:38,070 --> 01:34:41,253
only 500 point difference
was Colonel Panic.

1781
01:34:47,423 --> 01:34:49,260
And the winners of the DEF CON IOT CTF

1782
01:34:49,260 --> 01:34:54,260
with 25,501 points was Dark
Wolf Fire, congratulations.

1783
01:35:02,700 --> 01:35:03,533
- Thank you.

1784
01:35:10,140 --> 01:35:14,400
- So this next contest has
been around for many years.

1785
01:35:14,400 --> 01:35:16,440
Every year we'd see lines of folks

1786
01:35:16,440 --> 01:35:18,720
outside of the contest
area, waiting to get in,

1787
01:35:18,720 --> 01:35:22,020
to get their hands on
whatever the dark net folks

1788
01:35:22,020 --> 01:35:24,690
had gotten up to this year.

1789
01:35:24,690 --> 01:35:28,020
And they really like upped it this year,

1790
01:35:28,020 --> 01:35:31,350
to include as many people
as humanly possible.

1791
01:35:31,350 --> 01:35:35,250
And when I mentioned the running earlier,

1792
01:35:35,250 --> 01:35:37,950
they were way off in the
back of the contest area.

1793
01:35:37,950 --> 01:35:40,890
And so getting geeks to run that far,

1794
01:35:40,890 --> 01:35:42,843
it just speaks volumes, right?

1795
01:35:44,610 --> 01:35:48,180
Literally creating traces
out of foil themselves

1796
01:35:48,180 --> 01:35:50,880
on the badges, tables
covered in components.

1797
01:35:50,880 --> 01:35:53,700
It was a hacker's dream.

1798
01:35:53,700 --> 01:35:55,650
So we'll bring to the stage Darknet-NG.

1799
01:35:57,637 --> 01:36:00,637
(audience clapping)

1800
01:36:11,488 --> 01:36:12,488
- Thank you.

1801
01:36:13,530 --> 01:36:15,430
Hello you beautiful people of DEF CON.

1802
01:36:19,260 --> 01:36:20,130
So my name's Gator,

1803
01:36:20,130 --> 01:36:22,230
I'm one of the operatives
for the Darknet-NG

1804
01:36:22,230 --> 01:36:24,480
and the dark net is many things.

1805
01:36:24,480 --> 01:36:27,780
We are in a person role
playing game where a contest

1806
01:36:27,780 --> 01:36:30,690
accessible for to beginners
and challenging experts.

1807
01:36:30,690 --> 01:36:32,940
We're one of the most
prolific badge producers

1808
01:36:32,940 --> 01:36:35,456
that make a bit of a thorn in the side

1809
01:36:35,456 --> 01:36:37,656
of the contest goons
every year, sorry guys.

1810
01:36:38,700 --> 01:36:41,940
Let's see, so we are a year
round community of teachers,

1811
01:36:41,940 --> 01:36:43,890
that helps encourage people

1812
01:36:43,890 --> 01:36:45,840
to learn something new and have fun.

1813
01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:48,270
This is our 11th year doing
yet another highly successful

1814
01:36:48,270 --> 01:36:51,309
year for Darknet in our homecoming Guo,

1815
01:36:51,309 --> 01:36:56,309
he was our badge designer
and he helped us get back

1816
01:36:56,340 --> 01:36:58,867
to the basics, we went and gave away

1817
01:36:58,867 --> 01:37:01,620
the paper circuit boards,

1818
01:37:01,620 --> 01:37:02,550
which hopefully you've gotta see

1819
01:37:02,550 --> 01:37:04,950
a few around the conference.

1820
01:37:04,950 --> 01:37:07,200
And we got a lot of folks getting in

1821
01:37:07,200 --> 01:37:08,550
and tracing for the first time.

1822
01:37:08,550 --> 01:37:11,700
So we had about 13,000, excuse me,

1823
01:37:11,700 --> 01:37:15,283
1,300 new unique electronic
badges designed all in one year,

1824
01:37:15,283 --> 01:37:18,780
'cause you were designing them
yourselves, which is awesome.

1825
01:37:18,780 --> 01:37:21,750
We had over 200 players in our online CTF

1826
01:37:21,750 --> 01:37:23,239
and with the final standings.

1827
01:37:23,239 --> 01:37:27,000
In third place we had at 640 points,

1828
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,317
Tupac, put a around applause for that.

1829
01:37:29,317 --> 01:37:32,317
(audience clapping)

1830
01:37:34,080 --> 01:37:38,430
In second place at 711
points, a remote player,

1831
01:37:38,430 --> 01:37:41,103
not even here physically
at DEF CON, is Crumbo.

1832
01:37:45,660 --> 01:37:47,220
And our first place winner,

1833
01:37:47,220 --> 01:37:51,413
second time coming to
DEF CON at 822 points

1834
01:37:52,650 --> 01:37:55,533
was Crooked Fingers, the
fellowship of the token ring.

1835
01:38:03,930 --> 01:38:05,730
So I wanna thank the
operatives who slaved away

1836
01:38:05,730 --> 01:38:08,850
to make this happen,
including, digital tinker.

1837
01:38:08,850 --> 01:38:12,596
Oh hi, there PI key Colonel, Sanity.

1838
01:38:12,596 --> 01:38:15,210
Thank you for the contest goons

1839
01:38:15,210 --> 01:38:16,215
for helping us manage
all those silly lines

1840
01:38:16,215 --> 01:38:19,710
that we had across the
entire contest floor

1841
01:38:19,710 --> 01:38:22,080
on Friday morning, thank all of you.

1842
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:23,018
All of the players,

1843
01:38:23,018 --> 01:38:25,610
you guys are the reason why we exist.

1844
01:38:25,610 --> 01:38:28,570
We hope to see you online and
see you come back next year

1845
01:38:28,570 --> 01:38:31,923
and DEF CON is our people, so
go love your hacker family.

1846
01:38:40,590 --> 01:38:44,070
- All right, this next contest was new,

1847
01:38:44,070 --> 01:38:47,610
last year, they came in, set up a village,

1848
01:38:47,610 --> 01:38:49,050
put together a CTF.

1849
01:38:49,050 --> 01:38:51,960
And when I sat down with
the creator of the CTF,

1850
01:38:51,960 --> 01:38:53,550
I was blown away,

1851
01:38:53,550 --> 01:38:56,550
the amount of challenges
and the ridiculous hoops

1852
01:38:56,550 --> 01:38:59,310
that you had to jump through to solve them

1853
01:38:59,310 --> 01:39:02,430
was on the level of Lost himself.

1854
01:39:02,430 --> 01:39:06,450
And so they received a
black badge last year

1855
01:39:06,450 --> 01:39:08,700
and then they looked at
us this year and said,

1856
01:39:08,700 --> 01:39:11,917
watch this, Blacks and Cyber CTF.

1857
01:39:13,433 --> 01:39:16,516
(audience clapping)

1858
01:39:24,660 --> 01:39:26,845
- Wow, they were not kidding

1859
01:39:26,845 --> 01:39:27,678
when they said there was a lot of you.

1860
01:39:27,678 --> 01:39:30,210
Hi guys, oh my gosh, hey.

1861
01:39:30,210 --> 01:39:33,420
Wow, well, I mean a lot of
things go through your mind

1862
01:39:33,420 --> 01:39:35,640
when you're thinking
about what you wanna say

1863
01:39:35,640 --> 01:39:36,570
in moments like this.

1864
01:39:36,570 --> 01:39:39,090
But honestly, the only thing I can say

1865
01:39:39,090 --> 01:39:40,830
would be our village slogan for this year,

1866
01:39:40,830 --> 01:39:42,060
which if you were able to solve it

1867
01:39:42,060 --> 01:39:44,250
was love does not lose its way home.

1868
01:39:44,250 --> 01:39:47,250
It's based on a Sankofa
symbol out of west Africa

1869
01:39:47,250 --> 01:39:49,320
and love really doesn't lose its way home.

1870
01:39:49,320 --> 01:39:51,210
Look at how many people are around us.

1871
01:39:51,210 --> 01:39:53,100
We're just so excited
to be able to showcase

1872
01:39:53,100 --> 01:39:55,560
what our community can do
within the hacker community.

1873
01:39:55,560 --> 01:39:57,750
And we're so excited to
do it again next year.

1874
01:39:57,750 --> 01:39:59,684
So thank you guys so much.

1875
01:39:59,684 --> 01:40:02,684
(audience clapping)

1876
01:40:07,440 --> 01:40:09,690
- Yeah, let's talk about
the CTF real quick though.

1877
01:40:09,690 --> 01:40:10,533
How y'all doing?

1878
01:40:11,699 --> 01:40:12,532
Yeah, I go by daddy coco man.

1879
01:40:12,532 --> 01:40:13,770
You can find me everywhere.

1880
01:40:15,730 --> 01:40:17,910
Oh, so we had about 41 teams
register for this event.

1881
01:40:17,910 --> 01:40:19,470
It was pretty dope.

1882
01:40:19,470 --> 01:40:21,930
All the challenges were made by us

1883
01:40:21,930 --> 01:40:25,620
and hosted by the Georgia
Cyber Warfare Range.

1884
01:40:25,620 --> 01:40:27,690
So thanks to them for being able to host

1885
01:40:27,690 --> 01:40:29,280
our infrastructure for us.

1886
01:40:29,280 --> 01:40:31,744
They're a group of individuals
in Atlanta, Georgia,

1887
01:40:31,744 --> 01:40:35,700
who host live fire blue
and red team exercises.

1888
01:40:35,700 --> 01:40:36,533
So check them out

1889
01:40:36,533 --> 01:40:39,750
if you are interested
in that type of stuff.

1890
01:40:39,750 --> 01:40:44,750
We had 20 challenges and a
total point possibility of 480.

1891
01:40:47,130 --> 01:40:49,140
So we'll just announce
our winners real quick.

1892
01:40:49,140 --> 01:40:50,100
And they were very close.

1893
01:40:50,100 --> 01:40:52,451
They were within one
challenge of each other each.

1894
01:40:52,451 --> 01:40:57,451
So in our third place, we
had The Boar with 160 points.

1895
01:40:57,990 --> 01:40:59,740
You make some noise for them, yeah.

1896
01:41:00,778 --> 01:41:02,340
Yeah.

1897
01:41:02,340 --> 01:41:06,993
In second place we had Urchin
Sec Two with 170 points,

1898
01:41:09,900 --> 01:41:11,550
and our first place winners,

1899
01:41:11,550 --> 01:41:14,910
are Collateral Damage with 174 points.

1900
01:41:14,910 --> 01:41:16,533
It was pretty tight there.

1901
01:41:18,089 --> 01:41:19,350
Yeah, really close, right?

1902
01:41:19,350 --> 01:41:22,080
So thank you to all the
players, appreciate it.

1903
01:41:22,080 --> 01:41:24,060
And hopefully we'll have
some more new challenges

1904
01:41:24,060 --> 01:41:25,503
for you next year.

1905
01:41:35,100 --> 01:41:36,484
- All right.

1906
01:41:36,484 --> 01:41:39,330
Another long running contest
here with a newer name,

1907
01:41:39,330 --> 01:41:41,017
but long running.

1908
01:41:41,017 --> 01:41:44,280
When we look at everything around us,

1909
01:41:44,280 --> 01:41:47,487
whether it should have it
or not, it's got wifi in it.

1910
01:41:47,487 --> 01:41:50,730
And so these guys chain all
those things together and say,

1911
01:41:50,730 --> 01:41:53,631
get after it, the Radio Frequency CTF.

1912
01:41:53,631 --> 01:41:56,631
(audience clapping)

1913
01:41:59,083 --> 01:42:02,160
- [Speaker 5] There it was, there it was.

1914
01:42:05,430 --> 01:42:09,300
- So hello DEF CON 30,
back again this year,

1915
01:42:09,300 --> 01:42:13,080
radio frequency hackers sanctuary
presented the RF Village.

1916
01:42:13,080 --> 01:42:17,010
We used to be the wifi
village about 15 years ago,

1917
01:42:17,010 --> 01:42:18,589
turned that into the wireless village,

1918
01:42:18,589 --> 01:42:20,887
which then became the RF village.

1919
01:42:20,887 --> 01:42:22,940
Thanks a lot DT, Grifter.

1920
01:42:22,940 --> 01:42:25,230
And for the 15th year, I mean,

1921
01:42:25,230 --> 01:42:27,840
we're so happy to just kind
of keep doing this thing

1922
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:29,793
over and over and over again.

1923
01:42:31,380 --> 01:42:32,790
On top of the over 100 challenges

1924
01:42:32,790 --> 01:42:36,300
ranging from DC to
daylight, we were on site.

1925
01:42:36,300 --> 01:42:38,700
We had over a hundred players on site.

1926
01:42:38,700 --> 01:42:40,770
We had 40 players playing virtually.

1927
01:42:40,770 --> 01:42:43,653
So we had people worldwide
playing this time as well.

1928
01:42:44,610 --> 01:42:45,780
We really couldn't have done this

1929
01:42:45,780 --> 01:42:48,360
without the RF village team up here.

1930
01:42:48,360 --> 01:42:50,306
Thank you so much guys.

1931
01:42:50,306 --> 01:42:53,175
You just every year,
just bring it like crazy.

1932
01:42:53,175 --> 01:42:55,762
And our sponsors, Amazon, Aruba,

1933
01:42:55,762 --> 01:42:57,357
Weathered Security, Red Team Alliance,

1934
01:42:57,357 --> 01:43:00,633
Hack Five, Hacker Warehouse and Wiggle.

1935
01:43:02,388 --> 01:43:03,510
Wiggle has been absolutely
amazing this year.

1936
01:43:03,510 --> 01:43:04,770
Just give them quick props.

1937
01:43:04,770 --> 01:43:06,363
They're 21 years old this year.

1938
01:43:07,530 --> 01:43:09,454
They can drink, thank God.

1939
01:43:09,454 --> 01:43:12,049
We had two awesome Wiggle war drives,

1940
01:43:12,049 --> 01:43:15,780
worldwide war drive last week,

1941
01:43:15,780 --> 01:43:20,040
2.5 million new access points worldwide.

1942
01:43:20,040 --> 01:43:22,380
This week we did something
a little different.

1943
01:43:22,380 --> 01:43:25,437
We did the first ever indoor war walk.

1944
01:43:25,437 --> 01:43:27,540
It was four square miles,

1945
01:43:27,540 --> 01:43:32,040
27 properties and out of the
10 foxes that were hidden,

1946
01:43:32,040 --> 01:43:36,660
seven of those 10 were
found within 27 properties.

1947
01:43:36,660 --> 01:43:38,220
All of the rooms were in play.

1948
01:43:38,220 --> 01:43:40,560
Our rooms were air conditioned.

1949
01:43:40,560 --> 01:43:41,981
You were okay, if you
were out in the heat,

1950
01:43:41,981 --> 01:43:43,443
you were doing it wrong.

1951
01:43:45,942 --> 01:43:46,941
And there it goes my phone, yay.

1952
01:43:46,941 --> 01:43:48,573
Black badge winners.

1953
01:43:50,749 --> 01:43:52,590
This year they've been fighting
and fighting and fighting.

1954
01:43:52,590 --> 01:43:54,963
Finally got first place, What The Freak?

1955
01:43:57,103 --> 01:44:00,090
Good job, good job,
followed by a much smaller

1956
01:44:00,090 --> 01:44:02,130
but powerful team called Team Blunder Bus,

1957
01:44:02,130 --> 01:44:04,110
who I think is gonna
start to catch them soon.

1958
01:44:04,110 --> 01:44:06,782
Again, thank you DEF CON,
we'll see you next year.

1959
01:44:06,782 --> 01:44:09,782
(audience clapping)

1960
01:44:24,990 --> 01:44:29,990
- All right, so the SE
community village put together,

1961
01:44:30,496 --> 01:44:33,000
one, they faced an incredible challenge.

1962
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:36,360
They were coming in to
fill some very large shoes,

1963
01:44:36,360 --> 01:44:40,290
a lot of expectations on them
on what would it look like?

1964
01:44:40,290 --> 01:44:41,490
What would it feel like?

1965
01:44:41,490 --> 01:44:44,970
And for social engineering, right?

1966
01:44:44,970 --> 01:44:47,550
And so a team stepped up,

1967
01:44:47,550 --> 01:44:50,880
made up out of black badge winners

1968
01:44:50,880 --> 01:44:52,903
from competitions in the past.

1969
01:44:52,903 --> 01:44:56,220
People who lived in that village

1970
01:44:56,220 --> 01:45:00,330
in the past as well, and
if you went in there,

1971
01:45:00,330 --> 01:45:03,270
you know that they met
the challenge head on,

1972
01:45:03,270 --> 01:45:04,800
it was incredible.

1973
01:45:04,800 --> 01:45:06,120
We'll have them come up and tell you

1974
01:45:06,120 --> 01:45:07,503
about their competition,

1975
01:45:09,270 --> 01:45:10,527
The Vishing Competition.

1976
01:45:10,527 --> 01:45:13,527
(audience clapping)

1977
01:45:27,390 --> 01:45:28,380
- Hi everyone.

1978
01:45:28,380 --> 01:45:32,280
I'm JC and I am proud
to be joined by Snow.

1979
01:45:32,280 --> 01:45:35,213
Together, I got a couple claps,

1980
01:45:35,213 --> 01:45:37,350
see if I can impress you in a second.

1981
01:45:37,350 --> 01:45:39,815
We're the founders of the new
social engineering community.

1982
01:45:39,815 --> 01:45:42,630
I would like you to make some,
hang on, hang on, hang on,

1983
01:45:42,630 --> 01:45:44,374
hang on, hang on, hang on.

1984
01:45:44,374 --> 01:45:45,207
I wanna, you make some noise first

1985
01:45:45,207 --> 01:45:49,970
if you went to our village,
all right, there's the turnout.

1986
01:45:51,060 --> 01:45:53,040
You're the reason why
we chose to build this

1987
01:45:53,040 --> 01:45:54,660
and meet this task head on.

1988
01:45:54,660 --> 01:45:57,690
This was a lot of work,
if you came to the link,

1989
01:45:57,690 --> 01:46:01,890
waited in those long lines
and listened to our calls,

1990
01:46:01,890 --> 01:46:05,580
our panels, our talks, we really,
truly hope you enjoyed it.

1991
01:46:05,580 --> 01:46:08,550
Found them both entertaining and valuable.

1992
01:46:08,550 --> 01:46:09,570
This year, we were excited

1993
01:46:09,570 --> 01:46:11,640
to bring some new things with our village,

1994
01:46:11,640 --> 01:46:13,950
including our cold calls.

1995
01:46:13,950 --> 01:46:14,820
With our cold calls,

1996
01:46:14,820 --> 01:46:18,090
we gave attendees
opportunities to make a call.

1997
01:46:18,090 --> 01:46:23,090
We gave them five minutes,
three objectives, easy, medium,

1998
01:46:23,100 --> 01:46:25,200
and hard, and one phone number.

1999
01:46:25,200 --> 01:46:29,610
We placed that call, it was
on the spot, no preparation.

2000
01:46:29,610 --> 01:46:32,190
They were in there for
experience, nothing was judged.

2001
01:46:32,190 --> 01:46:34,830
There was no scores, pure experience.

2002
01:46:34,830 --> 01:46:38,730
Raise your hand, if you've
made cold calls, hang on.

2003
01:46:38,730 --> 01:46:40,110
That was stupid, let me hear you.

2004
01:46:40,110 --> 01:46:41,373
I can't see anything.

2005
01:46:43,530 --> 01:46:46,893
We were able to make 35 calls
with the time that we had.

2006
01:46:51,066 --> 01:46:52,521
- All right.

2007
01:46:52,521 --> 01:46:53,524
Okay, cool.

2008
01:46:53,524 --> 01:46:55,860
So we were really, really excited

2009
01:46:55,860 --> 01:46:58,230
to bring back one of the competitions

2010
01:46:58,230 --> 01:47:02,520
that everyone loved to watch,
our Vishing competition.

2011
01:47:02,520 --> 01:47:05,430
This year, we had 16
teams come and compete.

2012
01:47:05,430 --> 01:47:09,930
Every single one of them
showed up, which was huge.

2013
01:47:09,930 --> 01:47:11,940
A lot of them were brand new to DEF CON.

2014
01:47:11,940 --> 01:47:14,070
They've never been here before.

2015
01:47:14,070 --> 01:47:16,458
That takes a lot of guts.

2016
01:47:16,458 --> 01:47:20,880
So we are proud to give our second place

2017
01:47:20,880 --> 01:47:23,921
to team Artie Boy, round of applause.

2018
01:47:23,921 --> 01:47:27,067
(audience clapping)

2019
01:47:27,067 --> 01:47:27,900
Thank you.

2020
01:47:30,030 --> 01:47:33,090
And then with us on stage
is our first place team.

2021
01:47:33,090 --> 01:47:37,413
So we have Jen, Sean and
Matt with team Split Beans.

2022
01:47:43,804 --> 01:47:46,320
And because we're new,
we would love volunteers,

2023
01:47:46,320 --> 01:47:48,300
people who wanna be
contestants, all these things.

2024
01:47:48,300 --> 01:47:50,160
So please follow us on Twitter.

2025
01:47:50,160 --> 01:47:52,290
We are SEC_DEF CON.

2026
01:47:52,290 --> 01:47:54,600
And we also wanted to
thank everyone from DEF CON

2027
01:47:54,600 --> 01:47:57,210
who helped support us,
all of the goons, right?

2028
01:47:57,210 --> 01:47:58,290
Nikita, I love you.

2029
01:47:58,290 --> 01:48:00,120
Thank you so much, Grifter, Dark Tangent,

2030
01:48:00,120 --> 01:48:02,730
everyone for believing
us in us and showing up

2031
01:48:02,730 --> 01:48:04,869
to the village, thank you so much.

2032
01:48:04,869 --> 01:48:07,869
(audience clapping)

2033
01:48:15,420 --> 01:48:17,281
- All right, this next competition,

2034
01:48:17,281 --> 01:48:19,530
I hold near and dear to my heart.

2035
01:48:19,530 --> 01:48:23,840
When this contest was
started, years and years ago,

2036
01:48:23,840 --> 01:48:25,800
it was started by Pinguino,

2037
01:48:25,800 --> 01:48:28,170
and there was a lot of illegal stuff

2038
01:48:28,170 --> 01:48:29,070
on this scavenger list.

2039
01:48:29,070 --> 01:48:34,070
At one point, she couldn't cover the hunt.

2040
01:48:34,950 --> 01:48:36,480
She wasn't gonna be able
to make it to DEF CON.

2041
01:48:36,480 --> 01:48:38,460
And she asked me if I would take it over.

2042
01:48:38,460 --> 01:48:42,540
And I did with a group of
friends from Salt Lake City.

2043
01:48:42,540 --> 01:48:45,131
What later became DC801.

2044
01:48:45,131 --> 01:48:48,600
We ran the scavenger
hunt for several years.

2045
01:48:48,600 --> 01:48:51,052
Pinguino joining us by our side.

2046
01:48:51,052 --> 01:48:53,430
And we had an absolute blast.

2047
01:48:53,430 --> 01:48:55,740
Over the years, we would
hand it off and hand it off.

2048
01:48:55,740 --> 01:48:58,560
And every year it got better
and better and better.

2049
01:48:58,560 --> 01:49:00,780
And if you saw the scavenger hunt, yeah,

2050
01:49:00,780 --> 01:49:01,920
the statue limitations,

2051
01:49:01,920 --> 01:49:04,509
I'll tell you all kinds
of weird stuff later.

2052
01:49:04,509 --> 01:49:07,770
But if you saw the
scavenger hunt this year,

2053
01:49:07,770 --> 01:49:09,720
you saw that they raised it to a level

2054
01:49:09,720 --> 01:49:12,240
that I don't even know if anybody else

2055
01:49:12,240 --> 01:49:15,210
is ever going to be able to beat.

2056
01:49:15,210 --> 01:49:18,390
That's a challenge, but I'll bring them

2057
01:49:18,390 --> 01:49:19,350
to the stage to tell you

2058
01:49:19,350 --> 01:49:22,511
about what they put these folks
through, the scavenger hunt.

2059
01:49:22,511 --> 01:49:25,594
(audience clapping)

2060
01:49:35,460 --> 01:49:37,473
- What's up nerds?

2061
01:49:38,520 --> 01:49:39,510
- [Speaker] Here's the badge.

2062
01:49:39,510 --> 01:49:41,073
- Okay, here, hold my beer.

2063
01:49:42,690 --> 01:49:43,523
All right.

2064
01:49:45,030 --> 01:49:47,342
Okay, so I'm from the scavenger hunt.

2065
01:49:47,342 --> 01:49:50,820
And as Grifter said, last year,

2066
01:49:50,820 --> 01:49:54,990
we are always watching and always judging.

2067
01:49:54,990 --> 01:49:59,990
This year we had and Zora
and I were judging this year

2068
01:50:02,760 --> 01:50:05,223
and this was our 25th year.

2069
01:50:06,270 --> 01:50:07,230
As Grifter was saying,

2070
01:50:07,230 --> 01:50:09,780
it was started by pinguino
and he took it over

2071
01:50:09,780 --> 01:50:11,936
and then took it over and
then Salem took it over.

2072
01:50:11,936 --> 01:50:13,650
And I'm the one.

2073
01:50:13,650 --> 01:50:17,070
And we're all making this happen,
and if it wasn't for them,

2074
01:50:17,070 --> 01:50:20,133
we wouldn't be here, we wouldn't
be making DEF CON weird.

2075
01:50:21,357 --> 01:50:24,357
(audience clapping)

2076
01:50:26,220 --> 01:50:27,690
This year being so special.

2077
01:50:27,690 --> 01:50:29,849
We invited all of our
previous judges to come by

2078
01:50:29,849 --> 01:50:32,736
if they had the time and we
want to thank every one of them

2079
01:50:32,736 --> 01:50:35,583
that had the time to come
and help us run the hunt.

2080
01:50:37,740 --> 01:50:40,860
So, as he said, you couldn't miss us.

2081
01:50:40,860 --> 01:50:43,440
We're quite the spectacle
in the contest room.

2082
01:50:43,440 --> 01:50:45,720
If you didn't come in the contest room,

2083
01:50:45,720 --> 01:50:48,600
you should make it a priority
to do that next year,

2084
01:50:48,600 --> 01:50:50,493
we are a spectacle not to be missed.

2085
01:50:52,050 --> 01:50:53,910
And this year, we actually
built a soda machine

2086
01:50:53,910 --> 01:50:57,030
that was dispensing virtual machines

2087
01:50:57,030 --> 01:50:58,743
for people to hack at DEF CON.

2088
01:51:02,880 --> 01:51:04,520
And so let's see.

2089
01:51:04,520 --> 01:51:06,840
So this year it was a heated contest

2090
01:51:06,840 --> 01:51:09,690
between second place and third place

2091
01:51:09,690 --> 01:51:12,600
with a total of five points between first

2092
01:51:12,600 --> 01:51:14,130
or second and third.

2093
01:51:14,130 --> 01:51:18,873
In the end, team Fuck Howard
ended up in third place.

2094
01:51:19,860 --> 01:51:21,752
Team Hooters came in second.

2095
01:51:21,752 --> 01:51:25,230
And the first place team,
who had two of their members

2096
01:51:25,230 --> 01:51:30,230
fly to Italy last night,
are What's With the Nails.

2097
01:51:32,220 --> 01:51:35,223
So here you go, guys, you
got yourself a black badge.

2098
01:51:36,662 --> 01:51:38,070
(audience clapping)

2099
01:51:38,070 --> 01:51:39,990
If you're uninitiated,

2100
01:51:39,990 --> 01:51:44,990
you should go to DEF CONscavhunt.org
or DEF CONscavhunt.com,

2101
01:51:45,017 --> 01:51:47,217
we own both of them,
and look up the history

2102
01:51:48,377 --> 01:51:49,583
of the hunt and come play next year.

2103
01:51:59,130 --> 01:52:00,142
- I say this every year
and it's true every year,

2104
01:52:00,142 --> 01:52:04,301
they need no introduction,
Capture the Flag.

2105
01:52:04,301 --> 01:52:07,301
(audience clapping)

2106
01:52:31,110 --> 01:52:31,953
- Hi everybody.

2107
01:52:32,790 --> 01:52:35,553
I'm Thomas Windmill from
the Nautilus Institute.

2108
01:52:37,050 --> 01:52:39,690
One of our plans for the inaugural year

2109
01:52:39,690 --> 01:52:42,720
of the Capture the Flag

2110
01:52:42,720 --> 01:52:47,381
was a return to form to
allow DEF CON CTF to be weird

2111
01:52:47,381 --> 01:52:50,160
and to allow more
shenanigans to be in the game

2112
01:52:50,160 --> 01:52:55,160
than we've seen in past
years, shenanigans were had,

2113
01:52:55,800 --> 01:52:58,203
and our infrastructure greatly suffered.

2114
01:52:59,700 --> 01:53:02,010
We are deeply appreciative of the grace

2115
01:53:02,010 --> 01:53:06,180
and patience that our teams
showed us as we worked through.

2116
01:53:06,180 --> 01:53:09,120
What in retrospect was the
most predictable problem

2117
01:53:09,120 --> 01:53:09,953
in the world.

2118
01:53:11,670 --> 01:53:14,430
One of the things that DT has been asking

2119
01:53:14,430 --> 01:53:15,780
for quite some time

2120
01:53:15,780 --> 01:53:18,630
is a way for CTF spectators
to get a better understanding

2121
01:53:18,630 --> 01:53:22,752
of the game and what exactly
it is our players are doing.

2122
01:53:22,752 --> 01:53:25,110
In moving in that direction,

2123
01:53:25,110 --> 01:53:28,473
we introduced a new part of
our game this year, live CTF.

2124
01:53:31,260 --> 01:53:32,640
- Thanks Thomas.

2125
01:53:32,640 --> 01:53:33,960
I'm really excited to be representing

2126
01:53:33,960 --> 01:53:37,170
live CTF that was able to
be a sub event this year

2127
01:53:37,170 --> 01:53:38,850
during the finals to at least showcase

2128
01:53:38,850 --> 01:53:42,450
exactly how impressive all the
teams are that participate.

2129
01:53:42,450 --> 01:53:43,470
During the finals,

2130
01:53:43,470 --> 01:53:46,110
we ran a one V one single
elimination tournament

2131
01:53:46,110 --> 01:53:48,420
between the best members of each team,

2132
01:53:48,420 --> 01:53:51,000
where any points or any
wins gathered them points

2133
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:52,530
for the main event.

2134
01:53:52,530 --> 01:53:53,970
Everyone did amazing.

2135
01:53:53,970 --> 01:53:56,670
Even participating in such
a nerve-wracking environment

2136
01:53:56,670 --> 01:54:01,230
is challenging, but
congratulations to C2, W2, M2,

2137
01:54:01,230 --> 01:54:02,340
from team Starbucks

2138
01:54:02,340 --> 01:54:05,220
for our first place finish
and some amazing challenges

2139
01:54:05,220 --> 01:54:07,080
themselves about throughout the way,

2140
01:54:07,080 --> 01:54:09,870
check it out on live
ctf.com to see the videos

2141
01:54:09,870 --> 01:54:12,723
of every match and all the
scores and challenges as well.

2142
01:54:14,272 --> 01:54:17,272
(audience clapping)

2143
01:54:21,450 --> 01:54:22,560
- So after all of this,

2144
01:54:22,560 --> 01:54:24,300
I'm proud to announce the results

2145
01:54:24,300 --> 01:54:26,300
of this year's DEF CON Capture the Flag.

2146
01:54:27,780 --> 01:54:29,790
In third place, we have StarBugs,

2147
01:54:29,790 --> 01:54:31,653
the champions of the live CTF.

2148
01:54:38,244 --> 01:54:40,230
and second place we have Katzebit,

2149
01:54:40,230 --> 01:54:42,843
who were last year's
DEF CON CTF champions.

2150
01:54:48,630 --> 01:54:49,680
And in first place,

2151
01:54:49,680 --> 01:54:53,175
we had the Maple Mallard Magistrates.

2152
01:54:53,175 --> 01:54:56,175
(audience clapping)

2153
01:55:13,680 --> 01:55:16,020
- That's the last one, number eight.

2154
01:55:19,656 --> 01:55:21,109
Should we let them say anything?

2155
01:55:21,109 --> 01:55:21,942
- Yeah.

2156
01:55:21,942 --> 01:55:24,092
What was it like, team
captain, come on up.

2157
01:55:26,652 --> 01:55:29,485
(people laughing)

2158
01:55:33,175 --> 01:55:34,728
- All right.

2159
01:55:34,728 --> 01:55:38,190
My first time, so never talked
in front of this many people.

2160
01:55:38,190 --> 01:55:41,523
So thank you for running the CTF.

2161
01:55:42,630 --> 01:55:44,790
As a long time CTF player,

2162
01:55:44,790 --> 01:55:48,660
I know it's very challenging
and requires a lot of sacrifice

2163
01:55:48,660 --> 01:55:50,430
to run a CTF competition,

2164
01:55:50,430 --> 01:55:54,060
especially when the world's
best hackers are your audience

2165
01:55:54,060 --> 01:55:55,920
and congratulations to other teams

2166
01:55:55,920 --> 01:55:58,644
as well that played and competed with us.

2167
01:55:58,644 --> 01:56:02,100
It was definitely challenging,
but fun nonetheless.

2168
01:56:02,100 --> 01:56:05,677
I look forward seeing you all
again next year, thank you.

2169
01:56:05,677 --> 01:56:08,677
(audience clapping)

2170
01:56:19,918 --> 01:56:22,200
- Okay.

2171
01:56:22,200 --> 01:56:23,600
Oh yeah, that's right, okay.

2172
01:56:27,210 --> 01:56:28,654
- All right.

2173
01:56:28,654 --> 01:56:33,180
So there was an accidental
omission from the slide deck.

2174
01:56:33,180 --> 01:56:35,703
And so I just want to call
out that if you noticed

2175
01:56:35,703 --> 01:56:39,870
all the different teams here
have different badge types,

2176
01:56:39,870 --> 01:56:44,870
press, contests, events,
villages, CFP review,

2177
01:56:45,540 --> 01:56:47,010
and all of that coordination

2178
01:56:47,010 --> 01:56:49,230
and handling all of those
different badge types,

2179
01:56:49,230 --> 01:56:51,870
checking them in, making
sure the right people

2180
01:56:51,870 --> 01:56:53,580
have the right kinds of badges,

2181
01:56:53,580 --> 01:56:56,520
is a team called Inhuman Registration.

2182
01:56:56,520 --> 01:56:59,340
That handle all badge types
besides human registration

2183
01:56:59,340 --> 01:57:02,340
and between the two we distributed

2184
01:57:02,340 --> 01:57:05,695
about 25,000 badges this year.

2185
01:57:05,695 --> 01:57:08,695
(audience clapping)

2186
01:57:12,870 --> 01:57:13,703
Yep.

2187
01:57:14,880 --> 01:57:17,700
Next slide, okay, here it comes.

2188
01:57:17,700 --> 01:57:20,733
Are you ready to rumble?

2189
01:57:25,350 --> 01:57:30,350
So, some of you might remember
the Black Badge Raffle,

2190
01:57:32,700 --> 01:57:34,590
which was a troll,

2191
01:57:34,590 --> 01:57:36,750
which was in another troll
and then the next year

2192
01:57:36,750 --> 01:57:40,230
another troll, but we
were thinking DEF CON 30,

2193
01:57:40,230 --> 01:57:42,093
maybe it's not a troll.

2194
01:57:43,470 --> 01:57:47,703
And to tell you this story, come on up.

2195
01:57:49,410 --> 01:57:52,143
It's not quite a troll,
but it might be a troll.

2196
01:57:55,650 --> 01:57:56,513
- How you doing?

2197
01:57:59,336 --> 01:58:00,330
I am Sonico.

2198
01:58:00,330 --> 01:58:02,013
I am one of the sock goons.

2199
01:58:02,910 --> 01:58:04,590
For the last several years,

2200
01:58:04,590 --> 01:58:09,210
we've been doing the
troll, basically since 26

2201
01:58:09,210 --> 01:58:12,000
we wanted to encourage the
shenanigans, by the way,

2202
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:15,483
I am sorry for the cluster
fuck from 26 kind of.

2203
01:58:16,357 --> 01:58:17,485
- [Speaker] Are you?

2204
01:58:17,485 --> 01:58:19,350
- Yeah, but am I really?

2205
01:58:19,350 --> 01:58:21,810
So three months ago, I had an idea.

2206
01:58:21,810 --> 01:58:24,240
I reached out to Nikita
who reached out to DT.

2207
01:58:24,240 --> 01:58:25,260
We had a conversation.

2208
01:58:25,260 --> 01:58:26,790
I told him, hey, you know what,

2209
01:58:26,790 --> 01:58:28,710
let's try and make this thing real.

2210
01:58:28,710 --> 01:58:32,010
So he said, okay, fuck it.

2211
01:58:32,010 --> 01:58:34,110
Let's go put the pool on the rooftop.

2212
01:58:34,110 --> 01:58:35,994
And then I said, oh fuck,

2213
01:58:35,994 --> 01:58:38,820
I actually have to do homework now.

2214
01:58:38,820 --> 01:58:42,243
So three months ago I started
making my first badge,

2215
01:58:43,151 --> 01:58:44,850
which is the black badge raffle badge

2216
01:58:44,850 --> 01:58:47,610
that you've been seeing running around.

2217
01:58:47,610 --> 01:58:50,280
So first and foremost, I
wanna thank a lot of people.

2218
01:58:50,280 --> 01:58:52,680
My girlfriend, for helping
we with the pick and place

2219
01:58:52,680 --> 01:58:55,020
for the assembly, she kicked ass.

2220
01:58:55,020 --> 01:58:57,450
It would not have
happened without her help,

2221
01:58:57,450 --> 01:59:00,660
scav hunt for a thousand
different reasons.

2222
01:59:00,660 --> 01:59:02,434
Seriously, you guys kick ass.

2223
01:59:02,434 --> 01:59:05,155
The goons were helping
me hand these things out,

2224
01:59:05,155 --> 01:59:08,341
the info goons for telling
you guys to fuck off

2225
01:59:08,341 --> 01:59:12,420
and not XOR DC 26 bender badge

2226
01:59:12,420 --> 01:59:15,033
is where I stole most
of the code that works.

2227
01:59:16,050 --> 01:59:17,940
All of the code that works is from them.

2228
01:59:17,940 --> 01:59:19,803
All the code that's broken is mine.

2229
01:59:20,699 --> 01:59:25,260
DT, thank you for not
kicking me out after 26.

2230
01:59:25,260 --> 01:59:28,650
And I preemptively thank you
all for not fucking killing me

2231
01:59:28,650 --> 01:59:30,900
when I walk off this stage.

2232
01:59:30,900 --> 01:59:33,990
So for all of you who
have one of the DEF CON

2233
01:59:33,990 --> 01:59:37,260
raffle tickets for this
year, enjoy your souvenir.

2234
01:59:37,260 --> 01:59:39,056
You're not winning shit.

2235
01:59:39,056 --> 01:59:42,056
(audience clapping)

2236
01:59:45,818 --> 01:59:46,651
So.

2237
01:59:49,056 --> 01:59:50,520
Oh, you know, I do too.

2238
01:59:50,520 --> 01:59:55,170
So the way that I set this
up, the entrance for this,

2239
01:59:55,170 --> 02:00:00,170
these five humans had to give
me the tickets from 26, 27,

2240
02:00:01,950 --> 02:00:04,140
all three different colors from this year,

2241
02:00:04,140 --> 02:00:07,323
a receipt from Sav hunt
requiring what, was it 10 points?

2242
02:00:08,430 --> 02:00:10,740
Yep, and a single page,

2243
02:00:10,740 --> 02:00:13,950
single spaced report on
a topic of their choice,

2244
02:00:13,950 --> 02:00:16,020
printed and delivered to me directly

2245
02:00:16,020 --> 02:00:18,363
because I wasn't open in any attachments.

2246
02:00:19,860 --> 02:00:22,740
So the entrance would hunt for beacons,

2247
02:00:22,740 --> 02:00:25,800
hidden challenges, unlock
flags for the badge.

2248
02:00:25,800 --> 02:00:28,341
Each flag was gonna get a roll
of an 16 dice on my badge,

2249
02:00:28,341 --> 02:00:32,913
but in the vein of badge
life, I fucked it up.

2250
02:00:33,810 --> 02:00:35,460
The firmware was not complete.

2251
02:00:35,460 --> 02:00:36,720
So fuck it.

2252
02:00:36,720 --> 02:00:39,090
We'll do it live with a D20.

2253
02:00:39,090 --> 02:00:42,217
So one, two, three, four, five, 17,

2254
02:00:45,990 --> 02:00:48,213
what's three off, you, you win.

2255
02:00:49,382 --> 02:00:52,382
(audience clapping)

2256
02:00:57,116 --> 02:00:58,860
- Holy shit.

2257
02:00:58,860 --> 02:01:00,930
- So thank you.

2258
02:01:00,930 --> 02:01:02,808
Thank you again for putting up with me,

2259
02:01:02,808 --> 02:01:06,000
follow DEF CON raffle on Twitter,

2260
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:08,670
and we'll see how we can
keep the shenanigans going.

2261
02:01:08,670 --> 02:01:09,543
Thanks everybody.

2262
02:01:12,630 --> 02:01:13,477
- Right on man.

2263
02:01:17,580 --> 02:01:20,760
- I wanna thank all the departments
that make this possible.

2264
02:01:20,760 --> 02:01:22,170
If you look in the printed program,

2265
02:01:22,170 --> 02:01:23,250
you can see the shit out,

2266
02:01:23,250 --> 02:01:25,830
you can see the sheer number
of goons that it takes

2267
02:01:25,830 --> 02:01:29,130
to pull off a conference
like this, it's almost 500.

2268
02:01:29,130 --> 02:01:32,010
They're all organized
into the different groups.

2269
02:01:32,010 --> 02:01:34,290
There's about a thousand content creators.

2270
02:01:34,290 --> 02:01:38,100
So about 1500 people
at least are necessary

2271
02:01:38,100 --> 02:01:40,050
to give you the experience
that you've had here.

2272
02:01:40,050 --> 02:01:43,443
So let's see, a round of
applause for all the creators.

2273
02:01:53,130 --> 02:01:56,520
Now, every year, there's
a sort of a cycle of goons

2274
02:01:56,520 --> 02:01:59,610
that are retiring and
new goons that come on.

2275
02:01:59,610 --> 02:02:01,950
And if you've gooned for 10 years or more,

2276
02:02:01,950 --> 02:02:04,077
you get what we call the gold badge.

2277
02:02:04,077 --> 02:02:07,470
And the gold badge is like
the black badge in the sense

2278
02:02:07,470 --> 02:02:11,652
that you can continue to
attend for life for free.

2279
02:02:11,652 --> 02:02:14,520
And we would like to call
out those who are retiring

2280
02:02:14,520 --> 02:02:19,520
this year, Sunshine, Bit
Monk, Ahab, Red Beard,

2281
02:02:20,338 --> 02:02:24,663
Killer Spud, Matrix, Salem, Carrick, 33,

2282
02:02:26,160 --> 02:02:27,210
Brazil Scout,

2283
02:02:27,210 --> 02:02:32,210
Rick Q83D, Dallas, Chosen One, Crusader,

2284
02:02:34,950 --> 02:02:37,920
and Stuper, Stuper's not added, right on.

2285
02:02:37,920 --> 02:02:40,457
So thank them for 10 years, right on.

2286
02:03:01,860 --> 02:03:04,500
Without all of their help and
the help of all the goons,

2287
02:03:04,500 --> 02:03:06,813
this would not be possible, so thank you.

2288
02:03:07,770 --> 02:03:12,270
Now, behind the goons, we
have what we call the DCHQ.

2289
02:03:12,270 --> 02:03:14,633
These are the full time
year round employees

2290
02:03:14,633 --> 02:03:17,123
that help try to coordinate everything.

2291
02:03:17,123 --> 02:03:19,230
It's myself, Nikita,

2292
02:03:19,230 --> 02:03:24,230
Janet, Neil, Will, Darrington,
the other Jeff and TCMBC.

2293
02:03:25,530 --> 02:03:28,110
And this year I've got
Nikita and Janet bolded

2294
02:03:28,110 --> 02:03:32,030
because due to COVID and
some other situations,

2295
02:03:33,330 --> 02:03:35,970
they really had to step up their game.

2296
02:03:35,970 --> 02:03:37,410
And they really,

2297
02:03:37,410 --> 02:03:39,870
I mean, they're already doing great work,

2298
02:03:39,870 --> 02:03:44,760
but I think Janet and Nikita
really shown this year.

2299
02:03:44,760 --> 02:03:47,010
And I'd really like to
thank them personally

2300
02:03:47,010 --> 02:03:51,566
for their fantastic work, so
thank you for all the DCHQ.

2301
02:03:51,566 --> 02:03:54,566
(audience clapping)

2302
02:04:03,210 --> 02:04:04,377
So we're nearing the very end,

2303
02:04:04,377 --> 02:04:06,600
and I just want to call
out for those of you

2304
02:04:06,600 --> 02:04:07,560
who want to continue

2305
02:04:07,560 --> 02:04:09,719
with some DEF CON action
throughout the year,

2306
02:04:09,719 --> 02:04:13,560
we have a lot of ways to
engage with us online.

2307
02:04:13,560 --> 02:04:15,420
And over the last couple of years,

2308
02:04:15,420 --> 02:04:17,580
our Reddit channel has
really been taking off.

2309
02:04:17,580 --> 02:04:18,930
So we've added it to the slide,

2310
02:04:18,930 --> 02:04:21,423
check out our /RDEF CON Reddit.

2311
02:04:22,620 --> 02:04:25,230
We have mobile apps for
both Android and Apple

2312
02:04:25,230 --> 02:04:26,640
for the DEF CON forums.

2313
02:04:26,640 --> 02:04:29,234
And we've really been
trying to figure out post

2314
02:04:29,234 --> 02:04:34,234
sort of DEF CON 29, how
to engage more online.

2315
02:04:34,800 --> 02:04:37,890
Now next year, right,

2316
02:04:37,890 --> 02:04:41,160
next year, DEF CON 31 will be back here.

2317
02:04:41,160 --> 02:04:44,493
Registration is live, put
this date in your calendar.

2318
02:04:46,770 --> 02:04:48,720
We're gonna be here.

2319
02:04:48,720 --> 02:04:49,980
We're not going anywhere.

2320
02:04:49,980 --> 02:04:52,030
We're gonna try to figure this place out.

2321
02:05:00,660 --> 02:05:03,240
Now, we've got some content coming online.

2322
02:05:03,240 --> 02:05:04,890
I talked about some of the video,

2323
02:05:04,890 --> 02:05:07,890
a lot of the videos and
slides will all go online

2324
02:05:07,890 --> 02:05:11,100
over the next couple of
months, follow our Twitter.

2325
02:05:11,100 --> 02:05:12,500
We'll tell you all about it.

2326
02:05:13,530 --> 02:05:15,390
Now. I would normally say, thank you.

2327
02:05:15,390 --> 02:05:16,830
That is it.

2328
02:05:16,830 --> 02:05:18,410
But for the first time ever,

2329
02:05:18,410 --> 02:05:21,120
11:00 PM tonight in the chill out area,

2330
02:05:21,120 --> 02:05:22,980
there's gonna be an after party

2331
02:05:22,980 --> 02:05:24,941
for those of us still around.

2332
02:05:24,941 --> 02:05:27,941
(audience cheering)

2333
02:05:32,100 --> 02:05:35,490
And so for those of you who
won't be around that long,

2334
02:05:35,490 --> 02:05:38,460
we really like to wish a happy birthday

2335
02:05:38,460 --> 02:05:41,430
to someone who's been a long
time contributed to DEF CON.

2336
02:05:41,430 --> 02:05:44,013
El Cantaro, let us sing Happy Birthday.

2337
02:05:46,271 --> 02:05:49,475
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

2338
02:05:49,475 --> 02:05:52,959
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

2339
02:05:52,959 --> 02:05:57,578
♪ Happy birthday El Cantaro ♪

2340
02:05:57,578 --> 02:06:00,911
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

2341
02:06:05,102 --> 02:06:06,690
(person laughing)

2342
02:06:06,690 --> 02:06:07,803
I love you man.

2343
02:06:09,150 --> 02:06:10,353
Okay, get the fuck out.

2344
02:06:11,677 --> 02:06:14,260
(upbeat music)
