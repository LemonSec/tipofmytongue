1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,040
- Now, this morning,
we have Winn Schwartau,

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,630
talking to us about his history,

3
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:05,340
which is really legendary.

4
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:09,562
So sit back, enjoy, and please
give a warm welcome to Winn.

5
00:00:09,562 --> 00:00:13,645
(audience clapping and cheering)

6
00:00:17,046 --> 00:00:19,650
- Am I supposed to ask
for you to do that again

7
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:20,939
to make me feel really good?

8
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:22,792
No, no, no, no, no.
(audience laughing)

9
00:00:22,792 --> 00:00:27,647
(audience clapping and cheering)

10
00:00:27,647 --> 00:00:30,630
This'll fuck up the audio
guy in the rear, right?

11
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,517
Am I fucking it up really bad?

12
00:00:32,517 --> 00:00:35,040
(audience laughing)

13
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,303
This is gonna be a rant.

14
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:41,520
I haven't spoken at DEFCON
I guess in 15 years,

15
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,510
because I'm not the traditional hacker.

16
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:49,020
Network protocols, I
lie, I cheat, I Google

17
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:53,910
and I have a lot of good
friends, a lot smarter than me.

18
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:57,543
But I began and I didn't really
realize that I was hacking.

19
00:00:59,454 --> 00:01:00,287
And what I want to show you

20
00:01:00,287 --> 00:01:05,100
is some experiences that
I had starting in 1958.

21
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:08,400
Anybody alive in 1958?

22
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,330
Fuck you, Barry.

23
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:12,373
Really, okay.
(audience laughing)

24
00:01:12,373 --> 00:01:13,206
- [Barry] Two.

25
00:01:13,206 --> 00:01:14,039
- Oh, you were two?

26
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:19,940
And I grew up in an engineering family.

27
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,500
My father went to MIT at 15

28
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,470
and worked on radar development
during World War Two.

29
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:28,963
So he gave me a non-optional

30
00:01:28,963 --> 00:01:32,490
education on electrical engineering early.

31
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:35,700
My mother was the first audio engineer

32
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,460
at NBC during World War Two

33
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,869
and got a whole series of patents on...

34
00:01:40,869 --> 00:01:45,420
(audience clapping and cheering)

35
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,880
Yeah, my mother, I wish
she could come to DEFCON,

36
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,980
but she'd like be 140 now.

37
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:51,930
So not gonna work out.

38
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:54,783
That was my first DEFCON
and my first beer.

39
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:59,700
And this is my father giving me...

40
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,710
Every week my parents split up,

41
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:02,910
so on the weekend I went down

42
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:05,160
to my father's house in Greenwich Village

43
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,580
and watched the tourists
get mad at the beatniks,

44
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:13,020
and he gave me non-optional
electrical engineering education

45
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,760
and that went on for years and years.

46
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,190
So that ended up being weird.

47
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:21,480
But I ended up doing TV
repair work at six years old

48
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,103
because how hard was it?

49
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:27,480
You take the tubes out of the TV,

50
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:31,530
you go down to the drug
store, you test them,

51
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:34,260
you take the two dollars, get a new 12AX7,

52
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,433
go back, plug them in,

53
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:39,693
and a neighbor in the apartment
building gives me 50 cents.

54
00:02:42,617 --> 00:02:43,450
(audience clapping)

55
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:45,300
But that was in the 50s and they thought,

56
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,520
oh, how do you know how to do that?

57
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,890
Well, my father told me
how to use the tube tester.

58
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:50,723
That was really it.

59
00:02:50,723 --> 00:02:53,790
That's what our electronic
stores used to look like

60
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:56,610
when we had to build shit.

61
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:59,703
And this is the world of
computers way back then.

62
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:04,410
So my first hack was in 1958,

63
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:07,830
and anybody know what these
are called other than Barry?

64
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:11,370
Rotary telephones, of course.

65
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:13,560
So we had these obviously,

66
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,080
and some of them were four digit numbers,

67
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,930
and this is what a bill looked
like back in those days,

68
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:22,200
when you actually had to
pay rental fee for a phone

69
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,603
and a rental fee for the wire.

70
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,100
Phone calls, and this is in New York City,

71
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,470
were still 10 cents a minute,

72
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:34,650
even if I'm calling
just across the street.

73
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:37,623
So things got expensive very quickly.

74
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:43,550
And apparently I was an
unruly child and talked a lot.

75
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:49,040
So my mother locked the phone.
(audience laughing)

76
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:55,500
And, well, I wanted to make phone calls.

77
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,310
So what do you do in
a non-destructive way?

78
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:04,110
How do you hack a rotary
telephone with no tools,

79
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:10,950
no destruction whatsoever?

80
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:13,630
Well, here is the old people up here

81
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,070
and they're all giving me this.

82
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:20,190
Now, don't interpret that too
sexually, please, from them.

83
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:22,380
That's them.
(audience laughing)

84
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:23,910
Inside of these are what's called

85
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:26,100
stepper relays, decade relays,

86
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,150
and when you dial,

87
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:31,230
basically it's click
click, three or a seven,

88
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:33,000
and if you get your timing down

89
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,133
with the lock on the phone just right,

90
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:38,613
hello operator, may I help you?

91
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:43,500
And please connect me to this
long distance number in Greece

92
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,840
or to my friend across the...

93
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,370
A non-destructive hack

94
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:50,640
that my mother then on
the next bill came along

95
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,990
and it was too much and she goes,

96
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:54,804
so you figured it the fuck out, did you?

97
00:04:54,804 --> 00:04:57,540
(audience laughing)

98
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:58,560
Was it smart?

99
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,140
No, it was just a kid not accepting

100
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:06,300
that there was a lock
that I could not bypass,

101
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:10,260
even though it was a
completely non-technical hack.

102
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:12,480
So I'm screwing around
with analog computers

103
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,550
and stuff throughout the years,

104
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:17,853
and everybody know who
Richard Stallman is?

105
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:20,523
I grew up with him,

106
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:24,663
but I didn't remember that until I hit 60,

107
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:30,180
because we knew him as
Dickie, Dickie Stallman,

108
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:33,750
and so he and I built
little transistor radios

109
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,430
and all sorts of crap,

110
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:39,002
and his mother was a MILF, just saying.

111
00:05:39,002 --> 00:05:42,002
(audience laughing)

112
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,023
Shut up, Ben, out.

113
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:52,080
Now, the neighborhood drug
stores back in those days

114
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,090
would hire a bunch of us kids

115
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:56,700
for like three hours a week each

116
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,020
to spread a little bit

117
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:01,590
of the 80 cents an hour
wealth or whatever,

118
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:03,300
and inside of there, of course,

119
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,433
you see there's a phone booth.

120
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:08,730
And those were the phones of the day.

121
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:13,500
And of course, we wanted
to make phone calls,

122
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,710
but we're like 10 years
old, how do you do it?

123
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,933
How do you do it for free?

124
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:22,890
Well, that's the way
these things used to work.

125
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:23,850
Stick them in the slot,

126
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,710
and this is the US
system, it was different,

127
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:26,760
and you couldn't do this hack

128
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,520
in other countries and not everywhere.

129
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,463
So here are the pieces to the hack.

130
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:38,583
Chinese laundry cardboard and a penny.

131
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:42,510
What we did, and there was

132
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:46,110
a design feature or fault by AT&T,

133
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:48,210
depending upon how you look at it,

134
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:51,750
you take a sliver of
one of those cardboards,

135
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:56,750
slide it down the dime slot,
all the way to the bottom,

136
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:03,320
pick up the receiver, put
a penny in the nickel slot.

137
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:08,832
It registers as a dime and
you get your penny back.

138
00:07:08,832 --> 00:07:10,410
(audience laughing)

139
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:13,350
So if you have a pocket full of pennies,

140
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:15,630
calling Greece with the operator,

141
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:19,230
long distance operator on
the phone, is a no brainer

142
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:23,490
and they're getting a
legitimate money trigger.

143
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:27,300
And we lived at that drug store for years

144
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,710
making those kind of calls.

145
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:31,800
And again, it was a stupid, stupid,

146
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:36,800
but highly effective way
to bypass the security,

147
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:40,800
the features, the controls that
were built into that system.

148
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,390
So then I go on to high school

149
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:44,250
and they've got a computer thing,

150
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:46,833
and high school and I
didn't get along very well.

151
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,970
So I sort of left in 11th grade

152
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,010
and decided to go into
the family business,

153
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:57,690
the recording industry,
music, TV and all that stuff,

154
00:07:57,690 --> 00:07:59,463
and I was 16 years old.

155
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,850
So that was the first
studio I got to work at,

156
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:04,530
which was fairly overwhelming,

157
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:07,950
except for the fact that my father did it,

158
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:10,380
and I had been exposed to the studios

159
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:12,450
and it really wasn't all that scary.

160
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:13,620
Anybody know who that is?

161
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,720
My first recording session.

162
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,953
Shout it out, anybody.

163
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,593
Nugent, it was the Nuge.

164
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,160
He would get naked in the
studio and hump the console.

165
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:26,993
Just saying.

166
00:08:26,993 --> 00:08:29,610
Please don't repeat
that and publicize that.

167
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:33,090
And then this was my
first mechanical system.

168
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:37,620
It was a cyber mechanical system
for cutting records, vinyl.

169
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,870
Some of you may remember vinyl.

170
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:42,213
And this is how we used to do that.

171
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:48,080
Now, later on in life,
I was at the studios

172
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:49,050
and there was a thing

173
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:52,020
that used to be called
telephone credit cards

174
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:53,940
and there's one of them.

175
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,350
And once you got the number

176
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:57,180
and you got the number by paying a guy

177
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:00,123
on Eighth Avenue and 42nd Street a dollar,

178
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,030
you do that until the FBI

179
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:06,540
decides to wrap you around
their heads a little bit.

180
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,760
So that was my first visit from the FBI

181
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,950
for doing some sort of crime.

182
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,720
So that was 1969.

183
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,290
It was not a hack, it was
pure out and out theft.

184
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:17,970
So then I get involved with Hendrix

185
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:21,570
and all these guys doing
complex systems, Robert Moog,

186
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:23,550
and that's the first synthesizer

187
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:26,250
down from Electric Lady
Studios in New York.

188
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:30,750
So I kept seeing and being
involved with complex systems.

189
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:33,450
This is where I learned
that assembly language and I

190
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:35,463
do not get along either.

191
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:41,840
And I built it, it semi sort
of worked, and that was enough.

192
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,300
That was a computer that
we used deck computers

193
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:49,050
to do synchronization for TV shows.

194
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:50,760
And this one was from Applause!

195
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,640
And trying to make a deck
computer back in those days

196
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,710
actually do what you want it to do

197
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:58,383
was an incredibly slow process.

198
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,580
Back in, this was the day
in our studios in New York,

199
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:05,130
we had our own telephone
exchanges back in the day.

200
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:06,420
So how do you hack that?

201
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:08,370
Because what we needed to do

202
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:13,370
was get audio from the New York
studios into the LA studios,

203
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:19,070
but AT&T wanted $1,500
an hour in 1970 dollars,

204
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,480
to be able to do that connection.

205
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,450
But we had a switchboard.

206
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:30,690
And once you have the
switchboard and the PBX system,

207
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:33,510
you can bypass very easily the controls

208
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:35,490
and get directly out to LA

209
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:38,730
and move the audio back and forth.

210
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:41,343
Again, is it a hack by today's standards?

211
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:45,813
From our standpoint, it got the job done.

212
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:51,960
So being broke back in
those days and a roommate,

213
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:55,200
we used to get our utility
bills on punch cards.

214
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,150
Did anybody ever do that?

215
00:10:57,150 --> 00:11:01,470
All right, one old guy,
two old guys, fair enough.

216
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:02,688
Is that you, Mark?

217
00:11:02,688 --> 00:11:03,521
- [Mark] Yes, it is.
- It is.

218
00:11:03,521 --> 00:11:05,460
Well take your mask off
so I can see your face.

219
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:06,293
Thank you.

220
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,593
Yeah, let's hear it for
G Mark, come on, yeah.

221
00:11:10,593 --> 00:11:14,010
(audience clapping)

222
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:17,970
So, we used to get our bills
and what is it we want to do?

223
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:22,970
Not pay them, and keep
the power and the phones.

224
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,100
So we had access of course

225
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,860
to computers at NYU, what have you,

226
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:33,420
and then we discovered by
looking at the punch card,

227
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:37,173
the dollar amount, let's say it was $7.32,

228
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,613
there were no fields to
the left of the number.

229
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:44,343
So what did we do?

230
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:47,674
Add a minus sign.

231
00:11:47,674 --> 00:11:49,560
(audience laughing)

232
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:53,940
Every month, we got a check
for the amount of service

233
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:56,766
that we used the month before.

234
00:11:56,766 --> 00:11:59,766
(audience clapping)

235
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:05,550
Wait a minute, is this
doing a live thing of me?

236
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:07,125
Oh, shit.

237
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:09,360
(audience laughing)

238
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,760
I wonder if we can say that.

239
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:13,257
Oh, shit, okay (laughing).

240
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:21,470
So, that's how it worked
for about two years

241
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:23,970
and they upped their security at that

242
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:25,170
a little bit after that.

243
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,960
So then I got hired to do

244
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,930
a build a studio complex for some guys,

245
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:32,340
and while they wanted to pay me

246
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:34,950
reasonably good money back in the day,

247
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:37,863
they had virtually no
budget for equipment.

248
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,280
And what we needed to do was tie together

249
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:46,020
all of these studios
throughout the facility,

250
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:47,880
and there were eight or 10 of them,

251
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:51,600
and instead of the big patch
bay, they couldn't afford,

252
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,200
or the wiring associated,
which they couldn't afford,

253
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,323
we decided we have another option here.

254
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,460
Who pictures this?

255
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:05,460
Yeah, AT&T.

256
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:06,570
AT&T owned the universe.

257
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:08,940
Them and IBM owned the universe back then.

258
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,590
And the AT&T building

259
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:14,790
was about five blocks away on 11th Avenue.

260
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:15,900
And what did we do?

261
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:18,123
We did what is now called dumpster diving,

262
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:22,860
looking for old AT&T
equipment that they threw out,

263
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:25,560
because if there was
one little thing wrong,

264
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,690
they would just toss it out,

265
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:29,610
which meant from our standpoint,

266
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:30,443
all we have to do

267
00:13:30,443 --> 00:13:33,810
is find the one little
thing wrong and fix it,

268
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:35,523
but it was all free.

269
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:39,180
So by putting all of this stuff together

270
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,890
and repurposing this equipment,

271
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:43,980
we were able to build recording studios

272
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:47,740
and switching networks,
using stepper relays

273
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,040
the same way that we used to,

274
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,110
I hacked the phone when I was a kid.

275
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:53,850
And the stepper relay was the key to it,

276
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:57,990
because you could dial up
anything you wanted to do.

277
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:59,820
So there was a rack of dials

278
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:03,150
and it rerouted all of
the signals everywhere

279
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:05,130
throughout the recording complex

280
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:07,380
and it didn't cost us a dime.

281
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,693
Thank you, AT&T for that one.

282
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:14,490
My first home computer,
where again, I learned,

283
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:17,520
I'm a really shitty programmer.

284
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,480
I'm awful.

285
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:22,410
I got it to work semi
sort of kind of kludgy

286
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:24,630
and that was when my wife first said

287
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:28,770
that she was now a computer
widow, and that was in '78.

288
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:32,438
Oh, there's my wife, and
what happened with my wife...

289
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:34,588
(audience clapping)
Well, thank you, Mike.

290
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:39,429
My wife, she built recording consoles

291
00:14:39,429 --> 00:14:43,050
and this was the first computerized,

292
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:47,643
automated recording console, 1979.

293
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:52,020
Never fucking worked.
(audience laughing)

294
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:54,030
I kept blaming my wife
for it and she goes,

295
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:55,800
I didn't wire those.

296
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,380
But it was one of these...

297
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:02,640
You had to know 700 control commands

298
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:07,050
and do all phase shift antenna metal

299
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:10,050
in order to make anything
attempt to work and it didn't.

300
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:11,190
And that was one of the projects

301
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:12,810
that we were trying to make it work,

302
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:15,783
and fuck it, just completely gave up.

303
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:19,740
I had a studio in New York for a while.

304
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:24,720
So, that was the background
on which we started,

305
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,113
or I started learning
there's always an answer.

306
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,330
It's like that Apollo,

307
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:33,273
one of the greatest scenes
in movie history, Apollo 13,

308
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:37,350
this is what they have up there,

309
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:42,030
that's all you get to
work with, nothing else.

310
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:46,200
So back in these days, I was
doing a lot of studio work,

311
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:49,920
I was on the road with
various music artists,

312
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,590
and as we always say at DEFCON,

313
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:55,620
something's always gonna
fuck up completely.

314
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:58,980
Well, I'm gonna tell you about
a couple of those fuck ups,

315
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:01,413
and we had to hack our way out of them.

316
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:05,970
1975, 1976, I don't
even remember the year,

317
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:08,700
we were in Kingston, Jamaica,

318
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:11,160
and it was a thing with
the British government

319
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,750
and they were trying to make peace

320
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,610
because there were troubles down there,

321
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:18,873
and Stevie Wonder and Bob
Marley were the big acts.

322
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:23,440
So we had to build riot
cages into the stage

323
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:29,390
because of the suspected
possibility of terrorism

324
00:16:30,393 --> 00:16:32,757
that the British embassy
had told us about.

325
00:16:32,757 --> 00:16:36,300
And I remember, I think I'm
23 years old here going,

326
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:40,233
terrorism, concert, fuck me, get me home.

327
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:45,720
Well, concert goes on, soccer stadium,

328
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:50,400
120,000 people in the soccer stadium,

329
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:55,400
and keep in mind that Jamaican
police don't have police.

330
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:02,010
Ergo, the riot cages built into the stage.

331
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:06,940
So the chaos was suddenly

332
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:13,020
all of the lights and
all of the sound went off

333
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:17,733
with 120,000 reggaeing
people in the audience.

334
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,537
The fuck do you do?

335
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:26,441
We're in a foreign country,
we don't know where the...

336
00:17:26,441 --> 00:17:28,050
It was like, give us a plug.

337
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:28,980
It's like what we say,

338
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:32,250
give me clean internet and
I'll take it from there.

339
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,090
That's all we wanted.

340
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:35,250
Give us some good power.

341
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:39,000
Except in this case
there was so much power,

342
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,043
the pole transformer went.

343
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:45,450
120,000 people.
What do you do?

344
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:49,683
Well, one of the absolutely
stoned out of his mind groupies,

345
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:56,840
it was his, not mine, CO2 cools
things down really quickly.

346
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,948
So we had two of the group...

347
00:17:59,948 --> 00:18:03,840
Not the groupies, roadies,
sorry, not groupies,

348
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,450
roadies get the CO2s
that we happened to have

349
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:09,510
because we had two of
equipment and it gets hot,

350
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:11,910
went over to start cooling
down the transformer

351
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:15,753
as they start to get
arrested for terrorism.

352
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:22,980
And it took a few minutes in
order to get them to realize

353
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:27,510
we would like your help
keeping this, and it was a...

354
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:31,980
But we hacked the entire
power system for the stadium

355
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:34,560
with several cans of CO2,

356
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:37,260
and the concert finally went on.

357
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:40,890
Sort of like Jeopardy last
night, we finally got there.

358
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:42,570
Took a while, but we...

359
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:45,243
And again, is this a true hack?

360
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:48,990
I don't care what word
you want to use for it,

361
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:53,523
it was when the shit really
fucking hits the fan,

362
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:55,800
what do you do?

363
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,800
And you've got to pull
out every single stop,

364
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,470
and I get into rants
about graceful degradation

365
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:03,297
and enterprise networks and things,

366
00:19:03,297 --> 00:19:05,400
and I talk to the CISOs, I say,

367
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,610
where's your graceful degradation
and segmentation plan?

368
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:09,560
And I go, say what?

369
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:13,463
All right, well you've never
been in rock and roll, dude.

370
00:19:13,463 --> 00:19:14,440
(audience laughing)

371
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,380
So there's a few takeaways

372
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:19,330
and the slides will all be
available for you guys later on.

373
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:22,680
I absolutely love Liza Minnelli.

374
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:25,290
We recorded Liza With a Z,

375
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:29,670
and what she did in the
studio was rather amazing.

376
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:31,110
She drank a bottle of scotch,

377
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:33,483
took her clothes off
and proceeded to sing.

378
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:36,990
All right, if that's the
way you want to do it, Liza.

379
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:39,720
So the whole object was gonna be a TV show

380
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,830
called Liza With a Z.

381
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:45,060
She was coming back and doing,
now gonna be famous again.

382
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:49,740
So live shows, live thing
went absolutely fine,

383
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:51,720
but we need to go back to the studio.

384
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:56,400
Now, in those days we had film, deck,

385
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,950
we had a video (indistinct) a little bit,

386
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:00,513
but made mostly film,

387
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:05,613
and an audio machine with
a thing called pilot tone.

388
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,860
Nobody's probably ever heard...

389
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:10,470
Anybody ever hear of pilot tone?

390
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:13,080
Oh, Masuchi, of course you
have, you're as old as...

391
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:16,200
I went to high school with
this motherfucker up here.

392
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,050
Ninth grade, I've known him 56 years.

393
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:20,643
Thanks for coming, Mike.

394
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,070
So you get back to the studio

395
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:25,500
and you expect the pilot tone on the film

396
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,963
and the mag stripe to work
with the audio, right?

397
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,010
Well, not so much.

398
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:33,930
Completely out of sync.

399
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:38,280
And we have a live
broadcast coming up on NBC.

400
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:42,180
The fuck do you do when
you're completely out of sync?

401
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:44,160
Well, you cobble together.

402
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,930
This is very sophisticated equipment

403
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:48,060
compared to what we have.

404
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:51,450
We cobbled together a set
of oscillators and power,

405
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,880
two power amplifiers,

406
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:57,510
to drive a set of hysteresis
synchronous motors,

407
00:20:57,510 --> 00:21:00,150
for anybody that may
remember what those are

408
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:02,850
before the DC motors came along,

409
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:06,510
and that (indistinct) pattern,
the one that you see there,

410
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:10,860
we had to take dials on the
oscillators and the machines

411
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:13,500
because they introduced
friction into the system,

412
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:16,920
and maintain that (indistinct) pattern

413
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,683
for four hours by hand.

414
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:23,220
Did it always work?

415
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:24,690
No, sometimes the high hat

416
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:26,970
and the video was off a little bit,

417
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:30,510
but in general it was the
best that we could do.

418
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:33,360
We cobbled together some
equipment that didn't exist

419
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,340
and we went to the shop and did it.

420
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:37,140
Again, is it a hack?

421
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:39,330
We got the job done when otherwise

422
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:42,330
there would not have been
a TV broadcast at all.

423
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:45,150
Synchronization failures were a disaster

424
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:47,730
in the early days of
the recording industry

425
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:50,610
because everybody in the late
70s and early 80s is saying,

426
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:54,330
we're gonna go digital,
digital will fix everything.

427
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:57,150
Except for those of you who
remember what digital was like

428
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:59,280
in the late 70s and early 80s,

429
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,743
it was really highly experimental.

430
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,590
So we did a lot of experimentation

431
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:08,070
of how do you get,
instead of just 24 tracks,

432
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:10,860
how do you get 48 tracks?

433
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:14,430
And can I record 24 of
the tracks live in LA,

434
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:17,250
the other 24 live in New York

435
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:19,590
and keep them all
synchronized with equipment

436
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:21,240
that doesn't work from England?

437
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:24,480
No offense to my British
friends out there.

438
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:28,182
Well, synchronization was awful.

439
00:22:28,182 --> 00:22:30,933
Remember the song, Do You Think I'm Sexy?

440
00:22:31,845 --> 00:22:33,240
With Rod Stewart.

441
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:38,240
We were on that session for
72 hours, 72 straight hours,

442
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:45,200
just trying to keep the drum
tracks from that song from LA

443
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:49,260
in sync with the audio

444
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:52,440
and the voice being recorded in New York.

445
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:56,100
That was 72 hours of absolute
hell where we had to, again,

446
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,620
revert to graceful degradation

447
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:03,030
and a manual mode of
working, completely manual,

448
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:06,750
and you could grab a few seconds of sync

449
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:07,950
and it would fall out again.

450
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:10,680
So it was an absolute nightmare.

451
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,350
But synchronization in our world

452
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:16,170
is about what makes everything work,

453
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:17,760
and getting the timing right.

454
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,570
We've all heard the stories
of, well, my clock was on CST

455
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:24,690
and their clock was on
Central European Time.

456
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:26,160
We were eight hours off.

457
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,620
Or I'm using an Imperial
measurement system

458
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:30,870
versus a Metric system,

459
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:32,910
and everything completely fucks up.

460
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:37,350
The synchronization issues
that we faced are very similar

461
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:40,710
to the types of synchronization
issues that we face today,

462
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:45,710
but are much more profound
aspects of what can go wrong.

463
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:47,670
And that's why thinking synchronization

464
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:50,040
is so incredibly critical.

465
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,990
Charlie Daniels, I got flown in from LA

466
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:55,440
to record him in Madison Square Garden.

467
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,703
My crew was there.

468
00:23:57,630 --> 00:24:00,750
Everything should have gone very smoothly.

469
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:04,440
However, what we were supposed to do

470
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:08,160
was record Charlie Daniels
and the event and the bands

471
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:12,300
through a fairly large console
onto a 16 track tape machine.

472
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:16,173
Fairly normal activity
for us back in those days.

473
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:21,060
So you have 40 microphones
go into the console,

474
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:23,310
branch them out and record them properly

475
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:26,880
on the appropriate channel
on the audio machine.

476
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:31,080
Except, and no offense to any
union people in this room,

477
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:34,550
but back in the day, Madison
Square Garden, (indistinct),

478
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:40,200
hired the most incompetent
people known to man

479
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:43,473
to assist us in our professional
recording endeavors.

480
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:50,840
Every single microphone
signal was ground looped.

481
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:52,920
So every single input,

482
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:57,920
all 40 of them had
exactly the same signal.

483
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:01,560
Right.

484
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:05,520
No isolation, no differentiation,

485
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,680
and we actually had to do it all live

486
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:13,620
with massive amounts of
equalization and digital filtering,

487
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:16,920
such as existed in 1981,

488
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:20,220
to be able to get it
down to a mono machine,

489
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:21,660
and then have to go to the studio

490
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:24,360
and rebuild the whole thing from scratch.

491
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:27,090
So audio quality, if anybody's interested,

492
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:29,580
I actually have the vinyl from that,

493
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:33,450
the audio quality is absolutely awful,

494
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:36,510
but the radio stations
didn't seem to give a shit,

495
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:38,400
because they were broadcasting on AM

496
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,890
and the quality was so bad anyway.

497
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:44,370
So this was about
preparation and architecting

498
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:48,840
and never really trusting folks to do it,

499
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,430
do the jobs that you expected,

500
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:53,670
especially in that environment
back in those days.

501
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:55,530
So there's plenty of realities,

502
00:25:55,530 --> 00:25:58,230
and I spent a lot of
time doing remote work,

503
00:25:58,230 --> 00:26:00,930
and remote work is where
if it can go wrong,

504
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:03,270
it's gonna go fucking wrong

505
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:05,520
and it's gonna go wrong in a big way,

506
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,720
and these are just a
couple of the examples.

507
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,030
There was a studio we
worked at called R One

508
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:14,490
and it was a jingle
studio back in the days

509
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:18,240
and the money making for
the recording industry

510
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,130
that would support artists

511
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:22,623
was from the jingle
houses for advertising.

512
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:25,413
So it was pretty straight ahead stuff.

513
00:26:27,389 --> 00:26:30,270
So the studio was roughly like this

514
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:32,340
and 40 musicians out there,

515
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:35,400
the producer from whatever company it was,

516
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,260
like I said, this one was Alka-Seltzer

517
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:39,873
and the jingle house,
they're all sitting there,

518
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:43,030
and then they'd say to me,

519
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:47,109
Winn, is there supposed to be smoke

520
00:26:47,109 --> 00:26:49,023
coming out of the console?

521
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:51,783
Oh, fuck.

522
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,990
So we got 40 guys and we got a console

523
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:57,033
that just went up in smoke.

524
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,173
What do you do?

525
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,160
What do you do?

526
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,873
Well, you panic.

527
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,107
And back in those days,
we had these things,

528
00:27:07,107 --> 00:27:08,970
and I think some of the
AV guys still use them,

529
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:10,380
they're called SM.

530
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:14,400
They're mixers, little tiny,
sure, four channel mixers.

531
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,510
So what did we have to do?

532
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:18,480
We had to get all the
gophers in the studio,

533
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:23,010
extend all the microphones,
wires about 100 feet,

534
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:24,390
wire them into the studio,

535
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:27,750
put them into the back
of these little mixers,

536
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:30,960
take those mixers, bypass the console,

537
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,310
go into the tape machine

538
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:35,760
where we can manually control the levels

539
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,390
throughout the entire session

540
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:42,030
and never be able to
hear what was going on

541
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:45,210
until we did a playback
to see how good it was.

542
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:47,070
That was sheer chaos.

543
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:51,120
But again, there was a way to do it.

544
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,850
We understood the architecture

545
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:56,580
of what we were trying to achieve.

546
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:59,040
We understood what we had in the consoles,

547
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:02,850
how do we replicate
the console feature set

548
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:06,390
into something else in under 20 minutes?

549
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:08,880
And it's a bitch, but these are the things

550
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,940
that have brought me into
the security industry,

551
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:15,930
always thinking of what
the hell can go wrong?

552
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:17,400
And maybe that's why I wrote

553
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,200
several of the books on these topics

554
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:24,200
of what can go wrong when you
don't really think about it.

555
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:26,093
Charlie...

556
00:28:26,093 --> 00:28:28,053
That's Hank Williams Jr.

557
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,540
We were doing a thing in New York.

558
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:33,780
Anybody ever hear of the
Lone Star Cafe in New York?

559
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:34,613
Yeah.

560
00:28:34,613 --> 00:28:36,840
We had a studio in the basement of it,

561
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:41,800
and every week we'd record
whatever the act was live

562
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:47,760
to 570 radio stations across the country.

563
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,470
Not really a big deal technically,

564
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:50,430
we knew what we were doing,

565
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:53,013
we had the tie lines and
everything went well.

566
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:57,840
Hank Williams is up
there, and he's playing,

567
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:02,280
and a couple of guys whose
particular orientation

568
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,263
he was not thrilled with,

569
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:11,330
decided to have a beer fight
and throw beer on him on stage.

570
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,583
It's a little tiny
stage, smaller than this.

571
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:18,600
And he up and walks out

572
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:21,813
and we hadn't been through 30
minutes of the live show yet.

573
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:25,980
Gone, no act.

574
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:27,183
What do you do?

575
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:29,640
What do you do?

576
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,290
Well, we had the radio announcer,

577
00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:33,390
Mike Fitzgerald was his name,

578
00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:35,310
he was the New York radio announcer

579
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:37,830
for the station that sponsored all this,

580
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:42,120
and I said, Mike, vamp, vamp.

581
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,010
And I said, I need 10 minutes.

582
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:45,300
So what did we do?

583
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:47,160
We were live recording everything.

584
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:52,110
So I rewound the tape
to the very beginning

585
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:56,343
of when we began recording,
when we introduced him live.

586
00:29:57,450 --> 00:30:01,980
I pressed play and replayed
for the second half of the show

587
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:04,953
exactly what was done in
the first half of the show.

588
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:07,743
Nobody seemed to give a shit.

589
00:30:08,857 --> 00:30:10,797
Again, back in those days

590
00:30:10,797 --> 00:30:12,600
and I think it's still the same rules,

591
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,250
if you don't fill the air time,

592
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:16,830
the FCC's gonna get on your ass.

593
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:20,250
So whatever it was, fill
the air, fill the air,

594
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:23,913
and again, we kind of got
through that one as well.

595
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:28,983
The live stuff.

596
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:34,593
When you're doing any
technical stuff at all,

597
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,850
and you say, oh, this
is gonna be really easy,

598
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:39,873
the answer is no.

599
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:43,710
How many years of hacker
jeopardy have we had

600
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:46,590
where we, ah, we've got it wired this year

601
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:51,590
until somebody decides to put
Vista on a machine for us,

602
00:30:53,419 --> 00:30:54,870
and the first time I think anybody

603
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:57,660
ever yelled at jeopardy,
hacker jeopardy was,

604
00:30:57,660 --> 00:31:02,130
hey, does anybody have a
non-Vista machine we can have now?

605
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:04,263
And I finally worked our way through that.

606
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:08,310
As we build our systems,

607
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:13,310
complexity is our enemy, absolute enemy.

608
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:15,690
And we want more features.

609
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:20,690
So we see the increase of
sophistication of software.

610
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:24,300
We see the increase of
sophistication of hardware.

611
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:27,420
Not necessarily so much
because we need it,

612
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:30,210
but the vendors want to be able to say,

613
00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:32,190
we have 22 new features

614
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:34,285
and it's worth another thousand dollars

615
00:31:34,285 --> 00:31:36,093
for us to give it to you.

616
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:41,960
And we're increasing our
complexity without due thought,

617
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:46,680
without proper planning.

618
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:51,213
Again, what do you do
when the IT hits the fan?

619
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:54,480
And that's why I go back
to these presentations,

620
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:58,020
and my prior career of it was all analog,

621
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:02,310
we had nothing digital that
worked in those days at all,

622
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:05,040
with the exception of a couple
little pieces of equipment,

623
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:09,810
everything was guessing, trial
and error and it was a mess.

624
00:32:09,810 --> 00:32:13,263
And today we're still
doing this trial and error,

625
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:16,350
but we should learn from history

626
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:20,730
that a little bit more planning
in when the IT hits the fan,

627
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:21,870
how do you function?

628
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:25,563
What is your minimal viable
operating capability?

629
00:32:27,154 --> 00:32:27,987
Do we plan about that?

630
00:32:27,987 --> 00:32:30,270
The businesses go, no, IT,
you take care of the business,

631
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:32,310
folks don't understand enough.

632
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:34,620
You guys do.

633
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:37,230
And that is part of the
hopefully the lesson here

634
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:40,920
is to be able to plan for
absolutely everything.

635
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:43,980
One of the things we used
to do back in the day,

636
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:45,000
get a recording console.

637
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,560
Let's say a new recording console's in

638
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:50,853
or we've done an overhaul of
a particular part of a studio.

639
00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:55,590
One of the things, as we
called it, turn all the knobs.

640
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:58,410
What we did and the reason we did it,

641
00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:00,720
we wanted to crank up the volume

642
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,840
in every single circuit on the console,

643
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:08,840
and we're looking, oh, 4,000
knobs maybe on a good console,

644
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:12,210
because we wanted to
stress it to the point

645
00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:14,880
we wanted it to break
under our lab conditions

646
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:18,720
versus break in a live
situation, the TV situation

647
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,673
or live recording in the studio.

648
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:27,210
So cranking all the knobs for
us helped identify problems

649
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:30,870
similar to where airplane
engine design is done,

650
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:33,630
stress the hell out of it.

651
00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:37,020
And one of the things that I
think I've missed in our field

652
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:39,060
and if somebody's doing it really well,

653
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:40,710
I would love to know about it,

654
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:45,480
is do we have any sort of
protocols for stress testing

655
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:49,080
of our networking infrastructures
to be able to say,

656
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:52,530
okay, we need to put a
limiter or a compressor

657
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:54,480
or a restriction control,

658
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:58,620
because it cannot handle all
the traffic, all the thing.

659
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:03,620
So back in '91, we were building this...

660
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:06,450
Steve Katz, the world's
first (indistinct),

661
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:10,500
brilliant guy and a dear
friend from J.P Morgan,

662
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:15,203
they wanted to do the first
single sign on system, 1990,

663
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:19,230
and I was on that team

664
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:24,230
and we tied together security
dynamics which became RSA.

665
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:27,183
There was Sun Microsystems with Solaris,

666
00:34:28,388 --> 00:34:33,360
Delphi Project from MIT was involved.

667
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:36,273
So we built this whole
single (indistinct) system.

668
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:39,210
We were so proud of ourselves.

669
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:40,500
So proud.

670
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:42,450
We're showing it at a couple conferences

671
00:34:42,450 --> 00:34:45,060
and it works brilliantly.

672
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:48,393
Where single (indistinct)
is finally a reality,

673
00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:51,750
until it fucks up.

674
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:55,200
So Steve says, let's deploy it.

675
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,033
Deploy it where?

676
00:34:56,033 --> 00:34:58,440
Well, we're gonna do it at J.P Morgan.

677
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,273
Cool.

678
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:02,883
They deployed it company wide.

679
00:35:05,310 --> 00:35:06,783
Sounds good, right?

680
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:10,330
Well, what we had not considered

681
00:35:11,370 --> 00:35:15,240
was the time factor of authentication

682
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,970
when 10,000 people try to log on

683
00:35:17,970 --> 00:35:20,073
at 9:00 AM at the same time.

684
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:24,090
What happens to your network

685
00:35:24,090 --> 00:35:26,640
when you don't have accelerators,

686
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,640
you don't have spread bandwidth,

687
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,500
you don't have balancing circuits?

688
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:34,440
All the shit we have today, we didn't have

689
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:38,220
and we completely fucked it
up by spending all this money

690
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:41,910
and designing something that
was great for 10 people,

691
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:44,070
not for 10,000 people.

692
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:47,370
So turning all the knobs,
stress the shit out of things,

693
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:50,970
I cannot impress enough
that we need as an industry

694
00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:53,970
to really develop a stress mechanism,

695
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:55,980
a stress protocol for various

696
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:57,810
of the environments that we're in.

697
00:35:57,810 --> 00:35:59,400
And it's turn all the V knobs,

698
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,170
we can do the same thing

699
00:36:01,170 --> 00:36:03,390
and we should be able to very easily

700
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:07,140
automate that stress testing process.

701
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:10,140
And I see Dave Fiz is up here,
he's designing it right now.

702
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:11,880
Do you have the patent shift for this?

703
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:12,713
Yeah.

704
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:17,340
So incident response.

705
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:19,800
Whether it was the incident
response with my mother

706
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,240
and the rotary telephone,

707
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,770
and my response was, fuck that,

708
00:36:22,770 --> 00:36:25,260
I'm gonna make a phone call somehow,

709
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:28,710
all the way up to catastrophic failures

710
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:31,290
with a couple hundred thousand people,

711
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:33,990
live TV, with all of those,

712
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:36,840
and I didn't even show you
some of the really nasty ones,

713
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:41,250
it's all about incident response
and appropriate planning,

714
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:43,680
understanding your architectures

715
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,200
and then making sure that you have a way

716
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:50,460
to degrade and a methodology to recover.

717
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:53,520
And on that note, I wanted
to thank you so much.

718
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,740
I'm here for some questions if you like,

719
00:36:55,740 --> 00:37:00,000
but that was my hacking
career beginning in 1958.

720
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,840
I am still a really,
really shitty programmer.

721
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:06,270
I have no idea how to do it anymore.

722
00:37:06,270 --> 00:37:07,860
And you guys have been wonderful.

723
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:09,540
Hope to see you tonight
at Hacker Jeopardy,

724
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:11,554
and if you have any questions or comments,

725
00:37:11,554 --> 00:37:14,763
there's a goon with a
microphone out there.

726
00:37:16,945 --> 00:37:17,778
(audience clapping)

727
00:37:17,778 --> 00:37:18,611
Oh, thank you.

728
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:28,920
All right, if there's no questions,

729
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,360
again, thank you very much,

730
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,830
I'll see you tonight at Jeopardy.

731
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:32,943
I appreciate it all.
