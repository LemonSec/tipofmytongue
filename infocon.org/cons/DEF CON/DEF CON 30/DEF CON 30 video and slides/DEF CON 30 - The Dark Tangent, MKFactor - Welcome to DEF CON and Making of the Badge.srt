1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,070
- Coming up next is the badge talk.

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:05,280
This is always one of my
favorite talks, every DEFCON,

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:06,330
and we're running a little bit late,

4
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:08,190
so I'll just get right to it.

5
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:11,880
So coming up to the stage,
we've got DT and MK Factor,

6
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,726
which is Michael and Katie.

7
00:00:13,726 --> 00:00:16,893
(audience applauding)

8
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,800
- Okay, I can't get you from up here.

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,113
So I'll take my mask off, you're safe.

10
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:27,813
Hey, welcome to DEFCON 30.

11
00:00:28,664 --> 00:00:31,831
(audience applauding)

12
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:36,900
As you can imagine, it has
been a very tumultuous,

13
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:38,850
crazy, crazy pants year,

14
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:43,380
and we are all super duper
excited to actually be here.

15
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:47,010
And (chuckles) when I started
seeing everybody around,

16
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:49,290
it's like this huge sense of relief

17
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:50,790
and I'm not gonna lie,

18
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:53,910
after I'm done with this talk,

19
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:56,019
I don't care if the place burns down.

20
00:00:56,019 --> 00:00:57,200
(audience laughing)

21
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,650
It's like, (chuckles) I got it.

22
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:00,240
We got it done, we got it here.

23
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,310
It doesn't matter if it only
last for a couple hours,

24
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:03,143
but wooh!

25
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,090
So normally what we do in this talk

26
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:07,470
is I welcome everybody.

27
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:08,553
Welcome everyone.

28
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:12,390
Just to give you a quick overview
of some of the challenges

29
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:14,550
of organizing the CON.

30
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:16,170
And then we go right into

31
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:19,380
the challenges of actually
creating the badge.

32
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,660
What I hope most of you are wearing,

33
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:23,940
with the badge designers, MK Factor.

34
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:28,563
And yeah, this year you've
got some pretty good stories.

35
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:32,550
One that was the most
impressive was a sort of

36
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:37,050
I'm living in Singapore, they're in Utah,

37
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:39,270
and the time zone's terrible difference.

38
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:41,070
And it's for me it's the morning

39
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:42,090
and they're in the middle of the night

40
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:42,923
and they're like,

41
00:01:42,923 --> 00:01:43,756
we found this one chip

42
00:01:43,756 --> 00:01:46,470
and we need to order the chip right now.

43
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:48,990
And yeah, people were ...

44
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:51,240
Anyway, good stories coming up.

45
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,073
Stay tuned.

46
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:55,630
So what we try to do with the badge

47
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:58,860
is we try to make it interactive,

48
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,950
we try to make it collaborative,

49
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:05,430
we try to force you with mind control,

50
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:08,520
to use it to socially interact
with others around you.

51
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,040
One more way for you to make

52
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:15,030
an unexpected connection
with a fellow hacker.

53
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:18,483
And originally all the badges were simple,

54
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,600
paper, plastic, metal.

55
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,600
And we always put a lot of
time in trying to make them

56
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,620
more counterfeit resistant

57
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,450
because after a few years
people started copying them.

58
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:34,200
And because we don't take
corporate sponsorship,

59
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,940
the only way we make money

60
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:39,720
is through selling badges and t-shirts.

61
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,670
And if that gets undermined,

62
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:43,380
we don't have any other resources,

63
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:45,690
any other revenue to fall back on.

64
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:48,120
So it turned into this cat and mouse game

65
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,620
where the people counterfeiting

66
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,210
would get better and better

67
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:53,340
and we'd get better and better.

68
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,310
And then finally, they got so good,

69
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,810
it's like I don't mind

70
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:00,480
if you can really
counterfeit it at that level,

71
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,580
'cause there's only three of you that can.

72
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,660
And why don't you give talks

73
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:08,310
and tell us how you did it?

74
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:09,143
'Cause it was really,

75
00:03:09,143 --> 00:03:11,670
I mean they were melting records in ovens

76
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:14,070
and smudging things to get a reflection.

77
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:17,460
And I mean, they were doing
some really cool stuff.

78
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,500
So every once in a while
you'll see a display

79
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,353
or you'll see a contest, a
badge counterfeiting contest.

80
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:27,240
And then at some point we
realized that we shouldn't put all

81
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,403
of our energy into the
anti-counterfeiting,

82
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:33,180
and we started to, Joe Grand,

83
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,460
I was talking to Joe years ago

84
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:38,670
and we were lamenting that

85
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:39,930
if the end of the world was coming,

86
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:42,390
if Skynet was gonna wake up,

87
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:45,453
we need an army of hackers
to do battle against Skynet,

88
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:49,140
except everybody is doing software,

89
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:51,123
nobody can hack the hardware of Skynet.

90
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:53,730
And Joe was one of the
only hardware hackers

91
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:54,563
I knew at the time.

92
00:03:54,563 --> 00:03:58,500
And so we needed to build an army, right?

93
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,540
To defend the world against Skynet.

94
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:04,200
So how do we get hackers
more interested in hardware?

95
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,740
And we created, he designed,

96
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:10,320
We did the first electronic badge

97
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,570
for hacking conference at DEFCON.

98
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:15,600
And it was super, super
simple by today's standards.

99
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,500
But every year it got more
complicated and better,

100
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,970
and with new tricks.

101
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:22,650
And back then a lot of
things were happening.

102
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:24,300
It was aluminum PCB,

103
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,280
it was persistence of vision LEDs,

104
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,900
it was infrared communication,

105
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:28,733
it was ...

106
00:04:28,733 --> 00:04:30,180
and it just took off.

107
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:33,480
And now badge life, everybody,

108
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:36,210
I think we helped accelerate

109
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:38,970
the skill set to defend against Skynet.

110
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:43,203
So thank you, DEFCON attendees
for jumping on board.

111
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:48,150
And now the badges are
so complicated out there

112
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:50,190
that other people are creating.

113
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:53,970
Honestly, it's too
costly to really compete

114
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:55,350
with some of them.

115
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:58,433
And we can't do $100 badge.

116
00:04:58,433 --> 00:05:00,243
We have some limitations.

117
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:03,720
And so it becomes more important

118
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,150
for us on how to interact

119
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:08,100
the ideas behind them

120
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,650
and maybe not the super duper build.

121
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:11,730
So it's been really fun.

122
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:15,060
It's like launching
something into the world

123
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:17,430
and now it's outgrown us a little bit.

124
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:22,140
And so now we're just
trying to help inspire

125
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:24,390
and get more people involved.

126
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,280
It's not supposed to be counterfeit proof.

127
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,990
It's not supposed to be unhackable,

128
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:29,643
it's intentionally hackable.

129
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:33,240
So that's the idea with the badges.

130
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,060
And normally we alternate
between a paper badge,

131
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:40,110
meaning a physical, non electronic badge

132
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:41,070
and electronic badge.

133
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:44,520
And even years are normally physical

134
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,770
and odd years are normally electronic,

135
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:48,240
and that's to help save us some money

136
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,460
because they're so expensive to do.

137
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:54,000
But how can you not have an
electronic badge for DEFCON 30?

138
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,833
You gotta have one.

139
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:56,280
So we had an electronic badge last year,

140
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,750
we had an electronic badge this year.

141
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:00,143
We haven't figured out what
we're doing next year yet.

142
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:04,263
Maybe you can do a mechanical
computing badge, right?

143
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,780
Like an old Curta calculator

144
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,313
or slide rule badge.

145
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:10,860
Don't test me,

146
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:13,187
you might be wearing one next year.

147
00:06:13,187 --> 00:06:15,540
(DT laughing)

148
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:17,130
All right, so with that said,

149
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:19,590
I would like to introduce the badge team

150
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:23,220
that was responsible for
this wonderful experience.

151
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:26,403
And later on, we have other interactive,

152
00:06:27,318 --> 00:06:29,010
(indistinct) has created some interactive

153
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:30,330
badge stations you'll see around

154
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:31,620
where you can plug in your badge,

155
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:34,560
you can go head to head
in the chill out rooms,

156
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,820
battling each other.

157
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,950
There's some contests.

158
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:39,930
So there's some installation art stuff

159
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:42,360
you can do with your badges too.

160
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,620
We want it to be fun.

161
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:47,403
Okay, with that, I'd like to
introduce the M and the K.

162
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:52,033
(audience applauding)

163
00:06:58,804 --> 00:07:00,450
While he is fiddling around

164
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:02,770
maybe just tell 'em some stories about the

165
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:06,658
background of the, or the idea or.

166
00:07:06,658 --> 00:07:09,930
- Yeah, so I guess we can
talk about some of the

167
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,283
ideas behind the badge.

168
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:14,598
You wanna tell the story?

169
00:07:14,598 --> 00:07:15,431
- Sure.

170
00:07:15,431 --> 00:07:16,286
- Yeah.

171
00:07:16,286 --> 00:07:19,530
- So last year I was talking to someone

172
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:21,660
and he is like, wouldn't it be
cool to have a musical badge?

173
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,520
And I was like, yeah, that would,

174
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,350
I would really love that idea.

175
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:27,550
And so we sat on it and
we thought about it.

176
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,610
We also love the show, Bob's Burgers

177
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:34,020
and Jean has a sampling keyboard,

178
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,420
which, woo!

179
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,773
(audience applauding)

180
00:07:36,773 --> 00:07:41,773
Thank you.

181
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:44,190
- So Jean has a sampling keyboard,

182
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:45,540
which we'll see in a second

183
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,990
that he loves to make sounds with.

184
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:50,370
And we're like, what's the better way to

185
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:55,350
capture the sounds of DEFCON
with the sampling keyboard?

186
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,183
- Yeah.

187
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:58,913
All right.

188
00:07:58,913 --> 00:08:01,110
First thing we wanna do is
thank all the people that came

189
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:03,000
and helped us assemble these badges

190
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,530
and helped us create 'em

191
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:06,770
and oh my gosh.
- Supported us.

192
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:08,400
- So many people that helped.

193
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,600
It was amazing.

194
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,670
We have really great friends and family

195
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:13,470
and the community is just amazing.

196
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:14,400
Thank you everyone.

197
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,750
- Yeah, thank you so much.

198
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:18,650
And we would not have made it without you.

199
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:22,470
- All right, so let's talk about the

200
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:24,390
problem with the badges.

201
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:29,070
I'm sure some of you have run
into this and I apologize.

202
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:31,470
So there is a terrible, terrible,

203
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:33,390
stupid design flaw in the badge.

204
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:35,190
I take full responsibility for that.

205
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:40,380
So the problem is this little bitty chip

206
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:42,270
that's under the little cover board

207
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:45,330
and that's the audio amplifier.

208
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:48,750
And what happens is that amplifier

209
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,640
is designed to power a speaker.

210
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,470
And it does that really, really well.

211
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:53,580
What it's not designed to do

212
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:56,010
is be connected to an audio output.

213
00:08:56,010 --> 00:09:00,690
And well, I want to make
excuses and whatnot,

214
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:02,730
and there are excuses, right?

215
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:04,680
We had to change this last minute

216
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,390
and supply chain being what it was,

217
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:07,620
we could only get certain things

218
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,300
and fit it in budget and everything.

219
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:14,300
And I did not check that if
this was going to be a problem.

220
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:17,430
And so it became a problem

221
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:19,180
and that's the chip that burns out.

222
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,680
This is what's under that chip.

223
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,690
It is a nine pin BGA flip chip.

224
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:26,790
It's pretty much microscopic.

225
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:28,440
It's like one and a
half millimeters square.

226
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,493
It's ridiculous.

227
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,957
So if you have hurt your badge,

228
00:09:33,957 --> 00:09:37,410
the HHV does have some spare chips.

229
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:40,200
If your board is not too badly damaged,

230
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:44,250
they would be happy to
help you fix your badge.

231
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,590
Don't bring 'em and say, "Fix my badge."

232
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:47,790
That's not gonna happen. (chuckles)

233
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:52,713
So be willing to learn and help do that.

234
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,490
The other thing we found
out when we got here

235
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:59,790
is the lanyards can cause problems.

236
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:01,230
And we did not know this

237
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:02,760
because we didn't have the lanyards.

238
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,640
We didn't see 'em until they
got here a few days ago.

239
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,260
- And we didn't think they
were that close to the hole

240
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:09,000
or they would be big enough or.

241
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,716
- Yeah, and that ...
- The blindside.

242
00:10:10,716 --> 00:10:14,400
- Yeah, that lanyard
connector is the perfect size

243
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,486
to wrap around that connector
and just sort it out.

244
00:10:17,486 --> 00:10:18,319
- [Katie] Sort it out.

245
00:10:18,319 --> 00:10:20,400
- [Michael] So, tape over that if you can,

246
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,680
we've got tape if you find us.

247
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,330
Yeah.
- Yeah.

248
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:27,720
- [Michael] So with that
out of the way, (chuckles)

249
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,213
this is our original concept design.

250
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:34,645
- So this is one of them.

251
00:10:34,645 --> 00:10:36,270
So we went through
several different ideas.

252
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:39,150
We originally, it was gonna
be super simple, right?

253
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:41,370
'Cause that's how you
first start your badge.

254
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:43,800
And then you're like, wait, I
need this and now I need this.

255
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,870
But honestly it was literally
gonna be four buttons

256
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:48,033
and a screen, and then your keyboard.

257
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,130
That didn't happen.

258
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:53,100
But that's ... we had hopes. (laughs)

259
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,083
So yeah.

260
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,403
- So go ahead.

261
00:10:59,403 --> 00:11:03,240
- Like we said, Jean, he
has a sampling keyboard.

262
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:06,243
And so we were really
excited when he's like,

263
00:11:06,243 --> 00:11:08,670
we should buy these and play
with them and see how they work

264
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:10,800
and see if this is
really our idea we want.

265
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,007
And so here's our kids, they're like,

266
00:11:12,007 --> 00:11:13,920
"This is the coolest thing!"

267
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,590
And so we all turned into five

268
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:18,510
and just pounding on these keyboards

269
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:19,410
and having a great time

270
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:21,310
in making sounds and things like that.

271
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:23,940
- And we do have this keyboard with us.

272
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,830
So if you wanna play with
a real sampling keyboard

273
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:27,480
that works really nicely (chuckles)

274
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,493
come find us in the contest area.

275
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:34,890
All right, so artwork.

276
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:38,730
Last year, the theme with
the kind of '80s vibe

277
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:39,563
and everything.

278
00:11:39,563 --> 00:11:42,570
Everything was hard lines
and very geometrical.

279
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:44,970
This year, Katie got to
run wild with the artwork

280
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:45,933
and it's amazing.

281
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,600
- Thank you.

282
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,800
Yeah, I had a lot of fun.

283
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,170
It was kind of cool to just take stuff

284
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:53,373
from different things.

285
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:58,380
I don't know else to say,
but you've, enjoy. (chuckles)

286
00:11:58,380 --> 00:11:59,280
- It's awesome.

287
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,660
- Thank you. (laughing)

288
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:03,827
(audience applauding)

289
00:12:07,843 --> 00:12:09,000
- All right, stock supply chain

290
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,830
because it's a problem again,

291
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:13,290
and will be forever and ever and ever.

292
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:15,720
So this is one of the stories that

293
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,313
DT had started talking about.

294
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,720
When was that, February?

295
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,553
- Yeah.

296
00:12:21,553 --> 00:12:22,386
- We reached out to him.

297
00:12:22,386 --> 00:12:24,000
We were like, "Oh my
gosh, we found a chip,

298
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,190
that's in stock that's not $10.

299
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:28,470
We need to buy these now." (chuckles)

300
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:32,100
And so yeah, we bought a
crazy number of these chips.

301
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:35,670
It was a really weird circumstance.

302
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:39,000
So Raspberry Pi has on their site

303
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,510
links to all the different
distributors that have this chip.

304
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:47,130
And one of them was Digi-Key, right?

305
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:49,560
And all these things
were sold out everywhere.

306
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,440
And I happened to be searching
on Digi-Key one night

307
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,390
and came across this chip,

308
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:56,910
and they had like 50,000 of them in stock.

309
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,440
But the link on Raspberry Pi's website

310
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,870
hadn't been updated yet to
the new link on Digi-Key.

311
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:02,340
So I was like, this is our moment,

312
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:04,258
we've got (chuckles) chips.

313
00:13:04,258 --> 00:13:05,700
(audience laughing)

314
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,100
- Before anyone else
sees this weird thing,

315
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,858
we need to just take these.

316
00:13:09,858 --> 00:13:11,329
- Yeah.
- These will be ours.

317
00:13:11,329 --> 00:13:13,050
- Yeah, so yeah, we contacted DT

318
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:14,490
and bought those really quickly

319
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:16,800
and to our great surprise
Digi-Key actually shipped them.

320
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,220
- Well, yeah, I think I kept asking like,

321
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,260
okay, did they go in the shopping basket?

322
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,093
Yeah, yeah, they ...

323
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:24,600
Okay, did it check out?

324
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,640
Did it charge the credit card?

325
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,320
Okay, yeah, we've got them, okay.

326
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,690
And then you said on eBay
people were marking these things

327
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:33,189
up 10 times, right?

328
00:13:33,189 --> 00:13:36,270
People would swoop in, see
that a chip was in low supply,

329
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:39,030
buy them all, mark it up 10 times on eBay.

330
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:41,167
And so I think as several
times they contact me like,

331
00:13:41,167 --> 00:13:42,540
"We found the chip."

332
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:43,860
Oh no, they're all gone.

333
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:44,693
- Yeah.

334
00:13:44,693 --> 00:13:45,630
- Okay, we have to redesign
the whole badge now.

335
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:46,980
Okay, we got another chip.

336
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:47,910
Oh no, they're all gone.

337
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,563
Okay, now we have to redesign the badge,

338
00:13:49,563 --> 00:13:50,860
it was like, oh my God.

339
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:52,567
- Yeah, so when we saw this, we're like,

340
00:13:52,567 --> 00:13:54,840
"We want it, can we have it? (chuckles)

341
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,770
Please let us have this."

342
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:57,900
'Cause all the other ones were smaller

343
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,790
and they were like eight bucks a chip.

344
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:02,013
And you would've had a board and a chip.

345
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:07,800
- Yeah, and this also
did pose some problems

346
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,380
because if any of you have
messed with the RP2040,

347
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:14,010
it doesn't have any audio
stuff, any DSP stuff,

348
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:17,460
it doesn't have floating point stuff.

349
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:20,610
So it was a bit of a
challenge programming wise.

350
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:23,670
All the audio on your badge
is all in software, (chuckles)

351
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:25,680
which it's a good thing that chip is fast,

352
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,230
but even so it's still eight bit audio.

353
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:31,773
So that was a compromise, but it works.

354
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:36,870
So custom parts.

355
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:39,060
The screen, I don't know if any of you

356
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:42,030
have played with those
little OLED screens.

357
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:44,700
Normally they've got a big,
long flexible connector,

358
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,350
and it's to wrap around
the back of a board

359
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:47,730
and be soldered there.

360
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:48,690
That didn't work for us

361
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:49,800
because everything needed to be

362
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,000
on the front side of the board.

363
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,710
And no one made that screen
with a short enough cable on it,

364
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:58,170
and one that goes into
connector rather than soldered,

365
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:01,070
'cause we were not soldering
that many (chuckles) screens.

366
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,930
And so we contacted the supplier

367
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:05,610
and got those screens custom made

368
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:07,860
with a very short little
flexible cable on 'em.

369
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:10,020
So they're custom.

370
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:12,344
You can't get your own all you can.

371
00:15:12,344 --> 00:15:14,163
They're (laughs) fancy.

372
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:17,610
So yeah, that's one of the cool things

373
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:18,780
you can do when you're ordering

374
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:21,720
many crazy numbers of things.

375
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,400
You can get customed stuff.

376
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,233
- Kind of fun.

377
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:30,630
- So then parts started arriving
at our house. (chuckles)

378
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,440
- We don't have a big house.

379
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,510
(Michael and Katie both laughing)

380
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:34,800
It was everywhere.

381
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:39,273
- Yeah, so these bins
hold 4,000 audio cables.

382
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:43,737
There were many more of these
offscreen, yeah. (chuckles)

383
00:15:43,737 --> 00:15:46,089
- And they were heavy. (laughs)

384
00:15:46,089 --> 00:15:48,450
- DT, are we allowed to
say how many we made?

385
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:49,283
- Yeah, I think so.

386
00:15:49,283 --> 00:15:53,070
- Okay, so 25,000 is the
number of badges we made.

387
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:55,177
So there were many of these buckets.

388
00:15:55,177 --> 00:15:58,344
(audience applauding)

389
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:09,740
Yeah, two pallets of boxes just
to hold them all. (chuckles)

390
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:16,410
So batteries, yeah, 25,000 badges.

391
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:20,252
So 75,000 triple A's were
delivered to our house.

392
00:16:20,252 --> 00:16:21,360
(Michael and audience laughing)

393
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,190
- [Katie] The poor Amazon man,

394
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:26,259
he's constantly, what are these?

395
00:16:26,259 --> 00:16:27,092
(audience laughing)

396
00:16:27,092 --> 00:16:28,793
He's like loading these giant things.

397
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:33,360
They're small boxes, but
they were packed a punch.

398
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,540
- [Michael] Yeah, so one of
the things that happened is

399
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:39,450
we got the battery
holders and the batteries.

400
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:40,860
We ordered all the stuff for the badges

401
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:41,700
all at the same time.

402
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,050
And so a lot of the parts,

403
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:44,430
and the circuit boards and everything,

404
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:46,230
those go to an assembly house,

405
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:48,330
and then batteries and
battery holders came to us.

406
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:50,220
And so we had some time.

407
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:52,680
So we pre-filled the two batteries

408
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,993
on every single one of
those battery holders.

409
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:58,080
And this picture on the right,

410
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:01,218
I don't know if any of you
notice that's not right.

411
00:17:01,218 --> 00:17:02,580
(audience laughing)

412
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:05,100
So when you order this many of something,

413
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,890
you start finding the weird ones.

414
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:10,830
So about one in every 1000 battery holders

415
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:13,560
was malformed or put together
backwards. (chuckles)

416
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:16,263
So weird, crazy stuff you find.

417
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,083
- [Katie] I don't think our kids

418
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:19,769
will ever wanna see a battery again.

419
00:17:19,769 --> 00:17:20,602
(audience laughing)

420
00:17:20,602 --> 00:17:22,430
- [Michael] Yeah.

421
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:25,023
- So they had a blast
opening the batteries.

422
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:28,921
I walk in the kitchen and
they're like, we made a pyramid.

423
00:17:28,921 --> 00:17:30,210
(Katie and audience laughing)

424
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:33,030
- So, yeah, for reference,
each of those boxes

425
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:33,960
is 50 batteries.

426
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,310
That's 8,500 batteries.

427
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:38,460
So just over 10%. (laughs)

428
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:40,151
- They were everywhere.

429
00:17:40,151 --> 00:17:44,490
- Yeah, and we made some custom tools.

430
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:47,940
So those battery holders
have inch long pins

431
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,350
sticking out of them.

432
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:53,700
And we were not gonna
cut 50,000 pins by hand.

433
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:54,750
It's not gonna happen.

434
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:57,660
So I bought some metal
shears at Harbor Freight

435
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:00,420
and 3D printed a little jig for it.

436
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:01,800
And so we could just slide 'em through

437
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:05,190
and cut all the leads
off the battery packs.

438
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:06,023
That was fun.

439
00:18:06,023 --> 00:18:07,050
- Yeah, it was way fun.

440
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:08,701
There was metal everywhere, it's fine.

441
00:18:08,701 --> 00:18:11,430
(Michael and Katie laughing)

442
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:12,423
- And jigs.

443
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,880
So we designed and custom printed

444
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,610
little jigs to bend the top boards enough

445
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:24,030
to get 'em into the
badges without having to

446
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:26,130
manually bend each one over.

447
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:26,963
- [Katie] I don't know if any of you

448
00:18:26,963 --> 00:18:30,041
tried to do that with your hands. (laughs)

449
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:30,874
- [Michael] Yeah, it's not fun.

450
00:18:30,874 --> 00:18:31,920
- I physically can't.

451
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,753
And so I was like,

452
00:18:32,753 --> 00:18:36,456
we need something 'cause I
cannot do this 25,000 times.

453
00:18:36,456 --> 00:18:37,289
(laughs)

454
00:18:37,289 --> 00:18:39,210
So he's amazing and did that for us.

455
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:40,980
- And if any of you need help with that,

456
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,450
I've got some of these jigs on me

457
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:44,550
so I can help you put a top board back on

458
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:45,950
or flip it over if you want.

459
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:47,873
- Yep.

460
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:52,080
- Assembly, PCBx is amazing.

461
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,930
They did all the assembly on these boards.

462
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:56,460
They're based out of Ohio

463
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:57,513
and they are awesome.

464
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:01,380
This is what they dealt with. (chuckles)

465
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,550
This is what got delivered to them,

466
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:04,380
bare circuit boards.

467
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:07,080
It's like 1800 pounds of circuit boards.

468
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,823
It's ridiculous. (laughs)

469
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:13,410
And so yeah, they assembled all these,

470
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:14,970
put 'em in antistatic bags,

471
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:15,920
shipped them to us.

472
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:23,223
- Okay, so once we got to assembly,

473
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,650
we had to take 'em all
out of their static bags,

474
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:30,750
all 25,000 of them.

475
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,850
And then we,

476
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:33,750
as you can tell,

477
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,910
the Jeff says, we're awesome.

478
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:38,730
They taught us how to do it faster.

479
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:40,500
So we had them everywhere

480
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,480
and we were constantly unloading boxes

481
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,333
and we had static bags everywhere.

482
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:50,460
So our next part of assembly,
we had to do soldering.

483
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:53,430
We soldered all of those battery packs

484
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:55,740
back on onto the backs of these.

485
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:58,320
So we did 50,000 solder joints.

486
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,570
It was great, it was fun.

487
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:03,010
Our kids got really good at soldering.

488
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:06,177
(audience applauding)

489
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:15,330
- And of course our good
friends, Troy and Burley,

490
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:20,330
they graciously offered their
house as well for assembly.

491
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:23,520
So they did 1000s and 1000s
of them at their house

492
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,710
as well and had 'em everywhere.

493
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:28,236
- Yeah, and both houses
looked very similar.

494
00:20:28,236 --> 00:20:29,069
(Michael and Katie laughing)

495
00:20:29,069 --> 00:20:30,933
Boxes everywhere and badges everywhere.

496
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:33,720
- Yeah, so many badges.

497
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:36,180
That's a couple 100 on that table.

498
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:38,283
25,000 is a ridiculous number.

499
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,053
- Yeah, I think that's
only 300 on that table.

500
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,980
They were bigger than we were expecting.

501
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:51,000
So our top boards for the (indistinct)

502
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,570
came as panels and we had
to break 'em all apart.

503
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:56,880
So this is me and my mom
sitting there breaking.

504
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,140
We also have, (chuckles)

505
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:00,420
they did it at their house as well.

506
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:01,253
- Yep

507
00:21:01,253 --> 00:21:02,250
- There was breaking everywhere.

508
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:05,954
I did not see this picture till
today that they used pliers.

509
00:21:05,954 --> 00:21:06,787
(laughs)

510
00:21:06,787 --> 00:21:07,620
I was jealous.

511
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:09,275
We used our hands.

512
00:21:09,275 --> 00:21:11,790
(laughs)

513
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:13,500
But yeah, that was a fun,

514
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,100
there was fiberglass everywhere.

515
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:20,193
- So yeah, one of our
kids breaking more boards,

516
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:26,130
heat sealing and putting
little cuts in every bag

517
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:29,043
so you guys could rip 'em
apart, rip 'em open easily.

518
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:37,620
Yeah, it's just ridiculous. (laughs)

519
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:40,590
So these are just some of
the people that came to help.

520
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:44,040
There were friends, family, community.

521
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,383
We had just so many people.

522
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:51,480
- [Katie] Like for three, four weeks.

523
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,920
Yeah.
- Yeah.

524
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,240
Four weeks of assembly.

525
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,493
It was (chuckles) ridiculous.

526
00:21:57,493 --> 00:21:59,160
- [Katie] I don't think
I wanna go in my shop

527
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,533
for the next month and I'd be happy.

528
00:22:01,533 --> 00:22:04,450
(Michael laughing)

529
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:08,610
- [Michael] Yeah, they had
smiles till the endish.

530
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:09,443
- [Katie] Ish.

531
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:13,680
- [Michael] Well, we said
smile for the picture. (laughs)

532
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:16,743
- So when we got to the
den, we're like, oh!

533
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,620
That's a lot of badges.

534
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:20,910
That's more badges than we thought.

535
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:23,060
And we're like, we're
gonna need 100 boxes.

536
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:26,108
We don't have a car that can do that.

537
00:22:26,108 --> 00:22:28,080
(Michael laughing)

538
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:32,100
- Yeah, so each box of
250 is about 60 pounds.

539
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:35,610
So we loaded about 6,000
pounds worth of boxes

540
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:36,930
in this U-Haul (chuckles)

541
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:38,283
and dragged it down here.

542
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:40,103
- It was great.

543
00:22:40,103 --> 00:22:42,000
- So for those of you who
saw this picture on Twitter,

544
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,440
I loved the guesses.

545
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,570
You were all way wrong. (laughs)

546
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:46,403
- But it was fun.

547
00:22:46,403 --> 00:22:48,903
- We had lots of guesses
around 13, 14,000.

548
00:22:48,903 --> 00:22:50,520
We had a 30,000 guests,

549
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,837
but yeah, 25,000.

550
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:58,143
And badge challenge.

551
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,230
I hope a bunch of you
have started playing that

552
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:02,223
and having fun.

553
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,800
Today, you can actually do more with it

554
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,243
because contest is open.

555
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,040
So these lovely ladies this morning,

556
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:14,280
we went to set up our challenge
table in the contest area

557
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,443
and our boxes of stuff were gone.

558
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:19,890
They were not where they
were supposed to be.

559
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:22,740
Someone took them to the
hardware hacking village

560
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,060
in the Flamingo.

561
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:26,550
I don't know why. (chuckles)

562
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:28,037
- It's okay, it happens.

563
00:23:28,037 --> 00:23:30,630
- And so these lovely
ladies ran and got them

564
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:33,330
and brought them back to us here. (laughs)

565
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:34,163
- It was fun, it was good.

566
00:23:34,163 --> 00:23:35,885
We got our cardio in,

567
00:23:35,885 --> 00:23:38,443
and a lot of sweating. (laughs)

568
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,930
- So huge thank you to redacted

569
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:44,850
who helped with the badge challenge

570
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:46,470
and all the hardware set up for that.

571
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:47,340
It's awesome.

572
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:49,623
Please go play with it and have fun.

573
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:55,170
On the badge challenge, don't
make real phone calls, right?

574
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:57,750
There are special phones for you to use.

575
00:23:57,750 --> 00:24:01,860
Don't call people and
make 'em mad. (laughs)

576
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:04,521
Yeah, I'm sure people have been called.

577
00:24:04,521 --> 00:24:05,511
(Katie laughing)

578
00:24:05,511 --> 00:24:07,680
But don't do that anymore. (laughs)

579
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,683
- Those poor inspecting people, okay.

580
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:14,403
- So that's what we got.

581
00:24:14,403 --> 00:24:17,570
(audience applauding)

582
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,030
So if there's any questions,

583
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:28,650
I think someone's gonna
run around with a mic,

584
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:30,333
if you have questions for us.

585
00:24:33,719 --> 00:24:34,680
- Okay, we got a question in the front

586
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:37,440
and then another question will
be in the front to start off

587
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,242
and then we'll work our way back.

588
00:24:39,242 --> 00:24:40,075
- Run.

589
00:24:41,296 --> 00:24:42,496
- It's this person here.

590
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,660
- Thank you.

591
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:49,770
Amazing badge.

592
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:53,880
But fortunately mine got
fried in the first 10 seconds.

593
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:58,050
So I guess my question is
it's the same hardware, right?

594
00:24:58,050 --> 00:25:01,923
All the badges or did I
understood that wrong?

595
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,100
The badges are different some of them.

596
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,343
Is there-

597
00:25:06,343 --> 00:25:07,176
- The hardware is all the same.

598
00:25:07,176 --> 00:25:09,233
- Some of them are still
working and mine is not.

599
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:11,723
- Sorry, you're talking about

600
00:25:11,723 --> 00:25:13,920
between the different badge types?

601
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:17,043
- Yeah, the hardware, like
the chips that are being used.

602
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,860
- Are they all the same hardware

603
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:21,690
or they're different hardware specs

604
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:23,220
for different types of badges?

605
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:24,540
- They're all the same hardware.

606
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:28,890
- Okay, and why are some of
them are being fried the chips

607
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:30,660
and some of them are still working?

608
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:34,620
- It's the shorting out
from either the lanyard

609
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:37,290
or if you've created a loop of any sort.

610
00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:38,883
- Got it, all right, thank you.

611
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,333
- Yeah, thanks for asking a question.

612
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:43,873
- All right, who's next?

613
00:25:54,035 --> 00:25:55,680
- [Attendee] So thanks for badges.

614
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,520
They've been great,

615
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,590
loved the musical tones.

616
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:02,160
And obviously making these
there's a lot of repetition,

617
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:06,030
but what would you say was most
dreadful part of repetition?

618
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:10,020
Which part of this did you not
ever wanna do or see again?

619
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:10,983
- I know this one.

620
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:16,140
It's the ... I'm not going to curse.

621
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:18,510
It's the speakers. (laughs)

622
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:21,450
'Cause when the speakers
are loose in there, right?

623
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:24,640
We couldn't find one that
could go through a reflow oven

624
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:26,970
to do what we wanted to do.

625
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:29,790
And so that's why we made it

626
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:31,980
the cute little thing that goes over it.

627
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:34,860
The speakers, once you put that on there,

628
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:36,360
when you pop that thing off,

629
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,320
it creates a lot of force.

630
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:40,380
And so sometimes it will jolt it

631
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:42,930
and then you have to pop it into place.

632
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:46,350
Also, I think about a
third of our speakers,

633
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:49,950
all their leads were bent the wrong way.

634
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:52,440
So we had to go and bend them back

635
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:55,260
so that they would touch where
they're supposed to touch.

636
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:58,094
So those damn speakers!

637
00:26:58,094 --> 00:26:58,927
(Michael laughing)

638
00:26:58,927 --> 00:27:00,090
That's the part. (chuckles)

639
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:00,923
- Yep.

640
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:04,890
- [Attendee] Again, thank
you very much for the badges.

641
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:06,150
They're awesome.

642
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:10,140
Do you have a good source
for the six pin SAO headers

643
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:11,130
here at the CON?

644
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:12,270
down at the hardware hacking village

645
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:13,530
we have four pin headers,

646
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:15,690
but no six pins handy.

647
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:19,680
- So we have some.

648
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,120
Don't mob us,

649
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,670
but we have some available.

650
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:27,600
I think HHV has a small selection of them

651
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:32,070
and a lot of SAO designers
provided them with their SAOs.

652
00:27:33,141 --> 00:27:35,160
- [Attendee] Okay.

653
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:35,993
- Thank you.

654
00:27:35,993 --> 00:27:38,926
- [DEFCON Staff] Great,
any other questions?

655
00:27:38,926 --> 00:27:40,009
There you go.

656
00:27:42,003 --> 00:27:43,683
- He's gonna get his steps in.

657
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,820
- [Attendee] So you mentioned
as you were starting the story

658
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:50,010
before the slides came up,

659
00:27:50,010 --> 00:27:51,900
you mentioned that you had heard,

660
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:55,620
yeah wouldn't a musical
badge be interesting.

661
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:57,630
So was it just,

662
00:27:57,630 --> 00:28:00,210
I mean, why did you choose the keyboard

663
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:02,970
because of the show that
made it exciting to you,

664
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:06,330
or was there something
about the music that really

665
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:08,730
drew you into it differently?

666
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:10,320
Why are we doing it with the keyboard

667
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,233
versus any of the other types
of music options you had?

668
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:19,200
- So coming to the design choice.

669
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,093
So we had several different ideas.

670
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:24,450
We thought guitar hero thing,

671
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:26,550
where everyone had a different instrument.

672
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:31,590
It posed a building,

673
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:34,440
making it harder for us
to have custom things,

674
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,960
to help us put the badges together.

675
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,503
But generally we landed on the keyboard.

676
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:44,430
I felt like it was more
relatable for everyone.

677
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:48,030
Everyone's touched keys
on a keyboard before.

678
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:48,863
Do you know what I mean?

679
00:28:48,863 --> 00:28:52,170
And so I think more people are willing to,

680
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:53,620
I don't know. I think that's where it was.

681
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:54,994
- I think it was sampling.

682
00:28:54,994 --> 00:28:56,430
The sampling nature of that.

683
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:59,310
- The sampling was a
really big part of it.

684
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:01,560
So the people could record
their own sounds and play on

685
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:04,953
and add their own sounds to DEFCON.

686
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,220
- [Attendee] I've seen a couple
that have a different color.

687
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:10,863
Is there any significance
to the color of the badge?

688
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:13,209
- Sorry, say that again.

689
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:14,042
- You gonna say that again,

690
00:29:14,042 --> 00:29:15,780
sorry, we couldn't hear you.

691
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:17,850
- [Attendee] Is there any
significance to the color

692
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:18,840
of the badge?

693
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,790
- The color of the badge?

694
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:22,113
Like the different types?

695
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:24,833
- [Attendee] Yes.

696
00:29:24,833 --> 00:29:26,880
- Yeah, so all the different colors

697
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,650
are for different groups of people.

698
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:31,470
So other than the white and black ones,

699
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:32,820
like red is for goon,

700
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:35,550
there's some for all the
different people that help

701
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:37,260
run the conference basically.

702
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:41,190
- So you got your speaker,
you got CFP, you have press,

703
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:44,160
you have contest village.

704
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:44,993
- Vendor.

705
00:29:44,993 --> 00:29:45,826
- Vendor.

706
00:29:45,826 --> 00:29:47,430
So there's nine different colors.

707
00:29:48,746 --> 00:29:49,579
(indistinct)

708
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:51,050
Does that answer your question?

709
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:55,590
- And they all have
something different on them.

710
00:29:57,928 --> 00:29:59,193
I hope that answers it.

711
00:29:59,193 --> 00:30:01,980
- [Attendee] Hey, so
this is my first DEFCON.

712
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:06,980
I just wanted to say for me
personally, I love the keyboard.

713
00:30:07,247 --> 00:30:09,960
You couldn't have picked
a better theme badge

714
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,520
for me personally.

715
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,560
And I just wanted to say
thank you for all the effort.

716
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,460
That's an incredible amount of effort.

717
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:17,183
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

718
00:30:17,183 --> 00:30:20,156
(audience applauding)

719
00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:27,033
- We got one to your right.

720
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:29,670
- There's so many noises.

721
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:30,690
- Or further right,

722
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:33,930
but okay. (chuckles)

723
00:30:33,930 --> 00:30:36,660
- [Attendee] So a two part question.

724
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:38,070
First of all,

725
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:42,873
is it possible to reset the
challenge to factory state?

726
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:46,410
I know when you pulled a
battery and then put it back in

727
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:51,410
and started up it resumes where
you were in the challenge.

728
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:57,273
And secondly, do you think
it's theoretically possible to,

729
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:01,080
does the chip have any more capacity

730
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:04,713
to maybe do a more advanced
synth or anything like that?

731
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:09,210
- Okay, so yeah.

732
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:12,963
So to reset it from Raspberry Pi,

733
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,740
you have two file called flash nuke,

734
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:20,773
dump that on there and
then we'll need to ...

735
00:31:21,618 --> 00:31:22,560
Did we release the firmware?

736
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,393
- Not yet.

737
00:31:23,393 --> 00:31:24,226
- I don't think we have.

738
00:31:24,226 --> 00:31:28,530
We will throw the firmware
up on the badge website.

739
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:29,820
So then you can reflash

740
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:31,920
and that'll put you back to the beginning.

741
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:33,623
For the other one,

742
00:31:33,623 --> 00:31:36,420
there is tons of flash space left.

743
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:41,420
There's not a whole lot of extra
processing power available,

744
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:45,840
mainly due to my terrible code. (chuckles)

745
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:46,980
I don't know if any of have noticed,

746
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:49,770
if you press four more keys at once

747
00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:52,770
it hangs there and the screen
doesn't update for a second.

748
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:55,200
So yeah, we're right at the limit of what

749
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,250
it can do with my terrible coding skills.

750
00:31:58,220 --> 00:31:59,940
- I think your coding (indistinct)

751
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:01,680
- [Attendee] I was up
till two in the morning

752
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,240
decompiling assembly code.

753
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,340
So thank you for that.

754
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:06,990
So I've called all my friends,

755
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:08,763
but can you actually call Jenny?

756
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:14,173
- I mean, yeah. (laughs)

757
00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:16,740
Okay, I can't give too much away,

758
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:20,370
but maybe there's a whole area of contests

759
00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:22,440
in the venue here.

760
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,300
- Just don't use a real phone.

761
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:25,650
- Yeah, no real phones.

762
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:27,930
Don't use your cell phones for it.

763
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:30,090
- There's a special ... Well, nevermind.

764
00:32:30,090 --> 00:32:31,868
I'm not, I don't know.

765
00:32:31,868 --> 00:32:33,147
(Michael laughing)

766
00:32:33,147 --> 00:32:35,103
- All right, any other questions?

767
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:37,373
Over here.

768
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,360
- [Attendee] Hey, thanks again.

769
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,283
What was the budget per badge?

770
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:46,860
Are you allowed to say?

771
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:49,230
- No, we don't talk about budget.

772
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:50,250
- [Attendee] Okay, that's fine.

773
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:51,083
- Yeah.

774
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:55,493
- [DEFCON Staff] All right.

775
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:01,680
- [Attendee] Thank you.

776
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,450
I'm just curious,

777
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:06,120
can we try what it sounds
like if everybody in this room

778
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,770
plays something at the same time?

779
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:11,012
- What did he say?

780
00:33:11,012 --> 00:33:11,910
Say it one more time please.

781
00:33:11,910 --> 00:33:14,490
- [Attendee] Can we all
play something on our badges

782
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:17,240
right now at the same time
to test what it sounds like?

783
00:33:18,318 --> 00:33:19,151
- Get in.

784
00:33:21,104 --> 00:33:23,485
- Yeah, are we all playing?

785
00:33:23,485 --> 00:33:24,743
- Is this the final countdown or?

786
00:33:26,779 --> 00:33:29,529
(multiple beeps)

787
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:35,460
- Oh, it sounds so good.

788
00:33:40,334 --> 00:33:42,751
(indistinct)

789
00:33:43,862 --> 00:33:45,419
- Oh, that's awesome.

790
00:33:45,419 --> 00:33:46,635
- It's kind of creepy.

791
00:33:46,635 --> 00:33:49,393
I don't like it. (chuckles)

792
00:33:49,393 --> 00:33:51,747
- A little bit creepy, all right.

793
00:33:51,747 --> 00:33:54,960
(all laughing)

794
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,490
- I hope to hear the creepy sounds

795
00:33:56,490 --> 00:33:59,250
throughout the whole hotels as well.

796
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:01,813
I would enjoy that. (laughs)

797
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:06,533
- Excellent.

798
00:34:09,450 --> 00:34:10,768
- Great idea.

799
00:34:10,768 --> 00:34:13,935
(audience applauding)

800
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:20,912
- [Attendee] Hi folks, how are you?

801
00:34:20,912 --> 00:34:21,745
- Good, how are you?

802
00:34:21,745 --> 00:34:22,890
- [Attendee] This is my first DEFCON.

803
00:34:22,890 --> 00:34:23,853
- Woo! Welcome.

804
00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:29,520
- [Attendee] So I just
came from my first Skytalk

805
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:33,270
and it was really interesting,

806
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:36,330
but on my way up, I got yelled at,

807
00:34:36,330 --> 00:34:39,630
put away my phone for talking possibly.

808
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:43,470
And I was just wondering how hard

809
00:34:43,470 --> 00:34:46,230
or theoretical would it be to repurpose it

810
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:48,480
so you can turn this into recording device

811
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,680
in the middle of Skytalks

812
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:51,210
because that puts a recording device

813
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:52,960
in every single person's hand here.

814
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:56,580
- I mean, don't do that.

815
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:58,180
- [Attendee] No, I'm just

816
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:04,170
putting it out there because
I brought it up to them

817
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:09,141
and I looked around and
I was like, holy shit!

818
00:35:09,141 --> 00:35:13,050
- So the default programming,
you've got three samples,

819
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:15,063
one second each for recording.

820
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:17,250
- Okay.
- Yeah.

821
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:18,510
- [Attendee] So there's not enough memory

822
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:19,852
to hold enough audio?

823
00:35:19,852 --> 00:35:22,530
- You could secretly record three seconds.

824
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:23,950
- [Attendee] Okay, so that's good.

825
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:25,083
Good, thank you.

826
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:29,585
- [DEFCON Staff] Thanks
for asking a question.

827
00:35:29,585 --> 00:35:31,743
This is five bucks (indistinct)

828
00:35:31,743 --> 00:35:33,123
- Hey, any other questions?

829
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:35,453
- [DEFCON Staff] Oh, right here.

830
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:39,240
- [Attendee] So awesome badge.

831
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,330
And when I first saw it,
I was like, oh, dang!

832
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:45,990
I should have paid more attention
in music classes. (laughs)

833
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:48,420
So did you have to do some research

834
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:51,300
in terms of how to read a music sheet

835
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:52,200
or anything like that

836
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,150
or were you already musically inclined?

837
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:58,680
- I'm not, but she is musically inclined.

838
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:02,190
- Oh (chuckles) so music's
been part of my whole life.

839
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:04,650
I perform in theater
and do musical theater.

840
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:07,110
And so I was like, I'm happy to do,

841
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:09,390
and I play the piano a little bit,

842
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:11,070
like this hand, really well.

843
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:13,200
This hand doesn't do so great,

844
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,243
but this hand does great. (laughs)

845
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:22,213
You love me. (laughs)

846
00:36:25,813 --> 00:36:28,230
- [Attendee] I just wanna
thank the community of DEFCON

847
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:31,320
for resharing my final countdown video

848
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:34,530
I posted on (chuckles) the forum.

849
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:37,830
Lilly had the most likes
and shares and views

850
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:39,480
I got on all my music.

851
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,910
So I wanna thank you
guys for just completely

852
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:43,530
just going wild, just sharing for that.

853
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:46,290
So it made a big impact to my music.

854
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:47,123
So, thank you.

855
00:36:47,123 --> 00:36:48,696
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

856
00:36:48,696 --> 00:36:50,298
(indistinct)

857
00:36:50,298 --> 00:36:51,131
- All right.

858
00:36:51,131 --> 00:36:53,400
Any more questions you only
got time for one or two more.

859
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,800
(indistinct)

860
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:56,633
- [Attendee] Hey awesome.

861
00:36:56,633 --> 00:36:57,466
Thanks for the badge.

862
00:36:57,466 --> 00:36:59,730
It's been actually pretty fantastic.

863
00:36:59,730 --> 00:37:02,880
This is actually in regards
to the badge challenge.

864
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:06,240
So I guess minor spoilers for some people.

865
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:10,050
Will the, I guess the phone system

866
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:12,330
or whatever that you guys
have on the badge challenge,

867
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:14,250
will that may be made available for

868
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:19,187
post-conference usage in case ...

869
00:37:19,187 --> 00:37:20,430
(speaking simultaneously)

870
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:22,383
- No, it won't be available after CON.

871
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:24,780
We might be able to work something out,

872
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:26,830
but I wouldn't count on it at this point.

873
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,658
Got one more over there.

874
00:37:29,658 --> 00:37:31,410
- The last question.

875
00:37:33,508 --> 00:37:34,341
- Run.

876
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:38,010
- [Attendee] How long do you expect

877
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:39,420
the batteries to last for?

878
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:40,670
Did you test that at all?

879
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:43,350
- We did test the batteries a bit.

880
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:45,063
It depends on a lot of things.

881
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:48,570
So just leaving it on,

882
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:50,490
it'll go to sleep after a few minutes

883
00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:52,260
and that should last pretty much

884
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:54,060
the duration of the conference.

885
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:56,160
The more you play with it,
the faster it's gonna die.

886
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,568
If you got an SAO it's really gonna die.

887
00:37:58,568 --> 00:38:00,750
(audience laughing)

888
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:03,213
- And it's all theoretical
until you find out.

889
00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:08,097
- All right, thank you so much
for coming to the badge talk.

890
00:38:08,097 --> 00:38:09,090
(audience applauding)

891
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:10,340
We'll see you at the CON.
