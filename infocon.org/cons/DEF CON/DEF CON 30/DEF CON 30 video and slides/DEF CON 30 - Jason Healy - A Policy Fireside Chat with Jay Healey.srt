1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,083
- We'd like to welcome Jay
Healey from the CFP team,

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:06,933
and then Fahmida.

3
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:09,840
Welcome to DEF CON.

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,850
They'll be giving a fireside talk.

5
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:13,740
Please watch your schedules

6
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,680
and you'll see the latest information

7
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,570
on the Hacker Tracker app.

8
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:21,630
So if you're following
which times and rooms

9
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:22,620
you'd like to see,

10
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:24,780
that's the best place to find
your updated information.

11
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:29,154
So please give a warm
welcome to our panelists.

12
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:30,810
(audience applauding)

13
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:31,643
- [Jay] Fahmida.

14
00:00:33,202 --> 00:00:34,035
Yeah.

15
00:00:35,856 --> 00:00:37,131
- Thank you for the reminder, Jay.

16
00:00:37,131 --> 00:00:39,147
(Jay and Fahmida laugh)

17
00:00:39,147 --> 00:00:41,429
Hi, I'm Fahmida Rashid,

18
00:00:41,429 --> 00:00:43,156
I'm managing editor of
features at Dark Reading,

19
00:00:43,156 --> 00:00:45,390
and I am so excited to get a chance to...

20
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:48,090
- [Jay] Yeah, I don't think
we have audio for Fahmida?

21
00:00:49,212 --> 00:00:52,253
- Or should I just use?

22
00:00:52,253 --> 00:00:53,086
Okay.

23
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,673
Hi, is this better?

24
00:00:55,673 --> 00:00:56,506
There we go.
- Yay!

25
00:00:56,506 --> 00:00:57,690
- I hear myself now.

26
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:00,061
- Hacking!
(Fahmida laughs)

27
00:01:00,061 --> 00:01:01,560
- So I'm Fahmida Rashid,

28
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,960
I'm the managing editor at Dark Reading,

29
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,440
and it is my pleasure
to be here at DEF CON

30
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,390
to speak with Jay Healey.

31
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:11,490
We're gonna be talking a
little bit about the past,

32
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:16,490
present, and the future of
info sec, hacking, policy,

33
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:19,050
we're gonna be touching on
a lot of different topics.

34
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:21,599
So Jay, thank you so much
for joining me today.

35
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:23,310
- Thanks, thanks Fahmida, excited.

36
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:24,143
- Yeah.

37
00:01:24,143 --> 00:01:27,533
So I think one of the things
that I was hearing is,

38
00:01:27,533 --> 00:01:30,333
this is DEF CON 30, but I
think you mentioned to me

39
00:01:30,333 --> 00:01:34,093
it's also the 50th
anniversary of the realization

40
00:01:34,093 --> 00:01:35,460
- Yeah.
- that hackers

41
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,560
will almost always succeed.

42
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,150
- Yeah.
- So what did that tell you?

43
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:40,720
How did that make you feel?

44
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:45,720
- Yeah, let me push that back
on what led to that question.

45
00:01:46,814 --> 00:01:48,780
Are we, thank you for
those that are giving me

46
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,157
the universal sign of,

47
00:01:50,157 --> 00:01:51,957
are we doing any better on this one?

48
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,639
Okay.

49
00:01:54,639 --> 00:01:56,010
- [Staff] Get the mic up to your mouth.

50
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:58,020
- Check one, check two.

51
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,460
I was just on this.

52
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:02,403
Check one, check two, test,
I'm wearing pants and a shirt.

53
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:07,870
- No, it's not.

54
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,390
- Check one, check two.

55
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:10,380
Yes, thank you.

56
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,553
We have connected.

57
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:15,630
Great to hear you, or
great that you can hear me.

58
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:19,470
So Fahmida's intro, she was talking about

59
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:23,673
how we haven't done as much
as we want to as a community.

60
00:02:24,626 --> 00:02:26,460
This is DEF CON 30, right?

61
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:31,140
If we look at why a lot of
hackers do what we do, right,

62
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,820
a lot of it is for curiosity,

63
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,040
a lot of it is because
we're driven to do so,

64
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,643
but a lot of it is to make things better.

65
00:02:39,635 --> 00:02:42,363
We're doing this for
a purpose, many of us.

66
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:48,967
And I came across this quote that said,

67
00:02:48,967 --> 00:02:52,860
"Few, if any, contemporary
computer security controls

68
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,140
can stop a dedicated red team

69
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:58,227
from easily accessing
any information sought."

70
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:02,370
So it's saying the red team is
going to get through, right?

71
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:03,600
The hacker is going to get through,

72
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,120
the attacker has the advantage.

73
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,553
That quote was from 1979.

74
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:13,290
And I found actual quotes
that go back to 1972

75
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:15,390
that say the red team's gonna get through.

76
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,430
So, all right.

77
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:20,850
So if we're doing this to
try and make things better,

78
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:21,993
it's failing.

79
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:26,730
Using the normal way we go about things.

80
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:30,210
And that's why I'm glad to
see everyone here in policy.

81
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:33,090
That's a lot of what we're
trying to get done with policy,

82
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:35,160
is to say, all right, the normal things,

83
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:40,160
like hacking things and
telling people about it,

84
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:43,800
isn't leading to the success
at scale that we wanted,

85
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,120
'cause the attackers, if anything,

86
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,060
are just getting better and better.

87
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,800
And if you heard, Chris Inglis and others

88
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,690
talked about this in this room.

89
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:55,020
And so just think of
that, since 1972, right,

90
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:59,100
think about all of the patents,

91
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,990
all of the hundreds of
billions of dollars,

92
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:05,220
all the worked weekends, all
the missed kids' birthdays

93
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:08,850
that we, a community,
have done in 50 years.

94
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:12,033
And we haven't changed the
most fundamental dynamic,

95
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,620
'cause things aren't better now.

96
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:19,350
- I mean, I'm thinking
back, and like you said,

97
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:21,150
it's like all those work weekends,

98
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:24,270
we're thinking, "Hey, what is
the purpose of all of this?"

99
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:28,020
So it does get a little bit disheartening.

100
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:31,500
- Yeah, and a lot of the
mindset from this community

101
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,550
over the last 30 years,

102
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:35,190
I've started, I've been
coming since DEF CON 9,

103
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:36,870
I've been on the CFP review board

104
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:39,213
for the last six or seven years,

105
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:44,070
is that if we fuck things up, right?

106
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:48,303
If we hack the planet,
it's gonna be better,

107
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:51,813
and it's not working that way.

108
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:56,760
We're hacking stuff and
it's not getting better,

109
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,220
at least at the speed
and scale that we want.

110
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,500
If anyone heard Dark Tangent
in here this morning,

111
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,690
he was talking about how it
worked for the Election Village.

112
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:05,010
So we can do better, right?

113
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:06,990
We can make it so that
when we break things,

114
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:08,880
it really is gonna lead to better outcomes

115
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,320
on the other side.

116
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,810
- So, I mean, before we
even start figuring out,

117
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:14,700
okay, what are we gonna do differently?

118
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,860
Why don't we just kind
of go back a little bit.

119
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:20,673
What was the early days of hacking like?

120
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:25,020
I mean, I know some of
us have been around,

121
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:27,360
but I know not all of us
have been around for that,

122
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,625
so what was that like?

123
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:30,510
- Yeah, it's.

124
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:33,810
So I don't have the hacking
chops of a lot of the others

125
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:35,520
on the CFP board.

126
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,960
I'm there to help out on the policy talks.

127
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,580
But it's really interesting to see

128
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:46,230
how DEF CON has been changing
as part of that, right?

129
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:47,730
When we started off,

130
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:50,730
you know, the early years
at Alexis Park, right?

131
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:52,503
It was about shenanigans.

132
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:55,680
There was cool hacks.

133
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,680
There was fucking stuff
up and doing cool hacks.

134
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:03,697
One of my buddies, he
said to me one morning,

135
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:05,797
"Oh God, how drunk was I last night?"

136
00:06:05,797 --> 00:06:06,663
"Oh man, I don't know,

137
00:06:06,663 --> 00:06:07,920
like I didn't think you were that drunk.

138
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,753
What happened?"

139
00:06:08,753 --> 00:06:11,160
"Oh, I found an ATM receipt in my pocket

140
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,930
from the Alexis Park."

141
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:14,280
That was considered the height

142
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,510
of the stupid thing you could do,

143
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:17,910
is actually using the
ATM at the Alexis Park,

144
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:21,720
'cause it was the most
hacked ATM in Las Vegas,

145
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,983
and probably the world,

146
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:28,903
and DEF CON was absolutely 100%

147
00:06:28,903 --> 00:06:32,880
a hacking conference for hackers.

148
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,730
And it still substantially is now,

149
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:39,393
but if anyone heard Jeff here today,

150
00:06:40,943 --> 00:06:42,510
I'm sorry, Dark Tangent,

151
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:47,013
especially after Snowden
and after Stuxnet,

152
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:52,440
DT disinvited feds
coming to the conference.

153
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,470
He said, "You are no longer
welcome in our conference.

154
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:57,237
We need some time away."

155
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:00,508
And that was around DEF
CON, anyone remember that?

156
00:07:00,508 --> 00:07:01,920
That was around DEF CON 22?

157
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,790
- 22.

158
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:03,890
- Something like that?

159
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,980
And just look at how
different it is today, right?

160
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:11,943
Not only have we repaired
that rift for now,

161
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:18,090
but Jeff has said, DT has
said, we need to do better.

162
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:20,700
We're not making a difference
as a community of hackers

163
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:21,780
just on our own,

164
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:26,550
but we need to better integrate
with the policy makers,

165
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:28,500
not just in the United
States, but across the world,

166
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,660
so we have an actual policy track

167
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:31,890
to try and make more difference.

168
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:33,930
This is still a hacker conference,

169
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:35,730
but I think you're seeing
that commitment at DT

170
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:37,110
that we need to start doing better.

171
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:39,660
We need to start getting
defense better than offense.

172
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:43,320
- I think that's actually
the more positive aspect

173
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,250
that we've seen.

174
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:47,760
Like hackers have always been
a little bit on the outskirts,

175
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:51,210
a little bit doing their own thing.

176
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:53,160
But now with policy involvement,

177
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:57,390
we're seeing a little bit more,
not necessarily mainstream,

178
00:07:57,390 --> 00:08:00,660
but the idea that our ideas matter.

179
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:03,300
So what have you seen
in the past few years

180
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:07,500
where you were seeing these
kind of solicitation of ideas

181
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,210
from the hacker community?

182
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:10,590
- Yeah, and first I have to say,

183
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:13,560
I'm speaking in my personal
capacity right now,

184
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,413
not with any of my affiliations.

185
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:19,740
And we're starting to see a lot more ways

186
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,240
that hackers can get involved.

187
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,073
Just that you're here,

188
00:08:22,073 --> 00:08:24,540
that we have a policy track here.

189
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:26,460
We heard some great ideas this morning.

190
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:30,270
We had a panel and a lot of folks

191
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:32,520
that are involved in the Policy Village,

192
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,920
and some really great
ideas came outta that.

193
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:38,610
We heard from Mosfet,
who's a fabulous hacker,

194
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:40,470
and she went to Congress.

195
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:43,380
She was part of TechCongress fellow

196
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:48,000
that went to help members
of Congress and their staff

197
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,543
learn to do better, to have better laws.

198
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:55,260
We had Monica Ruiz here,

199
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,580
who was helping out, I think,

200
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:59,100
something called Digital Peace Now,

201
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,140
which is a global youth movement

202
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:05,190
to say we're tired of
nation states hacking,

203
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:08,010
and everybody else having
to pay the penalty,

204
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:10,950
and so what can we do to try and to help

205
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,783
make governments more responsible?

206
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:15,600
And they're really well meaning.

207
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,950
Is anyone with Digital Peace Now?

208
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:19,380
Anyone signed up to Digital Peace Now?

209
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:20,490
Super well meaning,

210
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:23,970
but they don't understand the
tech as well as they might.

211
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:26,460
And so if that sounds like it's something

212
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:27,420
that's of interest to you,

213
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:30,930
they can really use your help
in whatever country you're in.

214
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:34,830
Like checking with your city council.

215
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:37,590
There are people there that
need your help as a hacker

216
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:40,530
to say, "Good, yes, I need help.

217
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:43,020
I need some advice on
how we can do better."

218
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:46,470
Whether that's at your
village, your city, your state,

219
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:49,920
your region, whatever those are.

220
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,410
We had Jack Cable here this morning

221
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:55,920
who was around, he got
involved in Hack the Pentagon,

222
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,330
the first bug bounty program

223
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,250
against the Department of Defense.

224
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:00,750
That's how he got his start,

225
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:03,600
was finding these bugs in the Pentagon,

226
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,620
and then moving on,

227
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,330
and then he switched
to a job in government

228
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:10,620
to help do things like
improve election security

229
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,150
in the United States.

230
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:16,230
And he did that 'cause he got
in through the front door,

231
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:18,600
in just doing a bug bounty program.

232
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,920
So that's a U.S. example,

233
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,070
but we're starting to see
these "hack the blank"

234
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:27,090
come up in all sorts of country.

235
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:29,250
And the last one I'll mention is

236
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,350
the United States Government,
as well as other governments,

237
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:34,380
when they're coming out with a new rule,

238
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,480
they'll ask for input.

239
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,040
So we heard this morning,

240
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,507
Harley, who's a former
congressional staffer, said,

241
00:10:40,507 --> 00:10:44,430
"Look, the FTC is coming
out with a new rulemaking

242
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:48,657
on what cybersecurity should
be to help protect consumers."

243
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:52,460
That so fits into the kinds
of things that we're doing.

244
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:56,190
And rulemaking, it sounds boring,

245
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:59,130
but it's how big things change over time.

246
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:02,403
Not just in the United
States, but in other places.

247
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,190
So whatever your context is,

248
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:07,080
however it is that's interesting to you,

249
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,270
take a look at these things, right?

250
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:12,070
Beau Woods runs I Am the Cavalry

251
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:15,543
with Josh Corman and others.

252
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:18,540
And so take a look at I Am the Calvary.

253
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:21,150
They did this probably,
what, how long is it?

254
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:22,200
Six years, maybe?

255
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,233
Seven years?
- A little bit longer.

256
00:11:23,233 --> 00:11:24,066
I mean,
- Yeah.

257
00:11:24,066 --> 00:11:25,950
- they were around for at
least four or five years

258
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:27,660
before all the stuff locked down.

259
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,157
- Oh wow, okay.

260
00:11:29,157 --> 00:11:30,930
And the message from I Am the Calvary

261
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:35,100
is we can't just hack stuff
and wait for someone else

262
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,873
to own the responsibility of it.

263
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:39,750
That if you hack something,

264
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:42,390
you're responsible for the result,

265
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:44,310
whether it gets fixed or not.

266
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:47,670
So the name came from the
cavalry's not coming, right?

267
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:51,877
There are no adults that are
going to come by and say,

268
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:53,820
"Thank you for calling
our attention to that.

269
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,590
We got it from here."

270
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:58,020
It is not gonna happen.

271
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:00,090
Or at least it hasn't been happening.

272
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:01,470
We're trying to do better.

273
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:03,870
So this whole movement of I Am the Cavalry

274
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:08,670
was to help hackers own
up to that moment of good.

275
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:09,630
How can we do better?

276
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:12,420
How can we own the results?

277
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:14,730
Not just for fucking things,

278
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:16,320
but for unfucking them as well,

279
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,840
and making sure that they stay unfucked.

280
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,100
Technical term.

281
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,600
- I think that's actually,

282
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,310
when we were talking about all of this

283
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:24,143
and as you were saying this,

284
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:27,300
I'm thinking that is the
biggest difference, I think,

285
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,910
the early days of hacking and now,

286
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:31,740
there's a little bit of accountability.

287
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:34,710
The hackers are like, yeah,
I'm doing all this cool stuff,

288
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:36,270
but let me tell you how to fix it.

289
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:38,370
Or even if I don't know how to fix it,

290
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:42,150
give me someone who can sit
down with me and fix it.

291
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:44,207
And that level of
accountability is, I think,

292
00:12:44,207 --> 00:12:47,670
one of the more positive
aspects of what we've done.

293
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:50,700
- I had a real tough moment after,

294
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,620
it was probably around DEF CON 22,

295
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:55,290
'cause anyone, anyone
involved with NSA tool set

296
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:56,370
and the folks that would come in

297
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:58,320
doing the talks on NSA tool set?

298
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,150
Not if you were actually
doing NSA tool set,

299
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:01,740
don't put up your hand.

300
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,360
And it was after Snowden revelations,

301
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:08,047
and it was a set of fabulous
security researchers that said,

302
00:13:08,047 --> 00:13:09,540
"We wanna make...

303
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,610
We wanna look at the stuff
that Snowden revealed

304
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:12,930
about what NSA was doing,

305
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:15,930
and we wanna make it so easy,"

306
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:16,763
this was their words,

307
00:13:16,763 --> 00:13:18,300
"that a 10 year old girl could do it."

308
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:21,030
Not sure why they had to gender that, but.

309
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:23,370
And they were doing that for privacy.

310
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:25,200
So their goal, I remember I was saying,

311
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,670
they were hacking GSM encryption

312
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:29,253
and they wanted to make
hacking GSM so easy,

313
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:32,580
and they were gonna do that for privacy.

314
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:36,690
And I had real difficulty
wrapping my head around that.

315
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:37,770
It was a great talk.

316
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:39,153
It was a great goal.

317
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:43,110
But how long, especially back then,

318
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:47,193
that process of we break things
and then it will get fixed,

319
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,850
it's not a direct causal relationship.

320
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:51,840
Sorry, I'm an academic now.

321
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,790
That's what we talk about,
causal relationships.

322
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:55,290
If you do something,

323
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:57,390
are you expecting that
it's actually gonna,

324
00:13:57,390 --> 00:14:00,120
what result does it actually get to?

325
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,010
And so that's why I think
we've done a lot better now

326
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:02,910
in the community,

327
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:05,227
of looking at that causal relationship.

328
00:14:05,227 --> 00:14:06,270
"Good, all right, if we break it,

329
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:07,830
let's make sure it gets fixed."

330
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:09,090
- And it's even just the fact

331
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:11,280
that we have more of a structure,

332
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:15,600
so that even if I can't make
that, or I don't know who to,

333
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,400
I now have sources to go to,

334
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,627
we have bug bounty programs
where they will say,

335
00:14:19,627 --> 00:14:21,930
"I'll help you make that connection."

336
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:26,370
So I think we have more of
an infrastructural support.

337
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:27,360
- And I think the media,

338
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,190
and I think the journalists
are doing better too,

339
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:30,023
right?
- Thank you.

340
00:14:30,023 --> 00:14:30,897
- Yes.

341
00:14:30,897 --> 00:14:35,897
And if folks heard Jeff
at DEF CON, I'm sorry,

342
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,050
Black Hat, yesterday,
introducing Kim Zetter,

343
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:43,230
about how in the early days
the journalists would just

344
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:45,850
buzz in and buzz out and
talk about the crazy hair

345
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:50,880
and use the community for their purposes.

346
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,610
Now you've got Dark Reading,
you've got Kim Zetter,

347
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:55,530
you've got so many other great journalists

348
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:59,940
that are embedded in the
community like yourself,

349
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:02,733
deep tech chops in application security,

350
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:07,050
and so help us to tell better stories,

351
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:09,633
so that we get better
change on the other side.

352
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,170
- The one thing I wanted
to actually touch upon,

353
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:15,000
and you kind of hinted at it,

354
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,430
I think a lot of the
time when people hear,

355
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:19,560
oh, hacking and policy,

356
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,634
is, well, I'm not gonna run for office.

357
00:15:22,634 --> 00:15:25,980
I'm not a lawyer, so
I don't know the laws.

358
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:27,180
So you mentioned how

359
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:29,670
working with the city council and stuff.

360
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:31,770
How do you even start that language?

361
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:34,710
How do you even get the folks
in this room who are curious

362
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:38,220
to understand that you don't
need to be a legal expert

363
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,630
to be involved in policies?

364
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:40,980
- Right, they do that, right?

365
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,723
They understand the legal side.

366
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:46,680
They're curious about what you know,

367
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,900
and so just have the conversation, right?

368
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:51,810
I mean, for whatever
level's comfortable for you,

369
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:53,910
whatever path that you
have is gonna be good.

370
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:55,950
There's check out the
stack for TechCongress

371
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:56,850
and I Am the Cavalry.

372
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:58,800
There's a lot of good material on this.

373
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,330
If you've been out to BSides.

374
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:02,760
BSides Las Vegas is usually a place

375
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,260
where a lot of these folks are.

376
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:06,870
If you go down to the policy
track, look for Beau Woods,

377
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:08,820
he's got the, he's got the,

378
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:11,133
I think the hair's blue today?
- I think so.

379
00:16:12,447 --> 00:16:13,890
- And just ask around there.

380
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:17,223
There'll be a lot of folks that can help,

381
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:20,430
not just have general ideas,

382
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:22,380
but have been through it and helped others

383
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:24,480
for whatever context you're bringing with.

384
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:28,083
Just some other tips is
one, trying at least,

385
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:32,190
it's gonna take you a while
to speak the language,

386
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:34,650
but be forgiving of the language, right?

387
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:37,710
Folks in policy, we say cyber a lot.

388
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:40,380
If you can't forgive us that, (laughs)

389
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:41,760
it's gonna have difficulty.

390
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,050
If you wanna be understood,

391
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:45,870
you have to help meet people halfway

392
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:47,730
in how they talk about things.

393
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:48,960
So on the policy side,

394
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,690
attribution matters a lot to us,

395
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:53,400
because at the end of the day,

396
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,710
it's about what nation is responsible.

397
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:58,320
I worked at the White House
for a couple of years, right?

398
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,090
I didn't care about attribution.

399
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:02,880
I cared about national responsibility.

400
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,320
At the end of the day,

401
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,090
the president is gonna
have to pick up the phone

402
00:17:06,090 --> 00:17:08,490
and he's gonna have to
call some prime minister,

403
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:09,607
some president and say,

404
00:17:09,607 --> 00:17:12,330
"Knock it off or there's
gonna be consequences."

405
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:13,533
That's not attribution.

406
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:18,150
So that stuff matters at
places like the White House

407
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:22,320
and Congress or in your
national equivalence.

408
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,120
So again, if you can't
get past the fact that,

409
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,100
no, attribution's stupid,

410
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:28,620
in your full Threatbutt
and Attribution Dice,

411
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:29,610
like that stuff's funny,

412
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:33,690
and it might not matter
much in your context,

413
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:36,870
but it definitely matters
when you're thinking about

414
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:40,200
for some aspects of this
national security policy.

415
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,550
But definitely be yourself, right?

416
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:43,620
If you're angry and you're pissed off,

417
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:45,630
don't lose that. (laughs)

418
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:48,240
Stay angry and stay pissed off.

419
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,333
Just, let's keep it
channeled and stay energized.

420
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:55,560
- Yeah, I think we have
a big problem sometimes

421
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:58,020
when you get angry, when
you are just annoyed,

422
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,347
you're frustrated, you think,

423
00:17:59,347 --> 00:18:01,950
"Hey, nothing's ever gonna change,"

424
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:04,290
that we tend to get a little insular.

425
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:07,440
So I think this track is the
perfect way of explaining,

426
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,850
don't become insular.

427
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:10,710
- And within the course of one year,

428
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:13,260
this was right around 2011, 2012,

429
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:17,430
I had Jeff Moss, Dmitri
Alperovitch, Richard Bejtlich,

430
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,260
and others say we can't,

431
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:21,300
we're frustrated 'cause we're
not making the difference

432
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:25,143
that we wanted to have through technology,

433
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,580
but we don't know how to
make this happen on policy.

434
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,140
I was working for a
think tank at the time,

435
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:31,973
the Atlantic Council, sorry.

436
00:18:31,973 --> 00:18:34,606
So a lot of folks have been
down this road of saying,

437
00:18:34,606 --> 00:18:36,300
I need to do differently,

438
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:37,680
I need to figure out other ways

439
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:41,040
to get my voice heard
and to bring my knowledge

440
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,360
and skills to bear.

441
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,553
So this is well trod path.

442
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:50,730
- We're talking a lot about

443
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:52,770
how we are doing things differently now,

444
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:57,030
but if you can even give
me one example of something

445
00:18:57,030 --> 00:19:00,030
that we are doing better.

446
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:01,680
I don't wanna be just doom and gloom

447
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,690
saying we haven't done anything better.

448
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:06,990
- So I consider myself a
strategy person, right?

449
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:10,050
It's been a long time since
my fingers were on a keyboard

450
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:12,903
in any meaningful way, or
that'd be meaningful to y'all,

451
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,590
remember the way I said
it was went back to 1972,

452
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:18,420
we're 50 years in

453
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:21,903
where we haven't been having
the effect that we want.

454
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:25,920
And I was reading a news article

455
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,200
maybe five years ago in "The Economist."

456
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,957
And they looked at climate
change and they said,

457
00:19:31,957 --> 00:19:35,100
"What have been the interventions

458
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,990
that we have done as a species

459
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:39,210
that's taken the most
carbon dioxide equivalent

460
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:40,800
outta the atmosphere?"

461
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,260
And they rated them like 1 through 30.

462
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:46,290
And they said, "As far as we can tell,

463
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:48,990
no chuckleheads have
ever asked the question

464
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:50,370
in that way before."

465
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:53,340
Here it is, one of the
most compelling issues

466
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:54,810
faced by humanity,

467
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:56,227
and no one had ever said,

468
00:19:56,227 --> 00:19:59,370
"What have we done that's
made the biggest difference

469
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:02,340
at the largest scale and the least cost?"

470
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,500
And so I had an epiphany
of, (mimics explosion)

471
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:08,490
so what is it that we as
a community have done,

472
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:09,810
that's given the defender

473
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:12,540
the greatest advantage over attackers

474
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:15,420
at the larger scale and the least cost?

475
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:17,010
And let's do more of that.

476
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:18,870
The number, any guesses, just shout out,

477
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:20,490
the number one thing
that we think we've done

478
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:24,423
at scale and cost as a community?

479
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:29,730
Windows Update, yeah,
who said Windows Update?

480
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:31,530
Absolutely.

481
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:33,090
Because instead of doing something

482
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:36,390
that only affects a single enterprise,

483
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:38,830
we could come up with
the most perfect widget

484
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:41,910
and it gets all the VC money

485
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:44,130
'cause it is the most brilliant thing.

486
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:46,830
We still have to buy a billion of them.

487
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:49,170
We've gotta integrate
it into the enterprise

488
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:50,520
or our home networks.

489
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,690
We have to monitor it.

490
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:53,010
We have to keep it up to date.

491
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:55,410
We have to train people to use the widget.

492
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:56,760
We have to get it to integrate

493
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:59,010
with all the goddamn
other tools that we have

494
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:02,070
and do that a billion times.

495
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:07,070
Things like Windows Update,
cloud, end-to-end encryption,

496
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:11,280
you do it once and a
billion devices or people

497
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,140
can take advantage of it.

498
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:15,210
This is why, especially
a lot of us on policy

499
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:20,210
are so upset over government
folks looking to break

500
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:22,770
end-to-end encryption.

501
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:25,650
It's one of the few things
that aids the defenders

502
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:27,630
at scale, easily,

503
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:28,620
if it's implemented right.

504
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:31,890
It's really one of the few
things that you can get it

505
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:34,680
and it really makes it
hard for adversaries.

506
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,063
- And it's actually one of those things

507
00:21:36,063 --> 00:21:39,390
that we've seen really become mainstream,

508
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:41,550
because it's become easier to use.

509
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,417
Like the number of people I know who say,

510
00:21:43,417 --> 00:21:45,300
"Oh, I know nothing about security,"

511
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,680
and they use Signal,

512
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,120
and I'm saying, "There you go!
(Jay laughs)

513
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:51,750
Like that right there is an
important thing you're doing."

514
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,580
- And if I could push on one area.

515
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:55,020
So for me as some of that strategy,

516
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:57,453
we've never had a real strategy.

517
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:03,180
What was the U.S.
strategy for the Cold War?

518
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:04,780
It's a single word, containment.

519
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:10,470
Sorry, I'm a veteran, you know,

520
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:12,030
for folks that were in the military,

521
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:14,190
everybody knew what
General Petraeus's strategy

522
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:15,180
was for winning.

523
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:17,100
It was win hearts and minds.

524
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:19,410
A different general would
have a different strategy,

525
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:21,750
like get in firefights and kill people.

526
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:23,520
Petraeus was very simple.

527
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,430
No, we wanna win hearts
and minds, more or less.

528
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:28,020
It's a strategy that you can fit

529
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:31,860
on a single small sheet
of paper, in this phrase.

530
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:36,540
So mine, since I read that
quote from 1972 and 1979,

531
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:38,130
was defensible.

532
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:42,200
We've gotta get defender most
advantage over the attack

533
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,610
at the largest scale and least cost.

534
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:45,870
Sometimes I like to flip it around

535
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:47,760
and talk about a sustainable internet.

536
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:51,960
Just like we want our
grandkids to have an internet,

537
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,213
to have clean air and clean water,

538
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:56,673
better than we have today,

539
00:22:58,050 --> 00:23:00,030
we can think about the same, right?

540
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:02,700
Let's have our grandkids
where they have an internet

541
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:06,360
that's at least as awesome as
the one that we have today.

542
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,880
'cause we can get so caught
up in adversaries and the rest

543
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,800
that we're not thinking
about all the amazing things

544
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,880
that we wanna do,

545
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,803
and we want future generations to do.

546
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:17,670
- Since we are talking about the future,

547
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:21,300
and how we want the internet
to be at least available

548
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:23,760
for our grandkids, my children,

549
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:27,900
but there's so many new
types of technologies

550
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,280
that's coming on.

551
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,470
We are barely scratching the surface

552
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:33,660
on understanding how we're gonna use it,

553
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:35,370
how we're gonna regulate it.

554
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:37,410
What are the policy implications

555
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:39,870
that we should be thinking
about with emerging tech?

556
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:42,363
- Yeah, just think about, on emerging,

557
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:45,900
because I know what I care about,

558
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:49,800
a defensible internet that has
defense better than offense,

559
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:53,820
anytime I get asked about a new X, Y or Z,

560
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:54,653
I always think about,

561
00:23:54,653 --> 00:23:56,610
all right, is this
gonna preferentially aid

562
00:23:56,610 --> 00:23:58,710
the defender or the attacker?

563
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:01,053
It, almost every time we've done anything,

564
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:05,040
it's preferentially aided the attacker.

565
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,930
That the attackers have been able to use

566
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:10,030
the scale of the internet more effectively

567
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,870
than the defenders have,

568
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:15,810
to add scale to our operations
and what we want to do.

569
00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:18,450
So anytime I get asked like
quantum X, Y, or Z, or the rest,

570
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:21,660
it's almost always, no, that's
gonna help attackers more.

571
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:24,300
Cloud, one of those that
can definitely help,

572
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:28,440
Beau Woods, Josh Corman, helped
talk about it really well,

573
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:31,500
that the original internet was
never designed to be secure.

574
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,550
We added things to it,

575
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:35,160
and we just slapped Band-Aids on those.

576
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,950
And now we've got five decades
of Band-Aids all the way down

577
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:41,460
when it comes to the
security for the internet.

578
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:43,560
Cloud is one of those opportunities

579
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:46,260
that we can get it right from the start,

580
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:47,880
once we get people trained for it.

581
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:50,070
We really do have to
have people more trained

582
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:50,903
so that we're able to...

583
00:24:50,903 --> 00:24:52,590
- There's a definite mindset change

584
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:54,143
that we need to make sure that people

585
00:24:54,143 --> 00:24:56,520
are not just bringing the same mistake,

586
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,173
same ideas forward.

587
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:00,330
- And before we switch,

588
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:03,213
I know we're gonna probably
switch to Q&A soon,

589
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:06,937
we had a panel this
morning and someone asked,

590
00:25:06,937 --> 00:25:11,937
"Who is your favorite
trans or female hacker?"

591
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,220
And we had a lot of great answers,

592
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:17,280
a lot you'd expect from
Grace Hopper to Katie Mou,

593
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,680
to Amelia Koran and others.

594
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,243
I wanna raise a woman named,

595
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:24,270
her married name was Hilda Mathieu.

596
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:25,770
Anyone heard of Hilda Mathieu?

597
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:28,470
She's on the NSA Hall of Fame,

598
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:31,470
because Hilda came up with the idea,

599
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:32,613
back in the 80s,

600
00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:38,810
that NSA, that these new computer networks

601
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:42,780
gave NSA this incredible ability

602
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:46,413
to do amazing digital espionage.

603
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,890
And she was doing this as
a female technical engineer

604
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:50,723
in the 80s.

605
00:25:50,723 --> 00:25:52,803
Just think of how rare that is.

606
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:56,430
And she was the one that
figured out, yep, we can,

607
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:57,840
this is gonna be amazing,

608
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,620
but she also realized

609
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:03,483
this is gonna be a real
problem for the United States,

610
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:06,510
because we're incredibly vulnerable.

611
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:08,880
So they were already
understanding that at Fort Meade,

612
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,620
in the 1980s.

613
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:11,970
And what I really like about Hilda

614
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:13,470
isn't just that she realized this

615
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:17,460
and she was this real
pioneering female engineer

616
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:19,620
whom we've never heard about,

617
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:24,510
but also her name before
she got married was Faust.

618
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:28,180
So here we've got this
actual real Faustian bargain

619
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:32,730
of wanting to both,

620
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:35,400
NSA to have it both ways,

621
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,710
and the U.S. Government
to have it both ways,

622
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:38,950
that we can hack shit

623
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:44,490
and we can still secure
things well enough.

624
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:45,480
That we can hack it

625
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,520
and the adversaries aren't
gonna see what we're doing

626
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,230
and decide they need to copy us.

627
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:52,050
But also for us here in this room,

628
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:54,180
and the people that have
been coming to Vegas

629
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:56,370
every August for 30 years,

630
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:57,700
that we can hack shit

631
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:03,060
and we don't have to worry about
how it's going to turn out.

632
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:06,060
It's the original
Faustian bargain, (laughs)

633
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:10,410
in part thanks to great engineers
like Hilda Faust-Mathieu.

634
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:11,940
- Exactly.

635
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:14,910
So, I mean, we started off
all of this conversation

636
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:18,810
with you saying that we've been doing this

637
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:21,963
over and over again,
and nothing has changed.

638
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:27,840
We are now talking about a
strategy of defensibility.

639
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,670
How are we going to change?

640
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:31,710
What are the things that
we can start saying, okay,

641
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:33,150
these are the things we're gonna do

642
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:36,933
so that we can get blue
team better than the red?

643
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:43,620
- I think you heard a lot
of it here from Chris Inglis

644
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,733
this morning, right?

645
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,000
When I look at that question,

646
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,500
so we've looked at,

647
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:52,440
we did this report through
the New York Cyber Task Force

648
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,790
out of Columbia University,

649
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:55,590
and we went back and we said, okay,

650
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:57,420
what have been the actual innovations

651
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:58,650
that have made the biggest difference

652
00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:01,920
at the largest scale and least cost

653
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,050
over the last five decades,

654
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:05,900
going back to the original passwords?

655
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:08,100
And we looked at those

656
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:10,830
that tend to operate inside the enterprise

657
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:14,280
and those that operate
across cyberspace as a whole.

658
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,660
And the vast bulk of things I mentioned

659
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:18,390
were up here in the technical
things in the enterprise.

660
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:20,670
So one, we really wanted
to emphasize those things

661
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:22,740
that we can get with the larger
scale and the least cost.

662
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:25,320
End-to-end encryption, cloud,
we've already talked about.

663
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:29,913
I also really want to emphasize
the operational innovations.

664
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:36,090
When the Morris Worm hit
the early internet in 1988,

665
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:40,470
it took down 10% of the early internet.

666
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:42,960
Now, yeah, that was only
like 6,000 computers

667
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:43,943
or something like that,

668
00:28:43,943 --> 00:28:45,930
but it took down 10% of the internet,

669
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:48,390
because they didn't have anybody

670
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:51,300
that was there to look for vulnerabilities

671
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:52,560
and patch them beforehand,

672
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,750
and they didn't have any
coordination mechanism

673
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:56,460
once there was a disaster.

674
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:58,770
The only coordination mechanism they had

675
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:00,570
was the internet itself.

676
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:03,870
So they invented a computer
emergency response team.

677
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:05,700
We had to invent a CERT.

678
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,350
And now, of course, everybody has a CERT,

679
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:09,960
they're considered part
of the environment.

680
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:14,310
We had to invent the role of a CISO,

681
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:16,470
chief information security officer.

682
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:18,300
Vladimir Levin, a Russian hacker,

683
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:23,300
took Citibank for $15
million or so in 1995.

684
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:25,500
And we had to invent a CISO.

685
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:29,220
We had to invent a ISAC.

686
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:31,350
I used to be the vice
chairman of the FS-ISAC.

687
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:36,240
We had to invent ISACs in 1999
by a presidential directive.

688
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:40,020
The MITRE ATT&CK framework,
Lockheed Martin Kill Chain.

689
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:43,050
This stuff is, like the kill
chain or the cyber framework,

690
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:47,340
like, it's almost free, right?

691
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:48,240
It's a doctrine.

692
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:52,350
It's an idea about how you do things.

693
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:55,410
And just think about all
the defensive innovations

694
00:29:55,410 --> 00:29:58,440
that we've gotten from the
MITRE ATT&CK framework,

695
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:01,110
and how it's allowed us to
talk about things at scale

696
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:04,530
and implement things that sticks in taxi.

697
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:07,800
So as you're thinking
about how we can have

698
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:11,340
the most impact at scale,
it's not all about technology.

699
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:13,770
It's a lot of these
operational, these process,

700
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:16,050
the organizational innovations.

701
00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:18,645
Actually, maybe like CISA,
right, is now doing JCDC.

702
00:30:18,645 --> 00:30:19,478
- Yeah.

703
00:30:19,478 --> 00:30:21,870
- The Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative.

704
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:23,970
- I mean, the thing that
really strikes me about

705
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:28,080
the CERT, ISAC, even the
MITRE ATT&CK framework,

706
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:31,140
it's actually fundamentally collaboration.

707
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:33,480
It's like, okay, how do I work with you?

708
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,250
I can't do this alone.

709
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:37,410
I need to get other people with me.

710
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:39,420
And what is the shared language?

711
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:41,910
And I love the examples you gave,

712
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:45,240
because it kind of goes back
to what we were saying earlier,

713
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:48,210
that we need to be working
with the community.

714
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:50,343
We need to be engaging with the community.

715
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:52,980
- There there's a guy named Rob Knake

716
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:54,720
who had been with the
Council on Foreign Relations.

717
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,520
Now he's the deputy for strategy

718
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,860
at the Office of the
National Cyber Director.

719
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:01,140
And he had a great phrase to it.

720
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:02,983
He called it the Home Depot model.

721
00:31:02,983 --> 00:31:03,840
(Fahmida laughs)

722
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,720
You can do it, government can,
- We all know the Home Depot,

723
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,553
that's for sure.

724
00:31:06,553 --> 00:31:07,953
- You can do it, government can help.

725
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:11,400
'Cause when I looked at,
how do you get defensible?

726
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,510
It's not through government.

727
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:13,530
We're not gonna get there

728
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:16,410
by creating some new government office

729
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:19,050
and hiring more civil
servants in any country

730
00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:20,250
or in every country.

731
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:21,393
It can help.

732
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:24,990
But it's, the only real
change to get defensible

733
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:27,153
is gonna happen through
the private sector.

734
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,060
And that for the government, for me,

735
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:31,980
is you have to enable them, right?

736
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:34,293
Imagine, sorry to use a sports analogy,

737
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:37,170
say it's American baseball, right?

738
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:39,180
You've got nine players on the field.

739
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:41,550
What we had with General Alexander

740
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:43,230
when he was at Fort Meade,

741
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:44,460
and he tried this here,

742
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:46,680
well he tried it at Black Hat, right?

743
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,797
He would run around and say,

744
00:31:47,797 --> 00:31:49,920
"Wherever the ball was hit, we got it.

745
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:52,380
We at Fort Meade, we can make the play.

746
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:54,930
Let government do this.

747
00:31:54,930 --> 00:31:57,540
Finance sector, y'all
are doing a good job,

748
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,434
but let me put my sensors on your network

749
00:31:59,434 --> 00:32:01,527
so we can collect it for you."

750
00:32:04,410 --> 00:32:06,720
But most of the time,
whenever the balls hit,

751
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,950
it's someone in the private sector

752
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:09,630
that's in the position to make the play.

753
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:13,920
Now, they might not be
able to see the ball.

754
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,030
They might have an old,

755
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:17,580
and the government has to
help them to see the ball.

756
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:19,980
They might have a bad glove,

757
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:22,110
and we might need to help
them with some capability.

758
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:24,870
They might be like me when
I was in Little League,

759
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:26,280
and they might forget they're in the game

760
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:30,030
until they hear the crack
of the ball on the bat,

761
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:32,520
and they need to be reminded.

762
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:37,350
Others don't need the enablement,
they need encouragement.

763
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:38,520
They know it's a problem.

764
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:41,700
They've got the capability,
but they're not stepping up.

765
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,620
And their government
has ways that can help.

766
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:45,510
Not just U.S. Government, but others.

767
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:46,920
And last is, at the end of the day,

768
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:50,070
it might come down to enforcing
where it already happens,

769
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:51,840
the finance sector, energy sector,

770
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,070
publicly traded companies.

771
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:54,810
The enforcing is already happening

772
00:32:54,810 --> 00:32:56,850
in lots of regulated industries.

773
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:59,790
And we first said in 1998,

774
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:01,720
presidential directives that said

775
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:07,700
that if the market doesn't
work, we might need to regulate.

776
00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:11,760
And so it's been 25 years,
so maybe we're getting close.

777
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,010
- So one thing I wanna touch upon

778
00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:16,620
before we go to the audience questions

779
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:20,100
is that there are a lot of people

780
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:23,040
who can't get involved with Congress.

781
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:25,200
They can't get involved with FTC.

782
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,570
And I've been hearing a lot
of friends who are lawyers,

783
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:30,870
they talk about how they're
required by their law firm

784
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:32,280
to do pro bono work,

785
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,113
kind of give back
- Interesting.

786
00:33:33,113 --> 00:33:34,170
- to the community.

787
00:33:34,170 --> 00:33:36,750
What would that look like
from a hacker community?

788
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:39,510
- It's a great, wow.

789
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:40,740
I hadn't really thought about it.

790
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:42,750
It's a lovely, I love that idea.

791
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:46,710
So imagine, for what
Fahmida's raising here, right?

792
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:48,120
If you're working,

793
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:50,580
if you're a CEO of a tech company,

794
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:53,670
and you care about these
issues, say election security,

795
00:33:53,670 --> 00:33:56,523
or you're worried about the water,

796
00:33:57,570 --> 00:34:02,570
you know that your local water
utility is probably insecure.

797
00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:05,580
Just like a law firm might do pro bono,

798
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:07,387
you're saying that you might say,

799
00:34:07,387 --> 00:34:08,220
"Hey, you know what?

800
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:10,380
We're gonna go and we're gonna
help out the water utility.

801
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:11,910
And we're gonna do that pro bono,

802
00:34:11,910 --> 00:34:13,350
'cause we're a tech company."

803
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:14,460
And you can imagine that working

804
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:16,200
even not just for the
CEO of a tech company,

805
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:17,917
but it's anybody just saying,

806
00:34:17,917 --> 00:34:20,160
"Hey, I'm here to help."

807
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:21,210
That's a great idea.
- I mean, if you're an

808
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:24,120
incident responder going up to, you know,

809
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:26,580
hey journalists, human rights activists,

810
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:28,950
and being like, "Hey, do
you want us to take a look?"

811
00:34:28,950 --> 00:34:32,280
I just feel like there's so
many ways we can use our skills.

812
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:34,170
- And, you know, and it ties into

813
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:36,870
a lot of corporations are
worried about their ESG, right?

814
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:40,080
Their environmental,
social, and governance.

815
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,420
And they wanna do well doing that.

816
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:45,120
And companies wanna help on their ESG,

817
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,590
and people will volunteer.

818
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:47,610
So I worked for a bank,

819
00:34:47,610 --> 00:34:50,940
and we would go out and we
would do Habitat for Humanity,

820
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:54,480
or we'd clean a park, or we
would go on a 5k fund run.

821
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:57,630
Why shouldn't there be
a tech aspect of that?

822
00:34:57,630 --> 00:35:00,330
And saying, "No, we're
gonna get our awesome

823
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:01,410
set of nerds together,

824
00:35:01,410 --> 00:35:02,790
and we're gonna go help people."

825
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:06,510
Like a at risk community,

826
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:09,040
like journalists, or Rohingya, or Uighurs.

827
00:35:09,934 --> 00:35:12,091
- Go to your local school
and help your teachers.

828
00:35:12,091 --> 00:35:13,680
- (laughs) Go to school and help teachers.

829
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:14,970
Yeah, it's a great idea

830
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:16,890
to think about that as ESG,

831
00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:20,370
to think about that as pro bono work

832
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:23,940
that we should do through our
companies and get paid for it

833
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:26,070
as part of making the
world a better place.

834
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:27,750
I love it, it's a great idea.

835
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:32,250
- So there's, you have the
microphone for the Q&A?

836
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:34,980
So if you have any questions for Jason,

837
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:36,984
please raise your hand,
- Or Fahmida.

838
00:35:36,984 --> 00:35:39,963
- (laughs) and we welcome
any questions here.

839
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,740
I can barely see.
- Got one.

840
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:44,573
We have one over here.

841
00:35:44,573 --> 00:35:46,440
That's why I wear a hat.

842
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,273
Yeah.

843
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:52,413
- There's someone over there,
and then a gentleman in blue.

844
00:35:57,696 --> 00:36:02,370
- [Staff] There you go.

845
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:03,750
- [Audience Member] I mean,
this kind of goes way back

846
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:07,050
to the beginning of hacking
and computer security.

847
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:09,030
How do we still address the idea

848
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:12,123
of what right do you
have to check my doors?

849
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,580
You know, if you walk
down the neighborhood

850
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:15,420
trying everybody's door,

851
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:17,040
you're gonna get arrested.

852
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,890
And there's that analogy
to some of what's happening

853
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:21,330
in the hacker community.

854
00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:22,230
How do we...

855
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:24,240
Are we still struggling to justify that

856
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:28,110
from a legal perspective and
from an acceptance perspective?

857
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:30,060
You know, who are you to check my doors?

858
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:30,893
- Yeah.

859
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:34,740
It's a great, and for
those that didn't hear,

860
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:36,360
who are you to check my doors, right?

861
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,193
I mean, a lot of,

862
00:36:37,193 --> 00:36:39,660
and I think our communities had this

863
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:41,550
from the very beginning.

864
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:44,310
Who are you to tell me
not to check your door?

865
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:46,050
It's publicly available,

866
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:47,610
why shouldn't I be able to scan it?

867
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:49,080
I shouldn't even be able
to get into your computer

868
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:51,720
because you didn't protect it well enough.

869
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:54,090
That's part of our legacy of being hackers

870
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:56,550
and being in Vegas in
this time of year, right?

871
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:58,800
But also saying we also care about privacy

872
00:36:58,800 --> 00:36:59,910
and we want to do that.

873
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:04,560
I liked how Chris Inglis put
it together up here in that,

874
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:05,880
at least how the government was seeing it,

875
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:08,970
and saying we're all in it together,

876
00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:12,540
and just because your side
of the boat has a leak,

877
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:14,460
that's affecting the rest of us.

878
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:16,770
And I honestly approached this.

879
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:19,380
I talked about sustainability of how

880
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:21,810
we want our kids and grandkids
to have at least as good

881
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:23,490
as we have today.

882
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:28,440
And that's led to all
sorts of norms and mindsets

883
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,750
to think globally, act locally.

884
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:32,430
But also knowing that
the things that we do

885
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:37,020
have externalities and
that I can say, good,

886
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:38,970
I have a right to use
as much water I want,

887
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:43,970
or I can have as polluting
a company or car as I want.

888
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:47,700
But the way I, speaking personally,

889
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:48,690
I say it's kind of a dick move.

890
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:50,070
Like yeah, you've got the right to do it,

891
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:52,050
but you are imposing that on others,

892
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:55,050
and you're making the
situation worse for others.

893
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:58,980
And so we are gonna
have to think more about

894
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:02,880
how that affects us, that
good, your unpatched system.

895
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,800
It's not just you getting hacked,

896
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,690
but you're imposing that on others

897
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:08,970
because you're gonna be part of a DDoS.

898
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:12,960
And Inglis talks about
this new social contract

899
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,330
and what it is that we owe each other,

900
00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:18,990
what rights and
responsibilities we can demand.

901
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:21,630
But what are the
concomitant responsibilities

902
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:23,067
that we owe others?

903
00:38:23,067 --> 00:38:25,500
And I think it's a great
part of that conversation.

904
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:28,713
And for us to really address that afresh,

905
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,530
'cause that's what it's
coming down to a lot.

906
00:38:31,530 --> 00:38:33,240
What are we owed?

907
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:38,240
Even if we're having unpatched
systems versus, you know,

908
00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:41,880
FBI going in and patching systems for them

909
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:44,190
like they did for Cyclops Blink, right?

910
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:45,023
Let's address it.

911
00:38:45,023 --> 00:38:45,900
I think it's a great question.

912
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:47,857
- Or the, ISP basically saying,

913
00:38:47,857 --> 00:38:49,920
"I'm gonna scan and I'm
gonna take your computer

914
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,410
off the network because you have malware."

915
00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:54,420
- And it's a great, and
I know they won't happen.

916
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:56,013
I remember there's a great, it was a,

917
00:38:56,013 --> 00:38:57,900
or I think it was Arbor Networks did this.

918
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:00,600
And they looked at ISPs of saying,

919
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,970
which, and this maybe 10 years ago, ISPs

920
00:39:02,970 --> 00:39:06,360
do you monitor for inbound attacks?

921
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,580
And like 90% looked for inbound attacks.

922
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:12,030
And they said, "Do you
monitor for outbound attacks?"

923
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:14,250
And half of them didn't even bother

924
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:15,660
to monitor for outbound attacks,

925
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:17,010
and those that did,

926
00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:19,833
something like half of
them did nothing about it.

927
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:23,340
They would just see the
attacks going outbound.

928
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:26,040
They said, "Not my problem."

929
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,570
What do we think about that?

930
00:39:27,570 --> 00:39:31,110
Is that, I mean, that's
classic tragedy of the commons,

931
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:32,730
that they either don't,

932
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:37,110
half of the respondents back
then didn't know or didn't care

933
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:39,330
that they were imposing
problems on others.

934
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:40,560
That's externalities.

935
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,550
And at the end of the day,

936
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:44,100
that's where, in the
normal social contract,

937
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:45,847
we expect the government
to come in and say,

938
00:39:45,847 --> 00:39:48,810
"No, you can't impose
these costs on others

939
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:50,533
through your own inaction."

940
00:39:50,533 --> 00:39:52,444
- Yeah, can we get the next question?

941
00:39:52,444 --> 00:39:53,277
- Yeah.

942
00:39:53,277 --> 00:39:54,450
- [Audience Member] Hey, good afternoon.

943
00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:56,670
So I have kind of an
unpopular opinion here,

944
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:58,710
so this might be agitating to some people,

945
00:39:58,710 --> 00:40:00,630
but I think one of the reasons

946
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:03,810
why we have issues with policy ,

947
00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:07,080
and that's really what the
gist of this conversation was,

948
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:09,210
is that a lot of people
focus on the hackers,

949
00:40:09,210 --> 00:40:10,380
so people that are here.

950
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:11,370
But if you actually look at

951
00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:14,700
when we actually were good
at things like strategy,

952
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:16,980
it was from offset strategies.

953
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:19,050
We had a first offset strategy, nuclear.

954
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:21,780
We had a second offset strategy, ISR.

955
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:24,600
We tried getting a third
offset strategy of technology.

956
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:28,920
Ash Carter, Bob Work, and a
few other people, Jim Baker,

957
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,960
and a few other people
that worked at the building

958
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,520
were champions of this.

959
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:35,340
And then it fell on its
feet for whatever reason,

960
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:38,070
because of a session, we'll just call it.

961
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:42,540
So to me, the biggest problem
that we have as a nation,

962
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:45,480
'cause I wanna take this
beyond just the hacking,

963
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,880
it's really about cybersecurity

964
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,320
and how do you secure things.

965
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:52,020
It's that we do not have
a defined offset strategy.

966
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:54,510
And from there that's where
your operational tactic,

967
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:56,970
your operations go and your tactics go.

968
00:40:56,970 --> 00:40:58,740
My question to you is

969
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:01,027
will there ever be somebody that says

970
00:41:01,027 --> 00:41:04,170
"No shit, wake the fuck up
and get an offset strategy."

971
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:05,368
Over.

972
00:41:05,368 --> 00:41:06,420
- Yeah, cool.

973
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:07,860
And this is probably gonna
be the last question,

974
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:10,560
unless you want to take one
more and then I answer both?

975
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:11,550
I don't know how we're doing on time

976
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:12,480
- [Staff] Two minutes.

977
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,800
- Yeah, you wanna take
one more of the question

978
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:14,850
and then we can, yeah.
- So he had,

979
00:41:14,850 --> 00:41:16,110
the gentleman in the blue,
- Awesome.

980
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:18,270
do you still have a question?

981
00:41:18,270 --> 00:41:19,103
You're fine?

982
00:41:19,103 --> 00:41:21,120
Okay, and then I think
the gentleman in the black

983
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:22,680
with the orange lanyard,

984
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:26,070
he was one of the first
people to have his hands up.

985
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:27,533
- Thanks, Mike, we'll catch up.

986
00:41:32,730 --> 00:41:34,317
- [Staff] We have two minutes left.

987
00:41:34,317 --> 00:41:35,206
Two minutes, no rush.

988
00:41:35,206 --> 00:41:36,510
- [Audience Member] (laughs) Thanks.

989
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:38,643
Hey, Jason, very good talk as always.

990
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:42,360
You referenced earlier
about control effectiveness,

991
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,530
that for nearly 50 years,

992
00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:45,900
we haven't really seen
significant advancement

993
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:47,070
in control effectiveness.

994
00:41:47,070 --> 00:41:50,580
I was curious if, especially
from a policy standpoint,

995
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:55,580
we can get firms to all agree
to improve cyber hygiene,

996
00:41:56,010 --> 00:41:58,530
cyber control, capabilities,
and effectiveness.

997
00:41:58,530 --> 00:42:03,530
How would you suggest
measuring control effectiveness

998
00:42:03,570 --> 00:42:07,380
and thresholds for
essentially defining good.

999
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:08,280
- Perfect, thanks.

1000
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:12,060
So first, the first one is a very

1001
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:13,290
U.S. Department of Defense strategy.

1002
00:42:13,290 --> 00:42:15,300
This thing's called the third offsets.

1003
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:18,150
And the offsets were a
military strategy to say,

1004
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:21,210
what are the things that the
United States and allies,

1005
00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:24,270
that are super easy for the United States

1006
00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:25,350
and our allies to do,

1007
00:42:25,350 --> 00:42:27,930
but are really hard for our adversaries.

1008
00:42:27,930 --> 00:42:28,763
I actually thought of it

1009
00:42:28,763 --> 00:42:30,810
as an encryption problem, (laughs) right?

1010
00:42:30,810 --> 00:42:31,920
'Cause encryption is there.

1011
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,510
It's meant to be really easy one way

1012
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:35,190
and really difficult the other way.

1013
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:37,340
And it just took that
to military strategy.

1014
00:42:40,582 --> 00:42:43,870
And so we were trying this
over the last couple years

1015
00:42:44,850 --> 00:42:46,567
and people in D.C. would say,

1016
00:42:46,567 --> 00:42:49,380
"Cyber is a way that we're
gonna do this offset strategy."

1017
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:52,290
And I had no idea what
they were talking about,

1018
00:42:52,290 --> 00:42:54,780
'cause it is just as easy, if not easier,

1019
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:57,330
for our adversaries to have
offensive cyber capabilities

1020
00:42:57,330 --> 00:42:58,500
as it is for us.

1021
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:00,150
What's really hard for them

1022
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:01,953
is to work with the private sector.

1023
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:06,330
When you look back at almost
every major cyber incident

1024
00:43:06,330 --> 00:43:08,700
that we've ever had,
anywhere in the world,

1025
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:11,850
it's almost always the private
sector that has the agility,

1026
00:43:11,850 --> 00:43:13,110
the subject matter expertise,

1027
00:43:13,110 --> 00:43:14,910
and they have their
hands deep in cyberspace,

1028
00:43:14,910 --> 00:43:16,023
and they can fix it.

1029
00:43:17,070 --> 00:43:18,810
Governments lack that.

1030
00:43:18,810 --> 00:43:20,880
So we need to do those
things that the Russians,

1031
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:23,250
the Chinese, the Iranians can't do,

1032
00:43:23,250 --> 00:43:25,710
is work with the private
sector in the rich way

1033
00:43:25,710 --> 00:43:26,820
that we do in the West.

1034
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:28,410
And then to close out on the measurement,

1035
00:43:28,410 --> 00:43:30,270
it's a fabulous question.

1036
00:43:30,270 --> 00:43:31,590
I'm really interested,

1037
00:43:31,590 --> 00:43:35,220
not on a measuring control by control,

1038
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:36,450
but how do we measure

1039
00:43:36,450 --> 00:43:39,360
if defense is getting better than offense

1040
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:41,430
at the largest scale of the internet?

1041
00:43:41,430 --> 00:43:45,240
For example, if we're seeing
shorter breakout times,

1042
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:47,190
we're probably not doing our job.

1043
00:43:47,190 --> 00:43:49,260
If we see longer breakout times,

1044
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:51,630
if we see them taking longer to get in,

1045
00:43:51,630 --> 00:43:53,880
those are all the sorts of
things that we might imagine

1046
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:55,290
if the internet's getting more defensible.

1047
00:43:55,290 --> 00:43:57,694
- That might have to be
a conversation next year.

1048
00:43:57,694 --> 00:43:58,680
- Yeah, exactly. (laughs)

1049
00:43:58,680 --> 00:43:59,700
- Jay, thank you so much

1050
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:01,017
for joining us today.
- Thank you.

1051
00:44:01,017 --> 00:44:02,250
- And thank you everyone.

1052
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:03,750
Thank you for your good questions.

1053
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:04,583
- Yep.
(audience applauds)

1054
00:44:04,583 --> 00:44:05,416
Thanks for the questions.

1055
00:44:05,416 --> 00:44:06,390
Thanks for caring about policy.

1056
00:44:06,390 --> 00:44:07,500
Stay angry.

1057
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:08,823
Go unfuck things.
