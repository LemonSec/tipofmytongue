00:00:01.869 --> 00:00:05.472
Welcome. Thank you for attending
our talk. Today's talk is

00:00:05.472 --> 00:00:13.413
malware in the micro economy.
First the agenda. We'll cover

00:00:13.413 --> 00:00:16.617
who we are. The history of
scamming and gaming. Backgrounds

00:00:16.617 --> 00:00:21.922
for nongamers in the audience
which should hopefully be few of

00:00:21.922 --> 00:00:27.227
you. The interesting stats that
we got from players. Looking at

00:00:27.227 --> 00:00:31.565
the attackers and the techniques
and tools they use.

00:00:31.565 --> 00:00:35.903
Investigating the defenses that
Val and some other communities

00:00:35.903 --> 00:00:40.040
have put in place. And last
forecasts and recommendations

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:46.046
for the future. I'm Zack, this
is rusty. Just before we begin,

00:00:48.148 --> 00:00:51.251
I want to make sure that
everybody knows this is of our

00:00:51.251 --> 00:00:54.788
own volition and nothing to do
with our employees, yadda,

00:00:54.788 --> 00:01:01.895
yadda, yadda. >> History of
scams. Scams have been around as

00:01:01.895 --> 00:01:07.901
long as video games have been
around. Diablo 2. Runescape,

00:01:10.604 --> 00:01:16.777
people still play it. I stopped
when I was 13. Battlenet and

00:01:16.777 --> 00:01:22.749
Steam are more prevalent.
Diablo2. Interesting scamming

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:28.755
techniques. The D and D scam,
the Diablo network database

00:01:31.291 --> 00:01:38.031
where you could meet with other
players to trade, join clans and

00:01:38.031 --> 00:01:43.537
things like that. You type D and
D. User name and password. What

00:01:43.537 --> 00:01:47.240
this means is you put a do not
disturb up that responds back to

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.611
the message which is your user
name and password. The attacker

00:01:51.611 --> 00:01:57.617
would message you and they have
all your account information.

00:02:09.396 --> 00:02:14.568
Simple but incredibly effective
and hilarious. The next is a

00:02:14.568 --> 00:02:17.170
trade window scam. Attacks come
and say I want to do a trade

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.539
item. A million gold or whatever
it is. The window would close

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:22.342
and they say, shit, I fucked up.
Here is the item, my bad. But

00:02:22.342 --> 00:02:24.845
it's a different item and they
swap it in. Last is rush

00:02:24.845 --> 00:02:28.281
payment. I'll rush you through
all the dungeons here. Some X

00:02:28.281 --> 00:02:31.284
amount of gold. You give them
half up front and half when

00:02:31.284 --> 00:02:33.353
done. You give them half up
front and they go away. Run

00:02:33.353 --> 00:02:39.359
escape. How to scam people. You
have one buddy. I'll describe

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:49.936
this. You have one buddy saying
I'm looking for this jug of wine

00:02:49.936 --> 00:02:53.240
which is two copper. I'll pay
70K. The second friend says I'm

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:59.246
selling a jug of wine for 40K
and some idiot connects the dots

00:03:03.216 --> 00:03:07.054
there to see if they can make
money on the item. Easy money,

00:03:07.054 --> 00:03:11.591
the way I like it, perfect.
WikiHow, how to avoid scams on

00:03:11.591 --> 00:03:17.697
run escape. How to password save
in run escape. Anyone play eve,

00:03:17.697 --> 00:03:22.502
spread sheets in space. CCP and
the company that runs eve, they

00:03:22.502 --> 00:03:29.676
don't regard scamming as a
(audio blipped) they say it's

00:03:29.676 --> 00:03:36.883
part of the game. They don't
allow character cell fraud,

00:03:36.883 --> 00:03:43.323
impersonation, using a new
player's lack of knowledge or

00:03:43.323 --> 00:03:47.360
stealing real life assets.
Everything else is fair game in

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:53.366
that universe which is
fantastic. And the last one, the

00:03:55.802 --> 00:03:59.206
whole point of the talk is the
Steam platform. If you're not

00:03:59.206 --> 00:04:05.979
familiar with it, you don't
belong here. Steam is awesome.

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:10.350
It started way back in the day
when it was totally shitty but

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:14.521
now it's good. It's a digital
game store. You purchase and up

00:04:14.521 --> 00:04:17.591
load games. It's a social media
platform and there's a

00:04:17.591 --> 00:04:23.597
marketplace which is ripe for
the taking for scammers as well

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:28.869
as normal players to buy and
sell items together. That segs

00:04:28.869 --> 00:04:34.941
nicely into Steam market.
Nonfunctional cosmetic items

00:04:34.941 --> 00:04:41.515
were introduced in 2009. 2010
there was an update that allowed

00:04:41.515 --> 00:04:46.019
players to trade. Cosmetic hats
and weapons. The hats, they did

00:04:46.019 --> 00:04:49.856
nothing. It's like a Christmas
tree on your head that is on

00:04:49.856 --> 00:04:57.797
fire, that is worth $100 for
some insane reason. Since then

00:04:57.797 --> 00:05:03.036
it's expanded to other games.
The picture there is of the

00:05:03.036 --> 00:05:08.675
burning flames team captain. The
most expensive hat to this day.

00:05:08.675 --> 00:05:14.314
Worth $4,400. It makes your
characters head catch on fire.

00:05:14.314 --> 00:05:20.854
It does nothing useful but
someone pays $4,400 for it.

00:05:20.854 --> 00:05:27.828
Fantastic. This is a Screenshot
of the top fen available weapons

00:05:27.828 --> 00:05:31.298
in the marketplace. They're all
around $400. So there's dozens

00:05:31.298 --> 00:05:35.068
of sites dedicated to trading
and dedicated to gambling et

00:05:35.068 --> 00:05:41.641
cetera. CSO go lounge, and
traders, legal legends is

00:05:41.641 --> 00:05:48.215
interesting. There isn't a
marketplace but you have skin

00:05:48.215 --> 00:05:51.618
codes and things like email
where you can buy accounts that

00:05:51.618 --> 00:05:58.458
are boosted or have skins
unlocked. Potential attack

00:05:58.458 --> 00:06:01.995
vectors there. And I'll hand it
over to Zack? >> To sell to

00:06:01.995 --> 00:06:03.997
everybody how serious these
gamers get and how serious the

00:06:03.997 --> 00:06:10.337
communities are, we wanted to
survey the steamer base. Instead

00:06:10.337 --> 00:06:16.343
of finding as many places as
possible on the internet we went

00:06:18.778 --> 00:06:24.784
to red it. CSF two (ph.) to
collect stats in terms of

00:06:27.454 --> 00:06:31.191
anything ranging from inventory
prices or if they've been

00:06:31.191 --> 00:06:35.662
scammed before to age. To get a
general idea of what we're

00:06:35.662 --> 00:06:39.266
working with. Before I begin,
the problem with collecting

00:06:39.266 --> 00:06:42.369
stats on the internet is you
make sure that you do form

00:06:42.369 --> 00:06:47.140
validation for Google docs. When
I opened up the first excel

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:51.845
spread sheet I had an ASCII that
almost crashed my computer. My

00:06:51.845 --> 00:06:57.851
favorite ones is fuck you, talks
like this, why DEFCON sucks.

00:07:05.926 --> 00:07:09.396
Good way to start the summer,
right? Okay. Let's get into

00:07:09.396 --> 00:07:16.036
stats. First one we have here
most of these up front, we have

00:07:16.036 --> 00:07:20.407
a sample set of 1100 people.
This shows the general age range

00:07:20.407 --> 00:07:26.179
of Steam gamers. From the gaming
sub red its. Not the again

00:07:26.179 --> 00:07:30.417
scheme, 90 percent are between
12 to 24 years old. You can make

00:07:30.417 --> 00:07:35.221
some inferences there. Young,
impressionable, especially when

00:07:35.221 --> 00:07:41.227
it comes to scams. The Runescape
scam. In that post they said

00:07:45.332 --> 00:07:47.500
this works great for 13
year-olds. This works great to

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:50.136
just scam them. In terms of
Steam and the online gaming

00:07:50.136 --> 00:07:54.007
communities being an investment,
this one shows the hours per

00:07:54.007 --> 00:07:58.378
week spent on video games. Over
56 percent of people play 20

00:07:58.378 --> 00:08:01.147
hours or more on steamer. It
shows how much people invest

00:08:01.147 --> 00:08:07.487
into these things. It's not just
something where you get on and

00:08:07.487 --> 00:08:09.723
play a game for 3 or 4 hours,
you get on and play a game for

00:08:09.723 --> 00:08:13.360
20 hours and go after items that
are worth hundreds and thousand

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:16.196
of dollars and put their heart
and soul into it. In terms of

00:08:16.196 --> 00:08:22.202
the amount spent per month on
gaming items, the way this pie

00:08:26.106 --> 00:08:29.809
chart breaks down is four out of
five people that took our survey

00:08:29.809 --> 00:08:32.445
said they spend at least some
amount of money. People can

00:08:32.445 --> 00:08:36.850
spend casually one to ten
dollars but we have people

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:43.356
spending 2 percent of that base,
$500 a month on purchasing the

00:08:43.356 --> 00:08:49.829
end game items and trading with
other people. We talked a lot

00:08:49.829 --> 00:08:53.299
about purchasing and having
these game items. We then put

00:08:53.299 --> 00:08:57.937
out the question, inventory
prices? If you go to all the

00:08:57.937 --> 00:09:01.408
Steam accounts and take the sum
of all the items, how much is it

00:09:01.408 --> 00:09:03.443
worth. This is a box plot. I
wanted to show this first

00:09:03.443 --> 00:09:10.617
because of the out liers,
$60 --> 000, that is someone's

00:09:10.617 --> 00:09:14.187
inventory. So we went and
checked a well-known website for

00:09:14.187 --> 00:09:21.928
TF2 backpacks, inventories and
low and behold there is somebody

00:09:21.928 --> 00:09:26.800
there verified $55 --> 000, the
video game profile is worth on

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:32.405
Steam. This is the box bot
zoomed in. There is a red square

00:09:32.405 --> 00:09:38.411
on there that shows the mean.
People say on average about

00:09:41.781 --> 00:09:45.051
$1 --> 000 worth of items in your
inventory. When you think about

00:09:45.051 --> 00:09:51.524
these things, it goes to show
when it comes to scams, at first

00:09:51.524 --> 00:09:56.496
Runescape, diablo, game currency
is back and forth and now people

00:09:56.496 --> 00:10:00.800
attach dollar amounts to this.
This is really good targeted for

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:03.736
people that want to came because
they can steal the items and

00:10:03.736 --> 00:10:09.676
turn them around. Where does
this leave us? This is a funny

00:10:09.676 --> 00:10:11.678
picture. Only because this is
one of the most expensive

00:10:11.678 --> 00:10:17.684
[indiscernible] now. $1,500. We
put this up and I think we got,

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:25.091
yesterday or two days ago, a
friend of ours got this as a

00:10:25.091 --> 00:10:29.629
drop after playing a couple
hours after it. He played the

00:10:29.629 --> 00:10:35.735
game for 2 hours and netted an
item worth $1,500. We hate him

00:10:35.735 --> 00:10:41.741
right now. Cool. How did this
all start? I realize this is in

00:10:46.779 --> 00:10:49.182
the middle of the talk. This
started because we saw a read it

00:10:49.182 --> 00:10:57.156
post with someone having an
imager album of them attempting

00:10:57.156 --> 00:11:01.361
to be scammed. This is on the
front page of the

00:11:01.361 --> 00:11:04.898
[indiscernible]. There are lots
of comments talking about

00:11:04.898 --> 00:11:08.401
similar experiences. Head
scammers are targeting gamers.

00:11:08.401 --> 00:11:15.975
The messages say, can you be the
plus one as a stand in. The guy

00:11:15.975 --> 00:11:20.246
asks do I know you. Yes, we
played a couple days ago. Sure.

00:11:20.246 --> 00:11:28.221
When's the game? And they trade
details back and forth there.

00:11:28.221 --> 00:11:31.925
The guy says, hey, you need to
download mumble. I already have

00:11:31.925 --> 00:11:37.130
mumble. The scammer says which
version. The player says 1.24.

00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:41.067
Shouldn't matter. The scammer
says you need this specific

00:11:41.067 --> 00:11:45.972
version of mumble to talk to us.
Let me link you to the mumble

00:11:45.972 --> 00:11:49.709
site. Mumble software.net. What
is mumble software.net? It's

00:11:49.709 --> 00:11:55.715
registered in Russia. It looks
like this. If anyone downloaded

00:11:59.552 --> 00:12:02.822
mumble this is not what their
website looks like. It looks

00:12:02.822 --> 00:12:09.262
reasonable and given how shitty
voice gaming software is, this

00:12:09.262 --> 00:12:15.602
is something I would expect. Not
only that, it has great reviews.

00:12:15.602 --> 00:12:20.773
We have comments and great
quality. Good player feed back.

00:12:20.773 --> 00:12:25.712
It's awesome. So when you
download this piece of software,

00:12:25.712 --> 00:12:28.648
there is the actual mumble
installer but it's bundled with

00:12:28.648 --> 00:12:35.188
Java script that looks like
that. If you can't read it, it

00:12:35.188 --> 00:12:40.426
looks like this. This is the
download file from URL file that

00:12:40.426 --> 00:12:42.428
exists in that Java script file
which is eventually called

00:12:42.428 --> 00:12:44.530
"here." There is a download file
from URL function called. The

00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:50.536
first one grabs a copy of 7 zip
from a website called copy.Com.

00:12:57.944 --> 00:13:01.247
The second one is a 7 zip
encrypted binary, and the third

00:13:01.247 --> 00:13:03.716
one is a batch script, installed
as a service. Started on start

00:13:03.716 --> 00:13:05.718
up and [indiscernible].
Basically installed a rat for

00:13:05.718 --> 00:13:11.724
the scammer to log into your
system which is fun. This is

00:13:23.069 --> 00:13:25.938
what a hacker looks like if no
one is clear on that. Cool.

00:13:29.208 --> 00:13:31.210
We're going to go through some
of the different samples. We've

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:33.513
been doing this about a year
now. The evolution of the

00:13:33.513 --> 00:13:35.515
scammers and the attackers from
a year ago until today is

00:13:35.515 --> 00:13:37.517
fascinating with the evolution
of the complexity and just the

00:13:37.517 --> 00:13:42.455
TTPs they're using to scam
people. This is low level. They

00:13:42.455 --> 00:13:48.461
link you to curse voice --
beta.Com. It gives access to the

00:13:51.998 --> 00:13:58.004
victim's computer.
Straightforward. This is a

00:14:03.176 --> 00:14:08.981
sample -- this is what happened
when I tried to detonate it. It

00:14:08.981 --> 00:14:12.752
failed to execute the drop JS
file which is unfortunate but

00:14:12.752 --> 00:14:19.726
that's okay. It's similar to the
mumble software. It drops Java

00:14:19.726 --> 00:14:26.432
script and executes W script to
sleep for 15 or 1.5 million

00:14:26.432 --> 00:14:30.703
seconds which is like 62 days
which is most processes do, they

00:14:30.703 --> 00:14:36.676
don't. Steals information from
browsers and takes files.

00:14:36.676 --> 00:14:40.580
Getting more complex and
nastier. Your speaks, isn't

00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:47.320
based on anything real. So with
all the other samples we found

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:51.057
it was based on curse, based on
mumble, based on Skype and

00:14:51.057 --> 00:14:55.061
things like that. This is just
something that -- it sounds like

00:14:55.061 --> 00:14:57.697
it might be a weird voice
program that gamers might use

00:14:57.697 --> 00:15:03.569
which is interesting. Not trying
to do [indiscernible] attacks,

00:15:03.569 --> 00:15:09.208
just something new. This one
unhooks some windows functions.

00:15:09.208 --> 00:15:14.447
So less of the remote access
tools and more of sort of

00:15:14.447 --> 00:15:19.185
classic malware. Seeing the
evolution there. This is one of

00:15:19.185 --> 00:15:22.455
the more interesting ones. It's
got a great low go, POKEY Steam

00:15:22.455 --> 00:15:27.894
stealer. The attacker where you
knows a [indiscernible] and

00:15:27.894 --> 00:15:34.367
according to the website, this
photo is listed off there, a

00:15:34.367 --> 00:15:39.572
method of choosing to distribute
to victims. Creates a file, this

00:15:39.572 --> 00:15:45.578
QEQ file in users temp which
tries to sleep for 60 days. We

00:15:49.816 --> 00:15:53.419
have a video with this high
quality production value which

00:15:53.419 --> 00:15:59.425
is fantastic. He is dragging the
Steam stealer to the middle of

00:16:06.265 --> 00:16:10.102
the computer. This is a great
techno tract in the background.

00:16:10.102 --> 00:16:16.108
Executes the file. Running cross
X explorer like a good citizen.

00:16:21.747 --> 00:16:27.753
We can see what it's executing.
So this is his trade offers that

00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:38.264
he's sending. He has to refresh
it like 15 times. One more time.

00:16:38.264 --> 00:16:44.270
There we go. One more. So close,
baby, so close. Cool. Now that

00:16:48.708 --> 00:16:53.946
was a trade offer that he just
made to a mule somewhere and

00:16:53.946 --> 00:16:59.552
just because he clicked an
executable. That is insane. Go

00:16:59.552 --> 00:17:05.725
skins there. Here is the site.
They believe in quality. Here is

00:17:05.725 --> 00:17:13.099
your packages. They accept
paypal and pay coin. If this

00:17:13.099 --> 00:17:17.970
isn't the greatest marketing
video you've ever seen. Get it

00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:25.645
now. Perfect. I stumbled across
that video and I had to include

00:17:25.645 --> 00:17:30.783
it in this because it's
production value. That is the

00:17:30.783 --> 00:17:37.957
POKEY Steam stealer. Incredibly
effective for -- implementing

00:17:37.957 --> 00:17:43.696
security fixes. But the next
iteration is Steam stealer which

00:17:43.696 --> 00:17:49.001
is here. This is all C sharp and
I'll walk you through this. This

00:17:49.001 --> 00:17:53.339
is the main function. Iterates
through all of the windows

00:17:53.339 --> 00:17:57.410
processes running. Iterates
through anything called Steam

00:17:57.410 --> 00:18:03.182
and anything that has the Steam
[indiscernible] up loading. Oh

00:18:03.182 --> 00:18:08.955
suite Jesus which include the
Steam guard key and session

00:18:08.955 --> 00:18:14.126
codes for the login. Next
reiterate through each of the

00:18:14.126 --> 00:18:17.463
processes and iterate through
the memory. I don't know if you

00:18:17.463 --> 00:18:21.801
can see that in the middle.
There is a RegX. If you think

00:18:21.801 --> 00:18:26.706
the sex cookies are cool, check
this out? >> I have a Jack

00:18:26.706 --> 00:18:32.712
Daniels cookie for you. What do
first time speakers do? Cheers

00:18:35.348 --> 00:18:41.354
to DEFCON. >> To DEFCON. >> Good
luck can your talk now. >> Once

00:18:48.527 --> 00:18:53.366
you go Jack you never go black,
back, sorry. >> I would like to

00:18:53.366 --> 00:18:58.971
say that DEFCON does not condone
anything that was just said. >>

00:18:58.971 --> 00:19:04.944
The last half hour of this talk.
Cool. The Reg checks in the

00:19:04.944 --> 00:19:11.017
middle there is a 7 character or
7 digit string that all Steam

00:19:11.017 --> 00:19:14.320
cookies are preprinted with and
the RegX for the rest of the

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:18.224
stuff. Looping through the
processes to pull out the

00:19:18.224 --> 00:19:24.630
session cookie from memory. This
is crazy advanced from Runescape

00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:31.103
saying open this room with me
and let me steal your shit. The

00:19:31.103 --> 00:19:35.875
next part. For each session
cookie because multiple Steam

00:19:35.875 --> 00:19:43.315
instance can be on the same
computer. We get a list of all

00:19:43.315 --> 00:19:48.220
the items that are not common.
We want uncommon and rare. The

00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:53.793
bottom two lines there, the
first one is get items for Steam

00:19:53.793 --> 00:19:58.030
ID and then the text there is
570 which is the game code for

00:19:58.030 --> 00:20:01.400
Dota2. And the last is filtering
out the common items. If we look

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:08.841
at the request that is being
made and you probably can't see

00:20:08.841 --> 00:20:14.847
this but I'll describe. The user
agent being used is Valve Steam

00:20:14.847 --> 00:20:19.885
ware client. The malware is
attempting to duplicate the same

00:20:19.885 --> 00:20:25.157
client to pull the user's
inventory from the Steam master

00:20:25.157 --> 00:20:30.262
server. That is cool. 570 is the
game app ID for Dota2. So what

00:20:30.262 --> 00:20:36.268
does that give you back when you
make that request. This is my

00:20:40.106 --> 00:20:44.643
account. A request that I make
for a single item. Counter

00:20:44.643 --> 00:20:50.116
strike, the app ID is 730. This
is my 57 monkey business. A

00:20:50.116 --> 00:20:53.953
suite little 57 with a banana
handle. It's trade able and

00:20:53.953 --> 00:20:57.990
marketable. I don't have the
rarity on there but it's pretty

00:20:57.990 --> 00:21:04.530
rare. Once we have gathered a
list of all the items that the

00:21:04.530 --> 00:21:10.603
player has in their inventory,
then we make a giant list of

00:21:10.603 --> 00:21:17.209
this so we can trade it to our
mule. We create this divide

00:21:17.209 --> 00:21:24.316
list. Can only trade 256 items
at a time. If it goes over that

00:21:24.316 --> 00:21:29.622
they create multiple requests.
We iterate all the items and

00:21:29.622 --> 00:21:33.759
prepare them into the format we
need to make the request. The

00:21:33.759 --> 00:21:35.761
prepare items and the next one
is the sent items. Prepared

00:21:35.761 --> 00:21:40.232
items. The app ID is there.
Context ID. V mount, the number

00:21:40.232 --> 00:21:46.238
of items if you want to trade.
The asset ID is the item ID. So

00:21:51.577 --> 00:21:54.747
you're creating this list and
concatenating all of these

00:21:54.747 --> 00:22:00.686
together for the trade offer.
The second one is sent items

00:22:10.095 --> 00:22:12.097
using the Steam API trade offer
slash new slash send. The user

00:22:12.097 --> 00:22:14.133
ID from the cookie. The partner
is the person you're trading to

00:22:14.133 --> 00:22:16.135
and you throw your items in
there. Advanced and crazy. A

00:22:16.135 --> 00:22:18.938
step away from the low-level
scamming that we saw before into

00:22:18.938 --> 00:22:23.242
real malware, real value, real
production and we'll get into

00:22:23.242 --> 00:22:27.479
the interesting web stuff that
we saw? >> Now that rusty's

00:22:27.479 --> 00:22:31.917
talked about the evolution of
the malware I'm going to talk

00:22:31.917 --> 00:22:36.121
about the evolution of the
different attack methods via web

00:22:36.121 --> 00:22:41.760
or web TTPs. The attack websites
split into two categories and

00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:47.733
sometimes both. We've seen a lot
of phishing websites that have

00:22:47.733 --> 00:22:51.804
taken the Steam community,
taking the front page of it,

00:22:51.804 --> 00:22:55.007
attaching it to another website
and logging user names and

00:22:55.007 --> 00:22:58.644
passwords. We have a slide later
that shows how it does that.

00:22:58.644 --> 00:23:03.716
Malware droppers like we talked
about before with the mumble,

00:23:03.716 --> 00:23:09.388
mumble software.Net on there.
They get a person to connect to

00:23:09.388 --> 00:23:13.092
the website and take every
single link on the website and

00:23:13.092 --> 00:23:20.366
replace it with a downloadable
link. We've seen websites that

00:23:20.366 --> 00:23:25.838
especially terribly, you log
into the Steam account and it

00:23:25.838 --> 00:23:32.177
prompts you to say there is no
updates, download now. They get

00:23:32.177 --> 00:23:38.150
your credentials and get onto
your box and pilfer your items.

00:23:38.150 --> 00:23:41.353
In terms of the domain names,
those are two categories. The

00:23:41.353 --> 00:23:43.422
first is [indiscernible].
Essentially what we saw before

00:23:43.422 --> 00:23:51.030
with mumble or Ventrillo or
curse, think of a website that a

00:23:51.030 --> 00:23:53.599
gamer on Steam would visit. A
betting website or a regular

00:23:53.599 --> 00:23:58.937
Steam website or Voigt. People
perform different variations of

00:23:58.937 --> 00:24:06.445
the brands because they're
recognizable to a human but not

00:24:06.445 --> 00:24:12.284
to a machine. So it's easy to
trick somebody. Another type,

00:24:12.284 --> 00:24:16.722
image websites. A lot of times
they put a lot of time and

00:24:16.722 --> 00:24:20.693
energy into this hobby. And what
they do is they not only trade

00:24:20.693 --> 00:24:23.896
items to each other, they sell
items for real currency.

00:24:23.896 --> 00:24:28.067
[indiscernible] doesn't support
any exchange to broker the deal

00:24:28.067 --> 00:24:32.771
so there are player made ones
and paypal. What a lot of the

00:24:32.771 --> 00:24:38.711
times, the feed back coming from
the traders is in order to prove

00:24:38.711 --> 00:24:41.747
they have some item or funds,
they go and link Giaso or

00:24:41.747 --> 00:24:46.318
[indiscernible] pictures to the
person they want to trade with

00:24:46.318 --> 00:24:51.323
and this is the proof that I
have $500 for this one or this

00:24:51.323 --> 00:24:55.627
amount of money for a skin. What
it really is, it's just a JPEG,

00:24:55.627 --> 00:24:59.631
a.SER file that shows that the
file hitter is executable. This

00:24:59.631 --> 00:25:07.272
is really, really important
because while showing a little

00:25:07.272 --> 00:25:12.378
bit is we do have websites like
Giaso which is trusted and what

00:25:12.378 --> 00:25:16.615
people are doing is making a
fake image website. Very

00:25:16.615 --> 00:25:20.686
discernible and easy for the
human to say if someone links

00:25:20.686 --> 00:25:23.522
me, that might be an offshoot of
Inger or something that is not

00:25:23.522 --> 00:25:29.028
good and I'm going to connect to
it anyway. This is effective to

00:25:29.028 --> 00:25:33.298
get people to click on the
links. Just to go over the

00:25:33.298 --> 00:25:38.937
brands. For people that don't
know about betting, it's really,

00:25:38.937 --> 00:25:44.176
really huge in this community.
There are professional matches.

00:25:44.176 --> 00:25:46.812
There are profession mall teams
and they compete for a lot of

00:25:46.812 --> 00:25:49.314
money. Right now there is a
tournament called the

00:25:49.314 --> 00:25:53.552
international and the prize pool
is $18 million. There is five

00:25:53.552 --> 00:25:58.791
people per team and the first
place team gets $6 million to

00:25:58.791 --> 00:26:02.027
split among five. People bet on
these games all the time and you

00:26:02.027 --> 00:26:08.200
can bet different items. Because
they use these and they're

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:11.036
engaged in this community and
engaged into watching

00:26:11.036 --> 00:26:15.073
professional matches it's easy
to trick somebody into thinking

00:26:15.073 --> 00:26:19.478
they're visiting these websites.
In terms of games, the main

00:26:19.478 --> 00:26:22.481
Steam website, Steam
community.Com, you can log into

00:26:22.481 --> 00:26:28.020
your profile, talk to friends,
perform trades. [indiscernible]

00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:32.424
still very effective. If you can
trick somebody easily by

00:26:32.424 --> 00:26:39.798
changing a letter out on one of
those brands. And lastly, we

00:26:39.798 --> 00:26:45.771
talked about this but VOIP has
been very, very popular as well.

00:26:45.771 --> 00:26:50.242
Tricking someone into an
outdated version of mumble or

00:26:50.242 --> 00:26:56.181
need connection to a server to
play in a tournament, that is

00:26:56.181 --> 00:27:02.087
what they use. To really sell
the point here, the way that

00:27:02.087 --> 00:27:06.558
evolve and the way these
overtime have attacked different

00:27:06.558 --> 00:27:10.562
people using this platform, this
is an inch of the different

00:27:10.562 --> 00:27:15.067
Steam community holograph and
variations that we found. It's

00:27:15.067 --> 00:27:19.638
about 100 different domains. The
main domain is Steam

00:27:19.638 --> 00:27:24.376
community.com all one word. If
you look at this image, they

00:27:24.376 --> 00:27:31.316
replace an M with an N or M with
an R. Very, very like old

00:27:31.316 --> 00:27:34.419
techniques. These are things
we've seen in the 2000s and it's

00:27:34.419 --> 00:27:38.490
still used today.
[indiscernible] we have 230. We

00:27:38.490 --> 00:27:44.696
broke it down a little more.
Before I said there were three

00:27:44.696 --> 00:27:51.403
main ones but there are a couple
that we related to social as

00:27:51.403 --> 00:27:55.040
well. The large percentage of
the mules that we classified are

00:27:55.040 --> 00:28:00.612
image variations. A number in
front and image afterwards. It's

00:28:00.612 --> 00:28:05.651
tricking people to thinking
you're connecting to an image

00:28:05.651 --> 00:28:11.290
website. When they connect and
download it, they get the

00:28:11.290 --> 00:28:15.427
executable. It looks like a
Screenshot but when they execute

00:28:15.427 --> 00:28:21.300
it, they're infected. I know
we've talked about problems a

00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:27.072
lot. It seems like it's the wild
west. We're going to go into how

00:28:27.072 --> 00:28:30.475
Valve has responded to these.
Unlike traditional gaming

00:28:30.475 --> 00:28:35.180
companies where their business
focus on a micro economy. They

00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:40.485
have implemented interesting
fixes to combat this. This is a

00:28:40.485 --> 00:28:45.757
form post. It was on January of
this year. And essentially the

00:28:45.757 --> 00:28:49.494
person posted and said I tried
to give a Dota item away and

00:28:49.494 --> 00:28:51.997
Steam wanted to verify my email
address. [indiscernible]

00:28:51.997 --> 00:28:58.003
essentially it is turned on any
time you make a trade request.

00:29:04.876 --> 00:29:10.882
Say I'm giving rusty a gun or --
banana monkey business. You get

00:29:14.486 --> 00:29:18.423
an email, here is everything you
have that you're willing to

00:29:18.423 --> 00:29:21.360
trade. The other person is
willing to trade, are you sure

00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:26.198
you want to do this. Instead of
going and combating the links

00:29:26.198 --> 00:29:31.269
and getting antivirus and
missing platform and educating

00:29:31.269 --> 00:29:34.573
the users, they threw this in.
Effective. Really effective

00:29:34.573 --> 00:29:41.413
because this is a Screenshot
from the read it thread of the

00:29:41.413 --> 00:29:43.682
supposed maker of the Steam
stealer. Steam detached itself

00:29:43.682 --> 00:29:48.754
for good. It was fun while it
lasted. I'm not giving out

00:29:48.754 --> 00:29:53.325
refunds. You have to find a
different way to scam people. We

00:29:53.325 --> 00:29:58.363
continued to see it afterwards
and that is because of this

00:29:58.363 --> 00:30:04.736
configurable option in the Steam
client. Like I said, the key

00:30:04.736 --> 00:30:08.674
sentence is the second sentence
of disabled. Steam supportable

00:30:08.674 --> 00:30:12.277
is not providing any assistance
with items stolen from your

00:30:12.277 --> 00:30:17.049
account for any reason. The
problem with the fix, it works

00:30:17.049 --> 00:30:22.721
for a regular user but for the
power users that trade a lot and

00:30:22.721 --> 00:30:28.794
bet a lot, they go and make tons
of requests to trade out for a

00:30:28.794 --> 00:30:32.831
game, they hedge items against
certain games and look at

00:30:32.831 --> 00:30:37.302
certain investments and trends
over time and how an item dips

00:30:37.302 --> 00:30:42.708
or raises in price based on the
date. They need this. So a lot

00:30:42.708 --> 00:30:44.810
of the threads we were looking
at, people were turning us off.

00:30:44.810 --> 00:30:49.481
It's a nuisance. And because of
that, Steam stealer still works

00:30:49.481 --> 00:30:54.686
and valve refuses to help them
because of that contract there.

00:30:54.686 --> 00:31:00.625
Valve put out another silent
patch into the system. This is

00:31:03.829 --> 00:31:09.835
an article made on game spot on
April 19th that said Steam has

00:31:09.835 --> 00:31:13.572
decided to limit users who
haven't spent $5 on any game

00:31:13.572 --> 00:31:19.277
from friendly requesting people
and trading people. So

00:31:19.277 --> 00:31:23.682
essentially it's increasing the
cost. These different bots. They

00:31:23.682 --> 00:31:29.688
do a ton of friend requests and
how to respond to the other

00:31:33.125 --> 00:31:39.064
person and issue a link. This
got rid of that. Unless the

00:31:39.064 --> 00:31:44.536
Steam stealer bot net hurters
essentially went and spent the

00:31:44.536 --> 00:31:51.843
$5 per bot they had. We went
back out to the trading websites

00:31:51.843 --> 00:31:55.147
and asked them, how many scam
friend requests did you get per

00:31:55.147 --> 00:32:01.486
day before and after the $5 fix.
It's a weird survey. Talking

00:32:01.486 --> 00:32:04.956
with the traders, they said they
can tell based on a friend

00:32:04.956 --> 00:32:09.795
request on Steam if the person
is a scammer or not. They judge

00:32:09.795 --> 00:32:15.267
by account age, number of mutual
friends, the name, the messages

00:32:15.267 --> 00:32:20.338
they send in the friend request.
The whole community said they're

00:32:20.338 --> 00:32:25.977
good at catching these. On the
left you have the box bot.

00:32:25.977 --> 00:32:32.984
Before the 5-dollar square. The
red is about 19 a day. There are

00:32:32.984 --> 00:32:38.390
some out liers. After the
5-dollar fix the box is

00:32:38.390 --> 00:32:42.027
significantly reduced. The mean
is reduced by over half and

00:32:42.027 --> 00:32:46.164
there are still out liers. It's
an effective fix and it's tug of

00:32:46.164 --> 00:32:50.535
war that you have. You increase
the cost to the attacker and

00:32:50.535 --> 00:32:55.173
they do something else and you
have to pivot and keep doing

00:32:55.173 --> 00:33:00.779
more and more fixes? >> I don't
know how many of you were on

00:33:00.779 --> 00:33:06.351
Steam last week or if you watch
twitch or anybody else. There

00:33:06.351 --> 00:33:10.755
was a password reset bypass on
the Steam platform. That was

00:33:10.755 --> 00:33:14.392
awesome. For three hours all of
the major streamers on CS go,

00:33:14.392 --> 00:33:20.432
GOTA2 were locked out of their
accounts because of resetting

00:33:20.432 --> 00:33:26.438
the passwords. This is a gift on
how it works. If you have their

00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:35.614
account name, you can put the
account name and the passive

00:33:35.614 --> 00:33:38.650
reset field. You go and it says
reset the account

00:33:38.650 --> 00:33:40.652
[indiscernible] address. You
click that. You usually have to

00:33:40.652 --> 00:33:45.290
go confirm the email address
which is why it's like F star

00:33:45.290 --> 00:33:52.731
star star at G star star star.
But you can just hit okay. And

00:33:52.731 --> 00:33:56.167
it would take you right past it.
Okay. Right past it and now I

00:33:56.167 --> 00:34:01.573
get to reset whatever password I
want. This is live for 3 hours

00:34:01.573 --> 00:34:08.046
on the Steam platform before it
was fixed which is really

00:34:08.046 --> 00:34:12.684
interesting to hear the
streamers take on it

00:34:12.684 --> 00:34:17.889
[indiscernible] in an uproar
about everyone is going to lose

00:34:17.889 --> 00:34:22.861
their items. The steamers didn't
care because of all the previous

00:34:22.861 --> 00:34:26.564
security fixes that Valve put in
place. When the password is

00:34:26.564 --> 00:34:30.802
reset, you can't trade for five
days. Any time a new device is

00:34:30.802 --> 00:34:34.072
connected you can't trade for
five days. Basically what that

00:34:34.072 --> 00:34:40.078
meant is all of the password
resets of the attackers hitting

00:34:43.081 --> 00:34:49.120
the accounts couldn't monetize
the fact they were able to log

00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:52.424
into people's accounts which was
a serious tip of the hat to

00:34:52.424 --> 00:34:56.861
Valve. Thousand of people were
compromised but nothing of value

00:34:56.861 --> 00:35:01.199
was lost. I say that in the most
non-ironic way possible. Which

00:35:01.199 --> 00:35:07.806
is awesome? >> Now they we went
over the history this past year

00:35:07.806 --> 00:35:13.645
of studying this type of malware
and type of attacks on Steam and

00:35:13.645 --> 00:35:17.048
on these different gamers, we're
going to implement just a small

00:35:17.048 --> 00:35:19.584
forecast. Next 6 to 12 months in
the types of malware. The first

00:35:19.584 --> 00:35:25.023
point is the image site how many
graphs and phishing will be

00:35:25.023 --> 00:35:31.596
weapons of choice. Instead of
performing a homo graph attack,

00:35:31.596 --> 00:35:37.402
you take my name is ZACK and
replace a letter with it, say

00:35:37.402 --> 00:35:42.140
the A with a 4, humans can
interpret that and knowit's

00:35:42.140 --> 00:35:49.514
ZACK. Works great for humans and
terribly for computers. Since we

00:35:49.514 --> 00:35:54.919
saw a huge increase on the image
sites, 66 percent of the

00:35:54.919 --> 00:35:58.189
[indiscernible] we found were
classified as images, they need

00:35:58.189 --> 00:36:01.659
a weapon of choice. It's easier
to generate these types of homo

00:36:01.659 --> 00:36:06.431
graphs. Different variations of
it. Screenshots are used

00:36:06.431 --> 00:36:11.903
consistently by traders to
verify whatever they need to

00:36:11.903 --> 00:36:17.142
when performing trades.
[indiscernible] can be more than

00:36:17.142 --> 00:36:22.347
just a stealer. If you go and
Google some of the malware

00:36:22.347 --> 00:36:26.951
families, particularly Steam
stealer, they advertise more and

00:36:26.951 --> 00:36:31.389
more features. Specifically key
loggers. They have remote access

00:36:31.389 --> 00:36:36.661
tools. You have someone with an
inventory worth thousand of

00:36:36.661 --> 00:36:40.932
dollars. They're probably on a
gaming rig that is worth

00:36:40.932 --> 00:36:43.868
thousand of dollars and
something connected to the bank

00:36:43.868 --> 00:36:49.574
on their machine. They have a
good enough amount of money that

00:36:49.574 --> 00:36:51.609
it might be worth it to drop
something on there like a

00:36:51.609 --> 00:36:57.949
banking Trojan. There is more
than virtual items. They can be

00:36:57.949 --> 00:37:00.051
used as big coin miners. They
have [indiscernible] video

00:37:00.051 --> 00:37:06.057
cards. You can really make some
money off this more than just

00:37:09.227 --> 00:37:15.400
the sites. Looks like we forgot
one animation. Now

00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:21.873
recommendations. Recommendations
from us to Valve and from us to

00:37:21.873 --> 00:37:28.379
the gaming community in general.
Valve has the anti-cheat system

00:37:28.379 --> 00:37:32.016
called Vec. They have a security
team there and responded within

00:37:32.016 --> 00:37:35.787
a couple hours to the password
vulnerability. We couldn't find

00:37:35.787 --> 00:37:40.892
anything they had a platform
security team but even as

00:37:40.892 --> 00:37:48.366
something as text analytics with
a Google safe browsing or fish

00:37:48.366 --> 00:37:54.606
tank [indiscernible] for every
URL in a Steam message if it's

00:37:54.606 --> 00:38:01.179
on this blacklist of URLs don't
send it. It reduces the time for

00:38:01.179 --> 00:38:04.783
people finding these phishing
sites and submitting the

00:38:04.783 --> 00:38:08.086
request. Valve comes in. You
report it to Valve, they detect

00:38:08.086 --> 00:38:10.722
it and remove it and people are
saved. That looks better. So

00:38:10.722 --> 00:38:16.194
another recommendation is for
platform plug ins. Steam and

00:38:16.194 --> 00:38:23.768
Valve in general are good in
terms of being open with the

00:38:23.768 --> 00:38:29.440
community in terms of game
development. There is project

00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:36.347
green light. You can develop
games and people vote on the

00:38:36.347 --> 00:38:43.721
game. If you get votes you get
into the Steam platform. They

00:38:43.721 --> 00:38:48.193
should have something similar
for plug ins. So you can let the

00:38:48.193 --> 00:38:50.528
community -- there is a lot of
people doing this already. In

00:38:50.528 --> 00:38:55.800
terms of taking the fight back
to the Steam punks. And Valve

00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:58.937
can police the marketplace. They
don't have to let it be the wild

00:38:58.937 --> 00:39:01.072
west where anybody can submit an
app, they can have different

00:39:01.072 --> 00:39:07.612
guidelines. Especially a
security one that meets some

00:39:07.612 --> 00:39:15.153
kind of standard.
Recommendations for the gamers.

00:39:15.153 --> 00:39:21.159
In browser there are a lot of
plug ins in chrome and FireFox

00:39:23.428 --> 00:39:28.499
that I use. Malware bytes has
one and they do this blacklist

00:39:28.499 --> 00:39:34.606
capabilities. Every time someone
clicks on a link whether it's in

00:39:34.606 --> 00:39:36.608
team speak when you're
connecting to a server and the

00:39:36.608 --> 00:39:40.111
message of the day comes up or a
Steam message, it opens in the

00:39:40.111 --> 00:39:43.281
browser. Steam has a browser
[indiscernible]. You can have

00:39:43.281 --> 00:39:48.353
plug in and protect yourself
from it. There are people out

00:39:48.353 --> 00:39:52.523
there that are dedicating time
to take the URLs and getting

00:39:52.523 --> 00:39:59.664
them known in the community.
[indiscernible] phishing groups

00:39:59.664 --> 00:40:06.104
as well. Essentially these are
the guys that go out, find the

00:40:06.104 --> 00:40:09.741
scammers, interact with them,
try to get URLs and file samples

00:40:09.741 --> 00:40:12.977
from there and district them out
the community. They put them in

00:40:12.977 --> 00:40:17.615
the fish tank. A dedicated group
of people. They do something

00:40:17.615 --> 00:40:21.386
above and beyond URLs. A lot of
times scammers are profiled by

00:40:21.386 --> 00:40:27.825
the communities. Trading
communities are tightknit. They

00:40:27.825 --> 00:40:31.996
know who is good and who is
shady. And FOG and Steam

00:40:31.996 --> 00:40:37.935
[indiscernible] they do exactly
that. When you go out and trade.

00:40:37.935 --> 00:40:39.937
If you want to go and say you
have an item that you randomly

00:40:39.937 --> 00:40:45.176
got or you want to buy one, go
to the websites and look up the

00:40:45.176 --> 00:40:49.714
user name and you can tell very
quickly whether or not this

00:40:49.714 --> 00:40:55.353
person is trustworthy. We didn't
have time to do it for this

00:40:55.353 --> 00:40:58.957
talk, but one thing we're also
releasing, it's out now on the

00:40:58.957 --> 00:41:03.695
chrome extension store is
[indiscernible] it doesn't do

00:41:03.695 --> 00:41:08.433
blacklisting. It detects homo
graph attacks. Like people's

00:41:08.433 --> 00:41:15.540
safe browsing, if you use this
platform and Steam, look this up

00:41:15.540 --> 00:41:19.911
in the chrome store and download
it. If there is a detected Homo

00:41:19.911 --> 00:41:25.917
graph attack or image websites,
this detects it and throws you

00:41:27.952 --> 00:41:32.323
into a Google safe webpage and
tell you why and give you

00:41:32.323 --> 00:41:38.830
options of what to do. That
pretty much sums it up. I'm Zack

00:41:38.830 --> 00:41:41.933
and this is rusty. A couple
shout outs. Without them we

00:41:41.933 --> 00:41:47.939
wouldn't have this awesome data.
There is a guy in Germany that

00:41:50.742 --> 00:41:56.748
is really cool and fields me
URLs. >> We have a lot of the

00:42:00.118 --> 00:42:03.287
samples so if you're interested
in looking at the samples, hit

00:42:03.287 --> 00:42:09.293
me up on Twitter and I'll get in
touch with you. It's been really

00:42:13.831 --> 00:42:17.568
interesting seeing the evolution
over the past year and I'm glad

00:42:17.568 --> 00:42:19.570
to have been here. Thanks.
