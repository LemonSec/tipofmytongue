00:00:00.734 --> 00:00:08.242
I'm happy to
be here. They asked me if it was

00:00:08.242 --> 00:00:17.784
my first time speaking I said
yes and no from sky talks was a

00:00:17.784 --> 00:00:25.959
smaller room so happy to see so
many people. So talking about

00:00:25.959 --> 00:00:27.961
quantum computer.
How do youknow how

00:00:27.961 --> 00:00:37.504
quantum works or quantum
-- so this is very basic

00:00:37.504 --> 00:00:43.644
that you have to know.
Complex number -- obviously

00:00:43.644 --> 00:00:49.082
so if you
don't know these please leave

00:00:49.082 --> 00:00:57.925
the room. I'm kidding. The nice
thing I will say that you don't

00:00:57.925 --> 00:01:04.064
need to get this stuff to
understanding quantum computing

00:01:04.064 --> 00:01:12.906
-- lost audio -- I will try to
convince you that. Outline, I

00:01:12.906 --> 00:01:21.081
will be talking very broad but I
will not go into technical

00:01:21.081 --> 00:01:29.923
details so how things work and I
will give you the ideas and

00:01:29.923 --> 00:01:36.063
applications. Very brief crash
course of quantum computing. So

00:01:36.063 --> 00:01:42.202
based on quantum mechanisms
about you see the operating

00:01:42.202 --> 00:01:50.377
system of nature on nature like
the framework on top which the

00:01:50.377 --> 00:01:58.552
gravity -- nuclear forces are
running so you get series in --

00:01:58.552 --> 00:02:07.394
and you try to adapt them to do
quantum mechanics. There is my

00:02:07.394 --> 00:02:14.201
only side about quantum
mechanics. What it says that the

00:02:14.201 --> 00:02:20.340
particles in the universe like
electrons and protons they

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:26.480
behave randomly but not not
inception they are not

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:34.654
predictable. But you have no way
to predict what is going to

00:02:34.654 --> 00:02:41.461
happen but what is different
compared to what the randomness

00:02:41.461 --> 00:02:48.268
can be negative this is problem
but negative and complex

00:02:48.268 --> 00:02:55.776
numbers. So that seems to be
counter intuitive and you have

00:02:55.776 --> 00:03:03.283
to trust me that it does make
sense mathematically. So --

00:03:03.283 --> 00:03:14.194
(lost audio) -- so when you have
not looked as the Q bit it is in

00:03:14.194 --> 00:03:23.737
the state that if you observe
the Q bit and ask what is value

00:03:23.737 --> 00:03:29.876
it is zero with property and
some other property.

00:03:29.876 --> 00:03:37.384
Coefficients and -- of the
straight line and the bracket is

00:03:37.384 --> 00:03:44.891
called the bracket notation you
don't need to remember this but

00:03:44.891 --> 00:03:54.434
what you need to know that is
alpha and beta used called -- so

00:03:54.434 --> 00:04:02.609
they can be a negative or
complex and the property so you

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:10.784
take this value and square it
and that property that is what

00:04:10.784 --> 00:04:18.959
you get so a number between zero
and one. You have different

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:25.098
properties for each byte.
Sequence of eight quantum bytes

00:04:25.098 --> 00:04:35.308
maybe it will be 0X or 00 and so
on. And using these objects like

00:04:35.308 --> 00:04:41.448
quantum computer you have
registered which can we --

00:04:41.448 --> 00:04:49.623
anything you want and you will
transform the state so that is

00:04:49.623 --> 00:04:57.130
how you will compute. You will
have kind of quantum assembly

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:03.270
but you have will different
restrictions. The importance to

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:12.112
remember that will be reversible
but can go back in the past so

00:05:12.112 --> 00:05:18.919
for your information you don't
have classical assembly you have

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:26.426
end operation register one or
two and then you register one

00:05:26.426 --> 00:05:35.268
and you can't go back in the
past not the previous value and

00:05:35.268 --> 00:05:43.443
here you have what you modify so
quantum objects about you just

00:05:43.443 --> 00:05:50.250
chain the properties what you
learned in high school in

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:55.689
algebra so just do
multiplication and transfer the

00:05:55.689 --> 00:06:05.232
property and when you properties
go to one you want -- sum to one

00:06:05.232 --> 00:06:13.406
as well. I will not go more
technical but that is idea

00:06:13.406 --> 00:06:18.845
remember that quantum computing
is multiple together some

00:06:18.845 --> 00:06:27.687
properties of complex. And that
is it. So you have this set of

00:06:27.687 --> 00:06:37.230
register that can be bot on the
same time and at the end you

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:45.405
observe one bit or more and that
your result. And the importance

00:06:45.405 --> 00:06:51.544
thing is that you cannot
simulate this using quantum

00:06:51.544 --> 00:06:59.719
computer say you have a quantum
byte it is encoded 256 different

00:06:59.719 --> 00:07:07.894
properties so you might be able
to start this on the normal

00:07:07.894 --> 00:07:16.736
computer but now say you have a
quantum motor of two bits. How

00:07:16.736 --> 00:07:24.911
do you start this classically
might be doable but if you have

00:07:24.911 --> 00:07:33.086
64 bits cannot start this on the
classic computer. So can try

00:07:33.086 --> 00:07:39.893
this online there are some
simulators you cannot go too

00:07:39.893 --> 00:07:47.400
far. Multiple vision for all of
this was to simulate quantum

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:54.908
physics and for some reason that
you cannot simulate the quantum

00:07:54.908 --> 00:08:04.451
computer -- so a friend of said
okay to simulate this we need to

00:08:04.451 --> 00:08:11.257
simulate a quantum computer and
to understand how physics or

00:08:11.257 --> 00:08:18.064
nature works by submitting all
the quantum phenomenon. I will

00:08:18.064 --> 00:08:24.204
just go through to common
misunderstanding about this and

00:08:24.204 --> 00:08:31.711
people say quantum computer that
is super faster and way faster

00:08:31.711 --> 00:08:39.219
and solves problems but bad news
doesn't solve all the problems.

00:08:39.219 --> 00:08:48.762
I don't know if it is familiar
to you -- where you list of

00:08:48.762 --> 00:08:56.936
cities and you have to find the
best route. All have problems

00:08:56.936 --> 00:09:03.076
have some structure that makes
them difficult and practically

00:09:03.076 --> 00:09:10.583
impossible to solve on a normal
computer. You will not solve

00:09:10.583 --> 00:09:18.091
these hard problems on the
computer. The good news is you

00:09:18.091 --> 00:09:24.898
do have quantum speed up for
some specifications making the

00:09:24.898 --> 00:09:31.037
impossible possible on the
quantum computer and going from

00:09:31.037 --> 00:09:40.580
N to P times Q is difficult on
the normal computer but easy on

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:48.087
the quantum computer so the
application is -- I will talk

00:09:48.087 --> 00:09:56.262
about this later. So the last
caveat is some people say you

00:09:56.262 --> 00:10:03.069
have the super notion trying
everything the person for free

00:10:03.069 --> 00:10:11.911
-- that is not the idea, the
idea is in some sense several

00:10:11.911 --> 00:10:21.454
values of the same time but you
can only look at one result but

00:10:21.454 --> 00:10:31.664
like all of this is useless and
you cannot say I want to look at

00:10:31.664 --> 00:10:39.172
result that gives this value.
You look at the random results

00:10:39.172 --> 00:10:48.715
so no magic here. So that was it
for the tear. Let's move to

00:10:48.715 --> 00:10:57.557
practical part. Like I said --
we know how to factor 15. Three

00:10:57.557 --> 00:11:06.399
times five. We also know how to
factor 153 and 56,123. But that

00:11:06.399 --> 00:11:14.574
is caveat here for these numbers
they use special -- about in

00:11:14.574 --> 00:11:22.749
some sense they have to know in
advance what was the solution

00:11:22.749 --> 00:11:30.256
before searching for the
solution. I want to say that we

00:11:30.256 --> 00:11:37.063
have very far from the use
application of quantum computer

00:11:37.063 --> 00:11:45.238
and the reason is it is
difficult to build. First of all

00:11:45.238 --> 00:11:55.448
you is have to find a object to
simulate your Q bit so you will

00:11:55.448 --> 00:12:01.588
take some physical particle and
sometimes foreign molecules --

00:12:01.588 --> 00:12:08.394
the main problems they are
facing in quantum computer is

00:12:08.394 --> 00:12:17.236
that what is -- interact with
the rest of the system and this

00:12:17.236 --> 00:12:25.411
will complicate the system --
you can correct all your -- in

00:12:25.411 --> 00:12:32.919
time but in practice much more
difficult. You have to computer

00:12:32.919 --> 00:12:40.426
temperature plus absolute zero.
And we don't know how to scale

00:12:40.426 --> 00:12:49.268
to several hundreds or thousands
of Q bits so we have to result

00:12:49.268 --> 00:12:59.479
four or 5Q bits but if you want
to break all the crypts in the

00:12:59.479 --> 00:13:09.022
world you need a thousand and we
are far from this. 9Q bits this

00:13:09.022 --> 00:13:17.196
year not a actual quantum
computer just a set of 9Q bit

00:13:17.196 --> 00:13:24.704
that's can live together for a
few seconds while correcting --

00:13:24.704 --> 00:13:32.879
in the environment. Lost audio
-- I don't think they do. They

00:13:32.879 --> 00:13:42.422
probably don't but -- so like I
said -- RSA -- explain why RSA

00:13:42.422 --> 00:13:49.228
this is based on factoring
numbers. If you can factor

00:13:49.228 --> 00:13:58.071
numbers then you can break RSA
and then factor numbers so it is

00:13:58.071 --> 00:14:06.913
hard with computer we don't have
a math proof of this but we

00:14:06.913 --> 00:14:13.720
convinced that is our problem.
Factoring is not complete but

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:20.526
easy on the quantum computer.
Doing a quantum for transform

00:14:20.526 --> 00:14:28.701
and gives you the result. And
what is nice within is not

00:14:28.701 --> 00:14:36.209
specific for factoring, it is
for a whole class of problems

00:14:36.209 --> 00:14:43.716
that we call the -- fighting a
subgroup ribosome bigger group

00:14:43.716 --> 00:14:51.224
and turns out that the disc
algorithm is another time of

00:14:51.224 --> 00:14:58.731
this problem. So the problem
behind the -- problem is you

00:14:58.731 --> 00:15:09.642
have number G and you know a G
to power of Y and you don't know

00:15:09.642 --> 00:15:20.553
why so you look for Y. You can
try it. It's not easy if you do

00:15:20.553 --> 00:15:28.728
it only big numbers. And again,
it easy on the quantum computer.

00:15:28.728 --> 00:15:36.235
So what about -- or has
functions. A little bit faster

00:15:36.235 --> 00:15:44.410
than is quantum computer but not
that faster just that is search

00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:53.252
for the key would be much
faster. So you get half of 64

00:15:53.252 --> 00:16:02.795
bits of security. If you do some
advance math if I want 120 bit

00:16:02.795 --> 00:16:13.005
security I need a key off to 56
and we have version of 256 and

00:16:13.005 --> 00:16:23.216
we not have -- of 12 bits and
the reason behind this -- we can

00:16:23.216 --> 00:16:32.758
search in a table of elements in
time square with N instead of M.

00:16:32.758 --> 00:16:43.669
So if you have two to the N --
so there is a field called post

00:16:43.669 --> 00:16:51.177
quantum crypting to fee and goal
is the find alternatives. Lost

00:16:51.177 --> 00:16:57.984
audio -- means equations with
many variables and the variables

00:16:57.984 --> 00:17:06.158
are come fined in such a way
with multiplication and once you

00:17:06.158 --> 00:17:13.666
have that much much harder to
solve. You do multiplication it

00:17:13.666 --> 00:17:22.508
is harder so impossible. But if
you want the use it, most of

00:17:22.508 --> 00:17:31.350
time you need the have a shorter
system. You need to have some

00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:39.525
trace structure and that reason
why some -- working I don't --

00:17:39.525 --> 00:17:44.964
now something important to
understand, someone has quantum

00:17:44.964 --> 00:17:51.771
computer that created it might
break -- you can still

00:17:51.771 --> 00:17:59.278
signatures but issuing knew ones
with a quantum system. But if

00:17:59.278 --> 00:18:06.786
you encrypt something with a
nonquantum safe cipher it is too

00:18:06.786 --> 00:18:15.628
late and going to be encrypted
and no use to encrypt again. So

00:18:15.628 --> 00:18:22.435
the bottom line here is more
important the have quantum

00:18:22.435 --> 00:18:29.241
encryption you can still wait
until the quantum computer is

00:18:29.241 --> 00:18:35.381
created. So two types of
encryption techniques so nothing

00:18:35.381 --> 00:18:44.223
new. Ideas from 70s or 80s. We
have very large keys kilo bytes

00:18:44.223 --> 00:18:53.065
but today we have tera byte but
maybe kilo bytes not big data.

00:18:53.065 --> 00:19:01.240
And the other one is -- very
simple to understand you have

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:09.415
function and you don't know the
function you know what it looks

00:19:09.415 --> 00:19:17.590
like and you want to learn the
function. So you cannot guess

00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:25.097
how it works. So fifth part is
quantum distribution. Here the

00:19:25.097 --> 00:19:33.272
problem is like a quantum --
instead of using -- you use

00:19:33.272 --> 00:19:38.711
physical phenomenon. Not really
quantum computing but using

00:19:38.711 --> 00:19:46.886
quantum mechanics. The argument
is that if you are in the middle

00:19:46.886 --> 00:19:55.728
you can't do the middle because
it will be detected by the law

00:19:55.728 --> 00:20:03.903
of physics. It will be modified
so you will see the modification

00:20:03.903 --> 00:20:12.078
you cannot copy quantum bits.
And are random. So this one is

00:20:12.078 --> 00:20:21.620
the -- BB8 h invited by the guys
in 1984. This is simple. They

00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:31.163
want -- so likes a few bits and
she has to select encoding. Here

00:20:31.163 --> 00:20:39.338
it means just position of the --
you can see just simple

00:20:39.338 --> 00:20:47.513
encoding. So she says blue-green
green and she will send this to

00:20:47.513 --> 00:20:55.688
bob and he doesn't know the
encoding and thing is if you

00:20:55.688 --> 00:21:03.863
have the same encoding you will
observe the right value and if

00:21:03.863 --> 00:21:13.405
you don't have the -- it will be
too late to correct because once

00:21:13.405 --> 00:21:22.248
you observe it, it is not a
quantum bit. So bob he observes

00:21:22.248 --> 00:21:29.755
the bits that he receives and
then he publishing encoding and

00:21:29.755 --> 00:21:39.298
Alice says you have the right or
wrong one and it just pick the

00:21:39.298 --> 00:21:48.140
bits why you have same -- so the
scheme is more complicated but

00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:57.683
that is general idea. But it is
not as secure as it pretends to

00:21:57.683 --> 00:22:06.525
be. The first one is it is
quantum when you use the keys

00:22:06.525 --> 00:22:15.367
when you store it in your system
you use classical -- so the

00:22:15.367 --> 00:22:24.910
people say classical -- yes, but
then what do you do, you have to

00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:32.418
use classical crypt. In practice
you to -- quantum hacking and

00:22:32.418 --> 00:22:40.593
broke some of the first systems.
You can do this over the

00:22:40.593 --> 00:22:47.399
internet and dedicated optical
fiber links so point to point

00:22:47.399 --> 00:22:55.574
and limited in distance less
than a hundred km. You can put

00:22:55.574 --> 00:23:03.749
repeaters or make -- now it is a
bit annoying. So that

00:23:03.749 --> 00:23:11.257
application is quantum computer
if you wonder why I put this

00:23:11.257 --> 00:23:18.764
here. I don't know if you
recognize this guy. Leverage the

00:23:18.764 --> 00:23:26.939
no claim principle. The idea is
simple. The idea is when you

00:23:26.939 --> 00:23:35.114
have quantum bits you can know
like momentum but you know bot

00:23:35.114 --> 00:23:41.921
at the same time. You cannot
know everything about the

00:23:41.921 --> 00:23:49.428
quantum object so if you don't
know everything you cannot copy

00:23:49.428 --> 00:23:57.603
it. You cannot copy what you
don't know. In physics you have

00:23:57.603 --> 00:24:05.110
this -- that cannot clone a
physical object to exact copy.

00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:13.285
So you see the relation with
quantum cash. You will put some

00:24:13.285 --> 00:24:22.828
Q bits on your bank note and so
only the bank can create the

00:24:22.828 --> 00:24:29.635
ones. So that is suggest a
experiment and not practical

00:24:29.635 --> 00:24:39.178
because it is difficult to put Q
bits on the note and to deal

00:24:39.178 --> 00:24:47.353
currency problem. So you will
never see this for real but you

00:24:47.353 --> 00:24:54.860
can imagine. You can imagine
software -- so using this idea

00:24:54.860 --> 00:25:02.368
of quantum non-cloning, so you
have function here in green the

00:25:02.368 --> 00:25:11.210
-- let's say you find you get
the code of function and maybe

00:25:11.210 --> 00:25:18.017
sophisticated but you can
reverse the code. You check the

00:25:18.017 --> 00:25:26.859
hash, if a strong hash you not
find the password easily. And if

00:25:26.859 --> 00:25:35.701
you have binary you can copy the
bytes. So here is idea of

00:25:35.701 --> 00:25:42.508
prediction that you cannot copy
the program. You have the

00:25:42.508 --> 00:25:52.050
problem which is a list of Q
bits and you have no idea about

00:25:52.050 --> 00:26:00.225
what the program is doing. So
like quantum cash it is not

00:26:00.225 --> 00:26:08.400
something that will happen for
real. So my last one is about

00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:17.242
learning. Seems to be hot these
days. I have seen some very good

00:26:17.242 --> 00:26:25.417
talks and not so nice talks. So
one slide difficult to summarize

00:26:25.417 --> 00:26:32.925
but see the science of getting
computer -- it is either

00:26:32.925 --> 00:26:39.064
learning patterns or -- notion
of supervised -- un-supervised

00:26:39.064 --> 00:26:46.572
like discovering patterns and it
is quite a success and feels

00:26:46.572 --> 00:26:52.711
like for detection -- usually
better at finding similarities

00:26:52.711 --> 00:27:00.219
that no monies and intern
detection for example we went to

00:27:00.219 --> 00:27:07.726
find monies for specific notion
of no money. But security --

00:27:07.726 --> 00:27:13.165
lots of false positive the
mission learning. Recommend

00:27:13.165 --> 00:27:22.708
something that you don't want
the see it is not a big deal but

00:27:22.708 --> 00:27:31.550
if you -- system or detects too
much you have a problem. Some

00:27:31.550 --> 00:27:39.725
companies claim the use it but
sometimes just say we will use

00:27:39.725 --> 00:27:46.532
mission learning just to say
they use mission learning. I

00:27:46.532 --> 00:27:55.374
have not seen detail about this
so I don't think it works as

00:27:55.374 --> 00:28:02.180
claim. Some people have been
trying to -- mission learning.

00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:10.355
But a bit boring because not a
brand new algorithm, just take

00:28:10.355 --> 00:28:17.162
the algorithm and run them on
your quantum computer. Things

00:28:17.162 --> 00:28:23.969
like clustering. There are two
advantages and one sometimes you

00:28:23.969 --> 00:28:33.512
have search in the big list of
data, so you can use what was

00:28:33.512 --> 00:28:41.687
seen before to speed up the
search and you have the square

00:28:41.687 --> 00:28:49.194
root improvement. You do get a
exponential speed up which means

00:28:49.194 --> 00:28:57.369
it is something you could not do
on classical computer but you

00:28:57.369 --> 00:29:06.912
need a quantum ram. So the idea
is out there. You give a address

00:29:06.912 --> 00:29:15.087
and get the value add this
address so in quantum memory --

00:29:15.087 --> 00:29:21.226
and you receive the values at
these addresses in

00:29:21.226 --> 00:29:28.033
superposition. I have no idea
how the implement this and

00:29:28.033 --> 00:29:36.208
physicist have no ideas. And the
idea of quantum learning -- so

00:29:36.208 --> 00:29:45.050
if you have a quantitative you
don't have quantum -- so will be

00:29:45.050 --> 00:29:52.557
useless. So time to conclude?
Maybe you were not happy about

00:29:52.557 --> 00:30:00.732
this and you will be leaving the
room. It sucks. Doesn't even

00:30:00.732 --> 00:30:10.275
solve problems. So -- this is an
article but if you are more opt

00:30:10.275 --> 00:30:16.415
mystic person you will see it
differently. Stuff collecting

00:30:16.415 --> 00:30:24.589
all the -- if you are math --
transforming a physical state.

00:30:24.589 --> 00:30:33.432
You can take this microphone a
bunch of atoms you can see the

00:30:33.432 --> 00:30:40.238
wall is big quantum computer
allowing da. What is universe

00:30:40.238 --> 00:30:47.045
computing. So what some
physicist say we don't know if

00:30:47.045 --> 00:30:55.887
it is possible to have a quantum
mechanics but if we have proof

00:30:55.887 --> 00:31:05.430
that is poses then it will tell
us about physics. So even if we

00:31:05.430 --> 00:31:14.272
fail we win something. So I hope
you liked this. If you have

00:31:14.272 --> 00:31:22.447
questions, I will put the slides
at line. I have just been

00:31:22.447 --> 00:31:30.622
interested in this stuff for
years and years. So if you want

00:31:30.622 --> 00:31:39.464
to build a quantum computer
don't talk to me. Yeah. I have a

00:31:39.464 --> 00:31:47.639
few minutes left. When I did
this talk people ask me why

00:31:47.639 --> 00:31:55.814
don't you talk about the company
that is selling a computer. This

00:31:55.814 --> 00:32:02.621
is recorded. So the company
selling the quantum computer, it

00:32:02.621 --> 00:32:10.128
is a different type and it
cannot factor big numbers. So

00:32:10.128 --> 00:32:18.303
that's it. Thank you for you
attention and I am happy the

00:32:18.303 --> 00:00:00.000
take questions.
