00:00:00.334 --> 00:00:05.906
Good afternoon everyone. Welcome
to track 3 this is when the

00:00:05.906 --> 00:00:09.543
secretary of states says please
stop hacking us. And with

00:00:09.543 --> 00:00:15.549
further of due I give you David.
>> Thank you very much. im happy

00:00:19.319 --> 00:00:22.189
to here with you this afternoon,
so im gonna share some insights

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:25.726
from my work over in
government,and youll notice that

00:00:25.726 --> 00:00:29.563
with diplomacy, theres been a
remarkable consistency over a

00:00:29.563 --> 00:00:33.166
hundred of years in diplomatic
relationships, and also, the way

00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:35.168
that we diplomatically negotiate
with one another, and the way

00:00:35.168 --> 00:00:38.005
that diplomats maybe use the
threat of military force to back

00:00:38.005 --> 00:00:43.744
up that talk, but what is new,
is that cyber security is a new

00:00:43.744 --> 00:00:48.048
topic in diplomacy, You don't
really hear much about the

00:00:48.048 --> 00:00:52.019
government aspect which is why
I'm happy to be here today, to

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:58.558
share my insights with you, so
for 5 1/2 years i was a

00:00:58.558 --> 00:01:01.762
political military officer of
where the state department. In

00:01:01.762 --> 00:01:06.199
my role I help a lot of security
dialogues, bilateral and multi

00:01:06.199 --> 00:01:09.670
lateral dialogues. and i also
worked really closely with the

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.172
cyber offices all through out
the state department, And in

00:01:12.172 --> 00:01:15.542
other U.S. government offices.
State department we work closely

00:01:15.542 --> 00:01:19.413
with the policy shop. F-cyber,
its a cyber policy office

00:01:19.413 --> 00:01:22.449
directly under the secretary of
state, theres also another

00:01:22.449 --> 00:01:26.853
office, INR cyber which is an
intelligent site and there lead

00:01:26.853 --> 00:01:30.924
officer for cyber security that
represents their bureau and of

00:01:30.924 --> 00:01:33.660
course working closely with our
colleagues in the NSA state as

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:39.132
well. So I'm going to take the
experience of government and

00:01:39.132 --> 00:01:42.736
pair it with cyber threat. that
we see going on in the world,

00:01:42.736 --> 00:01:48.175
and then show how govt. approach
other govt. and talk and try to

00:01:48.175 --> 00:01:53.080
solve some problems from state
hackers and nonstate hackers so

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.349
to lay some ground rights, this
should be familiar to most of

00:01:55.349 --> 00:01:58.919
you, this is north corporation
cyber threat attack site map.

00:01:58.919 --> 00:02:02.589
its the 2014 model but if you
pull up your cellphones or

00:02:02.589 --> 00:02:08.028
computers you could basically
see it real time right now, what

00:02:08.028 --> 00:02:11.164
country is hacking what country,
its a representation of whats

00:02:11.164 --> 00:02:14.935
happening in reality, because it
sets up these honeypots and it

00:02:14.935 --> 00:02:19.406
attracts what country is hacking
what country, so its really what

00:02:19.406 --> 00:02:22.843
they say as tip of the iceberg,
but that not what actually is

00:02:22.843 --> 00:02:27.848
happening,but rather a
representation, so in addition

00:02:27.848 --> 00:02:30.684
to that invisible threat that we
saw, you know the cyber

00:02:30.684 --> 00:02:34.888
activity, that you know you cant
actually see with your eyes but

00:02:34.888 --> 00:02:38.158
the map makes it visible, and
the first time i saw that map it

00:02:38.158 --> 00:02:41.928
looked like WW3 to me, it looked
like those are missiles and

00:02:41.928 --> 00:02:46.633
bombs, it looked very serious
across continents across

00:02:46.633 --> 00:02:50.303
regions, it just looked very
serious, I want to specifically

00:02:50.303 --> 00:02:55.442
go to one incident of 2014, the
Ddos hack that shut down

00:02:55.442 --> 00:03:00.380
facebook, Again I'm laying some
background information for you.

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.683
With the DdoS attack
(distributed denial of service)

00:03:03.683 --> 00:03:08.121
thousands over computers were
part of coordinated attack. that

00:03:08.121 --> 00:03:12.459
then theyd be a part of a botnet
Which then stream from East Asia

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:15.395
over to United States and many
of these users and owners did

00:03:15.395 --> 00:03:18.398
not know they were part of
attack because they might have

00:03:18.398 --> 00:03:21.868
clicked on malware clicked on a
banner and installed malware,

00:03:21.868 --> 00:03:25.439
and basically installed a
stealthy program that lets other

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:29.042
people control their computer,
so youl see the sequence

00:03:29.042 --> 00:03:34.114
here that the first slide looks
alot like the previous, cyber

00:03:34.114 --> 00:03:37.017
incidences, only the previous
one were single attack going to

00:03:37.017 --> 00:03:41.855
country to country. This one is
the second frame shows thousands

00:03:41.855 --> 00:03:46.126
of computers being coordinated
like your in a Ddos,and this

00:03:46.126 --> 00:03:49.229
looks like street fighter 2
ryus hadukken going across

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:54.434
from East Asia to the United
States. And this is a massive.

00:03:54.434 --> 00:03:58.872
Many companies will shut down
their companies completely,

00:03:58.872 --> 00:04:03.510
might take em days to get back
online. it shut down facebook

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.279
completely for 30 mins For every
second their shut down they're

00:04:06.279 --> 00:04:13.820
losing money. Right. So given
that there is these attacks that

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:19.059
cost government a lot of cost
company a lot of money that hack

00:04:19.059 --> 00:04:21.862
government military secrets.
There is a lot of reasons why

00:04:21.862 --> 00:04:24.698
countries talk about cyber
securities when they have these

00:04:24.698 --> 00:04:28.235
bilateral dialogs. and every
year they have multilateral and

00:04:28.235 --> 00:04:32.305
bilateral dialogs that that
actions forward the event So you

00:04:32.305 --> 00:04:34.708
expect there is going to be
ministerial meeting, or youre

00:04:34.708 --> 00:04:36.710
gonna see a foreign minister
going to meet the other foreign

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.712
minister, what are we goin to
talk about? Cyber has become a

00:04:38.712 --> 00:04:43.650
topic in the recent years. In
the united nations its a

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:47.487
multilateral setting, and soon
im gonna talk about bilatelal

00:04:47.487 --> 00:04:49.890
setting, but in this
multilateral setting, the

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:54.394
plenary is not exactly a place
where cyber security will be a

00:04:54.394 --> 00:04:57.731
topic because that's where a
president of a country or

00:04:57.731 --> 00:05:02.702
foreign minister has 15 minutes
to talk about whatever they say

00:05:02.702 --> 00:05:05.906
to all the represent at actives
in the world. so rather than

00:05:05.906 --> 00:05:08.875
cyber would be a topic in the
side meetings, Throughout that

00:05:08.875 --> 00:05:13.680
week the head of state will
bring their entire delegation up

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.216
and down the ladder of
seniorities from the deputy

00:05:16.216 --> 00:05:18.819
secretary to under secretary,
and then they'll meet with their

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:20.921
counter parts from various
problem a range of issues

00:05:20.921 --> 00:05:27.494
including cyber security. now
instead of a multilateral

00:05:27.494 --> 00:05:32.499
setting, this is an example of
bilateral setting, The U.S.

00:05:32.499 --> 00:05:36.570
china SED, with plenary session
with secretary of state and

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:41.074
secretary of defense, this one
is huge its all the cabinet

00:05:41.074 --> 00:05:44.945
level of secretaries of the us
government, US ambassador to the

00:05:44.945 --> 00:05:48.915
UN, U.S. secretary of energy
meeting with their counterpart

00:05:48.915 --> 00:05:53.353
from china, this plenary session
will be more scripted, so thats

00:05:53.353 --> 00:05:56.289
not really the appropriate place
to bring up cyber details

00:05:56.289 --> 00:06:00.160
however there are breakout
sessions that happen a long side

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.162
of plenary sessions where they
will work with each other and

00:06:02.162 --> 00:06:07.734
that's a venue where cyber
security or cyber diplomacy will

00:06:07.734 --> 00:06:12.739
come up. and when the US talks
to china, its really trying to

00:06:12.739 --> 00:06:16.743
identify What are the state
actors and what the activity

00:06:16.743 --> 00:06:21.047
that is going on in china thats
impacting U.S... What are the

00:06:21.047 --> 00:06:24.951
nonstate actors? What are the
groups and how can the U.S.

00:06:24.951 --> 00:06:28.555
convince china to make some
changes or crack down on

00:06:28.555 --> 00:06:31.992
domestic group. So the Australia
ministerial is a bilateral

00:06:31.992 --> 00:06:35.395
ministry much like the one in
china, but the relationship is

00:06:35.395 --> 00:06:38.064
very much different, because
australias relationship with

00:06:38.064 --> 00:06:43.270
the US is different because both
are mutual defense treaty

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:47.707
allies, Australia is
considerered NATO +5 so European

00:06:47.707 --> 00:06:51.978
countries plus australia, new
zealand, Japan, Korea and

00:06:51.978 --> 00:06:55.482
israel, so theres a very close
relation and informations and

00:06:55.482 --> 00:06:59.619
intelligence sharing,so when the
U.S. sits down with the

00:06:59.619 --> 00:07:02.789
ministers former secretary
Hillary Clinton. and former

00:07:02.789 --> 00:07:06.459
secretary of defense panetta in
this picture, theyre gonna have

00:07:06.459 --> 00:07:09.362
a plenary and theyre gonna have
a break out meeting on the side

00:07:09.362 --> 00:07:13.566
but the tone is gonna be
different, You don't expect a

00:07:13.566 --> 00:07:18.071
state actor to be hacking the
U.S. from such a close ally. You

00:07:18.071 --> 00:07:21.941
will be expecting if there is
some action from the substate

00:07:21.941 --> 00:07:24.811
level. From certain hacker
groups but is going to be much

00:07:24.811 --> 00:07:28.615
more cooperative. these allies
will say tell me who it is we'll

00:07:28.615 --> 00:07:32.652
get the police.or well help try
to crack down on this so its

00:07:32.652 --> 00:07:37.023
gonna be a different kind of
conversation, So over the next

00:07:37.023 --> 00:07:41.261
few minutes I'm happy to share
my insights on these bilateral

00:07:41.261 --> 00:07:45.332
dialogues but to go more deeply
and to create a framework for

00:07:45.332 --> 00:07:49.402
cyber diplomacy Including the
roadblocks that we face over

00:07:49.402 --> 00:07:53.206
cyber diplomacy, problems with
finding attribution,and also

00:07:53.206 --> 00:07:58.311
disclosinginformation on how to
have evidence for attribution

00:07:58.311 --> 00:08:01.147
the disclosing dillema, ill talk
about this in few slides, and

00:08:01.147 --> 00:08:08.588
also some recomendations, so
back to the basics. What hackers

00:08:08.588 --> 00:08:12.859
want is fame. Hacktivist wants
to hack for the lows for the

00:08:12.859 --> 00:08:17.530
kicks. They might be going after
your credit card so they can buy

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:20.734
thing. One company might be
trying to get intellectual

00:08:20.734 --> 00:08:23.970
property from a competitor
company, in another country that

00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:28.274
they could have a competitive
edge or for the military most of

00:08:28.274 --> 00:08:32.712
them are state sponsored most
them are trying to get military

00:08:32.712 --> 00:08:37.283
technical drawings of the latest
aircraft, or attack helicopters,

00:08:37.283 --> 00:08:41.121
or military strategic planning.
like the pentagon plans or their

00:08:41.121 --> 00:08:47.660
conplans, operations plans When
this occurs these are really

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:51.364
good reasons to sit down with
partner countries.what are the

00:08:51.364 --> 00:08:54.801
most cooperative allies or less
cooperative partners, and to

00:08:54.801 --> 00:08:59.072
raise this into diplomatic
dialogs, so the dialogs would be

00:08:59.072 --> 00:09:01.174
like the one i mentioned
earlier, the Australia

00:09:01.174 --> 00:09:05.445
ministerial, U.S. china FED they
could also be with more of a

00:09:05.445 --> 00:09:09.115
working level. The U.S. military
has service to service talk like

00:09:09.115 --> 00:09:14.320
army to army and for the closer
U.S. allies the closer partners

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:18.124
will be these hybrid talks will
where say the diplomats will

00:09:18.124 --> 00:09:22.429
talk for over an hour and spend
the first 10 mins for the

00:09:22.429 --> 00:09:26.966
intelligence briefing wether
from the CIA, DIA or NSA to lay

00:09:26.966 --> 00:09:30.336
out the threat or the problem,
the for the rest of the hour or

00:09:30.336 --> 00:09:33.973
50 mins wil be the policymaker
and then sitting down with their

00:09:33.973 --> 00:09:36.843
counter parts of different
countries. We see a common

00:09:36.843 --> 00:09:39.979
picture how are we going to work
together to solve that problem.

00:09:44.217 --> 00:09:48.254
Cyber becomes a topic in
diplomacy when is in the news

00:09:48.254 --> 00:09:51.925
paper and you cannot ignore it
so you just wanna talk about it

00:09:51.925 --> 00:09:56.596
with your partners, It might not
be in newspaper but it might be

00:09:56.596 --> 00:09:59.899
in intelligent sources. So
government officials and sources

00:09:59.899 --> 00:10:03.036
might have access to this
information. and see some

00:10:03.036 --> 00:10:09.943
concerns, There some offices
that will take a lead on

00:10:09.943 --> 00:10:12.946
bilateral dialogue.and then
theyre the one that coordinate

00:10:12.946 --> 00:10:15.815
everything And make changes as
they're setting the agenda. Or

00:10:15.815 --> 00:10:23.323
an office might not the lead.
they might be a part of an inter

00:10:23.323 --> 00:10:27.193
agency clearance process but
They have they share an equity,

00:10:27.193 --> 00:10:31.097
they work on the similar issues
the cyber security, so the lead

00:10:31.097 --> 00:10:34.100
office will talk about the
talking points and agenda for

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:38.137
the entire meeting, and the
clear it with the 10 or 20 other

00:10:38.137 --> 00:10:42.942
offices and at the pentagon,
white house,NSA and when they

00:10:42.942 --> 00:10:47.747
make the edits they can go head
and put new topics and new ideas

00:10:47.747 --> 00:10:51.918
there because they're involved
in the process. and also the

00:10:51.918 --> 00:10:55.421
foreign minister could also just
put it in or nobody wants it in

00:10:55.421 --> 00:10:58.424
but it was there last years and
a year before So is a president

00:10:58.424 --> 00:11:04.430
that's going to be in this year
as well. So when U.S. diplomats

00:11:11.905 --> 00:11:17.310
and senior officials sit down
with other countries the

00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:22.615
attribution problem can be a
roadblock. so when the US sits

00:11:22.615 --> 00:11:26.352
with other countries, theyll
say the attribution problem is

00:11:26.352 --> 00:11:30.590
the back it up so the
attribution problem, just a

00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:35.228
refresher, is where the attack
could be coming from country A,

00:11:35.228 --> 00:11:38.164
yet its only a proxy from
country A its actually coming

00:11:38.164 --> 00:11:42.702
from country B, through country
A to hack you Or are maybe

00:11:42.702 --> 00:11:46.773
several proxies, country F going
through E,D,C all the way to

00:11:46.773 --> 00:11:50.510
attack you, so among private
company and among individuals

00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:54.814
the attribution problem can be
very difficult to solve but the

00:11:54.814 --> 00:11:58.952
US govt. has been trying to
solve the attribution problems

00:11:58.952 --> 00:12:02.121
and its a sensitive topic. so i
cant really get into it myself,

00:12:02.121 --> 00:12:05.391
So I'm going to scythe Shane
Harrissons new book hes a

00:12:05.391 --> 00:12:07.927
journalist and did a lot of
research about NSA and about

00:12:07.927 --> 00:12:10.763
cyber security, and he talked
about attribution problems, and

00:12:10.763 --> 00:12:14.233
according to research, Around
page 20 because i looked it up

00:12:14.233 --> 00:12:18.237
recently he wrote that basically
the NSA had spent a lot of money

00:12:18.237 --> 00:12:21.374
buying computer software from
companies in western Virginia

00:12:21.374 --> 00:12:24.944
and NY and developing their own
software in-house and spend

00:12:24.944 --> 00:12:32.151
years figuring out a way to
affectively solve the

00:12:32.151 --> 00:12:35.822
attribution problem so according
to his research, this former

00:12:35.822 --> 00:12:38.024
journalist, through his
interviews with senior

00:12:38.024 --> 00:12:41.394
officials, say that is the U.S.
government is very advance on

00:12:41.394 --> 00:12:47.033
this. and the attribution is the
very key aspect of diplomacy and

00:12:47.033 --> 00:12:49.168
all the things that you see in
newspapers because if you can't

00:12:49.168 --> 00:12:52.639
be sure if the attack is coming
from a specific country,then

00:12:52.639 --> 00:12:54.874
theres nothing to talk about,
you cannot sit down with a

00:12:54.874 --> 00:12:57.510
country and say, you're doing
this, even if you do not have

00:12:57.510 --> 00:13:01.981
attribution right. Say you do
have it right. and say you have

00:13:01.981 --> 00:13:05.585
high level confidence based on
certain method, Then you will

00:13:05.585 --> 00:13:08.821
still approach the disclosure
dilemma and thats where when

00:13:08.821 --> 00:13:11.791
youre sitting down with a
foreign country, and youre

00:13:11.791 --> 00:13:14.961
saying, youre hacking us,and
they say no were not, and you

00:13:14.961 --> 00:13:18.498
say we have evidence, and they
say prove it. and then you say

00:13:18.498 --> 00:13:23.102
no we cannot because if we prove
it to you, if we show it to you

00:13:23.102 --> 00:13:26.506
how we know were it was you,
then youre seeing our sources

00:13:26.506 --> 00:13:31.277
who is our informant in your
country. Is it a U.S. embassy

00:13:31.277 --> 00:13:33.379
officer telling us? then
whatre you gonna do with

00:13:33.379 --> 00:13:36.416
that? right? or youre finding
out more about the message, so

00:13:36.416 --> 00:13:41.754
next time you could go around
and change your tactics so we

00:13:41.754 --> 00:13:43.756
cant discover you next time,so
the disclosure dilemma

00:13:43.756 --> 00:13:47.326
especially if you know another
country exactly how you know the

00:13:47.326 --> 00:13:49.595
solution for attribution it
could make them a stronger

00:13:49.595 --> 00:13:55.601
adversary, so among companies, i
often hear officers and

00:13:58.771 --> 00:14:03.142
private companies, lament that
in Cyber security the only

00:14:03.142 --> 00:14:08.314
weapon is a shield and I feel
like companies are trying to how

00:14:08.314 --> 00:14:12.285
are we being hack how can be
guard against that. How with can

00:14:12.285 --> 00:14:17.457
we block specific IP so that
doesnt happen, but government is

00:14:17.457 --> 00:14:21.694
really interested in who, what,
when, where, why? and thats

00:14:21.694 --> 00:14:25.298
really important for bilateral
dialogs because it paints the

00:14:25.298 --> 00:14:30.937
global context of hacking, So
this is an area where social

00:14:30.937 --> 00:14:35.641
science can cooperate with
computer science can so you have

00:14:35.641 --> 00:14:39.445
the technical skills plus the
language, to send people into

00:14:39.445 --> 00:14:42.281
chatrooms and to talk to certain
people to certain countries

00:14:42.281 --> 00:14:44.751
without sounding if you put
it through Google translate

00:14:44.751 --> 00:14:47.320
you'll sound like a
kindergartner or finding out the

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:51.958
legal situation there, what kind
of laws can you use if the rules

00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:55.495
of law is strong, whats the
relationship between the govt.

00:14:55.495 --> 00:14:59.365
and the people or the govt
itself internally, is the govt

00:14:59.365 --> 00:15:01.868
fragmented? are you getting
hacked by the other side of the

00:15:01.868 --> 00:15:04.737
govt but the other side doesnt
know whats happening? when you

00:15:04.737 --> 00:15:07.974
talk to them you can really
affect. So private company I

00:15:07.974 --> 00:15:10.476
think the bare minimum is very
important to stop hacking and

00:15:10.476 --> 00:15:12.578
stop the bleeding. or their
monolithic that they really know

00:15:12.578 --> 00:15:15.281
whats going on, that when you
talk to them its going to affect

00:15:15.281 --> 00:15:17.583
change, sop private companies i
think the bare minimum is very

00:15:17.583 --> 00:15:19.886
important to prevent hacking to
stop the bleeding and to protect

00:15:19.886 --> 00:15:23.322
the network I think as you move
up mad load heiarchy of needs

00:15:23.322 --> 00:15:29.695
is important then.
After you take care of

00:15:29.695 --> 00:15:32.765
protection to start asking those
questionings. and i see some

00:15:32.765 --> 00:15:36.669
savvy private companies ask
those questions is because their

00:15:36.669 --> 00:15:41.174
senior officers are former US
military, or intelligence or the

00:15:41.174 --> 00:15:45.344
NSA. os if they find out that
the answer to the question is

00:15:45.344 --> 00:15:47.814
not that satisfying they wan t
to know to who, what, when,

00:15:47.814 --> 00:15:54.153
where why, So what types of
cyber tacks are more likely to

00:15:54.153 --> 00:15:58.124
come to come up in different
dialogs compared to others, so

00:15:58.124 --> 00:16:02.028
the kind cyber-attack that is
more likely to come up in

00:16:02.028 --> 00:16:06.599
dialogue are the state to state
hacks. when, assuming that you

00:16:06.599 --> 00:16:09.502
can solve the attribution
problems by some method by thru

00:16:09.502 --> 00:16:14.540
the NSA if a foreign govt is
hacking the US govt. so thats

00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:18.911
definitely gonna come up so the
US govt. thinks that perhaps if

00:16:18.911 --> 00:16:23.416
we convince them to someways to
prevent this from happening,

00:16:23.416 --> 00:16:26.819
moving down on the left, when a
nonstate actor when a hacking

00:16:26.819 --> 00:16:29.689
group hack it is U.S. government
yes the U.S. government wants to

00:16:29.689 --> 00:16:32.792
bring up in dialogue. because it
hopes that the govt is gonna be

00:16:32.792 --> 00:16:37.363
able to crack down on that group
domestically, But when there is

00:16:37.363 --> 00:16:41.334
an on the right side when is a
state government hacking a

00:16:41.334 --> 00:16:44.370
nonstate actor like a company or
something is not necessary going

00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:47.540
to come up in dialogue because
companies most likely don't want

00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:50.610
to share that information so the
govt might not even know that

00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:55.882
theyre being hacked, or is so
limited there a few examples of

00:16:55.882 --> 00:16:59.452
that. also in the bottom right
quadrant, for people to people

00:16:59.452 --> 00:17:02.588
hacking or company to company,
That's just so abundant there's

00:17:02.588 --> 00:17:05.992
thousands of these hacks every
day and people trying to hack

00:17:05.992 --> 00:17:09.028
your credit card number. or
sending you emails telling you

00:17:09.028 --> 00:17:11.831
that you won $10 --> 000 --> 000 So how
do you address this in a

00:17:11.831 --> 00:17:17.703
diplomatic dialogue? so getting
back to the classic scenario

00:17:17.703 --> 00:17:20.273
when the senior officials sit
down, its gonna look different,

00:17:20.273 --> 00:17:26.712
if the country is a US ally
versus a less cooperative

00:17:26.712 --> 00:17:30.917
country,of a US ally of for a
cooperative country, its gonna

00:17:30.917 --> 00:17:35.621
be. like australia it gonna be,
you know were pretty sure its

00:17:35.621 --> 00:17:40.159
not state sponsored, let us know
what you have because if its

00:17:40.159 --> 00:17:42.762
coming from within the country,
were gonna use the law

00:17:42.762 --> 00:17:46.299
enforcement to solve it, if its
a mutual threat or a share of

00:17:46.299 --> 00:17:48.868
information, and if its an
attack that was supposed to be

00:17:48.868 --> 00:17:52.939
susceptible from another country
then lets find out how we can be

00:17:52.939 --> 00:17:57.977
more safe together, but if its
coming from a country that is

00:17:57.977 --> 00:18:01.314
less cooperative, then theyre
gonna stonewall with the

00:18:01.314 --> 00:18:03.316
attribution problem, and
youre gonna face the

00:18:03.316 --> 00:18:06.118
disclosure dilemma, so thats
theyre gonna say, you cant

00:18:06.118 --> 00:18:09.588
prove it, its probably a proxy
server coming thru our country,

00:18:09.588 --> 00:18:13.225
it cold be another country,
theyre gonna ay we too are

00:18:13.225 --> 00:18:16.796
the victims of hacking, some are
victims just like you, so this

00:18:16.796 --> 00:18:19.332
all just stone walling, so they
dont have to do anything to

00:18:19.332 --> 00:18:23.302
try to help solve the problem,
in diplomatic dialogs, youll

00:18:23.302 --> 00:18:26.572
notice that some countries are
more cooperative than others,

00:18:26.572 --> 00:18:30.509
surprisingly vietnam is very
helpful and cooperative in cyber

00:18:30.509 --> 00:18:33.045
diplomacy,if they find out
theres an issue then the govt.

00:18:33.045 --> 00:18:36.015
is very cooperative in that
sense. youll find that in

00:18:36.015 --> 00:18:38.050
eastern Europe youll find
that there are countries that

00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:41.387
less or selectively cooperative
when its in their interest of

00:18:41.387 --> 00:18:46.993
course, and then theres the
variation in eastern Europe and

00:18:46.993 --> 00:18:50.463
Russia, that mostly these hacks
will target financial

00:18:50.463 --> 00:18:54.133
institutions, while southeast
Asia , in Vietnam theyll be

00:18:54.133 --> 00:18:58.504
targeting Ecommerce, while
northeast asia will be

00:18:58.504 --> 00:19:04.510
target9ing intellectual
property,sharing information so

00:19:08.314 --> 00:19:15.955
that other countries --
companies can learn from their

00:19:15.955 --> 00:19:19.592
experience and prevent future
hacks is to solve the government

00:19:19.592 --> 00:19:26.132
level recognize that this is a
growing field. If a country

00:19:26.132 --> 00:19:32.905
sayings, don't do this and this
is not right and does it. The

00:19:32.905 --> 00:19:40.413
country loses the right of other
countries. So consider going

00:19:40.413 --> 00:19:46.419
beyond the region. U.S. market
to a more international and

00:19:50.222 --> 00:19:52.858
global market. So that together
we can, work together to prevent

00:19:52.858 --> 00:19:54.860
cyber attacks. I'm happy to
share my twitter information and

00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:56.862
Im also working on a book on
Cyber Diplomacy. Im comparing

00:19:56.862 --> 00:20:04.637
agents and publishers, if you
have any advice Id be happy

00:20:04.637 --> 00:20:10.643
to hear. Thank you very much for
everyone here. And also thank

00:20:20.519 --> 00:20:23.756
you very much to Dell Secure
Works at VeriSign, for all

00:20:23.756 --> 00:20:25.958
Ive learned from their
subject matter experts and their

00:20:25.958 --> 00:20:30.930
analysts. And thank you very
much for coming today. [
