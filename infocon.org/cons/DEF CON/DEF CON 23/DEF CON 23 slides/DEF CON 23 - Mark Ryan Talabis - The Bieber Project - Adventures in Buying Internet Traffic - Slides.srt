00:00:00.267 --> 00:00:05.906
 >> so hello everyone, my name
is Ryan Calabis and my

00:00:05.906 --> 00:00:11.512
presentation in titled the
bieber project,so this is a 101

00:00:11.512 --> 00:00:16.717
on digital advertising, AD
technology and AD project, so I

00:00:16.717 --> 00:00:23.957
work for -- we are web cap
option company we work for

00:00:23.957 --> 00:00:29.596
digital advertising I did work
on executer analytics this will

00:00:29.596 --> 00:00:34.501
fold together after I go through
this. In any case let's talk

00:00:34.501 --> 00:00:38.972
about or main topics we'll talk
about bus and currency of

00:00:38.972 --> 00:00:43.410
digital advertising why am I
even talking about this why is

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.313
this even relevant. Then we are
going to go through the

00:00:46.313 --> 00:00:48.882
[indiscernible] system I can't
go through that many systems --

00:00:48.882 --> 00:00:54.888
how to start off with foundation
and stuff this is -- then after

00:01:08.235 --> 00:01:10.804
that we'll go through --
different types of fraud such as

00:01:10.804 --> 00:01:14.007
like publish, malicious
objectionable content non human

00:01:14.007 --> 00:01:17.177
traffic and my pet project the
BE -- BIEBER project. Why are we

00:01:17.177 --> 00:01:21.648
even talk and about this.
Basically we are talking about

00:01:21.648 --> 00:01:24.818
this because digital advertising
is big money so the total

00:01:24.818 --> 00:01:30.824
digital add spend is estimated
about 60 bill dollars 2015.

00:01:35.996 --> 00:01:41.535
Estimated also that five years
from now digital -- would be one

00:01:41.535 --> 00:01:48.241
hundred million dollars. It is a
big pie and a lot of different

00:01:48.241 --> 00:01:53.113
people with like a -- would like
a big chunk of the buy that's

00:01:53.113 --> 00:01:57.250
why this is very very important
topic right now like in add

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.153
particular and even enforced
security. So, let's talk about

00:02:00.153 --> 00:02:02.289
the currency of digital
advertising. So digital

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:05.225
advertising has several met
tricks but one of them most

00:02:05.225 --> 00:02:07.961
important and primary is lt
gnomist delivered or served

00:02:07.961 --> 00:02:13.967
impression that's views so but
primary problem here is not all

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.041
on line address or actually --
are actually seen, probably

00:02:21.041 --> 00:02:25.579
under stand like advertisers are
not interested they are not

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:29.116
interested in paying for address
that are never seen obviously,

00:02:29.116 --> 00:02:33.553
right. So, here's the thing.
Let's go through like the

00:02:33.553 --> 00:02:39.259
different METRICSS. When you
start using an add there's an

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:45.565
add on the left-hand side, you
see the ad. And that's the

00:02:45.565 --> 00:02:50.237
subtle impression. Next, you
have the CLICKS which is the

00:02:50.237 --> 00:02:53.507
other one then you have
conversion conversion could be a

00:02:53.507 --> 00:02:57.611
purchase assign up form and
stuff like that but what we are

00:02:57.611 --> 00:03:01.281
going to really talk about and
focus in this talk is really a

00:03:01.281 --> 00:03:05.252
view bell impressions that is
primary METRIC that we are

00:03:05.252 --> 00:03:09.489
talking about. Primary METRIC if
-- whole train would be

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:11.491
fraudulent that is basically the
currency of digital advertising.

00:03:11.491 --> 00:03:13.493
What I'm going to go through
next is like the ECO system. So.

00:03:13.493 --> 00:03:15.495
When I first, when I first moved
to digital advertising I came

00:03:15.495 --> 00:03:17.497
from security. When I first came
like to digital advertising

00:03:17.497 --> 00:03:19.499
someone she had me this. This is
the [indiscernible] of digital

00:03:19.499 --> 00:03:22.035
advertising when I saw that oh
man I don't know what to do with

00:03:22.035 --> 00:03:24.037
this. So it's very complicated
and well, we won't go through

00:03:24.037 --> 00:03:26.039
this today. So, what we are
going to go through is like a

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:28.041
disstilled version so I actually
made this but I even disstilled

00:03:28.041 --> 00:03:30.043
it more. We are going to talk
about the main entities in digit

00:03:30.043 --> 00:03:32.045
fat advertising which is
advertise sir, demand sight

00:03:32.045 --> 00:03:34.047
platform, the [indiscernible]
the supplier sight platform and

00:03:34.047 --> 00:03:36.049
publisher. So this is my real
101-1101 version first to think

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:38.051
about two end of the spectrum
two ends of the spectrum is the

00:03:38.051 --> 00:03:43.290
advertise sir the ones who sell
the product and publish sha who

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.793
is selling the ad sideways the
media space its your block like

00:03:46.793 --> 00:03:50.864
CNN, CS -- main -- like Nike
forward an all of those kind of

00:03:50.864 --> 00:03:53.467
guys. The address would have
like advertising agencies like

00:03:53.467 --> 00:03:56.970
mad men stuff so like here we
have an advertising agency one

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:00.073
the bigger ones curative P and
then what happens here they

00:04:00.073 --> 00:04:03.577
produce ACON at that time but in
terms of digital advertising the

00:04:03.577 --> 00:04:06.980
real important one is demand
sight platform VSP so this is

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:13.019
where really the magic paps this
is where the campaigns are made,

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:19.159
it's very important because this
is where you actually enter like

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:25.832
targeting information likes who
do I want this add to be served

00:04:25.832 --> 00:04:31.404
like what demographic, what
location and all of that stuff.

00:04:31.404 --> 00:04:38.078
So, in the other end you have
SSP the supplier platform. It

00:04:38.078 --> 00:04:43.116
manager's impressions that come
from different publisher and it

00:04:43.116 --> 00:04:48.688
all intersect in this add
exchange think of the add

00:04:48.688 --> 00:04:54.261
exchange as a marketplace an
auction place of these different

00:04:54.261 --> 00:04:58.431
impressions and what happens is
the DSP matches its criteria to

00:04:58.431 --> 00:05:00.667
all the impressions that are
being sold. Let me give you

00:05:00.667 --> 00:05:02.903
example. Like forward forward
wants to do like an -- FORD

00:05:02.903 --> 00:05:05.438
wants to do an add campaign for
F150, they want to do end year

00:05:05.438 --> 00:05:07.440
campaign advertising agency
conceptual lies it so what

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.442
happens there like well what we
want, we want these address to

00:05:09.442 --> 00:05:11.444
be shown at these particular
times at well all devices then

00:05:11.444 --> 00:05:13.446
-- only the United States, let's
say that's their criteria that's

00:05:13.446 --> 00:05:16.283
their targeting criteria. Like
for example my blog received

00:05:16.283 --> 00:05:18.585
impression or a view from let's
say the MANILA it goes there

00:05:18.585 --> 00:05:20.687
goes to the auction house this
impression is coming from MANILA

00:05:20.687 --> 00:05:23.156
doesn't fit criteria, no. Like,
there's no F one -- no F16789 --

00:05:23.156 --> 00:05:25.158
for example something comes in
hey this impression comes from

00:05:25.158 --> 00:05:27.360
Florida from a mobile sight it
-- from sprung that's when the

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.197
DSP starts the bid and if it
wins the bid the ad is served so

00:05:30.197 --> 00:05:32.632
that is really like general gist
of what's happening in an add

00:05:32.632 --> 00:05:35.068
exchange so I know this is
pretty high level and we can go

00:05:35.068 --> 00:05:37.103
there like we can go like into
more detail like after this.

00:05:37.103 --> 00:05:39.539
I'll just be walking around here
if you want to talk to me about

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:43.009
the system but this is enough to
start talking about ADD fraud.

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:46.813
And all that kind of stuff. So,
one thing you might want to go

00:05:46.813 --> 00:05:50.350
deeper is like how do you
actually like serve an ADD so so

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:53.353
here is a process of serving an
add there's actually three

00:05:53.353 --> 00:05:55.789
things, first, make the
campaign. So, that's where the

00:05:55.789 --> 00:05:58.525
DSP part happens, right. DSP
would usually have like a

00:05:58.525 --> 00:06:00.627
campaign management system and
this campaign management system

00:06:00.627 --> 00:06:03.496
will have like the ability to
like add -- ADD targeting

00:06:03.496 --> 00:06:07.200
information which I will show I
was little bit like some screen

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:10.470
shots like bigger screen shots
so I think it's hard to see

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:13.473
there so with the bid admitting
process, the BIDDING project the

00:06:13.473 --> 00:06:19.679
ADD exchange where the DSP and
SSP link together then if the BI

00:06:19.679 --> 00:06:24.818
-- bid wins then the ad is
served. Let me give you quick

00:06:24.818 --> 00:06:26.820
screen shots of what campaign
management system looks like. So

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:28.822
you see here you can actually
define what your budget is. Then

00:06:28.822 --> 00:06:30.824
you can like set like different
demographics like what location

00:06:30.824 --> 00:06:32.826
you want this particular ADD to
show up. You can also do a lot

00:06:32.826 --> 00:06:34.828
of things you can actually pick
what particular operating

00:06:34.828 --> 00:06:36.830
systems it should show up in
like what particular devices it

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:38.832
show up in like all different
platforms you can actually fix.

00:06:38.832 --> 00:06:40.834
It's very good at this targeting
thrust -- just think about that.

00:06:40.834 --> 00:06:42.836
Then you can do all sorts of
stuff contextual stuff. Key

00:06:42.836 --> 00:06:44.838
words, topics, so it's very very
like, very smart. Very smart in

00:06:44.838 --> 00:06:46.840
terms of targeting. So next you
can actually pick also what in

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:48.842
-- like what publishers to
publish on. So, it's very very

00:06:48.842 --> 00:06:50.844
good at that. You can actually
like you can start up loading

00:06:50.844 --> 00:06:52.846
creative here you can actually
like up load your

00:06:52.846 --> 00:06:54.848
[indiscernible] juror JPEGS and
flash files you are probably

00:06:54.848 --> 00:06:56.850
thinking advertising, redirects,
targeting, to she's, you can do,

00:06:56.850 --> 00:06:58.852
like you can do all start --
stuff with this one, like, you

00:06:58.852 --> 00:07:00.787
can do like like targeted
attacks if you wanted to that's

00:07:00.787 --> 00:07:02.789
why advertising is so big now.
But we are not going to -- we

00:07:02.789 --> 00:07:04.791
are going to talk about mal veer
advertising a little bit that

00:07:04.791 --> 00:07:06.793
you think that is enough for the
background. We can talk about

00:07:06.793 --> 00:07:08.795
now like the ADD fraud problem
itself. So, what ADD fraud? >>

00:07:08.795 --> 00:07:10.797
So it is the crib practice of
attempting to sell ADD that have

00:07:10.797 --> 00:07:12.799
no intention of being viewed by
a user. You are serving ADDS you

00:07:12.799 --> 00:07:14.801
are purposely serving ADDS that
no one is seeing that is

00:07:14.801 --> 00:07:16.803
basically the definition of ADD
fraud. It's kind of weird you'll

00:07:16.803 --> 00:07:18.805
see that later. So the problem
there's a lot of claims about

00:07:18.805 --> 00:07:20.807
how big, the big, the extent of
the problem is. So, in some

00:07:20.807 --> 00:07:22.809
cases in the low end, they say
that ADD fraud and like, fraud

00:07:22.809 --> 00:07:24.811
impressions are about 30 percent
of the low end and 60 percent of

00:07:24.811 --> 00:07:26.813
the high end so what's the scans
of this? >> If you think --

00:07:26.813 --> 00:07:28.815
let's use low end like 30
percent so if you think about

00:07:28.815 --> 00:07:30.817
it, the total digital ADD spend
is 60 billion so even 30 percent

00:07:30.817 --> 00:07:32.819
that's about seven billion I
think. So that is pretty big

00:07:32.819 --> 00:07:34.821
chunk of the pie, right. So
whose whose losing money

00:07:34.821 --> 00:07:36.823
obviously the advertise sir.
They have too much money any way

00:07:36.823 --> 00:07:38.825
that's a big chunk of change.
So, in any case who are the

00:07:38.825 --> 00:07:40.827
actor who are actually making
money out of this. So -- so they

00:07:40.827 --> 00:07:42.829
make money out of like generate
tongue traffic. And the next one

00:07:42.829 --> 00:07:44.831
obviously who makes money in
advertising? >> It's a

00:07:44.831 --> 00:07:46.833
publishers. It's like the blog,
the big websites and all of that

00:07:46.833 --> 00:07:48.835
stuff. So how do they make
money? >> So if they purchase

00:07:48.835 --> 00:07:50.837
traffic, there's a cost there
and they get money from the

00:07:50.837 --> 00:07:55.809
advertise sir so they make money
off of the spread. So in maybe

00:07:55.809 --> 00:08:02.849
two weeks from now I'm releasing
another paper called economic of

00:08:02.849 --> 00:08:08.855
ADD fraud so I guess just wait
for it and stuff. So, what are

00:08:11.925 --> 00:08:17.931
we doing about it? >> So before
I go through that, I want to

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:26.840
introduce you to the interactive
active advertising bureau so

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:32.846
when I first started like when I
moved to my new job in like, the

00:08:36.549 --> 00:08:44.324
digital advertising, the first
meeting I went to was the an tie

00:08:44.324 --> 00:08:49.529
Malware group IAB, so IAB
actually develops industry

00:08:49.529 --> 00:08:55.335
standards or on line digital
advertising. So, they are

00:08:55.335 --> 00:09:01.174
actually doing really good
things but honestly it's a bit

00:09:01.174 --> 00:09:06.946
confusing. Like I was confused
at first special l with the ADD

00:09:06.946 --> 00:09:12.919
fraud -- they have this whole
list about like ADD fraud here's

00:09:12.919 --> 00:09:19.893
like a quick outline and it had
me badge felled some of it criss

00:09:19.893 --> 00:09:26.332
coving why is this ADD fraud
what I'm going to do is disstill

00:09:26.332 --> 00:09:30.403
the -- into something a little
bit sim and a little bit more

00:09:30.403 --> 00:09:36.409
straightforward. So there are
basically three main types of

00:10:22.222 --> 00:10:28.228
ADD fraud the first one is
publish -- to increase

00:10:31.631 --> 00:10:36.402
impression county we'll talk
about that later. Second one is

00:10:36.402 --> 00:10:41.307
serving legal or malicious
content. Third one is using non

00:10:41.307 --> 00:10:44.744
human traffic to increase
impression. So, you see here,

00:10:44.744 --> 00:10:46.746
right, -- two of them are
related to increasing

00:10:46.746 --> 00:10:48.748
impressions so directly related
for generate ting money but the

00:10:48.748 --> 00:10:50.750
second one is actual allocated
little bit different its serving

00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:54.854
content it's about serving the
wrong kind of consent --

00:10:54.854 --> 00:11:02.228
content. Et cetera -- let's go
for the first one first the idea

00:11:02.228 --> 00:11:04.230
of publisher tricks to
increasing impression count is

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:06.232
to make like not really one ADD
impression but make a few ADD

00:11:06.232 --> 00:11:08.234
impression look more like --
more ADDE pressings how does

00:11:08.234 --> 00:11:10.236
that happen some of the exam
potentially here are hidden

00:11:10.236 --> 00:11:14.207
PIQEL one by one -- hidden PIQ
-- how does that happen. For

00:11:14.207 --> 00:11:17.911
example, like, eye view one
website and I see one ADD like

00:11:17.911 --> 00:11:21.948
the red block there I assume
that's an ADD. So you see one

00:11:21.948 --> 00:11:25.685
ADD but the publisher reports
that I saw three. So that's how

00:11:25.685 --> 00:11:30.557
the publisher tricks work. Let
me give you some examples like

00:11:30.557 --> 00:11:38.131
with the hid Ken PIXELS
typically you want to see this.

00:11:38.131 --> 00:11:41.301
So, if you see this, you see
three ADD, right that's

00:11:41.301 --> 00:11:45.838
legitimate, but you see this
like hidden ADDs so when you

00:11:45.838 --> 00:11:47.840
look -- let's say you look at
that page you see no ADDs but it

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:49.842
is actually serving ten or more
why because they are getting the

00:11:49.842 --> 00:11:51.844
ADD as in the -- so you are
actually generate tongue like a

00:11:51.844 --> 00:11:53.846
ton of I will -- a TON of
impression that's the idea of

00:11:53.846 --> 00:11:55.848
these hidden address the same
thing with ADD stack king you

00:11:55.848 --> 00:11:57.850
stack the ADDS I guess you see
this a lot in porn sites or

00:11:57.850 --> 00:11:59.852
something like for example you
see one ADD then you don't know

00:11:59.852 --> 00:12:01.788
that things other ADDs there you
see one but its generate and or

00:12:01.788 --> 00:12:03.790
serving ten or more or something
like that. So the thing here is

00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:09.796
like, this is this is kind of
effective but its rarely seen

00:12:14.033 --> 00:12:20.039
now less than before. Because --
because pub issue bluish her

00:12:24.143 --> 00:12:27.513
make money out of their sight
and the publisher are doing this

00:12:27.513 --> 00:12:29.616
on their sight so it can be
directly attributed to them so

00:12:29.616 --> 00:12:35.622
they don't want that happening
so that's why this is a little

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:09.522
less pref lent nowadays these
like publisher tricks to do

00:13:09.522 --> 00:13:12.625
this. So, let's go to, let's go
to the next one. So okay so

00:13:12.625 --> 00:13:15.261
serving objectionable and
malicious content. Sometimes ADD

00:13:15.261 --> 00:13:17.730
fraud doesn't mean increasing
impressions although it could

00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:21.100
lead to that. This case like the
prominent examples are like

00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:23.569
serving Malware MAL veer
advertising, exams like fraud

00:13:23.569 --> 00:13:26.339
fraudulent websites and stuff
like that then non

00:13:26.339 --> 00:13:28.508
[indiscernible] when I say
objectionable non brand serve

00:13:28.508 --> 00:13:31.577
these pertain to pornography,
hate and stuff like that so

00:13:31.577 --> 00:13:33.579
there's also like categories
regarding objectionable

00:13:33.579 --> 00:13:37.116
categories that you will see.
How does this work? >> Well we

00:13:37.116 --> 00:13:40.820
just go back to our like how
ADDS are served for example

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:44.223
malicious advertise he is you
want to send like like IRS

00:13:44.223 --> 00:13:47.093
examine or something through an
ADD you just make correct

00:13:47.093 --> 00:13:53.099
campaign like campaign set up
into the SP and if you win the

00:14:32.438 --> 00:14:36.008
bid you pretty much just like
like get all your ADDS through

00:14:36.008 --> 00:14:39.612
the publish her which ends up
April -- in the user fairly

00:14:39.612 --> 00:14:42.615
straightforward that's also what
happens when you talk about mal

00:14:42.615 --> 00:14:46.486
veer advertising as well so that
is the malicious content stuff.

00:14:46.486 --> 00:14:51.457
I'll give you some examples.
When I started like doing

00:14:51.457 --> 00:14:53.559
research other than this, I was
looking at an add -- dash

00:14:53.559 --> 00:14:55.561
inventory of ADD network, and
well needless to say in some

00:14:55.561 --> 00:14:57.563
network the inventory the
publisher inventory is very

00:14:57.563 --> 00:14:59.565
dirty so you see here like you
are serving Malware there's TONS

00:14:59.565 --> 00:15:01.501
of ADD wear here's the thing
some cases even if you serve

00:15:01.501 --> 00:15:03.503
like, like, like illegal content
it could actually generate like

00:15:03.503 --> 00:15:05.505
more impressions such as ADD
wear, like here's an interest

00:15:05.505 --> 00:15:07.507
and thing like exams and stuff
and the power of like targeting

00:15:07.507 --> 00:15:09.509
Ted advertising its too small
like for example in that very

00:15:09.509 --> 00:15:11.511
left-hand side, the scroll in
the lower left eye actually like

00:15:11.511 --> 00:15:13.513
loaded that in our MANILAA
office I got fraudulent like

00:15:13.513 --> 00:15:15.515
examine website that's directed
to the -- so you see it's in --

00:15:15.515 --> 00:15:17.517
all the department stores there
are actually like in the local

00:15:17.517 --> 00:15:19.519
area. So it's really smart doing
it this way like sending your

00:15:19.519 --> 00:15:21.521
malicious stuff through address
because you can actually target

00:15:21.521 --> 00:15:23.523
specific [indiscernible] so
that's wallets really cool about

00:15:23.523 --> 00:15:25.525
that stuff. So, now, we can
start talking about non human

00:15:25.525 --> 00:15:27.527
traffic. So, most of the time
when you talk about non human

00:15:27.527 --> 00:15:29.529
traffic, really it is -- but in
some cases it gets lumped in

00:15:29.529 --> 00:15:31.531
like some other stuff gets
lumped in some gray areas and

00:15:31.531 --> 00:15:33.533
it's not actually bought but
actually like human impressions

00:15:33.533 --> 00:15:35.535
that are kind of low quality so
I'll show that to you guys in a

00:15:35.535 --> 00:15:37.537
little bit. So let's talk about
non human traffic. What is the

00:15:37.537 --> 00:15:39.539
best way to investigate this? >>
So when I started this the best

00:15:39.539 --> 00:15:41.541
way to investigate this was
actually start buying traffic as

00:15:41.541 --> 00:15:43.543
well. So that's what I did. So,
the two main questions that I

00:15:43.543 --> 00:15:45.545
wanted to answer is what is purr
Chad internet traffic made of

00:15:45.545 --> 00:15:47.547
and can I buy internet traffic
and get away with it. So that's

00:15:47.547 --> 00:15:49.549
-- and that's the start of well
the BEIBER project. The project

00:15:49.549 --> 00:15:51.551
is really it's all like just a
TON of blog that I made that are

00:15:51.551 --> 00:15:53.553
basically HINEY parts that's
basically it. I did not make the

00:15:53.553 --> 00:15:59.559
content by myself. So, I just
grabbed it from different sites

00:16:04.964 --> 00:16:11.971
but I had a ton of them. So the
idea here is to like buy --

00:16:11.971 --> 00:16:13.973
purchase traffic and purposely
direct those impressions in

00:16:13.973 --> 00:16:15.975
those blog. And those blog
actually have like -- and what

00:16:15.975 --> 00:16:17.977
particular types of contractor
ribs and at contributes that I

00:16:17.977 --> 00:16:19.979
wanted to get and then I
collected information and did

00:16:19.979 --> 00:16:21.981
analysis. So I said collected,
right, so I used a lot of Java

00:16:21.981 --> 00:16:23.983
script and you can get a lot out
of a BO -- that's really what I

00:16:23.983 --> 00:16:25.985
used to figure out like what is
this traffic actually is and I

00:16:25.985 --> 00:16:27.987
just [indiscernible] and just
went through it. Then next is

00:16:27.987 --> 00:16:29.989
the fun stuff. I started buying
traffic. So initially I was

00:16:29.989 --> 00:16:31.991
thinking like oh this might be
hard like where do I buy traffic

00:16:31.991 --> 00:16:36.796
because like like for example
It's like hard to get like

00:16:36.796 --> 00:16:38.798
typically I thought it was going
to be as difficulty as get thing

00:16:38.798 --> 00:16:45.104
like Malware but no it's really
easy so there were a ton of

00:16:45.104 --> 00:16:49.976
vendors that I found like
selling traffic and these are

00:16:49.976 --> 00:16:55.815
just one of the few I probably
like used 30 for this

00:16:55.815 --> 00:17:00.119
experiments and there's also
like traffic market places out

00:17:00.119 --> 00:17:06.459
there and you can buy all sorts
of stuff so not only internet

00:17:06.459 --> 00:17:11.797
traffic not only impressions but
you can buy like YouTube views,

00:17:11.797 --> 00:17:18.638
YouTube likes, actually like I
spoke DEF CON kids this morning

00:17:18.638 --> 00:17:24.644
that other one, it was a little
-- what I presented was a little

00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:46.866
bit different it wasn't -- so I
did like an experiments so I had

00:18:03.983 --> 00:18:07.286
a Twitter account. So I opened
that like maybe a long time ago

00:18:07.286 --> 00:18:10.556
when I started like, cause I
gave a talks here in DEF CON

00:18:10.556 --> 00:18:13.859
before and I think I need add
Twitter account so I had a

00:18:13.859 --> 00:18:16.629
Twitter account opened to have
four years I had 21 followers

00:18:16.629 --> 00:18:19.665
for four years. And a few days
ago I started buying followers

00:18:19.665 --> 00:18:22.468
and now I have four thousand
followers impressive, huh. So so

00:18:22.468 --> 00:18:25.271
I don't know about that so
that's off topic. So traffic

00:18:25.271 --> 00:18:27.773
market places. And now let's
talk about what is purchase

00:18:27.773 --> 00:18:30.843
internet traffic made of? >> So,
well bought really like most of

00:18:30.843 --> 00:18:34.113
it so how do you know as I
mentioned like the clues are

00:18:34.113 --> 00:18:36.649
actually in the impression
itself like you grab it using

00:18:36.649 --> 00:18:40.186
Java script and you just analyze
it. So there are a lot of clues.

00:18:40.186 --> 00:18:42.989
And you know, right, like
browser can like a ton of

00:18:42.989 --> 00:18:46.025
information about you and what
you are doing and all you need

00:18:46.025 --> 00:18:49.829
is like some quick Java script
I'm not a Java script G U R you

00:18:49.829 --> 00:18:52.598
or anything like that. So
anyway, so you can look for

00:18:52.598 --> 00:18:55.134
status suspicious information
for example like plug ins, does

00:18:55.134 --> 00:18:57.336
it have plug ins like a lot of
bugs does it have plug ins. Does

00:18:57.336 --> 00:18:59.338
the plug in match what the
browser is or any of that stuff

00:18:59.338 --> 00:19:01.273
does it have screen at
contribute window at contribute

00:19:01.273 --> 00:19:03.275
how big is the view port is it
giving you the correct view

00:19:03.275 --> 00:19:05.277
ports the product identifiers
are all the product identifiers

00:19:05.277 --> 00:19:07.279
matching so does it look like
that its actually saying the

00:19:07.279 --> 00:19:09.281
browser is what its saying it
is. [indiscernible] so it it

00:19:09.281 --> 00:19:16.055
have a frame rate an mason frame
rate is it rent ring Java script

00:19:16.055 --> 00:19:22.561
there's a ton of stuff you can
look at and determine whether

00:19:22.561 --> 00:19:29.935
its non human traffic. Of course
user agented as you all no like

00:19:29.935 --> 00:19:36.776
user agents are very easy to
forge and stuff like that. But,

00:19:36.776 --> 00:19:43.582
you know, oh these are just like
the clues, like sometimes like

00:19:43.582 --> 00:19:49.155
like all this stuff that -- but
sometimes the clues are really

00:19:49.155 --> 00:19:51.490
obvious, you know, and when I
started buying like internet

00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:54.660
traffic the cheapest one I
noticed didn't even care to --

00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:57.163
that it was like -- it was plain
sight in their user agent so the

00:19:57.163 --> 00:19:59.165
cheaper you get the more bots
and cheaper bought you got. Not

00:19:59.165 --> 00:20:04.537
all traffic are made equal. So I
say like this is actually like

00:20:04.537 --> 00:20:11.911
inaccurate it should be like
weaker approaches and like

00:20:11.911 --> 00:20:17.917
smarter approaches. So, what are
the weaker approaches? >> Well,

00:20:20.119 --> 00:20:25.558
traffic generate so there's a
ton of traffic generators out

00:20:25.558 --> 00:20:27.993
there you can buy. You can
purchase traffic why not

00:20:27.993 --> 00:20:33.933
generate the traffic yourself so
you can use like traffic

00:20:33.933 --> 00:20:36.836
generates so there's a lot out
there I won't go through each

00:20:36.836 --> 00:20:42.842
one of them. And the thing is
like I made like a summary of

00:20:47.379 --> 00:20:53.385
all of this so I'll stop here.
Like the custom stuff you can do

00:21:17.109 --> 00:21:20.946
custom stuff and you its too
small there but you see like a

00:21:20.946 --> 00:21:23.649
lot of these custom stuff are
actually made by like through

00:21:23.649 --> 00:21:26.852
like you bought stud I don't not
sure if anyone is familiar with

00:21:26.852 --> 00:21:29.555
you bought stud I don't it's an
awesome software. It's not

00:21:29.555 --> 00:21:32.057
malicious its actually a
legitimate software and what you

00:21:32.057 --> 00:21:34.093
use it for is for web masters to
help facilitate like ought

00:21:34.093 --> 00:21:36.095
mating stuff in their websites
like logging in, doing stuff,

00:21:36.095 --> 00:21:38.097
posting stuff but you know all
good things can have like a bad

00:21:38.097 --> 00:21:40.099
aspect as well and you can also
use this to like create

00:21:40.099 --> 00:21:42.101
followers, alcoholic on likes,
create subscribe percent and all

00:21:42.101 --> 00:21:44.103
of those stuff you can
manipulate that. But really It's

00:21:44.103 --> 00:21:46.105
like its like It's like the --
so it's really like very very

00:21:46.105 --> 00:21:48.107
useful and it has like a
scripting language and all of

00:21:48.107 --> 00:21:50.109
that stuff. So, so, you'll see a
lot of the bots that they are

00:21:50.109 --> 00:21:52.111
being sold actually the made out
of you pot studio. Traffic

00:21:52.111 --> 00:21:54.113
generator, what are the
important things to look for if

00:21:54.113 --> 00:21:56.115
you are buying a traffic
generate? >> So obviously it has

00:21:56.115 --> 00:21:58.117
to be able to CLICK on links and
selected areas. And then -- you

00:21:58.117 --> 00:22:00.052
can't have it bottom barred
admitting like like the web side

00:22:00.052 --> 00:22:02.054
right then obviously changing
user agent is very important.

00:22:02.054 --> 00:22:09.895
Custom -- fur not like CNN or
something you can just type it

00:22:09.895 --> 00:22:15.668
indirectly in your browser for
example you are like a blog like

00:22:15.668 --> 00:22:21.407
known blog and you have like
suddenly you have like millions

00:22:21.407 --> 00:22:26.212
-- millions and millions of prim
messing -- that is suspicious

00:22:26.212 --> 00:22:31.984
usually you would like to does a
receiver from a search engine,

00:22:31.984 --> 00:22:37.723
someone found your sight and
went to your sight some of the

00:22:37.723 --> 00:22:41.093
important things with traffic
generator obviously proxy

00:22:41.093 --> 00:22:46.365
support is important so like you
can't have your traffic coming

00:22:46.365 --> 00:22:52.137
from one IP but here's the
problem also with IP proxy with

00:22:52.137 --> 00:22:59.311
the proxy stuff S like, a lot of
the one of the main thing that

00:22:59.311 --> 00:23:03.082
like interactive advertising
bureau ideas is like, like

00:23:03.082 --> 00:23:08.854
having checking like proxy you
can scrape from a lot of like

00:23:08.854 --> 00:23:14.126
different sites so its --
whether good guys no the proxy

00:23:14.126 --> 00:23:19.798
address and versus you so that's
the challenge there. So, but

00:23:19.798 --> 00:23:25.804
sometimes it is a little bit
tricky yes, sir so you can do

00:24:04.777 --> 00:24:07.846
like a more tricky yes, sir
things. So, let me tell you

00:24:07.846 --> 00:24:09.848
about [indiscernible]. So is
actually a traffic exchange

00:24:09.848 --> 00:24:11.850
software and it's in Chinese but
they are like tutor y'alls out

00:24:11.850 --> 00:24:13.852
there to learn what the buttons
mean so I'll tell you more about

00:24:13.852 --> 00:24:16.155
it which is pretty cool. So
traffic -- so here for example I

00:24:16.155 --> 00:24:18.157
installed [indiscernible] in my
computer but the thing is like

00:24:18.157 --> 00:24:20.159
[indiscernible] it won't visit
nie website because if it visit

00:24:20.159 --> 00:24:22.161
my website it's just pretty much
a traffic generator, right.

00:24:22.161 --> 00:24:24.163
[indiscernible] like visits
other peoples websites and when

00:24:24.163 --> 00:24:26.165
you start visiting other
people's websites you generate

00:24:26.165 --> 00:24:28.167
TOKEN the more TOTENs you have
the mother -- the mother other

00:24:28.167 --> 00:24:30.169
people have enforced stalled
visit your would be sight that's

00:24:30.169 --> 00:24:32.171
the idea how it works. You see
there's traffic exchange and you

00:24:32.171 --> 00:24:34.173
don't have to think about proxy
because its actually coming from

00:24:34.173 --> 00:24:36.175
different computers already. So
that's the neat thing about it.

00:24:36.175 --> 00:24:38.177
So let me show you a quick video
of the [indiscernible] stuff. So

00:24:38.177 --> 00:24:40.179
what I'll do I won't run the
whole -- I'll do like manual

00:24:40.179 --> 00:24:42.181
fast forward stuff so here is --
oh it's not showing up. How does

00:24:42.181 --> 00:24:44.183
this work? >> Oo my oh this is
going to suck. Oh, no. I'll drag

00:24:44.183 --> 00:24:46.185
it over. Right. So I'm releasing
-- oh, it works. That

00:24:46.185 --> 00:24:48.187
embarrassed me. Where's that
thing. Thank you Molly this is

00:24:48.187 --> 00:24:50.189
going to be really difficulty
for me. Okay. So let me go

00:24:50.189 --> 00:24:52.191
through this it's going to be a
little bit difficulty so yep,

00:24:52.191 --> 00:24:54.193
so, you see there on the right
that's [indiscernible] and I

00:24:54.193 --> 00:24:56.195
have like -- open so let's go
through this so yes so it's

00:24:56.195 --> 00:24:58.197
running so start -- so you see
like is already running I'm

00:24:58.197 --> 00:25:01.233
visiting like sites already so
this is my BIEBER blog, so these

00:25:01.233 --> 00:25:06.572
are moi blog let's continue
let's continue. And you see here

00:25:06.572 --> 00:25:10.476
I'm already receiving
impressions right off the bat.

00:25:10.476 --> 00:25:15.414
Let's go. So, [indiscernible]
has started a process and it is

00:25:15.414 --> 00:25:20.319
resource intensive it eats a lot
of resources here it is already

00:25:20.319 --> 00:25:26.024
context tongue to IP address you
see here its -- and I have low

00:25:26.024 --> 00:25:30.662
priority actually so lots of
resource -- so let's see what's

00:25:30.662 --> 00:25:36.668
happening in the network. So
it's already visiting a lot of

00:25:40.372 --> 00:25:46.378
sites. I have stats for you at
the typed of this so there you

00:25:56.088 --> 00:26:01.660
go. So traffic is very busy. You
see there on the left-hand side

00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:03.662
-- shark It's like banking away
so here's my blog continue to

00:26:03.662 --> 00:26:05.664
Google and stuff here's the
interesting stuff one of the

00:26:05.664 --> 00:26:11.670
main things they told me one of
the weaknesses most of the

00:26:20.712 --> 00:26:23.582
traffic actually comes from
china. But, you know, like in my

00:26:23.582 --> 00:26:29.288
most reSeptember once, no, its
actually coming from all over

00:26:29.288 --> 00:26:35.294
the world. And I don't have like
actual stats but in my sampling

00:26:42.701 --> 00:26:48.707
most of -- of it it's not all
china it's not majority even so

00:26:57.149 --> 00:27:02.221
getting like a lot of stuff
here, that stuff so it's still

00:27:02.221 --> 00:27:05.190
working, there you go so let's
-- so at this point like there's

00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:07.192
like already like a ton of
[indiscernible] processes there.

00:27:07.192 --> 00:27:09.194
It's very busy yep so let us
generate some stats I'm

00:27:09.194 --> 00:27:11.196
generating stats off wire shark.
So here's the interesting thing

00:27:11.196 --> 00:27:13.866
here so what happened here like
Iran it for 30 minutes just 30

00:27:13.866 --> 00:27:17.903
minutes so for 30 minutes I
generated four thousand HTTP

00:27:17.903 --> 00:27:20.672
requests from my computer alone
so it's a lot and like I

00:27:20.672 --> 00:27:25.577
probably visited about 300 to
400 unique websites so it is a

00:27:25.577 --> 00:27:27.579
lot of stuff. You might be
wondering how much impressions

00:27:27.579 --> 00:27:30.682
did I get for that 30 minutes I
only about 200 it's not fair,

00:27:30.682 --> 00:27:34.219
huh. Time generate tongue way
more than I am getting but

00:27:34.219 --> 00:27:36.555
still, still, like if you look
at the impression they look like

00:27:36.555 --> 00:27:43.328
pretty quality impression all
over the world. So its kinds of

00:27:43.328 --> 00:27:51.036
useful. So next -- let's move
on. Okay were done with the

00:27:51.036 --> 00:27:57.442
engining and stuff. There of
course there's Malware as well

00:27:57.442 --> 00:28:04.249
so this is like the one of the
last NHT stuff that I'm going to

00:28:04.249 --> 00:28:09.521
show you guys. So the problem
here is is I have another video

00:28:09.521 --> 00:28:15.527
so next let me open the stuff
for my add wear video. Okay --

00:28:17.896 --> 00:28:24.469
ADWARE video, it's not work
hadn't. There you go. There you

00:28:24.469 --> 00:28:31.677
go. Here we go. So same with the
[indiscernible] stuff I'm going

00:28:31.677 --> 00:28:38.450
to forward it manually. So I
will tell you about like the

00:28:38.450 --> 00:28:44.456
correct -- corrected risk of
Malware that's add fraud so

00:28:47.259 --> 00:28:53.265
let's go through here. So one of
the first things you'll notice

00:28:55.534 --> 00:28:58.070
is you'll seldom notice anything
just as with all types of

00:28:58.070 --> 00:29:00.005
Malware it's very subtle. --
subject. Let's go through it.

00:29:00.005 --> 00:29:02.908
Sometimes you notice if you know
key stuff for example there like

00:29:02.908 --> 00:29:07.512
just a pop up from a web page
came out. So where is it coming

00:29:07.512 --> 00:29:11.216
from you probably like have an
idea already. So, the pop ups

00:29:11.216 --> 00:29:14.286
are actually coming from hid ten
windows like hidden browsers

00:29:14.286 --> 00:29:17.356
running in the back are
background so Malware is using

00:29:17.356 --> 00:29:20.759
your browser with your plug ins
with your mind types and in

00:29:20.759 --> 00:29:26.765
working like in running it off
like like in the background but

00:29:29.768 --> 00:29:32.671
just hidden so that is very
smart actually. So these are,

00:29:32.671 --> 00:29:35.073
you probably see there the
hidden windows already. The

00:29:35.073 --> 00:29:38.010
next, here's the thing though
like sometimes, oh I have ten

00:29:38.010 --> 00:29:41.480
minutes so the funny thing here
is in some cases like what you

00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:44.950
see is -- you see clues suddenly
if the Malware makes -- forgets

00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:48.153
to like mute the volume suddenly
you are working suddenly like an

00:29:48.153 --> 00:29:51.356
ADD will play you'll see the
audio but there's no like ADD

00:29:51.356 --> 00:29:54.426
anywhere and there's no video
anywhere so that's when you'll

00:29:54.426 --> 00:30:00.432
see there so let me make this a
little bit faster so since --

00:30:08.407 --> 00:30:14.413
since I have ten minutes already
so here as I mentioned like high

00:30:24.723 --> 00:30:30.729
jacks browser very smart if you
high Jack about sir you are

00:30:57.456 --> 00:31:03.395
piggy back king off the -- so
it's hard to actually like

00:31:12.370 --> 00:31:18.376
fingerprint it as malicious
because you are actually piggy

00:31:21.346 --> 00:31:27.352
back and off browser that's
really smart. Aside traffic

00:31:30.322 --> 00:31:36.328
generate that what's really
smart about some of the user

00:31:40.298 --> 00:31:48.273
browser it actually generates
scrolling behavior and mouse

00:31:48.273 --> 00:31:54.279
behavior, you see the scrolling
there, right. But the mouse

00:31:58.250 --> 00:32:04.189
behavior is not too obvious. But
that's other thing because in

00:32:09.161 --> 00:32:15.167
some cases you try to detect non
human traffic bug BO checking

00:32:20.238 --> 00:32:24.442
user events and user engage try
to buy pass this by adding some

00:32:24.442 --> 00:32:28.547
user movements so let me end
that. Then -- so you can

00:32:28.547 --> 00:32:34.553
detrains analysis to catch
those, you can -- as I said you

00:32:38.523 --> 00:32:44.529
can do -- human in general have
more purposeful pattern like

00:32:49.134 --> 00:32:55.140
they go from element to element,
smoother movement mixture of

00:32:58.777 --> 00:33:04.716
events I actually had like
another video but I won't be

00:33:09.321 --> 00:33:13.091
showing that I have something
here like the actual like my

00:33:13.091 --> 00:33:16.027
BIEBER website track engage its
able to like like what track

00:33:16.027 --> 00:33:18.730
what element you hovered in how
long you hovered in the element

00:33:18.730 --> 00:33:21.700
what -- even if you highlighted
a text, like what text are you

00:33:21.700 --> 00:33:23.702
highlight tongue how long you
stayed there what alcoholics you

00:33:23.702 --> 00:33:25.704
are doing it actually gets way
more, CLICKS you are going

00:33:25.704 --> 00:33:27.706
Malware very injury key you do a
program scroll and a program

00:33:27.706 --> 00:33:29.708
mouse movement so there should
be like ways to look at other

00:33:29.708 --> 00:33:31.710
stuff. So, as I mentioned there
are gray areas here not all in

00:33:31.710 --> 00:33:33.712
NHT all like traffic are made of
boss so mirrors the the gray

00:33:33.712 --> 00:33:35.714
area so in some cases when you
buy traffic like traffic vendors

00:33:35.714 --> 00:33:37.716
will actually put your website
in other high traffic websites

00:33:37.716 --> 00:33:39.718
and serve it, pop under and pop
ups. And a lot of like

00:33:39.718 --> 00:33:41.720
verification services miss that.
They almost a lot of them will

00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:43.722
say it's all boss but sometimes
it's not. Sometimes its human

00:33:43.722 --> 00:33:45.724
but low quality. So in this case
likes for example win -- in one

00:33:45.724 --> 00:33:47.726
of the things that -- one of the
vendors I looked at 70 percent

00:33:47.726 --> 00:33:49.728
of all traffic came from one
PIXEL -- usually this is

00:33:49.728 --> 00:33:51.730
indicative of pop under. Pop
under a gray area pop under it

00:33:51.730 --> 00:33:53.732
pop under but difficulty to say
whether it was seen or not

00:33:53.732 --> 00:33:55.734
because it takes interaction to
actually see a pop under. So can

00:33:55.734 --> 00:33:57.736
I actually buy internet traffic
and get away with it. First well

00:33:57.736 --> 00:33:59.738
if an advertise sir no what to
look for, like the at

00:33:59.738 --> 00:34:01.673
contributes is about yes you
will get caught but if not you

00:34:01.673 --> 00:34:03.675
will not get caught another
thing that I discovered when

00:34:03.675 --> 00:34:05.677
like paying for all this
internet traffic is you get what

00:34:05.677 --> 00:34:07.679
you pay for. So, lower prizes
you really get boss with higher

00:34:07.679 --> 00:34:09.681
prizes when you start buying
traffic you get frames, pipe

00:34:09.681 --> 00:34:11.683
ups, pop under. How much time do
I still have so I don't have

00:34:11.683 --> 00:34:13.685
anymore time. Oh five minutes so
I will just do like a quick wrap

00:34:13.685 --> 00:34:15.687
up so, we talked about like the
businesses of advertising,

00:34:15.687 --> 00:34:17.689
right, so important thing to
know there is like yes it is a

00:34:17.689 --> 00:34:19.691
very important field to start
going into like as I mentioned

00:34:19.691 --> 00:34:21.693
it is a 60 billion-dollar
industry right now. And just

00:34:21.693 --> 00:34:23.695
keeps on growing. And there is
like a lot of stuff that you can

00:34:23.695 --> 00:34:25.697
like, like figure out there. The
next is the ECO system. Remember

00:34:25.697 --> 00:34:27.699
important things publishers,
advertisers you had demand sight

00:34:27.699 --> 00:34:29.701
platforms where you do -- which
manager's impression you have

00:34:29.701 --> 00:34:31.703
ADD exchange cheers which are
basically the marketplace for

00:34:31.703 --> 00:34:33.705
these impression finally you
have publish summer fraud, you

00:34:33.705 --> 00:34:35.707
have malicious content and non
human traffic. So, that

00:34:35.707 --> 00:34:37.709
diagnosis it for me. So if you
like my presentation please

00:34:37.709 --> 00:34:43.715
visit us at [indiscernible] so.
I would like to mention my books

00:42:58.843 --> 00:43:02.513
totally unrelated to ADD fraud
or add DD particular please

00:43:02.513 --> 00:43:05.383
check it out any way. I'll be
here if you have any questions

00:43:05.383 --> 00:43:11.389
I'll be walking around thank you
very much. >> [Applause]
