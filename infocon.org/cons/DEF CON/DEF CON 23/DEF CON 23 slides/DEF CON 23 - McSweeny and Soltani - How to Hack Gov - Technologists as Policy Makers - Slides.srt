00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:02.636
So this morning we are talking
about to hack government

00:00:02.636 --> 00:00:07.741
technologist as policy makers i
am (indiscernible) consul tony,
currently the

00:00:07.741 --> 00:00:12.980
chief technologist of the FTC.
You might know me from my

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:14.982
working with the Washington
journal or with the Washington

00:00:14.982 --> 00:00:17.417
post. I was one of the reporters
that worked on the Snowden

00:00:17.417 --> 00:00:22.155
documents that brought you that
smiley face & Im Carol Mc
(indiscernible)

00:00:22.155 --> 00:00:25.292
Im a commissioner with the
federal trade commission. And

00:00:25.292 --> 00:00:29.830
I'm an attorneys not a
technologist and I have been in

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:33.467
the policy space for a long time
at both I FTC, white house and

00:00:33.467 --> 00:00:37.404
the DOJ. as you can probably
tell by the difference in these

00:00:37.404 --> 00:00:41.375
pictures, Im the type of person
that rely relies technologist

00:00:41.375 --> 00:00:45.212
like (indiscernible)  to help me
do my job which is a little bit
about what

00:00:45.212 --> 00:00:48.515
were gonna talk about today,
just a word about the disclaimer

00:00:48.515 --> 00:00:52.386
that's at the bottom of this
slide. Both Ashkan and I work

00:00:52.386 --> 00:00:56.256
for the federal commission. And
so do a lot of people. i

00:00:56.256 --> 00:00:59.226
actually have 4 other colleagues
who are also commissioners and

00:00:59.226 --> 00:01:01.595
They don't always agree with
everything we say, so we are

00:01:01.595 --> 00:01:04.564
talking here about our
experiences and were speaking

00:01:04.564 --> 00:01:07.601
here individually and not on
behalf of the whole entire trade

00:01:07.601 --> 00:01:12.706
commission, or the government.
>> So this talk we are going to

00:01:12.706 --> 00:01:16.510
talk about what the tech policy.
on of the great debates right

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:20.447
now, and why do technologist,
you and the audience, why do you

00:01:20.447 --> 00:01:25.185
guys matter? this talk isnt its
not a tech talk. We are not

00:01:25.185 --> 00:01:27.955
dropping any other days. kinda
have some vulnerabilities, but

00:01:27.955 --> 00:01:33.226
theyre of the human kind, theyre
people and process. >> just to

00:01:33.226 --> 00:01:39.232
start >> does it work? >> video
playing so this senator Ted

00:01:58.051 --> 00:02:03.156
Stevens and his relatively
famous quote during the 2006

00:02:03.156 --> 00:02:05.959
technicality debate where in hes
saying that the (indiscernible)

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:09.529
infrastructure of the internet,
and uuuhm we included it just

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:13.300
because it sort of underscores
the message, because that people

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.671
who make laws who make policies
do need to have technical

00:02:17.671 --> 00:02:20.540
experts that help them
understand the technology that

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.844
they are empassing and to be
fair he wasnt totally wrong

00:02:23.844 --> 00:02:27.748
right it was kind -- , more --
than -- for example, not bad

00:02:27.748 --> 00:02:33.620
right? and so there are number
of policies that have been hotly

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.024
debated in DC right now, this
was kind of a word cloud in many

00:02:37.024 --> 00:02:41.094
of them, privacy, data security,
crossword or data flows, the

00:02:41.094 --> 00:02:45.565
right to be forgotten,
wassenaar, computer fraud and

00:02:45.565 --> 00:02:48.635
abuse act, which you guys are
probably in admittedly familiar

00:02:48.635 --> 00:02:51.772
with, there is cyber security
legislation that is currently on

00:02:51.772 --> 00:02:56.043
the floor, the senate, computer
breach and data security, tons

00:02:56.043 --> 00:03:00.781
of debates, and uummm and uuuhh
video playing: but i wanna start

00:03:00.781 --> 00:03:05.018
here in the FTC, because
everyday, you take the lead by

00:03:05.018 --> 00:03:08.588
making sure that the americans,
their hard earned money, and

00:03:08.588 --> 00:03:13.160
their privacy are protected,
especially when they go online,

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.997
and these days thats pretty much
for everything, managing our

00:03:16.997 --> 00:03:21.034
bank accounts, paying our bills,
handling everything form medical

00:03:21.034 --> 00:03:26.273
records, to movie tickets,
controlling our homes smart

00:03:26.273 --> 00:03:31.545
houses, from smart phones,
secret service does not let me

00:03:31.545 --> 00:03:38.618
do that, but i know other people
do. so this is president Obama,

00:03:38.618 --> 00:03:41.321
actually at the trade
commission, earlier this year

00:03:41.321 --> 00:03:44.357
talking alot about the tech
policy issues the we at the

00:03:44.357 --> 00:03:47.761
trade commission spend alot of
time on, consumer data privacy,

00:03:47.761 --> 00:03:53.533
data security, the internet of
things, uuhhm, this was actually

00:03:53.533 --> 00:03:56.937
really memorable to the FTC,
President Obama is actually the

00:03:56.937 --> 00:03:59.840
first president since President
Roosevelt to Visit the trade

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.510
commission. They think it really
underscore how important alot of

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.380
these technology policy debates
are right now and how they risen

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.951
up literally to the highest
level of the government. just to

00:04:10.951 --> 00:04:14.554
note also, i think its important
to explain that At the trade

00:04:14.554 --> 00:04:17.991
commission we protect consumers
and we are focused on the

00:04:17.991 --> 00:04:20.927
practices on the private sector
that are impacting them so

00:04:20.927 --> 00:04:23.263
that's what where he going to
focus on in this talk today. We

00:04:23.263 --> 00:04:26.700
are talking about consumer
privacy im talking about privacy

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.503
as it relates at the commercial
space. We are not part of the

00:04:29.503 --> 00:04:33.140
government that gathers
information about people and

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.208
thing like that, thats a
different debate, thats an

00:04:35.208 --> 00:04:37.344
important debate, but were gonna
stay out of it for now because

00:04:37.344 --> 00:04:39.679
that is not th e FTC
jurisdiction, >> Which it an

00:04:39.679 --> 00:04:42.782
important point that you guys
all know which is that is nearly

00:04:42.782 --> 00:04:46.219
every part of the society has
some technological component?

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:49.489
nearly everything we do is
online of technically mediated

00:04:49.489 --> 00:04:53.960
by an app or computer of some
sort, thats the part where we

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:58.798
come in to play, We come in as
technologist. >> just to level

00:04:58.798 --> 00:05:03.670
up, theres a kind of an Alphabet
soup of laws that protects the

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:07.140
data consumer and privacy in the
US, sometimes we refer to this

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:10.610
as sector base approach and this
is just a slide that runs

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:16.249
through many of those laws. That
we protect children under 13 and

00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:21.121
cafA. we have special Protection
about financial information and

00:05:21.121 --> 00:05:25.525
health information for some kind
of student records. We have

00:05:25.525 --> 00:05:28.862
obviously privacy protection
from the telecommunication act

00:05:28.862 --> 00:05:34.100
as well, that the jurisdiction
of the FTC so in several state

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:37.904
laws as well. So that's the kind
of landscape that we are

00:05:37.904 --> 00:05:43.009
operating in and the kind of
protections thats are out there

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:46.313
and we also have the FTC. >> and
of the things we have to think

00:05:46.313 --> 00:05:49.482
about is, for the most part
there are not a lot of

00:05:49.482 --> 00:05:53.620
restrictions for companies uuhm
what information companies can

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:58.725
gather. or what consumer data
practices protection in law, We

00:05:58.725 --> 00:06:02.362
have the patchwork as Carol
said, the laws and regulation

00:06:02.362 --> 00:06:05.565
that achieve that effect, but
there is not specifically

00:06:05.565 --> 00:06:08.768
prohibiting companies from
gathering information for

00:06:08.768 --> 00:06:14.774
example. >> So the FTC how does
it fit into this space. It was

00:06:17.978 --> 00:06:21.681
created on 1914 by president
Wilson, thats him on the left,

00:06:21.681 --> 00:06:27.654
it was part of a policy debate
that was focus on trying to

00:06:27.654 --> 00:06:31.891
combat the economic power of the
trust just like on the cartoon

00:06:31.891 --> 00:06:36.763
of standard oil and that stuff
so is created because there was

00:06:36.763 --> 00:06:39.299
a lot of concern about the power
that these trust had in our

00:06:39.299 --> 00:06:42.502
economy and that was a 100 years
ago, but it was given in a

00:06:42.502 --> 00:06:45.839
relatively broad authority to
protect consumers from unfair

00:06:45.839 --> 00:06:51.878
deceptive act of practices and
that's the next slide. >> And as

00:06:51.878 --> 00:06:59.152
Carol said, you can think of us
as the white hats of the

00:06:59.152 --> 00:07:02.155
government. Where he here to
protect consumers. were here to

00:07:02.155 --> 00:07:05.158
promote good practices of
companies Get them to fix their

00:07:05.158 --> 00:07:09.362
shit when is broken, were kind
of uuuhm As far as government

00:07:09.362 --> 00:07:13.433
goes on the consumer side of
things. >> So as the authority

00:07:13.433 --> 00:07:16.870
that we have we use essentially
in a number of ways and were

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:21.107
gonna spen a little time talking
about that today, mostly to

00:07:21.107 --> 00:07:24.511
check to make sure that privacy
promises that are made to

00:07:24.511 --> 00:07:29.015
consumers are being actually
being -- to at hear too and
that

00:07:29.015 --> 00:07:33.820
consumers are protected from
unfair practices especially when

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:37.290
it comes to securing their data.
>> and unfair, it took me alot

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:39.426
of guess, but unfair doesnt
mean, you know Hey that's

00:07:39.426 --> 00:07:44.264
unfair, theres a specific legal
definition of unfairness and as

00:07:44.264 --> 00:07:47.300
-- law, it is really
important to understand that

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:51.137
definition as we try to
highlight practicing that might

00:07:51.137 --> 00:07:53.707
be problematic. There is
restriction like it cant be

00:07:53.707 --> 00:07:59.145
offset by available benefits,
theres likelihood to cause

00:07:59.145 --> 00:08:04.317
injure or harm in some way. And
so I'll let Carol explain more

00:08:04.317 --> 00:08:07.721
about the law. video playing: i
dont know anything about this,

00:08:07.721 --> 00:08:09.889
maybe you know something about
this it has to do with federal

00:08:09.889 --> 00:08:13.526
trade commission and apparently
theres a product being marketed

00:08:13.526 --> 00:08:18.465
in the united states, it was
caffeine laced undergarments,

00:08:18.465 --> 00:08:23.103
the idea is that the caffeine in
the undergarments is that the

00:08:23.103 --> 00:08:27.240
wearer could lose weights and
and have less cellulites, by

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:33.813
putting caffeine in your
underpants. >> That seems like a

00:08:33.813 --> 00:08:36.883
really a cool idea, it turns out
that this product dont actually

00:08:36.883 --> 00:08:43.757
work which is a bummer. and we,
uuuhm, literally right? We at

00:08:43.757 --> 00:08:48.294
the FTC protect consumer from a
bunch of products or marketing

00:08:48.294 --> 00:08:53.700
claims that dont do what they
claim they do, right? That's a

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:58.872
really low tactic and we also so
we do that's like our bread and

00:08:58.872 --> 00:09:05.044
butter but we also do a lot of
high tech products as well. >>

00:09:05.044 --> 00:09:08.748
It was just undergarments under
pants. Consumers in 1914 were

00:09:08.748 --> 00:09:14.754
adopting technologies like the
phone and rails in fact one of

00:09:17.824 --> 00:09:22.662
our first cases was against this
company that produces a

00:09:22.662 --> 00:09:27.434
calculation machine and brought
a case that it did not due the

00:09:27.434 --> 00:09:30.203
claims. And then we have
understanding what a calculating

00:09:30.203 --> 00:09:34.274
machine, what the capability
were and what claims they were

00:09:34.274 --> 00:09:37.277
making and understanding the
technology underlying their

00:09:37.277 --> 00:09:44.884
claims. And it has always been a
part of our work. we in the 60s

00:09:44.884 --> 00:09:49.556
or 70s would build systems to
automatically test tar contents

00:09:49.556 --> 00:09:53.193
in cigarettes. So this was a
parallel smoking machine that

00:09:53.193 --> 00:09:57.664
would inhale cigarettes and
measure the ingredients, it

00:09:57.664 --> 00:10:00.767
became the FTC method. and then
again were building technology

00:10:00.767 --> 00:10:03.837
to measure things. like if you
folks remember, Like the droid

00:10:03.837 --> 00:10:08.408
army that would measure the
vulnerable libraries and

00:10:08.408 --> 00:10:11.344
multiple android devices in
parallel, these are the types of

00:10:11.344 --> 00:10:15.014
things that weve always been
engaged with to help measure and

00:10:15.014 --> 00:10:20.520
contrast and understand
practices and particular spaces.

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:25.091
>> So the FTC at 100 is
increasingly engage at looking

00:10:25.091 --> 00:10:30.296
at technology and high-tech
products. This gives a sense of

00:10:30.296 --> 00:10:35.368
some of the cases involving huge
tech companies in the last five

00:10:35.368 --> 00:10:40.073
years and sometimes the FTC is
refer to the federal technology

00:10:40.073 --> 00:10:44.978
commission beacuse of our goal,
increasingly looking at these

00:10:44.978 --> 00:10:47.747
the practices of these companies
as it relates to in fact that

00:10:47.747 --> 00:10:51.151
they are having on consumers
especially their privacy and

00:10:51.151 --> 00:10:54.487
their data security. >> were
gonna step through these cases,

00:10:54.487 --> 00:10:57.924
but to start -- >> To start one
important thing and weve been

00:10:57.924 --> 00:11:02.161
talking about it a little bit,
We have the ability to try to

00:11:02.161 --> 00:11:05.798
make sure people are marketing
their products fairly to

00:11:05.798 --> 00:11:10.236
consumer and deceiving them. So
this case actually is current in

00:11:10.236 --> 00:11:15.575
litigation and here the issue is
does an unlimited plan that is

00:11:15.575 --> 00:11:21.648
throttled is that actually
unlimited. And our allegation in

00:11:21.648 --> 00:11:25.251
this case is that its deceptive
to consumers to say that they

00:11:25.251 --> 00:11:28.655
have an unlimited plan if in
fact theyre gonna be throttled

00:11:28.655 --> 00:11:31.925
over certain threshold. right in
here we have to understand like

00:11:31.925 --> 00:11:35.195
how network routing works, whats
is congestion based throttling

00:11:35.195 --> 00:11:42.635
vs network management, >> You
know. For example SS 7 and weird

00:11:42.635 --> 00:11:45.572
networking and GSM protocols.
that you know Some people now

00:11:45.572 --> 00:11:47.874
in this know that obscure
technical underpinnings of old

00:11:47.874 --> 00:11:52.946
telco uuuuhhh, Telco systems, so
in order to bring this case so

00:11:52.946 --> 00:11:57.717
companies will bring argument
and they would say that this is

00:11:57.717 --> 00:12:00.086
how it needs to be managed and
we would say for example if

00:12:00.086 --> 00:12:02.589
youre capping people with 5gbs
regardless of network

00:12:02.589 --> 00:12:06.859
congestion, that might not be
congestion throttling and so it

00:12:06.859 --> 00:12:10.930
becomes the core elements of our
case. >>the privacy promises,

00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:13.833
this is a big piece of what we
do on the enforcement side, >>

00:12:13.833 --> 00:12:17.503
The reason we are spending a
little time talking ability the

00:12:17.503 --> 00:12:22.108
FDC enforcement is that
enforcement is actually one of

00:12:22.108 --> 00:12:25.245
the strongest tools that we have
in our tool box to help shape

00:12:25.245 --> 00:12:29.248
policy and practices in the
private sector. Google bus for

00:12:29.248 --> 00:12:33.286
example this case involves a
broken pipe as they promised

00:12:33.286 --> 00:12:36.122
which is that Google made to
gmail users, about how they use

00:12:36.122 --> 00:12:42.328
gmail information and wether
they would use that in the way

00:12:42.328 --> 00:12:47.400
that different than the Gmail
user expected so it is

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:52.305
relatively important because we
allege that in fact that the

00:12:52.305 --> 00:12:59.412
Gmail user couldnt avoid, or
couldnt have anticipated user

00:12:59.412 --> 00:13:04.117
buzz and didnt have adequate
notice to be able to opt you

00:13:04.117 --> 00:13:07.954
out. >> Once the settlement is
reach the company is often put

00:13:07.954 --> 00:13:11.357
under order, for example google
is under order for 20 yrs, To

00:13:11.357 --> 00:13:13.893
maintain that privacy policies,
that privacy promises in fact

00:13:13.893 --> 00:13:16.496
has regular privacy assessment
and we then use that authority

00:13:16.496 --> 00:13:20.533
to later bring other enforcement
action. So you may recall Google

00:13:20.533 --> 00:13:24.871
was also found circumventing
Safari browser settings

00:13:24.871 --> 00:13:28.908
basically responding safari
cookies. And then we later

00:13:28.908 --> 00:13:32.612
brought in enforcement actions
with monetary penalties once

00:13:32.612 --> 00:13:38.751
under order. >> Similarly, for
facebook, you know the facebook

00:13:38.751 --> 00:13:42.555
case again we took at a hard
look at whether representation

00:13:42.555 --> 00:13:45.525
of facebook had made to users
about how they could restrict

00:13:45.525 --> 00:13:51.964
their information were actually
true, and determine that they

00:13:51.964 --> 00:13:56.402
want and brought case there,
this is also pretty important

00:13:56.402 --> 00:14:01.941
because we look at how
retroactive change to how users

00:14:01.941 --> 00:14:06.512
information was handled,
actually was deceptive to

00:14:06.512 --> 00:14:12.585
uncertain consumers, and so we
looked at a change in policy and

00:14:12.585 --> 00:14:17.857
try to hold Facebook accountable
for the promises they have made.

00:14:17.857 --> 00:14:22.295
>> This was one of my first
cases as staff technologist at

00:14:22.295 --> 00:14:27.200
the tim in 2010. There was a lot
of technical work that needed to

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:33.072
be done. We allege that Facebook
apps will have access to more

00:14:33.072 --> 00:14:36.609
information than what users were
told, so you could restrict your

00:14:36.609 --> 00:14:40.646
information sharing to private.
for example via facebook

00:14:40.646 --> 00:14:43.616
settings but as a person in the
audience know, via the facebook

00:14:43.616 --> 00:14:46.419
API, you could pull alot of
information, you can pull

00:14:46.419 --> 00:14:49.989
whatever information the user
had set, so we have to do things

00:14:49.989 --> 00:14:54.260
like understanding the IPI run
App so demonstrate, or wrie apps

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:58.598
that demonstrate and verify our
claims. There was a claim

00:14:58.598 --> 00:15:02.468
regarding deletion of photos
there is need to understand how

00:15:02.468 --> 00:15:07.006
CDN works, when you delete your
photo on facebook, if you deep

00:15:07.006 --> 00:15:09.709
link to that photo it is still
available in the cache network

00:15:09.709 --> 00:15:12.311
because they didnt delete the
photo off their CDN. There was

00:15:12.311 --> 00:15:14.647
another case to sharing
information and folks here know

00:15:14.647 --> 00:15:16.916
how advertiser gets information
via refer headers, so facebook

00:15:16.916 --> 00:15:19.385
claim that they wouldnt share
your information with

00:15:19.385 --> 00:15:25.391
advertisers but in fact, your
facebook ID and the page your on

00:15:29.595 --> 00:15:33.099
would be stn will sent to
advertisers embedded embedded on

00:15:33.099 --> 00:15:35.201
the facebook page because they
didnt properly -- the

00:15:35.201 --> 00:15:41.207
advertisement, etc so a lot of
the case legal finding so we had

00:15:43.843 --> 00:15:47.680
technically demonstrate what our
claims were with regards with

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:51.517
information sharing. >> If I can
just underscore that per second,

00:15:51.517 --> 00:15:56.489
I'm a lawyer not a computer
scientist. Half the time I might

00:15:56.489 --> 00:15:58.658
understand what the
terminologist that Ashkan is

00:15:58.658 --> 00:16:03.396
using. but when i can work with
a technologist who does, they

00:16:03.396 --> 00:16:06.866
explain it clearly, then it
helps inform our mission, But

00:16:06.866 --> 00:16:10.536
core part of why this
partnership is so important, no

00:16:10.536 --> 00:16:14.207
me, so this is a relatively
users case again about privacy

00:16:14.207 --> 00:16:17.243
promises, this is a company
whose technology that allows

00:16:17.243 --> 00:16:20.880
their clients, the retailers, to
track to check users as they are

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:24.217
coming in and out of their
retail location and then we

00:16:24.217 --> 00:16:30.223
brought a case here because the
company says user's consumers

00:16:30.223 --> 00:16:34.427
will have the option opt out in
retail location, that was using

00:16:34.427 --> 00:16:36.429
the technology. that they will
have notice in the retail

00:16:36.429 --> 00:16:38.431
location using the technology,
neither which were happening so

00:16:38.431 --> 00:16:45.671
we brought a case saying that
was deceptive. >> Do you know

00:16:45.671 --> 00:16:49.175
what this? the retail tracking?
Promise no Wi-Fi sniffing,

00:16:52.044 --> 00:16:55.781
retailers malls, will install
essentially access points that

00:16:55.781 --> 00:17:00.519
are passively moldering for wifi
and GSM beacons and they will

00:17:00.519 --> 00:17:05.258
track you whether you return or
where you walk through the mall

00:17:05.258 --> 00:17:09.395
and there was a lot of technical
claims a lot of the companies in

00:17:09.395 --> 00:17:12.698
the space argue that the
information is anonymous the

00:17:12.698 --> 00:17:16.335
collect uuhhm for example they
may mac addresses but they use

00:17:16.335 --> 00:17:22.775
quick graphic to anonymize the
mac addresses and in fact if you

00:17:22.775 --> 00:17:26.512
guys know they are hashing the
mac addresses with known hashes

00:17:26.512 --> 00:17:31.117
often time is 6 byte mac
address, and the first part is

00:17:31.117 --> 00:17:35.321
the manufacture code so the
space required to actually boot

00:17:35.321 --> 00:17:39.492
all of the hashes is quite small
where its actually 2-30th and

00:17:39.492 --> 00:17:42.728
you can do on the regular laptop
or you can download it -- or

00:17:42.728 --> 00:17:47.033
a lot of the argument was when
companies make claim that this

00:17:47.033 --> 00:17:50.736
information is anonymize would
demonstrate it is not. its right

00:17:50.736 --> 00:17:52.738
there, the current status is
closed, you can reverse the

00:17:52.738 --> 00:17:57.643
hash, or you can go back to the
mac address, Similar regards to

00:17:57.643 --> 00:18:00.279
claims about notice, companies
that make claims like the

00:18:00.279 --> 00:18:06.452
tracking only occur within the
mall but as you all know Wi-Fi

00:18:06.452 --> 00:18:10.790
signal can trigger pass walls so
visitors at store next door will

00:18:10.790 --> 00:18:18.331
have this location tracking
technology. So informing the

00:18:18.331 --> 00:18:24.070
pros and cons and the pitfalls
were critical to bringing this

00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:28.541
case. This can where we, the
community can really contribute.

00:18:30.843 --> 00:18:34.614
>> Finally snap chat, this is a
case that's ongoing every effort

00:18:34.614 --> 00:18:37.883
to make sure that after being
marketed truthfully to consumers

00:18:37.883 --> 00:18:41.854
and then this case we allege it
was deceptive said this claims

00:18:41.854 --> 00:18:45.057
that messages would disappear
forever when it fact was

00:18:45.057 --> 00:18:48.961
actually easy to capture them.
we also had uuhm, carefully with

00:18:48.961 --> 00:18:51.597
data security and practices and
some of the other practices,

00:18:51.597 --> 00:18:53.599
have been found that the claims
they made are also similarly

00:18:53.599 --> 00:18:58.504
misleading, this is another case
where folks in this community

00:18:58.504 --> 00:19:03.175
there was a talk in 2013 about
ephemeral app and how they were

00:19:03.175 --> 00:19:09.315
in fact not ephemeral. This is
an area where this community has

00:19:09.315 --> 00:19:11.651
contribute quite a lot, and
researched and demonstrating

00:19:11.651 --> 00:19:14.553
that when companies make privacy
and security claims, of course

00:19:14.553 --> 00:19:17.857
its something we want, We want
privacy in apps, but when its

00:19:17.857 --> 00:19:21.193
not true. It actually harms
consumers if you can snap chat

00:19:21.193 --> 00:19:27.433
some sensitive of some one and
they can easily scrape that

00:19:27.433 --> 00:19:31.237
information, consumers are
effectively harmed they are

00:19:31.237 --> 00:19:33.339
proceeding and sending these
photos under the assumption of

00:19:33.339 --> 00:19:39.345
trust. so in addition to kinda
deceptive claims we also bring

00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:45.184
enforcive actions to companies
that fail to meet reasonable

00:19:45.184 --> 00:19:48.287
security practices. So one of
the cases that I work on was

00:19:48.287 --> 00:19:53.726
HTC. If folks remember that they
have this -- this carrier IQ

00:19:53.726 --> 00:19:57.930
which was kind of a telemetry
app inside multiple smart

00:19:57.930 --> 00:20:02.535
phones, the carrier would
essentially get the OEM to load

00:20:02.535 --> 00:20:07.273
this this kind of logging in
feature to help understand how

00:20:07.273 --> 00:20:11.110
people use the phone or monitor
the devices. So in this case

00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:16.048
carrier IQ, HTC integrated the
carrier IQ sytem, as well as

00:20:16.048 --> 00:20:19.051
their log -- in a way that
somehow broke the android

00:20:19.051 --> 00:20:22.621
permission module, they allowed
unsigned code, the damon was

00:20:22.621 --> 00:20:24.623
using a IAMF user bound to all
their interfaces and any other

00:20:24.623 --> 00:20:26.625
app could also pull all the
information from the damon, they

00:20:26.625 --> 00:20:28.627
enable debug options, in the
production code so it was

00:20:28.627 --> 00:20:32.832
logging all sorts of things like
key presses and SMS So here we

00:20:32.832 --> 00:20:38.838
make the case by this point of
of investigation that by not

00:20:41.841 --> 00:20:49.682
having not proper procedure of
reviewing code or by testing and

00:20:49.682 --> 00:20:53.219
doing code signing. They were
not essentially maintaining

00:20:53.219 --> 00:20:55.921
reasonable practices, they broke
the android permission model

00:20:55.921 --> 00:20:58.357
wand would effectively leak
other information to other app.

00:20:58.357 --> 00:21:01.594
>> And just a word about these
security cases. weve been

00:21:01.594 --> 00:21:04.497
talking before about private
cases that sort of involve

00:21:04.497 --> 00:21:10.636
deception or promises made that
isnt kept, In security cases we

00:21:10.636 --> 00:21:14.907
also use our authority to bring
them. Which means we talked

00:21:14.907 --> 00:21:18.711
about this in the beginning,
that we are looking at whether

00:21:18.711 --> 00:21:25.184
consumers are can avoid the harm
to them and whether they're in

00:21:25.184 --> 00:21:29.989
fact sort of the way we look at
it in the security context that

00:21:29.989 --> 00:21:35.027
leads us to, excuse me, the
practices that are being used by

00:21:35.027 --> 00:21:40.466
the company be reasonable. We
don't believe in such a thing

00:21:40.466 --> 00:21:46.772
like perfect security but what
we do search to enforce here is

00:21:46.772 --> 00:21:50.910
reasonable security in place to
protect the consumer data,that

00:21:50.910 --> 00:21:54.847
the company has and that's where
the technologist are vital to

00:21:54.847 --> 00:22:00.786
our mission. Understanding the
practice and procedure that are

00:22:02.955 --> 00:22:07.693
in place. >> This is another
case where multiple apps, like

00:22:07.693 --> 00:22:11.830
fandango the ticketing app and
credit karma an app that you can

00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:18.938
pull your credit score were such
not validating and allowing SSL

00:22:18.938 --> 00:22:23.042
middle attack feeding the whole
purpose over SSL so we brought a

00:22:23.042 --> 00:22:28.781
case against them by breaking
certain validation they were not

00:22:28.781 --> 00:22:32.484
engaging and reasonable security
practices. >> And these cases

00:22:32.484 --> 00:22:36.255
also involve deception element
as well. So promising you're

00:22:36.255 --> 00:22:41.026
securing something when you are
not can be deceptive. >> One of

00:22:41.026 --> 00:22:44.163
the resent cases. Trinet, which
is a, IOT camera. this was

00:22:44.163 --> 00:22:51.503
probably one of out IOT cases,
It was a web cam that allowed

00:22:51.503 --> 00:22:57.509
users to advertise to monitor
your baby can be used in banking

00:23:00.112 --> 00:23:04.316
environments. It was a security
camera. Expect the security

00:23:04.316 --> 00:23:08.120
functionality allows any user,
that it can pull the IP address

00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:11.090
of the camera to pull the video
feed even if the user had marked

00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:15.828
the video as private and this is
one of these case where again

00:23:15.828 --> 00:23:20.499
the understanding for example
how to connect the network, this

00:23:20.499 --> 00:23:23.569
was a really easy one. You can
redirect to the camera but some

00:23:23.569 --> 00:23:28.007
of the newer cams for example
bad default or the way they do

00:23:28.007 --> 00:23:33.879
port negotiation will allow any
pull any videos from number of

00:23:33.879 --> 00:23:38.884
cameras, without even needing to
the admin interface and so these

00:23:38.884 --> 00:23:41.954
IOT case were really interesting
for us, to were kinda understand

00:23:41.954 --> 00:23:45.724
There has been a number of talks
here informing some odf the

00:23:45.724 --> 00:23:49.094
problems in IOT, and i think
this is a critical area for us

00:23:49.094 --> 00:23:52.031
>> Just a word about the harm in
this case. Is obvious if the

00:23:52.031 --> 00:23:55.934
harm is credit card information
and financial information and

00:23:55.934 --> 00:23:59.772
that kind of thing. Here the
harm is exposing video feeds

00:23:59.772 --> 00:24:03.475
from people's home to public
internet. And we think that's a

00:24:03.475 --> 00:24:08.080
violation of privacy that is
deeply harmful. >> In the case

00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:11.216
there were example state of
undress and engage in sexual

00:24:11.216 --> 00:24:18.057
activity which we would argue as
harmful. if an attacker can

00:24:18.057 --> 00:24:25.898
review that and punch an IP
address And watch that feed and

00:24:25.898 --> 00:24:33.505
in the last case we'll talk
about is the Case of designer

00:24:33.505 --> 00:24:35.507
wear. it was an older case, I
did not work on this case but

00:24:35.507 --> 00:24:37.710
essentially, I'm sorry the
nudity was in this case not in

00:24:37.710 --> 00:24:43.315
the other case this was
essentially a rag, So the

00:24:43.315 --> 00:24:47.086
designer wear made software that
allowed rent to own companies,

00:24:47.086 --> 00:24:51.657
to monitor devices that they
rented to consumers so the

00:24:51.657 --> 00:24:55.928
software can be enabled to
monitor keystrokes, take screen

00:24:55.928 --> 00:24:59.665
shots every 2 mins, take web
camera shots every 2 minutes and

00:24:59.665 --> 00:25:06.638
no notice to consumer so we
argue that was an unreasonable

00:25:06.638 --> 00:25:10.309
practice. In some cases photo of
children,individual not in

00:25:10.309 --> 00:25:15.414
clothes and couple engage in
sexual activity were captured by

00:25:15.414 --> 00:25:18.450
this software, this was on
people that were late on their

00:25:18.450 --> 00:25:24.456
payment. And would capture this
data without the users knowing.

00:25:28.927 --> 00:25:32.331
>> So again unfair and deceptive
is harmful to consumers because

00:25:32.331 --> 00:25:36.201
its exposing them to things they
cannot avoid and theyre not

00:25:36.201 --> 00:25:40.339
aware of and they're really very
vulnerable as fi your computer

00:25:40.339 --> 00:25:46.145
is turning on and taking screen
shots sort of like Mr.Robot. >>

00:25:46.145 --> 00:25:52.151
So this is just we just cover a
few of our cases but there are

00:25:55.621 --> 00:25:58.991
tons that are very technical. We
brought cases against companies

00:25:58.991 --> 00:26:03.862
using flash cookies browser
setting, and privacy controls,

00:26:03.862 --> 00:26:08.467
we recently had a mobile app
that have a bitcoin miner

00:26:08.467 --> 00:26:13.472
enabled in it that would have
essentially would use your phone

00:26:13.472 --> 00:26:17.976
to mine bitcoins when you are
not using the phone, weve brough

00:26:17.976 --> 00:26:20.612
cases against companies that
uses CSS history sniffing, whic

00:26:20.612 --> 00:26:24.583
is again an academic paper which
then inform us of this practice

00:26:24.583 --> 00:26:29.988
and verify and demonstrated the
problem ourselves but then we

00:26:29.988 --> 00:26:33.058
have a technical concept and the
we have a number of concept of

00:26:33.058 --> 00:26:36.628
dat security, But in addition to
enforcement. >> So we have been

00:26:36.628 --> 00:26:39.531
talking ability our big stick
our enforcement cases and there

00:26:39.531 --> 00:26:43.268
is a bunch more of them. So we
can provide that information and

00:26:43.268 --> 00:26:48.073
is on your web site but we also
shape policy and the public

00:26:48.073 --> 00:26:51.743
policy debates in a variety of
other ways, . We can be

00:26:51.743 --> 00:26:56.682
workshops, very focus on the
internet over things. We think

00:26:56.682 --> 00:26:58.951
the invasion and potential in
this phase terrific for

00:26:58.951 --> 00:27:02.421
consumers but as a bunch of
folks in this room know and as

00:27:02.421 --> 00:27:07.125
waht is demonstrated through out
defcon this year and last year,

00:27:07.125 --> 00:27:10.062
there are lot of potential
vulnerabilities in these

00:27:10.062 --> 00:27:14.166
products. So we look carefully
at that. Data discrimination.

00:27:14.166 --> 00:27:18.036
Fitness and health wearables,
and chemical passes there that

00:27:18.036 --> 00:27:23.075
are affecting consumers if you
are generating your own health

00:27:23.075 --> 00:27:27.145
information and sharing it is
not HIPPA protect and had a lot

00:27:27.145 --> 00:27:30.549
of people may totally not
understand how that information

00:27:30.549 --> 00:27:33.685
being shared. >> Also we are
doing a workshop in NOvember on

00:27:33.685 --> 00:27:36.021
cross device tracking, do you
folks know what this is?

00:27:36.021 --> 00:27:42.027
advertisers want to know when
you see an add on your mobile

00:27:44.863 --> 00:27:48.100
beside. and you later purchase
it on your device or your

00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:51.737
computer, That are you the same
user and contribute the same

00:27:51.737 --> 00:27:53.739
user or impression, but the
technology behind is interesting

00:27:53.739 --> 00:28:00.045
so we are having a workshop to
discuss some of the concerns and

00:28:00.045 --> 00:28:06.018
some of the consuming notice and
functionalities , for example

00:28:06.018 --> 00:28:09.855
the technology work to either
log in services, so you can be

00:28:09.855 --> 00:28:12.090
logged in to one of the biggest
companies like google, facebook

00:28:12.090 --> 00:28:17.129
and twitter, there able to know
are you the same user but for

00:28:17.129 --> 00:28:20.165
good portion of the practice a
lot of companies will try to

00:28:20.165 --> 00:28:23.669
behave that model that two
devices are related. You might

00:28:23.669 --> 00:28:26.838
have a burner phone and your
regular phone and try to keep

00:28:26.838 --> 00:28:29.575
those at the technology
separate, but in fact the

00:28:29.575 --> 00:28:31.910
technology will try to
fingerprint and then identify

00:28:31.910 --> 00:28:35.747
that the same phone, are
connecting to the same location

00:28:35.747 --> 00:28:40.485
or maybe they visited the same
websites, and is using browser

00:28:40.485 --> 00:28:43.555
fingerprinting or some sort of
behavior correlation or

00:28:43.555 --> 00:28:47.326
statistical correlation. One of
the more interesting Technology

00:28:47.326 --> 00:28:50.996
for example. is something that
might resonate in the bad bios

00:28:50.996 --> 00:28:55.901
card, One company might use
audio beacons, subsonic audio

00:28:55.901 --> 00:28:58.604
beacons, that we can't hear but
one phone, the add library in

00:28:58.604 --> 00:29:00.539
one phone will admit these
calls, and add library in the

00:29:00.539 --> 00:29:02.541
other phones will pick up that
these two phones are in the same

00:29:02.541 --> 00:29:06.511
proximity and that these two
phones are within each other and

00:29:06.511 --> 00:29:11.883
then they will link that
together and thats the current

00:29:11.883 --> 00:29:18.256
practice We want to learn more
about. >> So we also put out

00:29:18.256 --> 00:29:22.260
material, really excited about
our start with security

00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:24.863
initiative. We are going to be
doing workshops around the

00:29:24.863 --> 00:29:28.133
country starting in the fall. So
weve already released what we

00:29:28.133 --> 00:29:31.837
call start with security its on
our website. If this is your

00:29:31.837 --> 00:29:35.774
field I encourage you to look at
it. Is based on more than 50

00:29:35.774 --> 00:29:40.012
cases brought on this case and
really and get into sort of

00:29:40.012 --> 00:29:43.815
lessons learned, best practices
that were drawing from our

00:29:43.815 --> 00:29:48.620
enforcement efforts. >> So one
is happening September 9 and the

00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:51.123
other September 5 in Austin. We
are trying to bring star ups and

00:29:51.123 --> 00:29:58.997
researching like yourself and
others together to how can we

00:29:58.997 --> 00:30:02.200
think ability security from the
gecko, how can we prioritize and

00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:06.605
what are those practices, And
also have a tech FTC blog. It

00:30:06.605 --> 00:30:14.012
highlights some of the technical
concerns in the space. Is very

00:30:14.012 --> 00:30:20.018
much inform by this community.
Technical lawyers of the FTC

00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:25.824
there are few. This is a blog
post on how to access API

00:30:25.824 --> 00:30:31.163
security. so theres a bunch of
load that we were actually

00:30:31.163 --> 00:30:35.934
trying to hit up, What should be
best practices. Is informing by

00:30:35.934 --> 00:30:41.106
the work you all do as well. >>
We have excited to use the

00:30:41.106 --> 00:30:44.309
American compete app to run
contests to harness the

00:30:44.309 --> 00:30:48.647
technical know how of this
community and others, so this

00:30:48.647 --> 00:30:53.819
week weve actually beem running
humanity strikes back contest

00:30:53.819 --> 00:30:59.324
which brings new tool to block
robocalls is and report them

00:30:59.324 --> 00:31:02.694
into a crowd source honeypots.
pretty excited on our efforts,

00:31:02.694 --> 00:31:07.165
Built on our effort here last
year zapping rachel, Rachel is

00:31:07.165 --> 00:31:10.569
that annoying customer service,
does anyone know rachel from

00:31:10.569 --> 00:31:14.906
customer service? this is
actually important to us because

00:31:14.906 --> 00:31:20.912
we actually get about 170 --> 000/
complaints month about robot

00:31:20.912 --> 00:31:23.682
calls. From people who are on
the do not call list S. really

00:31:23.682 --> 00:31:30.122
hard for us to try to enforce
our law and protect people from

00:31:30.122 --> 00:31:33.291
these really annoying call and
we are trying to develop new

00:31:33.291 --> 00:31:38.430
tools and harness new technology
not only to help us with our

00:31:38.430 --> 00:31:42.434
enforcement effort but also give
consumers new tools. >> And the

00:31:42.434 --> 00:31:45.971
contest will be announce today
at 2 here in the award and this

00:31:45.971 --> 00:31:50.308
is a very good example of the
need to have harmony between

00:31:50.308 --> 00:31:53.845
technology and law and lot that
has happened in policy is the

00:31:53.845 --> 00:31:58.049
lawyers, are like, technology
will fix it. Someone should make

00:31:58.049 --> 00:32:02.087
a law against that. But in fact
you need the 2 working together.

00:32:02.087 --> 00:32:06.491
So we have the do not call list
but robo calls can jump of PDXs

00:32:06.491 --> 00:32:10.829
and make calls from any numbers
and hard to send a reputation.

00:32:10.829 --> 00:32:16.034
So what are some other tools we
can employee to protect

00:32:16.034 --> 00:32:20.806
consumers or in act they do not
call mission? which is to

00:32:20.806 --> 00:32:25.110
protect consumers from robocall,
We also have im happy to

00:32:25.110 --> 00:32:28.380
announce we are kicking off an
office of technology research.

00:32:28.380 --> 00:32:33.518
this is essentially an in house
research group that puts

00:32:33.518 --> 00:32:39.524
together some interns that
manage to wake up at 10? And

00:32:41.626 --> 00:32:46.264
they're doing ongoing kind of
proactive research into emerging

00:32:46.264 --> 00:32:51.303
technologies. so were block
boxing things So were looking at

00:32:51.303 --> 00:32:54.573
vulnerabilities things, were
looking at data issues, data

00:32:54.573 --> 00:32:58.076
discrimination. some of the
topics that personal to me, the

00:32:58.076 --> 00:33:01.012
Internet of things Obviously
connected cars which is a hot

00:33:01.012 --> 00:33:04.783
issue. ansd this idea of
algorithmic trasparency And by

00:33:04.783 --> 00:33:09.054
that I mean so passwords that
help highlight companies

00:33:09.054 --> 00:33:11.756
charging different prices to
different people based on your

00:33:11.756 --> 00:33:16.595
ZIP code or refer headers or
what cookies you might have, on

00:33:16.595 --> 00:33:19.030
way i like to save the message
home how many of you guys use a

00:33:19.030 --> 00:33:26.738
mapping software? Almost earn.
But how many actually know

00:33:26.738 --> 00:33:33.044
whether you're being serve the
best routs. So we assume the

00:33:33.044 --> 00:33:37.249
system is routing us on based on
shortest distance or traffic or

00:33:37.249 --> 00:33:40.385
congestion, but how do yo know
its now routing you in front of

00:33:40.385 --> 00:33:42.988
a store front or a billboard the
company seeing you as a kick

00:33:42.988 --> 00:33:45.924
back for. We don't have a way to
look into those problems

00:33:45.924 --> 00:33:51.930
Currently and know what the bias
and in hand and so driving might

00:33:51.930 --> 00:33:54.599
is one factor but there is
issues in regards to

00:33:54.599 --> 00:33:59.070
discrimination and gender bias
and a lot of problematic areas

00:33:59.070 --> 00:34:03.275
in society that algorithms can
help be there directly or

00:34:03.275 --> 00:34:08.413
inadvertently contribute to bad
practices or bias practices so

00:34:08.413 --> 00:34:10.782
that's an area I'm very
interesting in. >> A word about

00:34:10.782 --> 00:34:14.619
this. OTRI office, I think is
really important. And in fact

00:34:14.619 --> 00:34:21.059
Ashkan rules and the rule of
technologist in the FTC what we

00:34:21.059 --> 00:34:26.231
see is the urgent need to
protect the consumers in an

00:34:26.231 --> 00:34:29.668
increasingly wired and connected
world, we need to to have our

00:34:29.668 --> 00:34:33.004
own technologist helping us form
out law enforcement and policy

00:34:33.004 --> 00:34:35.373
making mission, and so were
expanding the role of where the

00:34:35.373 --> 00:34:39.244
technologist are playing and i
think its vitally important so

00:34:39.244 --> 00:34:42.681
we can understand what is
happening in the market place

00:34:42.681 --> 00:34:45.884
and keep up in the very exciting
and innovative way >> We hug

00:34:45.884 --> 00:34:50.255
like this RTC. This is what
we're doing now. But there is a

00:34:50.255 --> 00:34:54.159
ton. >> FTC rocks. >> That's
true, but there is a ton of

00:34:54.159 --> 00:35:02.033
other technical debates that are
boing on DC that a lot of us are

00:35:02.033 --> 00:35:04.035
not engage on but are important
to technology but they are inf

00:35:04.035 --> 00:35:08.173
act critically important to
tachnology and require a deeper

00:35:08.173 --> 00:35:12.611
understanding on technology, so
data security, exploit controls,

00:35:12.611 --> 00:35:15.447
So we talked about of the
drones. >> Student privacy,

00:35:15.447 --> 00:35:21.219
patents, facial recognition
controls, These are all really

00:35:21.219 --> 00:35:27.225
important tech policy debates.
The FTC applies as role on them.

00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:33.798
And so do alot of other govt
agencies, and so is Congress and

00:35:33.798 --> 00:35:37.469
we are here to make a plug for
you to bring your technical

00:35:37.469 --> 00:35:41.740
knowhow into that debate and we
think having technologist at the

00:35:41.740 --> 00:35:44.643
table and is absolutely vital.
>> and so this is call of duty,

00:35:44.643 --> 00:35:48.847
and this is fun, but this is
another call of duty,this is

00:35:48.847 --> 00:35:52.951
actually alot more fun, turning
a bunch of high powered policy

00:35:52.951 --> 00:35:55.487
makers, taht their understanding
that world is completely wrong,

00:35:55.487 --> 00:35:59.224
is really great actually ive
donr it a few times. but its

00:35:59.224 --> 00:36:03.895
also critical. So otherwise if
we are not engage in these

00:36:03.895 --> 00:36:07.665
debates if we are not trying to
enforce and what the policy

00:36:07.665 --> 00:36:13.772
impact of the laws that will be
propose. Then people that dont

00:36:13.772 --> 00:36:18.176
have any technical background or
brag about the fact they don't

00:36:18.176 --> 00:36:22.080
use e-mail or have a flip phone.
in congress there a flip phonem

00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:24.783
and i dont wanna pick on
particular members But there are

00:36:24.783 --> 00:36:27.152
people that say we dont need to
know about technology that we

00:36:27.152 --> 00:36:29.621
make the right law, we think the
internet should work like this

00:36:29.621 --> 00:36:32.557
and we think technology should
work like this. And if we don't

00:36:32.557 --> 00:36:35.894
engage ask enforce this debate,
other people that make that laws

00:36:35.894 --> 00:36:41.866
that affect us without any
understanding of the underlying

00:36:41.866 --> 00:36:47.472
technical impact. And so. >> So
I may take raise, in case you

00:36:47.472 --> 00:36:52.043
missed it, we need your help.
Your work has a lot has allot of

00:36:52.043 --> 00:36:57.048
impact on what we do. we want
you to come and help us, weve

00:36:57.048 --> 00:37:01.019
been talking about some of the
formal ways to engage, but i

00:37:01.019 --> 00:37:03.588
also wanna make a plug in for
whats coming in for having a

00:37:03.588 --> 00:37:07.292
brown bag and talking to us
about your research, we do that

00:37:07.292 --> 00:37:11.062
regular at the FTC and is really
helpful. >> So if you want to

00:37:11.062 --> 00:37:14.299
contact us, FTC dot net is my
blog. -- If you have coming

00:37:14.299 --> 00:37:20.305
to DC and want to give a
presentation shoot me a line.

00:37:27.212 --> 00:37:30.348
Check out the office of
technology research, OTRI we are

00:37:30.348 --> 00:37:36.354
hiring we are trying to bring in
white hat research and research

00:37:39.190 --> 00:37:43.561
coordinators people to do server
as much in house, office of

00:37:43.561 --> 00:37:46.798
technology research. So e-mail
me or check out the USA job

00:37:46.798 --> 00:37:49.634
posting under FTC. Horrible web
site so you might just want to

00:37:49.634 --> 00:37:55.640
e-mail me. So you can come work,
I want to argue is not the most

00:37:58.109 --> 00:38:01.446
glamorous job but is a bunch of
constraints but again its tour

00:38:01.446 --> 00:38:06.351
of duty just 1 or 2 year and
help work on some of these issue

00:38:06.351 --> 00:38:09.454
and help do research and yo get
to work on really fun stuff. You

00:38:09.454 --> 00:38:14.459
can poke apart on any technology
and make policy recommendations

00:38:14.459 --> 00:38:16.761
in addition to poking up pipes,
you can actually suggest that,

00:38:16.761 --> 00:38:18.763
you know what this is how things
should work, you can make

00:38:18.763 --> 00:38:21.566
suggestion of how to make
policies and how companies

00:38:21.566 --> 00:38:27.906
should implement or just ideas.
You can create solutions to

00:38:27.906 --> 00:38:31.743
these problems. Is really fun.
Even though its govt and your

00:38:31.743 --> 00:38:33.745
friends will make fun of you.
and call you a fed >>.so that

00:38:33.745 --> 00:38:39.450
sour talk, So we have few
minutes for question. im happy

00:38:39.450 --> 00:38:43.755
to take questions. im also happy
to talk about a few tricks on

00:38:43.755 --> 00:38:48.092
what I found regard to
policymakers so is not always, I

00:38:48.092 --> 00:38:55.300
think is lot of it is being able
to communicate things. Not that

00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:59.504
we adopt do a good job on. But
engage policymakers so I'm

00:38:59.504 --> 00:39:05.443
happy. There is going to be a
mic if anybody has a question.

00:39:07.812 --> 00:39:13.818
So right here, fourth row. >>
Thank you for coming. One thing

00:39:20.558 --> 00:39:26.564
in blocks in consumer practices
is how demonster privacy harm --

00:39:29.434 --> 00:39:32.136
where is in the enforcement
action the commission doesn't

00:39:32.136 --> 00:39:34.973
have though show harm to the
consumer. I was wonder if you

00:39:34.973 --> 00:39:37.809
can talk to them to actually
show arm to themselves. >> This

00:39:37.809 --> 00:39:40.445
is a really important question.
We continue to use our authority

00:39:40.445 --> 00:39:43.514
to try to make promise policy
that is being made adhere to. We

00:39:43.514 --> 00:39:46.284
really look at the kinds of
information that are expose and

00:39:46.284 --> 00:39:52.290
data security cases and look
very carefully at the proms and

00:40:18.549 --> 00:40:22.020
commits that were made and
whether they were adhere to

00:40:22.020 --> 00:40:28.026
railroad people were misled. >>
There is current some -- to

00:40:32.130 --> 00:40:38.069
provide those laws but a right
now. A lot of the issues --

00:40:38.069 --> 00:40:42.273
clearly and consumers
understand. With the exception

00:40:42.273 --> 00:40:46.411
if you with demonstrate farm
they get to -- harm -- they get

00:40:46.411 --> 00:40:52.684
to do that and that might change
over time as peoples

00:40:52.684 --> 00:40:54.953
understanding and is impact.
Changes but right now you know a

00:40:54.953 --> 00:41:00.525
lot of our authority is face on
unfair and deceive which we are

00:41:00.525 --> 00:41:05.330
trying to use to protect
consumers but the laws are

00:41:05.330 --> 00:41:11.336
different than they are in
Europe for example. >> What

00:41:15.306 --> 00:41:20.345
happens to the companies when
they are found in violation? >>

00:41:20.345 --> 00:41:26.017
We general consent order to have
the company under 20 year order.

00:41:26.017 --> 00:41:32.657
They contain these two years --
so as a part of that process --

00:41:32.657 --> 00:41:38.496
we can hold them and have
actually done that. >> And we

00:41:38.496 --> 00:41:40.898
can say stop doing that that's
bad or find them as well

00:41:40.898 --> 00:41:46.904
depending on the type of issues.
We can say if -- people that

00:41:52.744 --> 00:41:58.816
scam your grandmother out of her
saving we go after those

00:41:58.816 --> 00:42:04.756
companies and shut them down. >>
We can get consumers money back.

00:42:08.860 --> 00:42:14.866
So in our cramming cases for
example in justice for kids we

00:42:19.470 --> 00:42:24.609
are misleading we got hundreds
and millions of dollar for

00:42:24.609 --> 00:42:28.613
consumer that goes back to the
consumer as redress which means

00:42:28.613 --> 00:42:34.619
in the mail with a check. >> Can
you detail the process of what

00:42:43.394 --> 00:42:46.531
happens when a tech policy law
comes in like the TTP CISA. When

00:42:46.531 --> 00:42:52.537
a policymaker is more lead how
are they getting that technical

00:42:55.173 --> 00:43:01.112
information -- Congress really
CS and in. >> Oftentimes this

00:43:03.714 --> 00:43:09.720
goes into some of the points I
made. They don't know when they

00:43:25.770 --> 00:43:29.140
don't know and they don't care
and even though these are

00:43:29.140 --> 00:43:33.244
important issues. So we are
starving children and whatever

00:43:33.244 --> 00:43:39.250
else. So to make this stuff kind
of tractable or important you

00:43:42.153 --> 00:43:45.156
can highlight those critical
points and you have to make sure

00:43:45.156 --> 00:43:53.064
the point is being made. People
have demonstrate that it is in

00:43:53.064 --> 00:43:57.235
fact an issue and people have to
concern audio safety. And so. >>

00:43:57.235 --> 00:44:03.174
Can I jump in as a nontechnical
policymaker? I think when you

00:44:05.243 --> 00:44:11.249
are talking to us med fore
matter, pictures are good. So

00:44:16.487 --> 00:44:22.426
have you back up a little bit
and sort of speak plain English,

00:44:22.426 --> 00:44:29.367
use picture and diagram and try
make real right at the beginning

00:44:29.367 --> 00:44:33.671
and then get technical. >> So
don't assume that your -- knows

00:44:33.671 --> 00:44:37.308
what the hell are you talking
ability. In the same you guys

00:44:37.308 --> 00:44:40.411
saw those a -- don assume the
people are you talking to know

00:44:40.411 --> 00:44:46.417
what this is. You have to find
always back and go forward. >>

00:44:55.226 --> 00:45:01.165
And don't make us feel dumb for
not knowing. >> Metaphors are

00:45:04.902 --> 00:45:08.739
really powerful tools. You with
help someone understanding the

00:45:08.739 --> 00:45:14.879
concept but it has to be intact
so as you say is more like a

00:45:14.879 --> 00:45:20.251
phone call then a postal mail,
as you start if the thing is

00:45:20.251 --> 00:45:25.489
going forward then maybe is not
like a phone call maybe is caps

00:45:25.489 --> 00:45:30.328
so you have pick a med fore
that's maintains but it helps

00:45:30.328 --> 00:45:36.000
allot to do homework on what the
law is on the previous med fore.

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:40.738
So there is a law regarding
phone call and wiretapping so if

00:45:40.738 --> 00:45:45.543
you understand those laws you
can use the med fore in a way

00:45:45.543 --> 00:45:49.380
that -- I have den -- realize
that again people have limited

00:45:49.380 --> 00:45:53.484
time. What the turning point
that this decision hedges on.

00:45:53.484 --> 00:45:57.955
First focus on that just that
piece and then expand because

00:45:57.955 --> 00:46:02.293
you need to hit home with the
one piece otherwise you'll -- a

00:46:02.293 --> 00:46:08.299
lot of what happen there and I
feel bad because we con --

00:46:35.059 --> 00:46:41.065
technical conversation. For
saying some wrong so is a lot of

00:46:57.415 --> 00:47:02.186
this communities work to say,
these are important issues, here

00:47:02.186 --> 00:47:05.790
I'll help you understand. You
are not dumb for understanding.

00:47:05.790 --> 00:47:11.796
Just as the same way are you not
dumb for not understanding. So

00:47:15.633 --> 00:47:17.868
we have to talk same level of
respect in people. >> Hi. I

00:47:17.868 --> 00:47:23.874
wanted to take this personal
attract. But I -- for

00:47:25.910 --> 00:47:31.916
disclosure. I assume that you
were you know going through --

00:47:35.319 --> 00:47:41.325
when you receive your FCFDC so
however -- Terrel. As a

00:47:47.398 --> 00:47:51.836
commissioner you are -- right?
So at least you have a perceived

00:47:51.836 --> 00:47:57.842
alliance that would allow you
that people would think you

00:48:01.345 --> 00:48:03.347
would make decision.
Prioritizing what to investigate

00:48:03.347 --> 00:48:05.349
and so forth based on whoever
appointed you. Even Ashkan --

00:48:05.349 --> 00:48:07.351
opinions that you don't fully
agree where you want to take. >>

00:48:07.351 --> 00:48:13.357
Whether I'm going to fire
Ashkan? Not just to be clear. So

00:48:30.408 --> 00:48:36.647
I think the point is really cool
one actually because you're

00:48:36.647 --> 00:48:43.287
talking about a little bit how
our government works which is

00:48:43.287 --> 00:48:49.360
that people who are politics
hacks. Well. People who have

00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:54.398
politic are deeply engaged in
making very important policy

00:48:54.398 --> 00:49:00.471
choices. And hopefully we have
using experts to help us do

00:49:00.471 --> 00:49:04.408
that. I'm definitely politic I'm
appointed by president Obama. --

00:49:04.408 --> 00:49:10.414
2 republicans, 2 democrats and
chair who appointed by - so

00:49:13.384 --> 00:49:17.788
there's no question there is a
divide there -- that's politic

00:49:17.788 --> 00:49:20.090
and part son and that does
reflect. We don't always agree.

00:49:20.090 --> 00:49:26.096
For example 2 of agree and 3 of
us don't and we try to explain

00:49:30.034 --> 00:49:33.771
where the differences are but
all of us are really committed.

00:49:33.771 --> 00:49:35.873
Also we use economic expert,
technical experts -- jump in,

00:49:35.873 --> 00:49:42.947
this is actually so there is
politic agenda and this is how

00:49:42.947 --> 00:49:48.953
government works. You cannot
under estimate the power of

00:49:52.990 --> 00:49:58.996
proof. >> If you can use signs
to prove a point. Then the

00:50:02.700 --> 00:50:05.870
politicians or the people with
an agenda have to ignore you but

00:50:05.870 --> 00:50:12.042
height lighting -- of the world
-- even if a state of the

00:50:12.042 --> 00:50:18.048
security. Like nobodies want to
get pop in Congress that's the

00:50:22.353 --> 00:50:28.392
worst thing for them. So you
might find by highlighting and

00:50:28.392 --> 00:50:30.728
working with the press or people
to highlight you can cut through

00:50:30.728 --> 00:50:34.465
that politic pull shit. >>
That's our time. >> Thank you

00:50:34.465 --> 00:50:40.471
for coming out and getting up
early [ APPLAUSE ]
