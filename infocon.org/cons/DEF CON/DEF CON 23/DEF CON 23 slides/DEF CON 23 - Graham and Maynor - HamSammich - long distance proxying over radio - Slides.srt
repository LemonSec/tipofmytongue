00:00:00.634 --> 00:00:05.172
This talk is the ham sandwich
talk. It's a replacement talk.

00:00:05.172 --> 00:00:08.308
So if you look in your guide, in
the paper guide, we're replacing

00:00:08.308 --> 00:00:13.814
a talk that was canceled. What
we're really replacing is a talk

00:00:13.814 --> 00:00:19.820
that was in the press about two
weeks ago. And that it was a big

00:00:22.356 --> 00:00:25.325
-- kind of a big deal that
people thought that maybe

00:00:25.325 --> 00:00:28.929
somebody else's talk was
canceled. We're really a

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:34.935
replacement for that talk. So we
are two researchers, Dave Meiner

00:00:40.507 --> 00:00:45.379
and Robert Grahan and we have
been doing a lot of SDR things,

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:49.883
that is software definable
radio. But what it really is is

00:00:49.883 --> 00:00:54.655
hacking of the internet of
things. Lots of stuff these

00:00:54.655 --> 00:01:00.794
days, your car, your phone, your
gun, all these things connect to

00:01:00.794 --> 00:01:05.933
the internet over radio waves.
So a big deal these days is

00:01:05.933 --> 00:01:09.903
learning how to use computers
and software definable radio in

00:01:09.903 --> 00:01:16.109
order to hack everything that
talks radio. So I'm Robert

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:20.113
Graham, I do a lot of blogging
and Twitter. I'm famous for a

00:01:20.113 --> 00:01:25.986
couple of things like black ice,
flak Jacking and I do lots of

00:01:25.986 --> 00:01:29.957
conference talks. My partner
here is Dave Meiner. He is also

00:01:29.957 --> 00:01:33.627
notorious for the apple hack
from several years ago, some DA

00:01:33.627 --> 00:01:39.433
hacks and he is one of the
awesomest pen testers in the

00:01:39.433 --> 00:01:42.636
world. And he also has done lots
of conference talks and we've

00:01:42.636 --> 00:01:48.208
done many of our talks together.
He'll be setting up the demo

00:01:48.208 --> 00:01:51.745
here if he can get it to work.
We only have a 20-minute slot

00:01:51.745 --> 00:01:57.751
here so we don't have much time.
The talk that we're replacing is

00:01:57.751 --> 00:02:05.625
this proxy ham talk where a guy
put together two boxes in order

00:02:05.625 --> 00:02:10.197
to create a point to point link
with the idea that one might be

00:02:10.197 --> 00:02:16.803
in some place next to a bar or a
Starbucks with an open wifi and

00:02:16.803 --> 00:02:20.707
the other box would be up on a
hill somewhere with your laptop.

00:02:20.707 --> 00:02:24.945
So as a hacker you could be five
miles away from the bar and

00:02:24.945 --> 00:02:28.348
using their wifi and when they
track back the IP address of the

00:02:28.348 --> 00:02:35.722
hacker they wouldn't be able to
find the real hacker. This talk,

00:02:35.722 --> 00:02:41.028
that talk was canceled under
suspicious circumstances. There

00:02:41.028 --> 00:02:48.735
was suspicion it was the FBI or
the government tried to suppress

00:02:48.735 --> 00:02:54.074
the talk. And that was sort of
our motivation for talking about

00:02:54.074 --> 00:02:58.011
this. There was things like NSL,
national security letters that

00:02:58.011 --> 00:03:00.881
have quieted people and
suppressed things. There's been

00:03:00.881 --> 00:03:04.317
lawsuits and lots of things in
our industry that try to

00:03:04.317 --> 00:03:10.323
suppress research. So this was
our philosophy. This really

00:03:16.797 --> 00:03:19.800
should be the philosophy of
DEFCON. When we see a talk has

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.402
been canceled and it really
isn't in the area of our own

00:03:22.402 --> 00:03:26.873
expertise, or something we've
been researching lately, people

00:03:26.873 --> 00:03:29.576
ought to step up and say I can
do something similar to that.

00:03:29.576 --> 00:03:33.513
That rapid transit thing from --
when that was canceled. There

00:03:33.513 --> 00:03:38.285
are other people that do
research along those same lines

00:03:38.285 --> 00:03:43.056
from my fair car hacking for
example. So when we see a talk

00:03:43.056 --> 00:03:45.659
that's been canceled, people
ought to step up and say, hey, I

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:51.698
can do something similar.
However, what we found was this

00:03:51.698 --> 00:03:54.067
talk in particular though wasn't
so dramatic. We don't know why

00:03:54.067 --> 00:04:00.006
the talk was canceled. The proxy
ham talk was canceled. But we

00:04:02.375 --> 00:04:06.713
guess that the agency that was
involved was probably the FCC

00:04:06.713 --> 00:04:14.221
rather than the NSA or the FBI.
If you see here -- we'll get to

00:04:14.221 --> 00:04:18.425
that in the next picture. What
he probably did was boosted the

00:04:18.425 --> 00:04:24.131
transmit power and the FCC is a
very prickly agency. They have

00:04:24.131 --> 00:04:28.001
people staffed at every major
city in the United States whose

00:04:28.001 --> 00:04:31.404
sole job it is is to hunt down
people that transmit power,

00:04:31.404 --> 00:04:37.043
radio frequencies at too high a
power. Or who interfere with

00:04:37.043 --> 00:04:41.882
other stuff. So we suspect what
happened is that the FCC caught

00:04:41.882 --> 00:04:45.418
him, they came to his door and
they probably gave him a letter

00:04:45.418 --> 00:04:48.221
and this is what the FCC does.
The big thing they do is they

00:04:48.221 --> 00:04:52.859
don't want to prosecute people,
they don't want to hurt people.

00:04:52.859 --> 00:04:58.265
But they do want people to stop
causing the interference. So one

00:04:58.265 --> 00:05:00.534
thing they do have is a consent
decree which is to say, you sign

00:05:00.534 --> 00:05:06.873
here and agree that you won't do
this stuff anymore ever again

00:05:06.873 --> 00:05:09.843
and then we'll let you off with
a small fine or ignore the

00:05:09.843 --> 00:05:14.181
situation. Also I'm guessing
that the real reason this guy

00:05:14.181 --> 00:05:18.318
was quiet is because his lawyer
said, hey, if there is a legal

00:05:18.318 --> 00:05:20.987
situation the first thing your
lawyer is going to tell you is

00:05:20.987 --> 00:05:25.091
to shut up and stop talking
about it. So it's probably

00:05:25.091 --> 00:05:28.929
something simple like the FCC
coming down on him rather than

00:05:28.929 --> 00:05:34.935
the FBI trying to stop hackers
or something like that. So this

00:05:37.304 --> 00:05:42.275
was the picture from the Wired
article. From Wired magazine.

00:05:42.275 --> 00:05:45.912
What we see from here is he is
using standard off the shelf

00:05:45.912 --> 00:05:50.517
equipment. This device has a
yogi antenna for the directional

00:05:50.517 --> 00:05:56.289
antenna and you see this white
box on the back of the antenna.

00:05:56.289 --> 00:05:59.459
Well that's just a Ubiquity
device. Ubiquity is a company

00:05:59.459 --> 00:06:02.128
that cells point to point
internet links. This is a

00:06:02.128 --> 00:06:05.332
picture from their website. If
you look at it, it's essentially

00:06:05.332 --> 00:06:09.669
the same thing. It's just a
little box plugged into the back

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:14.874
of a Yogi antenna. So -- >> This
is a great lesson actually for

00:06:14.874 --> 00:06:20.213
all of the kind of security
types you see. A lot of times

00:06:20.213 --> 00:06:23.984
when people do press ahead of
time, they give away enough

00:06:23.984 --> 00:06:26.186
details that you should be able
to reproduce what they're doing.

00:06:26.186 --> 00:06:30.590
Like in this example, all it
took was Googling for Yogis and

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:35.428
900 megahertz to find the
Ubiquity device he was using in

00:06:35.428 --> 00:06:40.200
the photo. >> Yes. As Dave said
from the press we can often tell

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:45.972
what the talk is about. We went
online and bought the same sorts

00:06:45.972 --> 00:06:50.443
of devices from Ubiquity. The
rocket end that he was using was

00:06:50.443 --> 00:06:54.881
a little more expensive and
required an external antenna and

00:06:54.881 --> 00:07:01.154
I'm cheap and I bought the
cheaper units. I'm going to see

00:07:01.154 --> 00:07:04.224
if this goes here. We bought the
units -- so you can see these

00:07:04.224 --> 00:07:10.230
units. I'm going to pull them
out of my bag here. I probably

00:07:16.736 --> 00:07:19.506
should have brought them out
when I was waiting? >> While Rob

00:07:19.506 --> 00:07:23.877
is doing this, the basic premise
of our theory is is that the

00:07:23.877 --> 00:07:28.214
original researcher assumed that
because the ubiquity would give

00:07:28.214 --> 00:07:30.884
us point to point connection
over 900 megahertz instead of

00:07:30.884 --> 00:07:33.853
2.4 gig hertz, it would somehow
provide an additional layer of

00:07:33.853 --> 00:07:36.823
obfuscation that would make it
hard finding the signal and the

00:07:36.823 --> 00:07:40.327
source. That is really what our
talk is all about. So you can

00:07:40.327 --> 00:07:43.530
buy these Ubiquity devices on
E-bay for $125. Not much at all.

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:47.233
You have to get two of them,
though. So 900 megahertz if you

00:07:47.233 --> 00:07:53.239
don't know, it's an ISM band by
2.4 or 5.8. It can do longer

00:08:07.187 --> 00:08:09.956
distances because the wavelength
is longer and penetrates things

00:08:09.956 --> 00:08:12.859
better. They can go through
buildings and trees. As an

00:08:12.859 --> 00:08:16.096
interesting note because of the
demo we're going to do, I ended

00:08:16.096 --> 00:08:20.967
up getting my amateur radio
exam, my ham radio license just

00:08:20.967 --> 00:08:25.271
so we could do this demo.
...(applause)... I didn't want

00:08:25.271 --> 00:08:29.576
to brag but I knocked the
technical and general and extra

00:08:29.576 --> 00:08:35.415
out in one sitting. >> So Dave
actually cheated. I say cheated.

00:08:35.415 --> 00:08:37.784
He had actually been studying
for the exam for like two years.

00:08:37.784 --> 00:08:41.955
So he didn't really just go up
there and just do the test. He's

00:08:41.955 --> 00:08:46.960
been studying for it. >> Rob, in
reality I just learned how to

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:50.196
use SDRs and only stuff I really
had to study for was the

00:08:50.196 --> 00:08:54.234
procedures. So 900 megahertz
band and these are the devices

00:08:54.234 --> 00:09:00.740
right here that Rob has. >> I
didn't really want to set them

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:02.742
up in the hotel because they
really cause a lot of

00:09:02.742 --> 00:09:07.914
interference. But they're just
two boxes and as I -- as you see

00:09:07.914 --> 00:09:14.487
in the previous picture, you
just set them up and what the

00:09:14.487 --> 00:09:18.024
connection is, is on the
left-hand side you see one of

00:09:18.024 --> 00:09:24.030
these bridges connected to a
little wifi device. Almost every

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:27.467
wifi access point can act as a
wireless bridge or a wireless

00:09:27.467 --> 00:09:32.572
client. So you go to a bar or a
Starbucks and find some power

00:09:32.572 --> 00:09:36.209
outlet outside or bring a
battery pack. And you can

00:09:36.209 --> 00:09:39.512
configure a little wifi access
point to connect and log onto

00:09:39.512 --> 00:09:42.449
the wifi at Starbucks. And then
you connect that access point to

00:09:42.449 --> 00:09:48.455
the 900 megahertz bridge and
point it five miles up a hill

00:09:54.661 --> 00:09:58.998
where you can see line of sight
with the hill. Up on the hill

00:09:58.998 --> 00:10:02.569
you sit there with your laptop
and the other bridge pointed

00:10:02.569 --> 00:10:07.107
back down towards the Starbucks
at your other device. And then

00:10:07.107 --> 00:10:10.677
you can log on remotely from
really, really far away. I used

00:10:10.677 --> 00:10:14.547
to live in the Bay area where
you had the hills up between the

00:10:14.547 --> 00:10:18.251
hills and the Bay area they had
views over almost the entire Bay

00:10:18.251 --> 00:10:24.257
area. This would really go
really, really far. So yeah, the

00:10:28.928 --> 00:10:32.932
reason by the way that you use
900 megahertz is it goes farther

00:10:32.932 --> 00:10:39.839
than 2.4 megahertz. >> Do we
have time? >> We have time. By

00:10:39.839 --> 00:10:43.510
the way these boxes though,
they're still just wifi boxes.

00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:47.647
One of the critical features of
this proxy ham thing is whether

00:10:47.647 --> 00:10:51.484
it's an encrypted connection.
And it is. It's just using WPA2.

00:10:51.484 --> 00:10:55.755
The configuration of the boxes
is the same as the wifi access

00:10:55.755 --> 00:10:59.025
point. And when we pull them
apart, we see if they're using

00:10:59.025 --> 00:11:02.128
the same or if there is tip set
(ph.). The only thing different

00:11:02.128 --> 00:11:06.533
between these and a 2.4 gig
hertz wifi device is they have a

00:11:06.533 --> 00:11:09.569
little converter on it that
converts the signal, the whole

00:11:09.569 --> 00:11:14.574
block of that range from 2.4 gig
hertz down to 900 megahertz.

00:11:14.574 --> 00:11:17.677
That's why they're more
expensive. Ubiquity sells the

00:11:17.677 --> 00:11:21.581
identical devices that run at
2.4 gigahertz but that's really

00:11:21.581 --> 00:11:27.587
the only difference. These boxes
come with a flat panel antenna.

00:11:27.587 --> 00:11:31.524
So when the flat side faces you,
that's the directional antenna.

00:11:31.524 --> 00:11:38.131
And this is the shape of the
communications. So directional

00:11:38.131 --> 00:11:42.101
antenna means less radio
frequencies on the side and

00:11:42.101 --> 00:11:45.538
behind and more out front. That
is why they're directional and

00:11:45.538 --> 00:11:48.374
you point them at each other.
You have two directional

00:11:48.374 --> 00:11:55.048
antennas pointing at each other
that improves the signal. So at

00:11:55.048 --> 00:11:59.252
the maximum rate, and I set this
up, I got 22 megabits per second

00:11:59.252 --> 00:12:02.655
download. And I'm not quite sure
if that was the limitation of

00:12:02.655 --> 00:12:07.894
those devices or that little
wifi access point that I was

00:12:07.894 --> 00:12:14.601
using. Is your demo ready? >>
Yes. >> Okay. So this was the

00:12:14.601 --> 00:12:18.004
picture of what -- I set this up
last night in my hotel room. And

00:12:18.004 --> 00:12:24.477
I used an SDR to go look at the
900 megahertz spectrum and to

00:12:24.477 --> 00:12:30.016
see what it looked like. So I
walked out of my hotel room down

00:12:30.016 --> 00:12:34.520
a ways to a bar in order to see
how much of that signal I could

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:38.791
see from pretty far away. So
through many buildings, with

00:12:38.791 --> 00:12:42.862
these devices not even pointed
at me, this was the signal that

00:12:42.862 --> 00:12:45.164
I got. And what you can see
slightly to the right is that

00:12:45.164 --> 00:12:50.436
bump. And that bump is a very
obvious 900 megahertz signal.

00:12:50.436 --> 00:12:54.040
Even with concrete buildings in
the way I can still see this is

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:58.945
very visible. That's the problem
with the proxy ham concept. Is

00:12:58.945 --> 00:13:03.182
that I think the orangal talk
believed that 900 megahertz that

00:13:03.182 --> 00:13:07.220
no one was watching but in fact
we are watching. We actually can

00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:10.823
see the signal and it's very
easy to track the signal back to

00:13:10.823 --> 00:13:15.628
its location. The FCC has banned
in every city all the equipment

00:13:15.628 --> 00:13:18.164
that is necessary to point the
antennas, do the directional

00:13:18.164 --> 00:13:21.034
finding, and go some place,
stop, scan, go some place else,

00:13:21.034 --> 00:13:25.271
stop, scan. Triangulate and they
will find you really, really

00:13:25.271 --> 00:13:28.675
quickly. You think you're nice
and secrete and point to point

00:13:28.675 --> 00:13:33.312
and no one can see you, they see
you very quickly. So what we've

00:13:33.312 --> 00:13:37.050
done, what Dave set up here is
an alternative using the SDRs.

00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:41.254
They're more expensive and
they're going to be slower. And

00:13:41.254 --> 00:13:43.489
by the way when I post this
presentation online, here are

00:13:43.489 --> 00:13:48.194
some links to other people doing
similar things. What our

00:13:48.194 --> 00:13:53.399
technique is, is in our case is
to hide the -- that point to

00:13:53.399 --> 00:13:57.670
point link below what is called
the noise floor. Another way to

00:13:57.670 --> 00:14:03.309
think of it is a negative signal
to noise ratio. And what the

00:14:03.309 --> 00:14:07.947
noise, what the noise floor is,
is like the radio static you

00:14:07.947 --> 00:14:12.018
hear on an FM radio. It's the
background noise that comes from

00:14:12.018 --> 00:14:15.188
the atmosphere, from lightening
storms, from manmade objects,

00:14:15.188 --> 00:14:19.125
bad antennas. There's a dark
line on this picture here,

00:14:19.125 --> 00:14:23.096
that's where I unplugged my
laptop from the power and

00:14:23.096 --> 00:14:29.102
plugged it back in. Unplugging
it reduced the noise floor. So

00:14:31.804 --> 00:14:35.842
in theory anything below the
noise floor you can never catch.

00:14:35.842 --> 00:14:38.878
You can never have a radio
signal that will work. In

00:14:38.878 --> 00:14:42.882
practice it does. If you tune to
FM radio station with an SDR you

00:14:42.882 --> 00:14:46.586
see that, you can find FM radio
stations by hearing the music

00:14:46.586 --> 00:14:49.388
that as far as the SDR is
concerned doesn't exist. There

00:14:49.388 --> 00:14:54.427
is nothing above that noise
floor. So conceptually what

00:14:54.427 --> 00:14:59.499
we're doing is, our technique,
instead of building up a strong

00:14:59.499 --> 00:15:02.068
signal that jumps above the
noise floor as you saw that bump

00:15:02.068 --> 00:15:07.006
before in the graph, what we're
going to do instead is do lots

00:15:07.006 --> 00:15:11.210
of little channels all below the
noise floor, all co-opterring to

00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:14.914
amply fie our signal but still
hide behind the waves like a

00:15:14.914 --> 00:15:19.519
little submarine thing. By the
way I tried to draw this with

00:15:19.519 --> 00:15:22.789
PowerPoint, I just gave up and
just hand drew it and took a

00:15:22.789 --> 00:15:29.929
picture. So the problem with
this is that it's going to be

00:15:29.929 --> 00:15:37.270
slower speed. We have time. We
have 7 minutes. The advantage of

00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:44.610
this is undetectability. If they
knew exactly what we were doing

00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:50.817
they could find us. But in all
probability they can't detect

00:15:50.817 --> 00:15:56.789
that any signal exists. So I'll
let David continue with this and

00:15:56.789 --> 00:16:01.661
then go onto the demo. >> So as
a young man I used to look at

00:16:01.661 --> 00:16:07.667
the moon and I would dream. What
would it be like to touch the

00:16:10.469 --> 00:16:14.707
moon? Since I can't become an
astronaut after getting my ham

00:16:14.707 --> 00:16:19.846
radio stuff, I learned there's a
thing called an earth moon

00:16:19.846 --> 00:16:23.015
bounce or an EMB. It's basically
how you bounce the radio off the

00:16:23.015 --> 00:16:26.319
moon. You use a protocol called
the JT65A. This is designed to

00:16:26.319 --> 00:16:31.791
work with a lot of noise in
between. It's great for our

00:16:31.791 --> 00:16:35.428
purposes. Because that's
basically what we're doing. It

00:16:35.428 --> 00:16:38.998
was really limited to the amount
of data it can transfer. So

00:16:38.998 --> 00:16:43.469
instead of using basically one
carrier, we multiplex it over

00:16:43.469 --> 00:16:48.040
several different versions of
JT65. This is our demo. Hold on

00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:53.112
a second. Any questions so far,
comments, suggestions? >>

00:16:53.112 --> 00:16:59.118
(inaudible). >> We have done
about 20-miles. Once again,

00:17:03.890 --> 00:17:07.527
we're going to show you
something really interesting. >>

00:17:07.527 --> 00:17:13.532
(inaudible). >> Well one would
be less than -- basically less

00:17:16.769 --> 00:17:22.775
than around two bod. But with
multiple, we can get up to 56K.

00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:34.654
>> So the limitation is having
lots of SDRs, you can increase

00:17:34.654 --> 00:17:40.960
the speed. One of the problems
is that signal strength is

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:45.598
logarithmic or exponential. That
means you don't really see on

00:17:45.598 --> 00:17:49.235
the graphs very easily, that's
the easiest way to increase the

00:17:49.235 --> 00:17:54.273
speed is massively increasing
the power. It's really easy. But

00:17:54.273 --> 00:17:57.643
we're going length wise and
that's linear. So the faster you

00:17:57.643 --> 00:18:02.882
want to go, you need more SDRs
and faster SDRs. >> So this is

00:18:02.882 --> 00:18:08.020
kind of what the signal would
look like if it was being

00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:11.791
broadcast over 900 megahertz
using the Ubiquity gear using a

00:18:11.791 --> 00:18:16.362
2 megahertz channel. As you can
see if you're looking at that

00:18:16.362 --> 00:18:20.933
and you have any clue what
you're doing, you're not hiding

00:18:20.933 --> 00:18:26.939
from anything. That's one hell
of a spike. Right? So what we

00:18:32.278 --> 00:18:39.652
did don't look at my password.
>> So what Dave is doing here is

00:18:39.652 --> 00:18:43.856
we're using one laptop because
mine I couldn't get working with

00:18:43.856 --> 00:18:47.727
the video. He is going to use a
VM to do the transmit. He is

00:18:47.727 --> 00:18:54.000
actually going to transmit his
signal and use the other to

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.770
receive on the graph like this
to see what the signal looks

00:18:57.770 --> 00:19:03.709
like. And now he seems to have
broken it. He had 20 minutes and

00:19:13.486 --> 00:19:19.492
he told me to hurry. >> Somebody
in the audience is, jamming us.

00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:30.336
That is always funny. We really
appreciate that. Who wants demos

00:19:30.336 --> 00:19:33.939
to go right the first time? You
don't go to NASCAR races to see

00:19:33.939 --> 00:19:36.676
the completion of the race, you
go to see the carnies right.

00:19:39.211 --> 00:19:42.381
This is what it looks like
normally. If you look at the

00:19:42.381 --> 00:19:48.654
graph at the bottom, that is the
signal. You can see over on the

00:19:48.654 --> 00:19:52.892
left-hand side the DB, you can
see the peak, where the signal

00:19:52.892 --> 00:19:58.898
is rising. This is over time,
right. So with the other one --

00:20:02.968 --> 00:20:10.409
where did it go? >> While he
figures this out. We just put

00:20:10.409 --> 00:20:17.249
this together with the new radio
which is the standard tool kit

00:20:17.249 --> 00:20:23.956
for SDRs that everyone uses. >>
This is the same spectrum. This

00:20:23.956 --> 00:20:27.727
is actually us transmitting. If
you look you'll see there is a

00:20:27.727 --> 00:20:33.899
much wider and lower profile for
the signal. That is because the

00:20:33.899 --> 00:20:38.471
JT65A modulators, there's
currently 1 --> 000 of them running

00:20:38.471 --> 00:20:42.908
when we recorded this. Basically
multiplexing all the data across

00:20:42.908 --> 00:20:48.914
a little over 2 megahertz to get
a 56K signal which may seem

00:20:52.751 --> 00:20:57.556
strange, but you can be easily
located by standard direction

00:20:57.556 --> 00:21:03.496
finding gear. With that being
said, people that have nation

00:21:08.334 --> 00:21:11.103
state assets can easily find you
with this. But not a person with

00:21:11.103 --> 00:21:14.707
a $20 SDR. >> What's that spike
we see to the left? >> The spy?

00:21:14.707 --> 00:21:21.113
>> The spike. >> Here. >> Yes.
>> This is the noise floor. And

00:21:21.113 --> 00:21:26.252
this is -- we recorded what's
under it. Without the rest,

00:21:26.252 --> 00:21:29.989
we're basically pushing down the
rest of the noise floor. In

00:21:29.989 --> 00:21:34.426
addition to being able to hide
the signal, the thousand or so

00:21:34.426 --> 00:21:38.297
JT65A encoders that are running
actually collectively cause the

00:21:38.297 --> 00:21:43.369
noise floor to raise making it
even harder to find the signal.

00:21:43.369 --> 00:21:47.706
We plan or putting on this code
on GitHub and hopefully one day

00:21:47.706 --> 00:21:51.644
be able to integrate it into a
simple raspberry based solution

00:21:51.644 --> 00:21:57.650
so you can do these types of
things without having much radio

00:22:00.019 --> 00:22:04.290
knowledge. >> Any questions? So
the thing that really made this

00:22:04.290 --> 00:22:08.394
all possible and keep in mind
just for a recap, the proxy ham

00:22:08.394 --> 00:22:13.299
and the proxy gambit, the proxy
gambit still uses a 900

00:22:13.299 --> 00:22:16.735
megahertz connection. But they
also added a cellular device.

00:22:16.735 --> 00:22:20.072
And Sammy said they did that
because you can basically use it

00:22:20.072 --> 00:22:23.809
from anywhere in the world using
the same techniques. Somebody

00:22:23.809 --> 00:22:28.214
could find a -- find your device
with the cellular modem that

00:22:28.214 --> 00:22:33.719
you're using or a point to point
link. At that point your

00:22:33.719 --> 00:22:37.223
identify is kind of blown. That
should be the take away. And

00:22:37.223 --> 00:22:41.894
there are ways to hide yourself.
>> So are there any questions?

00:22:43.896 --> 00:22:46.632
>> Any comments? Any
suggestions? >> Question over

00:22:46.632 --> 00:22:52.137
there. >> (inaudible). >> The
question is, why is this

00:22:52.137 --> 00:22:59.812
illegal? Because the guy was
doing it over the ISM band. We

00:22:59.812 --> 00:23:03.549
don't know the exact details but
we suspect the reason is because

00:23:03.549 --> 00:23:06.385
he boosted the signal. If you
look in the manual for these

00:23:06.385 --> 00:23:12.524
devices or these devices, it
says this is -- this meets these

00:23:12.524 --> 00:23:14.927
requirements for part 15 blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah of the

00:23:14.927 --> 00:23:19.865
FCC regulations but there's an
external antenna here and the

00:23:19.865 --> 00:23:23.202
documentation clearly says if
you add an external antenna you

00:23:23.202 --> 00:23:28.140
must be a licensed person to do
so. Because the regulations

00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:34.713
monitor, regulate how much power
at a certain distance. This is

00:23:34.713 --> 00:23:38.817
directional but still spreads
which means the power is less.

00:23:38.817 --> 00:23:41.820
The more directional you make
it, the more you're likely to

00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:45.624
then exceed those regulations.
That's what we suspect happened

00:23:45.624 --> 00:23:48.794
is that Yogi is just too
powerful, it's beyond the light

00:23:48.794 --> 00:23:53.766
distance operation and you can't
do it? >> Also if you're over

00:23:53.766 --> 00:23:58.937
the power limit, if you're not
operating legally as a low

00:23:58.937 --> 00:24:01.974
powered device but you're over
the regulation, you're not

00:24:01.974 --> 00:24:05.511
supposed to send any encoded or
encrypted data. What he was

00:24:05.511 --> 00:24:11.550
doing was proxying WPA2
encrypted wifi which is against

00:24:11.550 --> 00:24:17.356
FCC radio standards. In our demo
we are not proxying that, we are

00:24:17.356 --> 00:24:22.995
just sending a message that says
send it? >> Was a big question,

00:24:22.995 --> 00:24:25.998
the regulations are complex that
way. >> We have a question over

00:24:25.998 --> 00:24:31.503
here? >> You had said you can
still download data, et cetera,

00:24:31.503 --> 00:24:34.740
et cetera across this line. How
much data would you be able to

00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:40.312
send? >> Up to 56K. Basically
the same as one of the higher

00:24:40.312 --> 00:24:43.982
speed dial-up modems from the
late 90s. >> Okay. I just wanted

00:24:43.982 --> 00:24:47.586
to confirm that. A second
question that I have is if you

00:24:47.586 --> 00:24:50.723
were to have two of these
devices and you're using it on

00:24:50.723 --> 00:24:55.427
your property, does that still
make it illegal? You're still

00:24:55.427 --> 00:24:57.863
going to have the FCC showing up
at your door? You're in the

00:24:57.863 --> 00:25:02.601
neighborhood and you're on a
couple of acres? >> Well the FCC

00:25:02.601 --> 00:25:08.040
controls all the air waves in
the United States, so being on

00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:11.977
your own property doesn't negate
or doesn't stop you have having

00:25:11.977 --> 00:25:19.551
frequency plans. The FCC is very
specific. That although these

00:25:19.551 --> 00:25:22.721
devices are technically
unlicensed, they're only legal

00:25:22.721 --> 00:25:25.591
as long as they're operated in
the correct capacity that does

00:25:25.591 --> 00:25:28.193
not cause interference with
other devices. Once you start

00:25:28.193 --> 00:25:32.097
doing that, you have to stop
your operations. >> In practice

00:25:32.097 --> 00:25:34.900
you probably can. But if
somebody nearby complains of

00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:37.569
interference, whether or not
you're actually the one at

00:25:37.569 --> 00:25:39.972
fault, they will probably see
that you're transmitting at a

00:25:39.972 --> 00:25:42.141
very high power and come and
knock on your door and tell you

00:25:42.141 --> 00:25:44.610
to stop. But you won't have to
pay fines because you didn't

00:25:44.610 --> 00:25:49.882
damage anybody else. Probably.
I'm not here to give legal

00:25:49.882 --> 00:25:54.353
advice so I have no idea. >> We
are not lawyers. >> Question

00:25:54.353 --> 00:26:00.292
over there. I'm sorry I can't
hear that. Something about ...

00:26:05.931 --> 00:26:11.403
whoever was doing it stopped.
This is what it looks like on a

00:26:11.403 --> 00:26:15.774
GQRS. The peaks are minimal but
we have our devices, the one

00:26:15.774 --> 00:26:19.745
that is transmitting and the one
that is receiving very close to

00:26:19.745 --> 00:26:23.682
each other but that is what it
looks like when you're running

00:26:23.682 --> 00:26:26.952
it. Whoever was jamming us,
thank you for stopping. And

00:26:26.952 --> 00:26:30.556
we'll find you. >> We're worse
than the FCCs trust me. >>

00:26:30.556 --> 00:26:37.796
Great, so the big take away here
is we really wanted to prove

00:26:37.796 --> 00:26:41.200
that there was nothing hokey or
hinkey about the talk being

00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:45.204
rejected. We just actually --
not rejected or pulled -- we do

00:26:45.204 --> 00:26:48.874
believe that at some point the
author just decided or learned

00:26:48.874 --> 00:26:52.010
that it was a bad idea and
wasn't providing the level of

00:26:52.010 --> 00:26:57.049
anonymity that they thought
originally. >> That's our talk.

00:26:57.049 --> 00:27:03.388
We'll be heading out. So thank
you very much. >> If you have a

00:27:03.388 --> 00:27:06.892
moment when you're done and
you're leaving, there is a young

00:27:06.892 --> 00:27:10.128
blond woman in the front row
named Sophie Kotch, if you could

00:27:10.128 --> 00:27:13.365
spend a few minutes talking to
her about IOT that would be

00:27:13.365 --> 00:27:15.367
great. Thank you.
...(applause)...
