00:00:00.534 --> 00:00:08.075
hello everybody, welcome to the
EFf panel uuuhhm >> We are the

00:00:08.075 --> 00:00:13.847
EFF or position of EFF who is
here to answer your questions.

00:00:13.847 --> 00:00:20.587
My name is Kurt. I am the deputy
(audio drop) I have been doing

00:00:20.587 --> 00:00:26.827
this for a long time before we
get to your questions we are

00:00:26.827 --> 00:00:32.132
going to giver some brief
overviews. One thing I wanted to

00:00:32.132 --> 00:00:39.339
do is put out ground rule. First
of all, most of you are how many

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:46.079
people are much with the EFF but
as you may know one of things

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.852
that we do we counsel people and
give legal advice to security

00:00:51.852 --> 00:00:55.689
researcher and people from this
community about presentations

00:00:55.689 --> 00:01:00.427
they are having. What is
something that we enjoy doing

00:01:00.427 --> 00:01:05.332
but now is not the time to ask
those questions we want that

00:01:05.332 --> 00:01:08.502
with attorney client privilege.
So if you have questions to your

00:01:08.502 --> 00:01:14.508
situation contact us afterwards
and set up a time to talk to us.

00:01:33.894 --> 00:01:40.233
So let me introduce who we have
here starting my right we have

00:01:40.233 --> 00:01:44.604
Nate staff attorney with EFF and
Corine, legal director and mark

00:01:44.604 --> 00:01:48.875
-- and Cooper who works on
technology projects and Nadia.

00:01:48.875 --> 00:01:52.879
>> So we wanted to do something
different this year for some of

00:01:52.879 --> 00:01:58.885
you have come to panels before
what we have done each of us

00:02:11.231 --> 00:02:17.938
will talk about one or two
things that we work on. But I

00:02:17.938 --> 00:02:24.077
wanted to give a little bit more
I wanted to talk everything that

00:02:24.077 --> 00:02:27.948
we do and I had a interns
prepare the list of everything

00:02:27.948 --> 00:02:31.518
that we do and single spaced it
would have taken me 20 minutes

00:02:31.518 --> 00:02:38.025
the read so I will not do that
so I will give some highlights

00:02:38.025 --> 00:02:44.731
so that you have a little bit
more of appreciation of the

00:02:44.731 --> 00:02:50.737
scale and work that we do.
Seventeen lawyers. So it not a

00:02:58.412 --> 00:03:02.816
big team but in the last year we
have filed more than 15 new

00:03:02.816 --> 00:03:08.822
lawsuits including film maker
Laura -- seeks her detention

00:03:11.858 --> 00:03:18.465
more than 50 times and we
represented a patent controlled

00:03:18.465 --> 00:03:22.235
victim success fully and a first
time we have done a direct

00:03:22.235 --> 00:03:26.907
representation of the context
and we sued DEA twice. We had

00:03:26.907 --> 00:03:28.909
major development in more than a
11 of our ongoing cases about

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:36.650
that ranged from major brief
files to major court arguments.

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:42.656
In the last three years we have
done counseling engagements.

00:03:49.996 --> 00:03:56.002
This year alone we counseled
presenters giving 10 talks at

00:03:58.772 --> 00:04:04.711
the three conferences. And we
filed more than 30A MIC A briefs

00:04:06.947 --> 00:04:13.019
probably something like 50 it
courts all the around the

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:18.492
country ranging from supreme
court to federal circuits to

00:04:18.492 --> 00:04:24.598
state supreme court to local
courts. We testified in state

00:04:24.598 --> 00:04:28.668
local and federal rule makings
and hearings at least eight

00:04:28.668 --> 00:04:36.009
times in the last year. So that
those are the numbers. Fifteen

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:42.182
new suits 10 counseling
engagements -- >> I can talk

00:04:42.182 --> 00:04:48.188
about a few of them because we
could not review owl of work so

00:04:52.392 --> 00:04:58.398
I will talk about a few cases
and situations that I am engaged

00:05:01.801 --> 00:05:07.807
in and really we have been
enjoying. The first is we filed

00:05:10.577 --> 00:05:16.583
six exception request before the
office in the DMCA rule making

00:05:18.585 --> 00:05:24.591
process and for those that saw
-- you will know about it but

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:31.731
what we had found is that we
have this law that makes it

00:05:31.731 --> 00:05:36.937
illegal to break DRM even if you
do it for a lawful reason like

00:05:36.937 --> 00:05:42.943
testing your security or a host
of otherwise legal things that

00:06:03.363 --> 00:06:08.568
you want to do but you need to
break the DRM in order do it and

00:06:08.568 --> 00:06:11.838
that is illegal unless you get
permission from the copyright

00:06:11.838 --> 00:06:15.742
office so every three years we
get to go to copyright office

00:06:15.742 --> 00:06:20.313
and ask a bunch of lawyers if it
is okay the technology do their

00:06:20.313 --> 00:06:24.217
work. And this year we tried to
up the anti-because we are

00:06:24.217 --> 00:06:27.454
seeing how different places
because we have software in so

00:06:27.454 --> 00:06:31.358
many kind of devices to cars to
refrigerator and phone and DRM

00:06:31.358 --> 00:06:35.595
suddenly is more necessary than
ever for us to go the library of

00:06:35.595 --> 00:06:39.833
congress and asks permission for
you all to do the work that you

00:06:39.833 --> 00:06:45.772
do. I wish we didn't have to do
that but we do and this round is

00:06:45.772 --> 00:06:49.909
interesting because in
particular the exception that we

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:54.314
ask for which had to do with car
repair and security video game

00:06:54.314 --> 00:06:59.152
preservation and jail breaking
not just your phone but tablets.

00:06:59.152 --> 00:07:05.091
We aroused the interest of GM.
And John deer. Who felt

00:07:08.862 --> 00:07:13.333
necessary to file responses to
exception to say no, no, no we

00:07:13.333 --> 00:07:18.271
own the copyright in the
software and you can't mess with

00:07:18.271 --> 00:07:22.509
it. So all of sudden I am
fighting John Deer in court.

00:07:22.509 --> 00:07:25.111
Infere thought I would have to
reach out the farmers I wish I

00:07:25.111 --> 00:07:29.249
didn't. But on the other hand I
think that way you turn the time

00:07:29.249 --> 00:07:35.255
because you get more and people
more to that you had this area

00:07:37.857 --> 00:07:43.863
of law is effecting them. So the
DMC rule making process is sill

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:53.006
in plane and we will know the
play in a couple of months. We

00:07:57.577 --> 00:08:02.282
-- (audio drop) and the reason I
wanted to talk about these two

00:08:02.282 --> 00:08:04.718
is because I thought this
audience would appreciate at the

00:08:04.718 --> 00:08:09.389
pay tend that we killed one was
a competition over social

00:08:09.389 --> 00:08:11.391
network. It is not going to work
too well. Secondly there is pay

00:08:11.391 --> 00:08:17.397
tend only pod casting. Somebody
thinks they own that. We don't

00:08:23.069 --> 00:08:30.510
think so and turns out we won
that one. And the victor has to

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:38.017
do with cloud flare and what
happening more and more is that

00:08:38.017 --> 00:08:44.224
the entertainment companies are
running to court and get broad

00:08:44.224 --> 00:08:49.863
injection to require providers
to a website requiring those

00:08:49.863 --> 00:08:56.703
providers to shut down service
sites based on nothing more than

00:08:56.703 --> 00:09:04.144
(audio drop) that same kind of
idea, the theory is if you

00:09:04.144 --> 00:09:08.748
provide any service to website
what is doing something unlawful

00:09:08.748 --> 00:09:14.754
you are conspiring with it.
Providing basic service like

00:09:21.661 --> 00:09:24.130
they would to any other
customer. Basically making cloud

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:30.136
flare into copyright cops and
this is part of trend which is

00:09:38.044 --> 00:09:44.050
why we were worried about it but
we got it narrowed so clear that

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:59.599
cloud fair does not have to be
the trademark cops. So that was

00:09:59.599 --> 00:10:03.269
a big victory and I hope that
set president for other

00:10:03.269 --> 00:10:10.477
situation down D line. >> I will
do this quickly because I know

00:10:10.477 --> 00:10:18.284
people want to answer questions.
I focus on things that we are

00:10:18.284 --> 00:10:25.458
doing on EFF. First thing is
updating privacy law right now

00:10:25.458 --> 00:10:31.464
was a law in 1986 and it has
been for the congress. For the

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:40.240
first time the house has bill
sponsored by 200 members and

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:44.611
second one we're doing is (audio
drop) where you want the make

00:10:44.611 --> 00:10:50.149
sure it is used encourage
security research and not skill

00:10:50.149 --> 00:10:57.957
it and proposals we have seen is
disaster yous and not

00:10:57.957 --> 00:11:04.864
encouraging it so working on
those two things and the third

00:11:04.864 --> 00:11:08.768
thing we're doing and something
that going to move next month in

00:11:08.768 --> 00:11:13.006
September combating a lot of
privacy basis sharing bills.

00:11:13.006 --> 00:11:18.845
They didn't a lot of new
authorities for attacking users

00:11:18.845 --> 00:11:26.486
so what we're doing now and --
with CFA amendment that is just

00:11:26.486 --> 00:11:33.526
(audio drop). We're going the
try to kill that in the short

00:11:33.526 --> 00:11:39.532
term. The last thing we're doing
which I think if a lots of you

00:11:42.035 --> 00:11:45.538
follow the news in the summer
there was one part of it with

00:11:45.538 --> 00:11:51.411
performing one of many stated
programs the last thing we're

00:11:51.411 --> 00:11:55.782
doing is furthering looking at
surveillance laws and offering

00:11:55.782 --> 00:12:01.721
changes in spying. Huge numbers
of mass spying and collecting

00:12:05.425 --> 00:12:11.431
America information with
twisting interpretation so also

00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:21.507
working to change those. >> So
in addition to legal work we do,

00:12:21.507 --> 00:12:25.778
we do a lot of technology work.
We have several technology

00:12:25.778 --> 00:12:29.582
projects. This year along we
have unavailable four new

00:12:29.582 --> 00:12:35.588
technology projects. Certified
of authority. Canary watch which

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:51.104
was tracking -- and privy (audio
drop) in addition we have

00:12:51.104 --> 00:12:55.274
maintained several other
technology projects such as

00:12:55.274 --> 00:13:02.415
start TLS every where to encrypt
all of the e-mail observers. And

00:13:02.415 --> 00:13:08.988
we have done some tech. The
super efficient -- window spy

00:13:08.988 --> 00:13:14.794
wear and the we helped uncover
leak where you personal

00:13:14.794 --> 00:13:20.800
information was being leaked to
third party advertiser so those

00:13:44.324 --> 00:13:47.994
are some of technology
techniques that we do and I can

00:13:47.994 --> 00:13:51.197
do into more details of them. >>
So in addition to litigation we

00:13:51.197 --> 00:13:57.203
have activity vim teach. One of
things that I work on the

00:14:04.277 --> 00:14:07.547
privacy to addressing things
that happened this year we

00:14:07.547 --> 00:14:11.050
worked on letter to I can the
corporation that assigns domain

00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:16.055
names so they are wanting to get
rid of privacy services for

00:14:16.055 --> 00:14:22.328
anybody that is commercial
website and what deem commercial

00:14:22.328 --> 00:14:29.669
is a huge range of websites they
are possible out of touch with

00:14:29.669 --> 00:14:32.438
how people with using the
inter-intestine and why they

00:14:32.438 --> 00:14:35.742
would want privacy so we I can
with a huge list of signatures

00:14:35.742 --> 00:14:41.748
and was a diverse range of
people and people that were

00:22:03.622 --> 00:22:06.458
targeted for harassment and
people concerned about security

00:22:06.458 --> 00:22:10.429
and it was we think that it had
a good effect that time I have

00:22:10.429 --> 00:22:13.833
sort of dialed back on saying
they are going to get rid of

00:22:13.833 --> 00:22:17.236
privacy services and we happy to
say that and we think they need

00:22:17.236 --> 00:22:20.139
to be more responsive. In
addition to that we worked on

00:22:20.139 --> 00:22:23.309
the Facebooked real name policy
so this is something that a lot

00:22:23.309 --> 00:22:26.445
of people are seeing this year
they get kicked off of Facebook

00:22:26.445 --> 00:22:30.382
and used as a way to shut people
up and get them off of Facebook

00:22:30.382 --> 00:22:32.751
so people like international
activist or people in Vietnam

00:22:32.751 --> 00:22:35.387
use that as platform for
blogging to political and drag

00:22:35.387 --> 00:22:38.290
queens are getting kicked off
even though they use names they

00:22:38.290 --> 00:22:41.427
use in everyday life just huge
range of people so we keep

00:22:41.427 --> 00:22:43.529
pushing on that. Another
pro-correct we have surveillance

00:22:43.529 --> 00:22:46.966
self defense so on we put --
play list which are list of

00:22:46.966 --> 00:22:49.868
tools that we think would be
helpful for specific groups so

00:22:49.868 --> 00:22:53.005
we have play list for youth for
people working on human rights

00:22:53.005 --> 00:22:56.442
and we added more new tools and
do trainings and I would say

00:22:56.442 --> 00:22:59.311
this year we trained people how
to use encryption. In addition

00:22:59.311 --> 00:23:02.147
to -- that I'm excited about is
street level surveillance that

00:23:02.147 --> 00:23:05.584
so project when we'll go out
therein a talk to people who may

00:23:05.584 --> 00:23:07.920
be don't have knowledge about
surveillance they are thinking

00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:10.289
about (indiscernible) and they
thinking that it is something

00:23:10.289 --> 00:23:12.925
far away, that maybe it is
something hey should be

00:23:12.925 --> 00:23:16.095
concerned about but in the last
couple of years we are see

00:23:16.095 --> 00:23:18.464
proliferation of technology in
the hands of local law

00:23:18.464 --> 00:23:21.066
enforcement so street level
surveillance is gave -- we want

00:23:21.066 --> 00:23:24.503
it to be something that people
use to take issue in their own

00:23:24.503 --> 00:23:26.872
hands so we have partnership
with (indiscernible) you should

00:23:26.872 --> 00:23:29.775
check them out. They have made
it possible for thousands of

00:23:29.775 --> 00:23:32.645
people to file public records at
request. So we have partnership

00:23:32.645 --> 00:23:36.348
with them to help people file
PRAs on the use of -- and we

00:23:36.348 --> 00:23:39.218
have talking points for activist
and adding more and we are

00:23:39.218 --> 00:23:42.922
highlighting legal work that we
have done. We got a case

00:23:42.922 --> 00:23:46.492
accepted to California court and
public records act case around

00:23:46.492 --> 00:23:52.598
the use of automated license --
so automatic license plate users

00:23:52.598 --> 00:23:58.604
is sort of privacy catch 22. If
you can't get public record

00:24:06.445 --> 00:24:12.451
request you are not going to
know how. It's invasive they are

00:24:20.326 --> 00:24:26.332
and if they are being miss used
and the information deal was lot

00:24:35.374 --> 00:24:41.380
of information about the license
plates being tracked. That is

00:24:46.952 --> 00:24:52.958
why we want to make it public
what is being revealed just like

00:24:58.530 --> 00:25:02.735
with a lot of surveillance. So
really excited today see that

00:25:02.735 --> 00:25:04.970
case go the California supreme
court and lot of legislation at

00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:06.972
the state level on license plate
readers and whether that

00:25:06.972 --> 00:25:08.974
information can we requested
under the state public record

00:25:08.974 --> 00:25:11.010
law so we think this case is
going to be important. And A RBC

00:25:11.010 --> 00:25:13.011
are couple technologies that we
have information on but string

00:25:13.011 --> 00:25:15.414
rays and drones and shots you
name it going to end up on that

00:25:15.414 --> 00:25:17.416
website because we think it is
important for people to have

00:25:17.416 --> 00:25:19.618
this information in front of
them so keep it short. >> Where

00:25:19.618 --> 00:25:21.820
are we going to have the
question. If you have a question

00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:23.989
we will start to line here. Come
forward with your questions and

00:25:23.989 --> 00:25:26.024
the others sort of -- ask me
anything. So we're looking

00:25:26.024 --> 00:25:28.193
forward to hearing from you. >>
I'm curious on privacy -- some

00:25:28.193 --> 00:25:30.195
other actors in the space has
gone out against transparency

00:25:30.195 --> 00:25:32.598
perhaps I want to make a website
and I don't want to tell the

00:25:32.598 --> 00:25:34.967
word. It is my website. Are
there places where -- how do you

00:25:34.967 --> 00:25:36.969
manage cases like that where
there is public interest in

00:25:36.969 --> 00:25:38.971
transparency how you balance
those. >> (indiscernible) I

00:25:38.971 --> 00:25:40.973
think this is interesting
question and hard to answer. I

00:25:40.973 --> 00:25:42.975
think that certificate
transparency is important of I

00:25:42.975 --> 00:25:45.244
will some problem was CA system.
A couple and I think that the

00:25:45.244 --> 00:25:47.246
benefit that we get from
certificate transparency and

00:25:47.246 --> 00:25:49.248
knowing the SSL certificate that
you site is encrypted with is

00:25:49.248 --> 00:25:51.250
the one that it is supposed to
be encrypted with is pretty

00:25:51.250 --> 00:25:53.252
strong. Maybe there are some oh
work for that. I think the

00:25:53.252 --> 00:25:55.254
benefits of CT out way the
privacy concerns. I don't know I

00:25:55.254 --> 00:25:57.256
have not done much research on
that topic. You can ask Peter, I

00:25:57.256 --> 00:25:59.258
will throw him under the bus on
that one. >> So back in may

00:25:59.258 --> 00:26:01.193
there was a circuit court ruling
that surveillance said it wasn't

00:26:01.193 --> 00:26:04.029
authorized by the pat trout acts
and say everything is fine were

00:26:04.029 --> 00:26:06.031
more or less surveillance and
congress reauthorized the

00:26:06.031 --> 00:26:08.033
inspiring section. I hope you
guys could provide context how

00:26:08.033 --> 00:26:10.035
it would play out in the courts
will that go to supreme court or

00:26:10.035 --> 00:26:12.037
how can congress
(indiscernible). >> So on the

00:26:12.037 --> 00:26:14.039
first part, yes, there was a
good ruling about section 215 of

00:26:14.039 --> 00:26:16.041
the pat trot act and what the
government had been doing was

00:26:16.041 --> 00:26:18.043
illegal. It was not saying that
it was unconstitutional but that

00:26:18.043 --> 00:26:20.045
argument was made. That circuit
court decision was not binding

00:26:20.045 --> 00:26:22.047
outside of that circuit so it is
not enough that that happened to

00:26:22.047 --> 00:26:24.049
require this court the a bide by
that and then things got further

00:26:24.049 --> 00:26:26.051
complicated by the passage of
United States freedom which

00:26:26.051 --> 00:26:28.053
changed the language of statute
that had prior been the court

00:26:28.053 --> 00:26:30.055
interpreted to say they could
noted do the program so think

00:26:30.055 --> 00:26:32.057
about program under the new
statute and how that is going to

00:26:32.057 --> 00:26:34.059
play out in congress Mark do u
with want the stay something. I

00:26:34.059 --> 00:26:36.061
think the questions how it is
going the play out when you have

00:26:36.061 --> 00:26:38.063
two court decisions. I think now
we have continuation of program

00:26:38.063 --> 00:26:40.065
and we're going to go into this
narrow program. I would be

00:26:40.065 --> 00:26:42.067
interested on where
(indiscernible) as well as if

00:26:42.067 --> 00:26:44.069
those cases are ongoing because
a part of that we is what

00:26:44.069 --> 00:26:46.071
happens to current court cases.
So there are a number of

00:26:46.071 --> 00:26:48.073
different cases out there which
where challenging wire taping

00:26:48.073 --> 00:26:50.075
program and several ACLU versus
clapper which had section 215

00:26:50.075 --> 00:26:52.077
decision. And there are other
ones out there. There is Smith

00:26:52.077 --> 00:26:54.079
Obama which was a case what
brought by a practitioner

00:26:54.079 --> 00:26:56.081
attorney on behalf of his wife
as the client but adverse

00:26:56.081 --> 00:26:58.083
decision at that court level.
That was heard in December so we

00:26:58.083 --> 00:27:00.018
have a number of cases ongoing
and have to determine a couple

00:27:00.018 --> 00:27:02.020
of thing going forward. The main
question is this

00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:04.022
unconstitutional. Goes beyond
the wounds of what was

00:27:04.022 --> 00:27:06.024
acceptable under the four
amendment. And your write of

00:27:06.024 --> 00:27:08.026
associate. Those will remain
ongoing but for the aspects of

00:27:08.026 --> 00:27:10.028
these challenges where it a
focused on statutory language

00:27:10.028 --> 00:27:12.030
that has been changed by
modification of United States

00:27:12.030 --> 00:27:14.032
freedom. So the originally
statute 215 it was thought to be

00:27:14.032 --> 00:27:16.034
the library division. They get
library book records and things

00:27:16.034 --> 00:27:18.036
that authorized through the
investigation and through secret

00:27:18.036 --> 00:27:20.038
law by courts that were not
known to anybody they determined

00:27:20.038 --> 00:27:22.040
that everything is relevant to
authorized investigation which

00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:24.042
make irrelevant dead letter.
They expanded the understanding

00:27:24.042 --> 00:27:26.044
of in tangible things. It was a
ongoing daily dump of the phone

00:27:26.044 --> 00:27:28.046
records prospectively. So their
interpretation was wrong and

00:27:28.046 --> 00:27:30.048
that is the problem that does
secret interpretation. So they

00:27:30.048 --> 00:27:32.050
changed some of that language
through United States freedom

00:27:32.050 --> 00:27:34.052
and came up with a different
system where communication

00:27:34.052 --> 00:27:36.054
companies would hold on the
records and starting in six

00:27:36.054 --> 00:27:38.056
months they use a different
system to get them and so when

00:27:38.056 --> 00:27:40.058
you have statutory challenge and
there is little bit of

00:27:40.058 --> 00:27:42.060
procedural monkey wrench and we
have been providing briefing to

00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:44.062
court and what the effect open
United States freedom. Those

00:27:44.062 --> 00:27:46.064
cases have been doing on for a
long time now. But one of things

00:27:46.064 --> 00:27:48.066
that is extraordinary to be
every time we turn around, now

00:27:48.066 --> 00:27:50.068
we know we are fighting over
this issue and we're going to

00:27:50.068 --> 00:27:52.070
need to okay we are focused now
and then all of sudden we get a

00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:54.072
new revelation and turns out
other agency is collecting

00:27:54.072 --> 00:27:56.074
records of all Americans and we
have brand new case so we had

00:27:56.074 --> 00:27:58.911
the file a lawsuit against the
drug enforcement agency which

00:27:58.911 --> 00:28:02.981
nate just mentioned so we are
back down the district court

00:28:02.981 --> 00:28:06.351
starting again but a similar
kind of activity. And seems like

00:28:06.351 --> 00:28:09.254
every time you turn around your
most paranoid fantasy are true

00:28:09.254 --> 00:28:12.891
just another way of government
spying on you. So what happens

00:28:12.891 --> 00:28:18.897
with these cases is important
but it is clear that the problem

00:28:26.371 --> 00:28:31.810
doesn't is not that confined not
confined to NSA. What the DEA

00:28:31.810 --> 00:28:34.980
was doing they were collecting
records and all the other

00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:40.986
agencies access them. >> So
there was QA by Bruce nigher

00:28:46.458 --> 00:28:52.464
yesterday. I will channel a
answer to (indiscernible) easier

00:29:04.242 --> 00:29:07.346
for normal. The response was it
is impossible, so go for pretty

00:29:07.346 --> 00:29:13.685
good security and make
(indiscernible) so to that end,

00:29:13.685 --> 00:29:20.926
I know that training and user on
end to end encryption is one of

00:29:20.926 --> 00:29:28.066
services if I recall, what can
we do to encouraging the downs

00:29:28.066 --> 00:29:34.072
by a peer tools to just kind of
get the word out there? >> I

00:29:36.742 --> 00:29:42.814
think one of the -- there are
variety of different ways to

00:29:42.814 --> 00:29:48.553
encouraging people. So depends
on your audience but I think one

00:29:48.553 --> 00:29:51.490
of the things I like the point
out is that we are making

00:29:51.490 --> 00:29:54.326
surveillance more expensive and
difficult for the government

00:29:54.326 --> 00:29:59.531
when we do that and another
important point if you feel like

00:29:59.531 --> 00:30:05.537
if you have or understand how
open source applications work

00:30:05.537 --> 00:30:12.744
and you know you are okay using
them that your security is

00:30:12.744 --> 00:30:19.317
strong as the weakest link in
your security. So important for

00:30:19.317 --> 00:30:25.924
this community to work with the
people who -- you grandmom

00:30:25.924 --> 00:30:31.930
(indiscernible) could use signal
and no reason why she couldn't.

00:30:31.930 --> 00:30:37.336
And no reason why anybody
counted use signal. Everything

00:30:37.336 --> 00:30:45.143
that is share able so -- what's
URL? Shocking URL. HTTPS -- so

00:30:45.143 --> 00:30:51.149
please send people there. There
are people across the country

00:30:51.149 --> 00:30:58.356
who do these trainings and do
for people of variety of level.

00:30:58.356 --> 00:31:05.497
One of the things that I get
excited about doing is trainings

00:31:05.497 --> 00:31:11.503
where I know the audience is
going to be so I think sort of

00:31:13.905 --> 00:31:20.278
that is very long answer to
simple question your argument to

00:31:20.278 --> 00:31:28.019
why peopled should use thing is
audience specific. We try and

00:31:28.019 --> 00:31:34.025
make encryption prevalent to get
plane text off the wire and do

00:31:42.634 --> 00:31:48.640
policy work to make sure that
(indiscernible) safe and legal

00:31:54.846 --> 00:32:00.786
and not back doored. >> So
follow-up to that question. We

00:32:03.455 --> 00:32:07.492
have seen a lot for lack of
better word, zero knowledge

00:32:07.492 --> 00:32:12.497
encryption systems and services
being provided the private key

00:32:12.497 --> 00:32:18.503
they encrypt the private with
the user password on a legal

00:32:32.551 --> 00:32:37.789
level this is differ than just
encrypting it with a system that

00:32:37.789 --> 00:32:43.929
you control but when there is
messaging act that talking using

00:32:43.929 --> 00:32:48.533
protocol to remote server and
things get fuzzy when it is

00:32:48.533 --> 00:32:56.341
browser base. Proton mail they
is client and you put your

00:32:56.341 --> 00:33:02.280
password word but easy to back
door those on demand and target

00:33:08.887 --> 00:33:15.060
the user, my question is is that
for you United States services

00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:21.299
and I don't think you can talk
about Germany but for United

00:33:21.299 --> 00:33:26.538
States services do you feel
there is legal distinction there

00:33:26.538 --> 00:33:31.209
between the systems. >> There is
no law in this what so every. No

00:33:31.209 --> 00:33:34.012
court has ruled on this in
United States. We have not seen

00:33:34.012 --> 00:33:36.815
and we are unaware of any order
from the United States court

00:33:36.815 --> 00:33:39.384
ordering a service to back door
product. Some situation

00:33:39.384 --> 00:33:45.390
different. That was not a back
door order but that is only one

00:33:55.333 --> 00:34:02.040
that we heard of. What we have
seen a ton of informal pressure

00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:08.046
put on (audio drop) so your
question was is there a legal

00:34:10.882 --> 00:34:16.888
description no because it is no
law what so every. What that

00:34:22.193 --> 00:34:29.668
means what happened when you get
a wiretap order with technical

00:34:29.668 --> 00:34:31.670
assistance attached we don't
know the answer to that. Run a

00:34:31.670 --> 00:34:37.676
service and you get a order
please in to us. >> So going to

00:34:44.983 --> 00:34:48.086
switch gears, so when stuff like
the legislation that won't die

00:34:48.086 --> 00:34:50.088
or congress passing retro active
community to questionable

00:34:50.088 --> 00:34:52.490
programs, does that seem to be
happening every other day, and

00:34:52.490 --> 00:34:58.496
kind of the deck being stacked
against you. How do you deal

00:35:12.577 --> 00:35:19.451
with burn out? How do you keep
from knowing your hands up in

00:35:19.451 --> 00:35:26.958
the air in a saying fuck it? >>
So working on cyber security

00:35:26.958 --> 00:35:32.964
stuff in two weeks I'm going on
a 500-mile bike ride and not

00:35:41.172 --> 00:35:47.178
putting on devices. We have to
fight for these thing. We have

00:35:54.953 --> 00:36:00.892
people some intelligence and FBI
and fighting us. Everything that

00:36:06.364 --> 00:36:13.671
EFF works on so for me
personally the fact that we

00:36:13.671 --> 00:36:17.108
don't -- if all of us are not
fighting against it and setting

00:36:17.108 --> 00:36:20.311
the standards for better uses
then we're going the have much

00:36:20.311 --> 00:36:28.119
worse in my opinion technology
history so I think those are my

00:36:28.119 --> 00:36:32.690
two answers. Burn out is
difficult. You saw over the

00:36:32.690 --> 00:36:37.996
summer had where working on
national security and we

00:36:37.996 --> 00:36:43.268
switched to this cyber
information sharing act so there

00:36:43.268 --> 00:36:49.274
is not a lot of rest but try and
take vacations and just realize

00:36:51.543 --> 00:36:55.680
that we are in a very specific
and important time period. I

00:36:55.680 --> 00:37:00.418
will get to rest later in my
life. >> I would add that

00:37:00.418 --> 00:37:05.857
everybody at EFF feels privilege
that had we get to do this work

00:37:05.857 --> 00:37:09.594
and that you guys support us so
like yes it is not like you

00:37:09.594 --> 00:37:16.101
don't have hard days but really
we are so lucky that we get to

00:37:16.101 --> 00:37:20.205
do this and fight this fight. No
one who works at EFF is a kind

00:37:20.205 --> 00:37:27.011
of person that doesn't love a
good scrape and sometimes you

00:37:27.011 --> 00:37:33.017
win and that feels good. So have
to remember those. >> Just one

00:37:37.222 --> 00:37:43.194
other thing to had one of great
things about EFF we have

00:37:43.194 --> 00:37:47.532
holistic strategy. And we all
work on a lot of things so in

00:37:47.532 --> 00:37:50.001
this year I have seen
frustrating things that didn't

00:37:50.001 --> 00:37:56.007
move but the I get to work on
local things like is city

00:37:59.711 --> 00:38:05.650
counsel level. I got somebody to
use a program they would have

00:38:11.656 --> 00:38:17.996
never used before. I have a
comment and at least two

00:38:17.996 --> 00:38:24.502
questions. What do we do about
the problem of demonstrating

00:38:24.502 --> 00:38:28.473
injury when there is so many
secret things going on. There

00:38:28.473 --> 00:38:34.479
was lack of evidence of injury
and court said and they could

00:38:36.981 --> 00:38:41.986
not have obtained the evidence.
That is catch 22 any suggestions

00:38:41.986 --> 00:38:47.992
or thoughts on that? >> Evidence
of injury, there is a notion

00:38:58.970 --> 00:39:04.309
called standing that is
necessary you have to have

00:39:04.309 --> 00:39:08.680
standing before you proceed with
a case. You have to have some

00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:13.017
concrete relationship to case
that is demonstrated by showing

00:39:13.017 --> 00:39:17.021
that you have been injured in
that case and one of challenges

00:39:17.021 --> 00:39:20.091
that has come up is the
government asserts that it is

00:39:20.091 --> 00:39:24.229
state secret whether or not they
spied upon you so even if they

00:39:24.229 --> 00:39:29.334
have program that is spying on
everybody -- you can't get

00:39:29.334 --> 00:39:34.439
standing and case has to be
dismissed. And we have been

00:39:34.439 --> 00:39:40.011
fighting on this issue. Anyway
to over come that? >> I think

00:39:40.011 --> 00:39:46.050
one of things that we foresee a
lot of work on with national

00:39:46.050 --> 00:39:50.855
security we want to see or fix
classification so h is problem

00:39:50.855 --> 00:39:56.861
and something that makes it hard
to see cochlea the going on.

00:40:17.615 --> 00:40:20.618
Whether there is hope or not,
yes there is always hope. >> My

00:40:20.618 --> 00:40:25.590
comment people often in know
will tell you that there is

00:40:25.590 --> 00:40:33.531
shortage of good attorneys, a
lot of the qualified and

00:40:33.531 --> 00:40:38.970
skillful litigate fors get
lifelong contracts to represent

00:40:38.970 --> 00:40:45.243
you might say bad guys. So
assume that shortage of

00:40:45.243 --> 00:40:51.215
attorneys it has been said 10
percent of the population will

00:40:51.215 --> 00:40:53.584
litigate and let's will be able
to make a argument that is

00:40:53.584 --> 00:40:59.324
complete. How do you feel about
your availability of legal team?

00:40:59.324 --> 00:41:02.460
Is there assist legal research
or do you feel confidence that

00:41:02.460 --> 00:41:10.068
you have enough to get the job
done? >> Well, I would put our

00:41:10.068 --> 00:41:15.673
team against any team anywhere
in the United States. And we

00:41:15.673 --> 00:41:21.512
often are against different
companies big law firms, big

00:41:21.512 --> 00:41:24.315
governments large and small we
will fight them and take them on

00:41:24.315 --> 00:41:28.886
and win. So I feel good that we
have set of -- we can always use

00:41:28.886 --> 00:41:34.892
help. Help is great. One of the
things that we have if lawyers

00:41:49.273 --> 00:41:54.178
in the room we have co-op
attorneys. They take the cases

00:41:54.178 --> 00:41:57.548
that we can't. We get lots of
inquiries we try to take the

00:41:57.548 --> 00:42:00.218
cases that we can charge the
law. But we also connect people

00:42:00.218 --> 00:42:02.220
to legal services. So we have
host of attorneys that we want

00:42:02.220 --> 00:42:04.489
more help when people are
willing to take on the clients

00:42:04.489 --> 00:42:06.791
that just need advice. So if you
want to join that list sent

00:42:06.791 --> 00:42:10.828
e-mail. Give you card to EM IL
and we have group of co-rate

00:42:10.828 --> 00:42:16.834
rating technologist who are
willing to help out with some of

00:42:29.714 --> 00:42:32.216
projects so if you would like
the join that group same

00:42:32.216 --> 00:42:38.222
contract information. >> My
question is about European laws.

00:42:46.931 --> 00:42:54.439
Privacy laws. My question is
about the European privacy laws

00:42:54.439 --> 00:42:58.176
that are being discussed at the
moment and what is your thoughts

00:42:58.176 --> 00:43:04.115
if it is going to be a
difference. >> Are you talking

00:43:15.860 --> 00:43:23.100
about the right to be forgotten?
>> That for one but

00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:29.107
(indiscernible) the company
location is restriction of

00:43:33.911 --> 00:43:39.917
(indiscernible) this is a
growing issue and the law raises

00:43:42.587 --> 00:43:48.359
it as well. So I will try the
answer in one. So for those that

00:43:48.359 --> 00:43:55.533
are not familiar the right to be
forgotten is in Europe and

00:43:55.533 --> 00:44:02.006
basically where you say there is
something on internet about me

00:44:02.006 --> 00:44:08.012
and it is not true and it is
invading my privacy so you get a

00:44:10.982 --> 00:44:17.555
order requiring search engine to
take down the link and pretend

00:44:17.555 --> 00:44:24.095
that website doesn't exist my
more and what has happened is

00:44:24.095 --> 00:44:32.003
that in Europe they adopted this
and we had court order google to

00:44:32.003 --> 00:44:36.574
apply that right but up until
now it has been country

00:44:36.574 --> 00:44:41.145
specific. So if it a French
court then only in France people

00:44:41.145 --> 00:44:46.284
can't get to that website. But
(inaudible) drop that is on

00:44:46.284 --> 00:44:49.487
appeal said no, no, no we need
you the take down all around the

00:44:49.487 --> 00:44:55.493
world so no one could access it
because some portion of the

00:45:01.165 --> 00:45:07.171
French population has figured
out you can get around that. So

00:45:11.776 --> 00:45:15.112
google is fighting this and I
think write I will so and

00:45:15.112 --> 00:45:19.784
because sit very dangerous to
have a world you see a different

00:45:19.784 --> 00:45:25.790
view of the internet. I they is
very dangerous path for us to go

00:45:31.729 --> 00:45:33.998
down and people come in and have
these stories there is untrue

00:45:33.998 --> 00:45:38.869
and I didn't do it but what it
means is depending on what kind

00:45:38.869 --> 00:45:42.540
of editing you want you choose
your just direction and you

00:45:42.540 --> 00:45:46.010
orders that global implications.
I don't think anyone court

00:45:46.010 --> 00:45:52.016
should have the ability to set
the terms for the entire world.

00:45:56.420 --> 00:45:59.390
There are other countries that
worry about things like the

00:45:59.390 --> 00:46:02.526
right to be forgotten. So Latin
American that I are concerned

00:46:02.526 --> 00:46:05.529
about this because they have
history where it is important

00:46:05.529 --> 00:46:11.535
for them to remember. If you are
Latin where a lot of history was

00:46:14.572 --> 00:46:22.313
erased by dictatorships you can
scared by the notion that some

00:46:22.313 --> 00:46:25.650
portion of history will
disappear depend on you where it

00:46:25.650 --> 00:46:32.056
is. This is hard problem because
I don't practice law un-Germany.

00:46:32.056 --> 00:46:36.594
So one of things that that we're
working on is building coalition

00:46:36.594 --> 00:46:40.965
with lawyers, with privacy
groups in other countries and

00:46:40.965 --> 00:46:45.069
figuring out way to work
together. In terms of data

00:46:45.069 --> 00:46:51.075
localization laws we have
skeletal of those laws but a we

00:47:06.123 --> 00:47:11.862
have seen them even more than
not past for a wrong purposes

00:47:11.862 --> 00:47:18.869
not to give greater protection
but to force companies to store

00:47:18.869 --> 00:47:26.377
data to give to law enforcement
so that scares us. >> So I was

00:47:26.377 --> 00:47:30.848
glad to see EFF that was listed
one of the organization against

00:47:30.848 --> 00:47:36.854
-- and I hoping that you explain
about why and what the impact of

00:47:39.890 --> 00:47:44.495
those international trade
agreements will have as well as

00:47:44.495 --> 00:47:50.501
kind of what you see as next
steps. >> I can speak to that.

00:47:52.603 --> 00:47:59.310
So we are against the T P P.
Vast trade agreement that cover

00:47:59.310 --> 00:48:06.350
all types of thing to dairy and
corn and covers a lot but it

00:48:06.350 --> 00:48:11.288
also as chapter on intelligent
property. There is chapter where

00:48:11.288 --> 00:48:15.526
they negotiate international
copyright law by trade

00:48:15.526 --> 00:48:21.632
agreement. When you talk about
copyrights you are talking about

00:48:21.632 --> 00:48:28.506
balancing and figuring out what
the are the rules for expression

00:48:28.506 --> 00:48:32.376
and that means you are talking
about speech and that means

00:48:32.376 --> 00:48:35.479
doesn't belong in a trade
agreement because not the same

00:48:35.479 --> 00:48:40.284
thing figuring out what the
rates for corn. It is a very,

00:48:40.284 --> 00:48:46.590
very different things we have
tree speech tradition here and

00:48:46.590 --> 00:48:50.694
when you say the word copyright
all of free speech goes out the

00:48:50.694 --> 00:48:56.700
window. The other problem with T
P P -- so we sort of know we

00:49:05.776 --> 00:49:11.782
have a long history and know
that doesn't work. Doesn't stop

00:49:17.321 --> 00:49:23.327
the trade represent of trying to
make other country -- they

00:49:28.833 --> 00:49:34.905
occurred in secret. And this
therapy behind trade agreements

00:49:34.905 --> 00:49:39.510
secret is because you don't want
people shorting I don't know

00:49:39.510 --> 00:49:43.380
cars or manipulate the market.
That is all fine but now they

00:49:43.380 --> 00:49:46.951
negating the rules for speech.
So we have been fighting it and

00:49:46.951 --> 00:49:49.920
the good news a round of
negotiation and that was

00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:55.926
supposed be the final round and
deal fell apart. So have to go

00:50:22.620 --> 00:50:27.591
back but gives it any chance to
challenge it. With trade

00:50:27.591 --> 00:50:31.161
agreements sometimes people just
give up and that will be a best

00:50:31.161 --> 00:50:35.733
thing or they may drop the TP
section. So I remain hopeful

00:50:35.733 --> 00:50:39.069
this trade agreement may die in
the vine. >> EFF comments on

00:50:39.069 --> 00:50:45.075
(indiscernible). >> So for those
of you that don't know the vas

00:50:52.950 --> 00:50:58.956
nor arrangement is four is state
arrangement to control the

00:51:04.461 --> 00:51:10.467
export of dual use technology
and what that means is

00:51:16.006 --> 00:51:22.346
technology that is useful both
in civilian and military

00:51:22.346 --> 00:51:26.717
context. Nerve gas, body armer,
land mines stuff like that. Were

00:51:26.717 --> 00:51:32.723
added to control list for the
first time. The United States

00:51:41.031 --> 00:51:47.037
didn't implement the rule
instead department of commerce

00:51:50.074 --> 00:51:56.747
took eight months to get act
took and it was terrible. It

00:51:56.747 --> 00:52:02.686
would have outlawed jail
breaking services or license.

00:52:10.127 --> 00:52:13.597
Dependent on how you read it and
for debuggers and this was

00:52:13.597 --> 00:52:20.604
crazy, that had nothing to do
with types of software that the

00:52:20.604 --> 00:52:27.144
vas nor arrangement to band the
export of. The software intended

00:52:27.144 --> 00:52:30.948
to be cover were things like fin
fisher and hacking team. State

00:52:30.948 --> 00:52:34.852
sponsor malware to target end
points. This kind of restriction

00:52:34.852 --> 00:52:36.854
would be unconstitutional. The
next step commerce has indicate

00:52:36.854 --> 00:52:42.860
that had they are going to
revise the rule. So we have won

00:53:09.686 --> 00:53:15.692
the first battle but the real
next step is going to be try and

00:53:28.672 --> 00:53:31.442
push the states at that meeting
in December of this year in

00:53:31.442 --> 00:53:37.448
Europe to try and clarify the
control list itself. John

00:53:47.925 --> 00:53:53.931
Gillespie more in 1993 said the
net censorship is damaged and

00:53:59.803 --> 00:54:05.743
routes around it. Software
controls don't work that well so

00:54:11.949 --> 00:54:18.755
we are going the trial to focus
on end use. So that is where we

00:54:18.755 --> 00:54:24.761
are now hopefully we will work
with the state and make sure

00:54:30.801 --> 00:54:35.472
that any controls on
surveillance technology doesn't

00:54:35.472 --> 00:54:41.478
sweep in really good thing like
pen testing. We need to make

00:54:45.082 --> 00:54:51.088
sure they are not chilled and
secure user academics hackers

00:54:54.591 --> 00:55:01.265
are not chilled and are free the
continue going about their work.

00:55:01.265 --> 00:55:07.271
>> You mentioned indication that
you like to do and third thing

00:55:09.339 --> 00:55:14.111
you were talking about if you
have some current development

00:55:14.111 --> 00:55:18.448
service and the government comes
with you get something like that

00:55:18.448 --> 00:55:25.556
and you get to litigate that and
curious if there is services

00:55:25.556 --> 00:55:29.059
that you would like to see
developers set up purposely in

00:55:29.059 --> 00:55:34.932
hopes that the government goes
after them so you can beat them

00:55:34.932 --> 00:55:40.938
in court? >> Is this being
recorded? Yes. So making a legal

00:55:44.141 --> 00:55:50.147
honey bot. We take the cases
where that come up one of things

00:55:55.385 --> 00:56:01.325
that has happened the government
is good at identifying good

00:56:03.594 --> 00:56:07.064
facts so one of things that we
have done is try to establish

00:56:07.064 --> 00:56:11.568
there is protection for you
e-mail. That the government need

00:56:11.568 --> 00:56:17.574
to have warrant. 180 days or
older and we think the amendment

00:56:20.444 --> 00:56:28.285
should apply to e-mail all the
time and we have won that case

00:56:28.285 --> 00:56:31.288
in some jurisdiction. And I
appreciate that because it is

00:56:31.288 --> 00:56:34.891
victory for clients in this case
but not larger purpose of trying

00:56:34.891 --> 00:56:40.897
to establish the president. So
one trying to create the honor

00:56:44.601 --> 00:56:50.607
my bot with good facts attempt
the government to raise this

00:56:54.811 --> 00:57:00.751
issue they have some people they
have figured that out and will

00:57:05.856 --> 00:57:11.862
not take they battle. (audio
drop) so the question about burn

00:57:16.433 --> 00:57:19.136
out got me thinking, that raises
me a concern because it is the

00:57:19.136 --> 00:57:23.874
days there a lot of sort of more
distance in accessible intuition

00:57:23.874 --> 00:57:27.411
base back because they are tech
companies tend to be more

00:57:27.411 --> 00:57:33.450
accessible and more culturally
related but you have like goings

00:57:33.450 --> 00:57:37.454
tell come industry what is
looking for new technology and

00:57:37.454 --> 00:57:42.793
looking to deploy relevant cloud
based services but when you want

00:57:42.793 --> 00:57:48.799
to work with them the first
question they ask under the

00:57:57.674 --> 00:58:01.511
table, but perhaps obviously is
this law -- can the technology

00:58:01.511 --> 00:58:03.980
do law enforcement request and
you have those sort of very old

00:58:03.980 --> 00:58:09.986
tell come institution that are
only willing to deploy you have

00:58:18.762 --> 00:58:24.768
the so law enforcement recess
that remain outside of the

00:58:37.848 --> 00:58:42.152
culture reach of what the way
they EFF operates generally so

00:58:42.152 --> 00:58:46.323
you see things like reports and
you see things like all those

00:58:46.323 --> 00:58:51.128
things who is transparent and
who is reaching out. You see a

00:58:51.128 --> 00:58:55.465
list of companies like apple
Facebook and google all of the

00:58:55.465 --> 00:59:01.471
modern tech companies just in
this case what a modern company

00:59:01.471 --> 00:59:05.809
is question of culture and
question of how related is that

00:59:05.809 --> 00:59:10.247
company culture to the way that
EFF understands and how we all

00:59:10.247 --> 00:59:13.650
understand in this room tech
culture. But what do you do

00:59:13.650 --> 00:59:19.356
about the people the standards
that you set is just not

00:59:19.356 --> 00:59:21.625
relevant to their way of
thinking because they are coming

00:59:21.625 --> 00:59:29.166
from the old telephone way of
doing things. And this is

00:59:29.166 --> 00:59:33.170
something that reaches outside
of United States also to Europe.

00:59:33.170 --> 00:59:35.806
>> So what is question? >> How
do you deal with that? >> There

00:59:48.118 --> 00:59:52.189
are ways that we can pressure
companies and established tech

00:59:52.189 --> 00:59:58.195
is still knew to sometimes
improve the practices and hard

01:00:00.664 --> 01:00:06.670
to get at the codes. How do we
handle that problem is that the

01:00:10.006 --> 01:00:16.480
question? >> Yes. >> So we have
who has your back project so we

01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:20.250
go through who has you back when
the government comes knocking

01:00:20.250 --> 01:00:22.853
and I will tell you our super
friendly companies got one stars

01:00:22.853 --> 01:00:25.956
and they improved their
practices so people like stars

01:00:25.956 --> 01:00:30.026
so we have we started out saying
you need to improve you

01:00:30.026 --> 01:00:36.032
practice. So I wanted to say
even the people that we are

01:00:46.510 --> 01:00:52.516
friends with we had to D a fair
amount of work to get them to

01:01:04.027 --> 01:01:06.263
improve -- I don't know if we
are friends with them but we it

01:01:06.263 --> 01:01:12.269
took a while to get them in a
better place. So I think there

01:01:16.172 --> 01:01:19.175
are some companies they are
going to be who they are going

01:01:19.175 --> 01:01:23.613
to be and they will just evolve
over time and we will get a new

01:01:23.613 --> 01:01:29.519
guard take over for the old
guard. >> I was going the

01:01:29.519 --> 01:01:35.525
mention we have holistic
approach. There are multiple

01:01:37.794 --> 01:01:41.197
ways to deal with company. We
have policy and activism. That

01:01:41.197 --> 01:01:47.203
is what comes to mind to answer
that question. >> He saw some

01:01:58.815 --> 01:02:04.754
things while there and at AT
wiring up a room for the NSA

01:02:19.169 --> 01:02:25.175
surveillance program. Figure out
what he had been involved with

01:02:35.418 --> 01:02:37.587
he knew that it was wrong and he
wanted to tell somebody about

01:02:37.587 --> 01:02:42.292
that and from that we got our
case against ATT for

01:02:42.292 --> 01:02:47.430
collaboration in the NSA program
and that was applying some

01:02:47.430 --> 01:02:51.735
values that maybe a little bit
different the what you see in

01:02:51.735 --> 01:02:56.072
some of modern internet
companies but reflecting a

01:02:56.072 --> 01:03:00.010
belief shared by a lot f people
that we don't want the give the

01:03:00.010 --> 01:03:06.783
government that much power over
our lives. >> I think companies

01:03:06.783 --> 01:03:10.387
respond to bad publicity. (audio
drop). >> So you touched on this

01:03:10.387 --> 01:03:13.690
in answer to other questions I
want to ask sort of the how can

01:03:13.690 --> 01:03:15.692
be -- let me start again. How
can we prevent and what tools do

01:03:15.692 --> 01:03:17.694
we have to prevent the setting
of bad International precedence

01:03:17.694 --> 01:03:19.696
so these come in two forms --
parliament pushed through audio

01:03:19.696 --> 01:03:21.698
recordings with no treaty.
Because the United States does

01:03:21.698 --> 01:03:23.700
it that is international. You
get these standards without the

01:03:23.700 --> 01:03:25.702
bodies out of nowhere,
(indiscernible) it is bad.

01:03:25.702 --> 01:03:27.704
(laughter) it what hard to
intervene on the international

01:03:27.704 --> 01:03:29.706
level. Sometimes we can and make
it possible for people in United

01:03:29.706 --> 01:03:31.708
States and outside of United
States to speak up and sort of

01:03:31.708 --> 01:03:33.710
international principles that
valuable. So that is one way to

01:03:33.710 --> 01:03:35.712
do it and people in this room
the thing is stay tuned to EFF

01:03:35.712 --> 01:03:41.251
-- even if it seems doesn't
effect me as citizen. We can

01:03:41.251 --> 01:03:43.253
stop bad things but only when
there is out cry. I would remind

01:03:43.253 --> 01:03:47.323
everybody (audio drop) right
around the same time

01:03:47.323 --> 01:03:53.029
International name protest
stopped A CT A which was a

01:03:53.029 --> 01:03:58.768
international trade agreement
and stopped in the tracks by the

01:03:58.768 --> 01:04:05.542
international protest here and a
broad so stiff we can do but

01:04:05.542 --> 01:04:08.945
required coordination. >> So you
guys have talked about the

01:04:08.945 --> 01:04:12.816
freedom of speech issues so far
and I'm curious, so I have heard

01:04:12.816 --> 01:04:15.685
some quotes from your
organization about speaking out

01:04:15.685 --> 01:04:20.023
against laws what is referred to
as reviewing form and I am

01:04:20.023 --> 01:04:24.361
curious if you think in this
space there is way way to

01:04:24.361 --> 01:04:27.597
balance criminalizing these
actions with free speech. >> I

01:04:27.597 --> 01:04:31.935
think the answer is we have not
seen any legislation that comes

01:04:31.935 --> 01:04:36.272
close to that. The problem is a
lot of legislation has poorly

01:04:36.272 --> 01:04:39.876
defined terms and in some ways
the (indiscernible) coming from

01:04:39.876 --> 01:04:43.146
companies and their questions
about really key terms like

01:04:43.146 --> 01:04:48.184
consent that are just not clear.
So if were to see a piece of

01:04:48.184 --> 01:04:51.454
legislative that could balance
these concerns we could be

01:04:51.454 --> 01:04:54.691
excited but the question of
addressing this issue is

01:04:54.691 --> 01:04:58.328
certainly something that we
think people need to think about

01:04:58.328 --> 01:05:01.865
because what's happening now
that it is very reactionary and

01:05:01.865 --> 01:05:05.468
it is reactionary in a
particular way sort of to

01:05:05.468 --> 01:05:09.072
mentioning the companies they
know people are upset and know

01:05:09.072 --> 01:05:13.743
that people want to do something
and they are going to do the

01:05:13.743 --> 01:05:17.447
things are easiest to do. The
other thing to keep in mind is

01:05:17.447 --> 01:05:22.352
that a lot of this legislation
is not thinking about what --

01:05:22.352 --> 01:05:28.358
all of this issues of harassment
are coming from a big cultural

01:08:31.007 --> 01:08:34.277
context. (audio drop). >> EFF
has come out against

01:08:34.277 --> 01:08:40.283
(indiscernible) I am curious if
you can describe it at a high

01:08:46.889 --> 01:08:52.895
level of government perspective
sharing -- protection of

01:09:21.157 --> 01:09:28.898
individual's information. >> I
think we should start out by

01:09:28.898 --> 01:09:34.904
addressing the flaws I think one
of the for important thing to

01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:43.513
note is that -- these laws are
addressing or they have been

01:09:43.513 --> 01:09:48.384
painted as more information
sharing but when we look at lot

01:09:48.384 --> 01:09:53.256
of breaches what happened when
we look at JP morgan chase, home

01:09:53.256 --> 01:09:59.262
depot, what it was -- JP morgan
that was due to not updating the

01:10:11.641 --> 01:10:17.647
server so the first accept is
ensuring that we tackle those

01:10:21.284 --> 01:10:27.323
things and we could talk about
hours what a good policy is. We

01:10:27.323 --> 01:10:29.392
focus on the -- the granting of
new powers a lot of people

01:10:29.392 --> 01:10:31.394
neglect and the -- often is not
contend and what these bills do

01:10:31.394 --> 01:10:33.396
and what we see every bill what
every bill does for the past

01:10:33.396 --> 01:10:35.398
three year as try to get rid of
privacy protections and try to

01:10:35.398 --> 01:10:37.400
enlarging the scope of the
contend or of the able to

01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:39.402
collect private information, but
also increase the powers. So I

01:10:39.402 --> 01:10:41.404
think the -- we try to focus
(audio drop) we don't need the

01:10:41.404 --> 01:10:43.406
grant companies huge -- let's
deal with the problems that we

01:10:43.406 --> 01:10:45.408
are trying to deal with. Let's
look at how this was caused and

01:10:45.408 --> 01:10:47.410
try the fixed those problems. We
are focusing on the solution

01:10:47.410 --> 01:10:49.412
that not a actual solution to
these problems. >> Have you seen

01:10:49.412 --> 01:10:51.414
attend towards law enforcement
trying to force individuals to

01:10:51.414 --> 01:10:53.416
give their password. >> So I
will take the portion about the

01:10:53.416 --> 01:10:55.418
giving out password . S this has
been a continued area of

01:10:55.418 --> 01:10:57.420
litigation under what
circumstances can someone be

01:10:57.420 --> 01:10:59.422
compelled to give password. Or
compelled to provide

01:10:59.422 --> 01:11:01.357
un-encrypted information the
government cannot compel you to

01:11:01.357 --> 01:11:03.359
give away you password but you
may have a order to decrypt the

01:11:03.359 --> 01:11:05.361
information but you may be able
to do that. Whether the act

01:11:05.361 --> 01:11:07.363
having that password would give
testimony to provide

01:11:07.363 --> 01:11:09.365
information. Will it be
testimonial. But if they know

01:11:09.365 --> 01:11:11.367
that it is your computer they
know you have access to this

01:11:11.367 --> 01:11:13.369
information but the you are not
currently giving it to them that

01:11:13.369 --> 01:11:15.371
sometimes courts will order
somebody to give a decrypted

01:11:15.371 --> 01:11:17.373
copy. So that was that and I
forgot the second part of you

01:11:17.373 --> 01:11:19.375
question. >> It was about
increase in law enforcement

01:11:19.375 --> 01:11:21.377
attempting to force people -- >>
Because when the government we

01:11:21.377 --> 01:11:23.379
only fine out about it if
someone creates EFF for help.

01:11:23.379 --> 01:11:29.385
One of the things that
government does is they pick and

01:11:29.385 --> 01:11:35.391
choose the facts of litigate and
their is good set of factors for

01:11:39.362 --> 01:11:45.368
us it is often the case we drop
it. And Judges are willing to go

01:12:05.288 --> 01:12:11.294
to great length to throw child
pornographers -- so there is has

01:12:26.075 --> 01:12:32.081
been some bad law made by some
bad people. >> So you touched on

01:12:50.333 --> 01:12:57.206
proposals and information
sharing that would under mine

01:12:57.206 --> 01:13:01.544
our rights so I it is easy to
become disa lighted with

01:13:01.544 --> 01:13:07.550
political system but there any
proposal that let us sleep

01:13:17.260 --> 01:13:23.266
easier. Something that benefit
our right as what can with do to

01:13:56.399 --> 01:14:02.338
help. >> So let me by start by
pointing out the win so this is

01:14:26.462 --> 01:14:32.468
not all doom and gloom because
we had a Witness here that was 4

01:14:49.719 --> 01:14:55.725
million people spoke up and
forced FCC to do the right thing

01:15:10.039 --> 01:15:16.045
and rules that make sense and
will survive legal review and

01:15:47.009 --> 01:15:50.379
FCC has been trying to interact
-- it would go to court and lose

01:15:50.379 --> 01:15:53.449
again and we have world in which
many people have little choice

01:15:53.449 --> 01:15:57.653
with respect to high speed
access and EFF believed that we

01:15:57.653 --> 01:16:03.592
needed rules of road. We turned
ship and it was amazing thing to

01:16:40.196 --> 01:16:47.670
happen. And it leaves me feeling
very, very positive about the

01:16:47.670 --> 01:16:53.309
power of the net. So that makes
me helpful and those rules are

01:16:53.309 --> 01:16:59.315
being litigated in court but
this time I feel like we can win

01:17:06.622 --> 01:17:09.425
this one. We will survive legal
review and there have been

01:17:09.425 --> 01:17:15.164
victories and I think internet
user are starting to mature as a

01:17:15.164 --> 01:17:22.771
political force. >> I want to go
back years with the

01:17:22.771 --> 01:17:28.777
(indiscernible) and how much it
shocked the country. A lot of us

01:17:38.153 --> 01:17:45.628
knew some f this but not the
extent. Working cyber security

01:17:45.628 --> 01:17:52.001
world -- a lot of people in this
room -- the feeling that I get

01:17:52.001 --> 01:17:54.370
when I read something there are
thank you things that come out

01:17:54.370 --> 01:17:56.405
about surveillance feel like
people become desensitized to it

01:17:56.405 --> 01:17:58.407
now and peers of mine so my
question is, how can be get

01:17:58.407 --> 01:18:00.342
people to become more (audio
drop). >> So that is a great

01:18:00.342 --> 01:18:02.344
point. I think that people do
feel over then I ask how many

01:18:02.344 --> 01:18:04.346
people say it is just so bad
will is nothing I can do about

01:18:04.346 --> 01:18:07.950
it. So I think we need to make
it real and sorry if kids in the

01:18:07.950 --> 01:18:12.154
room but Dick picks that is
brilliant segment and when you

01:18:12.154 --> 01:18:18.160
talk about section 702 people
want to know how it is going to

01:18:24.667 --> 01:18:30.673
effect them and really on the
base level people want to know

01:19:28.497 --> 01:19:34.503
can they see Dick fix you make
it real for people and we are

01:19:41.010 --> 01:19:47.016
still figuring out how much is
still out there and we are

01:19:49.184 --> 01:19:55.190
figuring out how to communicate
with people and we want to talk

01:19:59.128 --> 01:20:05.134
about the values of work we do.
But we need to talk about how it

01:20:11.540 --> 01:20:17.546
matters to people so having that
approach so it is really bad and

01:20:22.284 --> 01:20:28.290
I am going to tell you about
something else but here is

01:20:32.027 --> 01:20:35.297
something that you can do now.
You can start doing this thing

01:20:35.297 --> 01:20:39.368
that is going to make it harder
the government to watch you.

01:20:39.368 --> 01:20:42.037
When congress people get calls
it does make a difference. Some

01:20:42.037 --> 01:20:44.740
times the difference is only in
numbers if they only got one

01:20:44.740 --> 01:20:48.410
call they are not listening but
if they got a hundred calls this

01:20:48.410 --> 01:20:54.416
is something people care about.
If they get more than then care

01:20:56.952 --> 01:21:02.191
more so all of those things
people need to hear all of

01:21:02.191 --> 01:21:07.963
those. >> I would add there is
one thing I love the privacy

01:21:07.963 --> 01:21:13.268
bagarre projects part of it I
have it installed and you go

01:21:13.268 --> 01:21:17.673
website to website. It is
company surveillance but way to

01:21:17.673 --> 01:21:22.511
see I can see all the different
companies that are watching me

01:21:22.511 --> 01:21:27.082
now. Where as if I go to this
site it green so this is safe.

01:21:27.082 --> 01:21:33.088
So this is important and
interesting way for people to

01:21:37.059 --> 01:21:40.596
engage and become conscious of
how much they are being tracked

01:21:40.596 --> 01:21:45.768
so those kind of projects key to
keeping people aware. >> We

01:21:45.768 --> 01:21:51.774
don't talk about free speech as
only individual issue. We should

01:21:58.981 --> 01:22:01.817
not talk about privacy as
individual issue. I care about

01:22:01.817 --> 01:22:05.487
free speech for everybody else
because that is what matters.

01:22:05.487 --> 01:22:11.493
And privacy is the same thing. I
care about other people having

01:22:19.468 --> 01:22:22.404
privacy because privacy is what
is necessary to do the hard work

01:22:22.404 --> 01:22:24.406
of democracy. You can't push
social change without advocacy

01:22:24.406 --> 01:22:26.408
just like you can't do it
without free speech and you

01:22:26.408 --> 01:22:30.712
can't have free speech without
privacy. It is about society. >>

01:22:30.712 --> 01:22:33.048
I would like to move the
conversation back to online

01:22:33.048 --> 01:22:37.619
harassment. I have had the time
what has had a hard time so near

01:22:37.619 --> 01:22:43.625
and deer to my heart. I know
this summer the court came out

01:23:05.948 --> 01:23:11.954
with a decision that kicked a
lot of these things back down to

01:23:14.089 --> 01:23:19.261
lower courts to redefine. am I
right on that about how -- there

01:23:19.261 --> 01:23:25.267
was a ex-husband who went after
his wife and that decision was

01:23:29.771 --> 01:23:35.777
kicked back down I would like to
know if EFF are working at the

01:23:39.214 --> 01:23:45.120
lower court level to help define
what is harassment and how that

01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:50.659
is defined going forward? >> So
I can say that I am not certain

01:23:50.659 --> 01:23:54.730
which case you are referring to
but there is bleed between

01:23:54.730 --> 01:23:59.534
online and offline harassment
and sounds like the case you are

01:23:59.534 --> 01:24:03.639
talking about was about offline
-- it was online harassment he

01:24:03.639 --> 01:24:08.210
was putting things on Facebook.
Sorry, now I know what case you

01:24:08.210 --> 01:24:14.216
are referring to. I will let one
of attorneys answer that. >> I

01:24:19.454 --> 01:24:23.458
this the question was not about
the case I think the question

01:24:23.458 --> 01:24:28.363
was what the EFF doing to help
the lower courts define. I think

01:24:28.363 --> 01:24:34.369
part of our point is we have a
lot of laws that define

01:24:36.405 --> 01:24:41.176
harassment already. We have
number of laws on the books that

01:24:41.176 --> 01:24:45.247
can be used criminal laws and
civil law That's can be used

01:24:45.247 --> 01:24:51.420
when people are stepping out of
line. We have robust laws and

01:24:51.420 --> 01:24:56.858
criminal penalties for criminal
activity. One of the things that

01:24:56.858 --> 01:25:00.929
(audio drop) I think law
enforcement needs to be better

01:25:00.929 --> 01:25:06.935
educated about what counts as
threat. I think of 10 law

01:25:09.237 --> 01:25:11.306
enforcement discounted important
threats that are happens -- I

01:25:11.306 --> 01:25:17.312
think something we are aware of
the laws on the books are not

01:25:26.588 --> 01:25:32.494
enforced the right way and but
we sort of -- what we like about

01:25:32.494 --> 01:25:35.697
the laws on books like with
defamation of law we have

01:25:35.697 --> 01:25:39.368
history of courts figuring out
they balance between defamation

01:25:39.368 --> 01:25:45.374
and (audio drop) true threats
and just talk and I think it is

01:25:51.680 --> 01:25:53.915
bone to continue to be a
struggle. (audio drop). >> I

01:25:53.915 --> 01:25:55.917
think recently in a district
court decision maybe in new or

01:25:55.917 --> 01:25:58.053
whens judge found (audio drop)
using DCMA as a lock he found

01:25:58.053 --> 01:26:00.288
the thing that was being locked
had (audio drop) and using it as

01:26:00.288 --> 01:26:02.624
access control list and found
not use of DCMA so h is judge

01:26:02.624 --> 01:26:05.127
slapping down over reach or is
that kind of use in decline now.

01:26:05.127 --> 01:26:07.129
>> So what we have seen there is
question whether you activity

01:26:07.129 --> 01:26:09.131
(audio drop) or tied to
copyright infringement and we

01:26:09.131 --> 01:26:11.133
would like the world in which
you have to be breaking

01:26:11.133 --> 01:26:13.135
(indiscernible) for there to be
a claim. There is law that is

01:26:13.135 --> 01:26:15.837
being represented that would do
just that but courts have

01:26:15.837 --> 01:26:21.843
interpreted this in different
ways whether it has to be tied

01:26:56.378 --> 01:27:02.317
to breaking a lock or tied to
copyright interest or not. So

01:27:43.291 --> 01:27:49.297
kind of mess but in the meantime
if you person engaged in

01:27:57.806 --> 01:28:01.009
security research that is not
very comforting so the law is

01:28:01.009 --> 01:28:05.147
kind of mess. >> So do you see
this going to supreme court? >>

01:28:05.147 --> 01:28:09.284
It could happen. >> Is there any
legal basis -- I see you shaking

01:28:09.284 --> 01:28:13.155
your head that is good. Or just
a cable company talking point.

01:28:13.155 --> 01:28:16.691
>> Yes. I was not planning on
asking a question (audio drop) I

01:28:16.691 --> 01:28:20.562
guess where I want to go with
this we hear terms like cyber

01:28:20.562 --> 01:28:23.498
warfare and we are getting
bombarded more and feeling of

01:28:23.498 --> 01:28:26.468
having to defend ourselves I
guess is more into something

01:28:26.468 --> 01:28:29.437
more than just physical. It
digital (audio drop) on the

01:28:29.437 --> 01:28:32.407
first amendment and lot of
answers were based on protection

01:28:32.407 --> 01:28:35.644
and we have DMCA1201 -- have you
guys considered application of

01:28:35.644 --> 01:28:38.613
the second amendment to this
defense. So second amendment is

01:28:38.613 --> 01:28:42.484
right to defend our self but the
kind of idea and the second

01:28:42.484 --> 01:28:45.120
amendment was to protect our
several against the government

01:28:45.120 --> 01:28:49.858
and the right to bear arms so if
we had some application and of

01:28:49.858 --> 01:28:54.229
morph of that second amendment,
maybe that could be a defense.

01:28:54.229 --> 01:29:00.168
>> So the notion of second
amendment coming into play have

01:29:03.104 --> 01:29:09.110
been raised on the number cases.
There is no court that indicates

01:29:13.848 --> 01:29:19.854
they might look at is second
amendment. To say like guns a

01:29:24.593 --> 01:29:30.599
knives and weapons of that sort.
And when it has come to software

01:29:36.204 --> 01:29:42.210
putting into categories with
weapons that generally been a

01:29:44.246 --> 01:29:50.252
problem. So in earlier days of
EFF the first round of war there

01:29:55.890 --> 01:30:01.897
is were controls over the export
with notion -- those were

01:30:05.734 --> 01:30:11.740
weapons. And in that case it
really the first amendment that

01:30:15.577 --> 01:30:21.583
came into play. The code of
speech and you have -- so no

01:30:27.188 --> 01:30:33.194
indication that the second
amendment will be a fruitful

01:30:36.298 --> 01:30:42.304
application. So the question can
the second amendment be useful,

01:30:44.472 --> 01:30:51.546
remains out there. The area in
which it may start to impact

01:30:51.546 --> 01:30:57.419
technology things like hacking,
we talked about that earlier and

01:30:57.419 --> 01:31:04.426
3D printing with e are bring
these issue to the forum. >>

01:31:04.426 --> 01:31:11.499
Last question. Mine is simply
have you seen a increase in use

01:31:11.499 --> 01:31:18.006
of (indiscernible). >> H1B
visas. As in -- we don't do

01:31:18.006 --> 01:31:24.479
immigration law. I was curious
if you heard anything. >> No.

01:31:24.479 --> 01:31:32.153
Immigration is not one of issues
that we work with and when EFF

01:31:32.153 --> 01:31:39.227
needs immigration law advice we
hire those lawyers. >> I want to

01:31:39.227 --> 01:31:43.932
follow-up with question you
mentioned the secret around

01:31:43.932 --> 01:31:50.405
national security, I don't know
if you guys remember the case

01:31:50.405 --> 01:31:58.079
Japanese car maker -- >> Hold
the mic closer. >> I don't know

01:31:58.079 --> 01:32:05.086
if you remember a Japanese car
because his rental car tag was

01:32:05.086 --> 01:32:10.992
expired. He was arrest because
the rental card registration was

01:32:10.992 --> 01:32:17.999
expired. >> I don't think we are
familiar with that case. >>

01:32:17.999 --> 01:32:24.005
Alabama has a law if you have
car registration (indiscernible)

01:32:31.980 --> 01:32:37.986
if you are foreigner and minor
traffic problem you have go to

01:33:08.716 --> 01:33:14.722
jail so that was a kind of
(indiscernible) my question is

01:34:25.527 --> 01:34:29.063
that the car company used
(indiscernible) we made a

01:34:29.063 --> 01:34:34.068
mistake and somebody didn't do
the work. But before that case,

01:34:34.068 --> 01:34:40.875
given one of those cars and -- I
think that is kind of -- they

01:34:40.875 --> 01:34:45.013
have a program to provide car to
some people so that

01:34:45.013 --> 01:34:51.019
(indiscernible). >> This is
about your specific situation --

01:34:58.226 --> 01:35:04.165
>> No. I was asking if there is
policy or something like that.

01:36:24.379 --> 01:36:31.719
>> Hard to hear. >>So are you
asking whether license plates

01:36:31.719 --> 01:36:37.725
are policy. >>They have a
program like a car company

01:36:42.163 --> 01:36:48.169
(indiscernible) in the name of
national security whether the

01:36:51.539 --> 01:36:57.812
(indiscernible) privacy
something like that, how you

01:36:57.812 --> 01:37:03.751
contact that -- something to do
with national security we can do

01:37:07.789 --> 01:37:12.527
nothing about it. >> I'm not
positive this will be a answer

01:37:12.527 --> 01:37:15.830
to your question but the let me
take a stab. We have street

01:37:15.830 --> 01:37:21.002
level surveillance project and
part of goal of that project to

01:37:21.002 --> 01:37:27.008
not just track but share
information in the ways in which

01:37:30.745 --> 01:37:37.819
people on ground including
things like tracking license

01:37:37.819 --> 01:37:43.825
plates. I don't think that what
you're asking but that is

01:37:47.595 --> 01:37:53.601
closest in terms of what we're
are paying attention to. >>One

01:37:57.338 --> 01:38:03.277
of the things that we encourage
is people file -- you are

01:38:07.915 --> 01:38:13.921
mentioning the car companies and
that is -- >> Sorry I could not

01:38:19.427 --> 01:38:25.433
catch that. >> Car manufacturing
we have not heard information

01:38:28.302 --> 01:38:34.308
that car manufacturing are -- >>
Rental company? Rental cars. >>

01:38:37.278 --> 01:38:41.616
Sorry we don't have a better
answer for you. We are not

01:38:41.616 --> 01:38:47.488
really aware of rental car
program that is involved. Could

01:38:47.488 --> 01:38:55.096
be that there is one but we have
not really heard of that. But

01:38:55.096 --> 01:38:58.766
thank you for you question and
thank you all for coming and

01:38:58.766 --> 01:39:01.235
appreciate coming here and being
apart of this community and

01:39:01.235 --> 01:39:07.241
thank you much.
