00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.937
So who am I, who the hell am I?
Who is this weird guy? So, I am

00:00:03.937 --> 00:00:06.974
DEF CON's official cryptographer
and puzzle master. I created the

00:00:06.974 --> 00:00:10.744
hardware hacking village, I have
been doing puzzles and mystery

00:00:10.744 --> 00:00:16.750
challenges for many, many years.
This is my lovely wife and yes,

00:00:38.472 --> 00:00:44.478
that's a Dr. Seuss book on the
right. Who wants to come to Las

00:00:58.425 --> 00:01:05.499
Vegas in the summertime with a
bunch of sweaty people that

00:01:05.499 --> 00:01:11.505
don't shower and rub elbows? I'm
not a Vegas person. This is for

00:01:17.978 --> 00:01:23.483
noobs and not for any particular
subject area. Who knows who Matt

00:01:23.483 --> 00:01:25.752
Blaze is? It says don't be shy.
A quick shoutout and APG and a

00:01:25.752 --> 00:01:27.754
couple others. I have some good
props. Everyone should do that.

00:01:27.754 --> 00:01:29.756
Disclaimer. I'm not going to sit
up here and read slides to you.

00:01:29.756 --> 00:01:31.758
I will not advocate criminal
activity. You can determine what

00:01:31.758 --> 00:01:33.760
that access is for later. How
many of you notice a certain

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:39.066
folder on my desktop when I came
in here? I'm going to open that.

00:01:39.066 --> 00:01:42.135
What was the folder? You asked
for it. Remember, you asked for

00:01:42.135 --> 00:01:44.771
this. Oh! [ APPLAUSE ] Dang. How
many of you notice the name of

00:01:44.771 --> 00:01:48.141
this song. How many of you are
going to take another weird ass

00:01:48.141 --> 00:01:51.511
look at the name of this song
and read just the first letter

00:01:51.511 --> 00:01:55.148
of the word that is there? First
of all, you are full of crap

00:01:55.148 --> 00:01:58.018
because this is a bull bullshit
and arrogant in our community.

00:01:58.018 --> 00:02:00.554
Get over the bullshit. Every
person in this room, especially,

00:02:00.554 --> 00:02:03.657
if you are from the United
States, look it up. It is

00:02:03.657 --> 00:02:05.993
talking about what type of
research securities are legal

00:02:05.993 --> 00:02:08.862
and not legal. Big joke,
everyone came to DEF CON this

00:02:08.862 --> 00:02:14.868
year and now, you have a record.
Ah-ha see what you did there.

00:02:23.043 --> 00:02:27.247
This is a hacker and if you see
him at the conference thank him

00:02:27.247 --> 00:02:31.051
and shake his hand and thank him
for putting this together. The

00:02:31.051 --> 00:02:34.855
first two talks before DEF CON
actually starts. How many of you

00:02:34.855 --> 00:02:38.325
have been through the hellacious
red line? How many people took

00:02:38.325 --> 00:02:42.929
five hours? Six hours? Seven
hours? How was it this year? [

00:02:42.929 --> 00:02:46.299
APPLAUSE ] So, we got a whole
bunch of red folks and the same

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:49.169
thing with the swag. Was it
awful? Tell the truth. >> Better

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:51.271
than last year. >> Anyway, for
those of you that are familiar

00:02:51.271 --> 00:02:53.273
with the contests and the
puzzles that I do, there are

00:02:53.273 --> 00:02:55.275
people who are working on the
crypto challenges and it takes

00:02:55.275 --> 00:02:57.377
up their entire DEF CON time.
For me, it takes an entire year

00:02:57.377 --> 00:02:59.479
to put together everything that
I do and I'm entirely busy. He

00:02:59.479 --> 00:03:01.682
would always bug me for slides
and a title. I kept putting him

00:03:01.682 --> 00:03:07.687
off and off. So, he would start
making up talk titles. Now, the

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:35.515
title is kind of a tradition.
Highways came up with that. I'm

00:04:41.615 --> 00:04:47.621
the brunt of that joke, as well
as you guys. Anyway. How many of

00:05:02.502 --> 00:05:08.508
you have seen "Spinal Tap"? How
many of you get the reference?

00:05:11.745 --> 00:05:17.751
There is a scene in "Spinal Tap"
and they are like what the hell

00:05:22.556 --> 00:05:28.562
are we going to talk about?
There is some jazz that you can

00:05:32.566 --> 00:05:38.572
bullshit through all of that. I
would encourage you if someone

00:05:41.041 --> 00:05:46.413
says something that doesn't make
sense to you, challenge the

00:05:46.413 --> 00:05:52.419
speaker. Challenge me. That's
how we are going to get better.

00:06:10.337 --> 00:06:16.343
That's the whole point of a
conference like this. Don't go

00:06:18.945 --> 00:06:24.951
in and listen to a guy who is
giving basically a vendor

00:06:28.455 --> 00:06:32.158
speech. If someone is saying
something that is bullshit,

00:06:32.158 --> 00:06:36.363
challenge them. We are going to
get better that way. How many of

00:06:36.363 --> 00:06:42.736
you have heard my 101 speech
before? Because of all of the

00:06:42.736 --> 00:06:49.142
puzzles in crypto and mysterious
things that I do, I'm accused of

00:06:49.142 --> 00:06:55.515
thinking outside of the box.
Most of the time I talk to

00:06:55.515 --> 00:07:01.288
reporters and they are like you
are creative and you think

00:07:01.288 --> 00:07:07.661
outside of the box. That's one
of my biggest pet peeves right

00:07:07.661 --> 00:07:14.034
now. How many of you know where
the term "thinking outside of

00:07:14.034 --> 00:07:20.940
the box" comes from? Connect all
of the dots. Don't let your pen

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:28.381
leave the paper. If this is not
your cup of tea, feel free to

00:07:28.381 --> 00:07:35.288
leave. I will not be offended at
all. I will talk about some

00:07:35.288 --> 00:07:41.628
technical issues, but 101.
That's what it is." So the nine

00:07:41.628 --> 00:07:47.634
dot problem. You are often
presented with connect all of

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:56.676
the dots. Can't lift the pen
from the paper or you have a

00:08:02.349 --> 00:08:07.354
limit etc.? And everyone knows
that you have to extend the

00:08:07.354 --> 00:08:12.425
lines past the mental imposed
box. The presenter, like Tony

00:08:12.425 --> 00:08:16.062
Robinson or something will come
down and like, oh, ha ha I'm

00:08:16.062 --> 00:08:19.165
going to challenge you to be
creative. Especially, for us, as

00:08:19.165 --> 00:08:22.102
a hacker, and coming up with
solutions to problems and as a

00:08:22.102 --> 00:08:24.604
hacker, you have to think
outside of the box and come up

00:08:24.604 --> 00:08:26.806
with a different method or a
abuse the system in a way that

00:08:26.806 --> 00:08:28.808
nobody else has thought of.
There is another examination and

00:08:28.808 --> 00:08:30.810
basically says that all I have
to do to make people sign that

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:32.812
nine dot problem is to tell them
they are mentally constraining

00:08:32.812 --> 00:08:34.814
themselves and there are studies
that show that's not true. There

00:08:34.814 --> 00:08:36.816
are studies that even ahead of
time you cannot -- you have to

00:08:36.816 --> 00:08:38.818
draw outside of this imposed
space in order to solve this

00:08:38.818 --> 00:08:40.820
problem. The same person
(Indiscernible) oh, that

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:42.822
particular puzzle. The ones that
could do it could do it anyway

00:08:42.822 --> 00:08:44.824
and the ones that couldn't,
couldn't. The only thing that

00:08:44.824 --> 00:08:47.260
helped was the study of the
generation. How many of you are

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:54.701
in high school? College
students? Fresh out of school?

00:08:54.701 --> 00:09:00.640
How many people are looking for
jobs? No, I'm serious. It is a

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:26.666
great place to get recruited.
How many people are looking for

00:09:42.715 --> 00:09:48.721
jobs? Let's do that again. How
many people are looking for

00:09:58.231 --> 00:10:01.000
jobs? How many people are
looking to hire someone?

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:07.006
Everybody see that? Okay, just
trying to help. You're welcome.

00:10:11.544 --> 00:10:13.546
[ LAUGHTER ] The reason I bring
that up is that we have a

00:10:13.546 --> 00:10:15.548
generation of wanna be hackers
and the epithermal moments are

00:10:15.548 --> 00:10:17.550
not going to come from thinking
outside of the box, but from

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:19.552
what you are exposed to. I used
to teach at the university and

00:10:19.552 --> 00:10:21.554
students would come up and ask
questions. I would say first,

00:10:21.554 --> 00:10:23.556
have you tried what you have
tested? And I'm afraid that we

00:10:23.556 --> 00:10:25.558
have a generation of hackers
that have or have not be in

00:10:25.558 --> 00:10:27.560
school and they don't tinkle
anymore and we are going to put

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:29.562
constraints on people and if you
do these things, you are going

00:10:29.562 --> 00:10:31.564
to go to jail. You are going to
get arrested. You are going to

00:10:31.564 --> 00:10:33.566
get a record. You are not going
to be able to get a job. We are

00:10:33.566 --> 00:10:35.568
scaring this younger generation
where they are not tinkering

00:10:35.568 --> 00:10:37.570
anymore. We have to break that.
Or we are not going to have

00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:39.572
these epiphrenal moments and I
have a brand-new daughter, who

00:10:39.572 --> 00:10:41.574
is in the front row and I want
her to be able to explore like I

00:10:41.574 --> 00:10:43.576
used to and not go to jail for
it. Not get a record for it.

00:10:43.576 --> 00:10:45.578
That's my bullshit and would you
argue with me? Agree with me?

00:10:45.578 --> 00:10:47.580
That's a good point. I have to
Google proof everything that I

00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:49.582
do. What's going to happen the
first time that someone gets a

00:10:49.582 --> 00:10:51.584
piece of information that I give
and I have to Google proof of it

00:10:51.584 --> 00:10:53.586
because they are going to throw
it into Google? That's correct.

00:10:53.586 --> 00:10:55.588
It goes back to the
informational knowledge and

00:10:55.588 --> 00:10:57.590
gives you the epiphany and so
you can have these pivotal

00:10:57.590 --> 00:10:59.592
moments and break through to the
next great thing. When I was in

00:10:59.592 --> 00:11:01.528
college. Like magic and as a
kid, I would see magic tricks

00:11:01.528 --> 00:11:03.530
and try and figure out how it
was done and when a kid sees

00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:05.532
magic tricks now, he goes to
Google and the magic trick is

00:11:05.532 --> 00:11:07.534
ruined because they have instant
gratification. How many of you

00:11:07.534 --> 00:11:09.536
have looked at the code on your
lanyard already? Well, that code

00:11:09.536 --> 00:11:11.538
is deliberately deceptive. I
will tell you that it is not

00:11:11.538 --> 00:11:13.740
simple. I will also tell you
that everything that I do that

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:15.742
you see in my puzzles and
challenges require people and

00:11:15.742 --> 00:11:17.744
require you to have
communication. If you look at

00:11:17.744 --> 00:11:20.079
where a lot of our great tech
came from, it came are from

00:11:20.079 --> 00:11:22.615
Belfast. How many of you know
what I mean by bell labs? No one

00:11:22.615 --> 00:11:24.951
wants to foot the bill for
places like bell labs. You had a

00:11:24.951 --> 00:11:26.953
giant group of people that had
diverse subject knowledge and

00:11:26.953 --> 00:11:29.122
they all had direct access to
each other. If we don't have

00:11:29.122 --> 00:11:31.257
bell labs anymore, where is the
next great thing going to come

00:11:31.257 --> 00:11:33.426
from? How many of you in here,
Java is your first coding

00:11:33.426 --> 00:11:35.428
language? You don't even know
what an object is. I totally

00:11:35.428 --> 00:11:37.430
disagree with that way of
teaching things. And then, you

00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:39.732
have to think to yourself, why
did we start with Java? We are

00:11:39.732 --> 00:11:42.235
trying to spit out a guy that
can work for a meat factory as

00:11:42.235 --> 00:11:44.370
far as coding is concerned and
you are not going to get

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:46.372
mitigration with that happening.
Talk to me. >> (Indiscernible).

00:11:46.372 --> 00:11:48.808
>> I love the way that you are
thinking. >> Can I interrupt? >>

00:11:48.808 --> 00:11:50.810
Sure. >> I came out of a school
where Java is taught and he said

00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:52.812
that we have an intuitive
knowledge of objects. That's

00:11:52.812 --> 00:11:54.814
bullshit. I grew up with
computers since I was in

00:11:54.814 --> 00:11:56.816
elementary school.
(Indiscernible) when I took

00:11:56.816 --> 00:11:58.818
(Indiscernible) coming out of
high school and I was with a

00:11:58.818 --> 00:12:00.753
group of people all the same
type of nerd as me. Our minds

00:12:00.753 --> 00:12:02.755
were melted by objects when we
has been scripting our entire

00:12:02.755 --> 00:12:04.757
career. It took five weeks of
doing these labs and everything

00:12:04.757 --> 00:12:10.763
for us to have that epiphany,
oh, objects. >> Thank you for

00:12:26.679 --> 00:12:32.685
that comment. It sounds like we
all need to get together and

00:12:57.644 --> 00:13:01.214
have a drink. People who say
stuff like that are full of crap

00:13:01.214 --> 00:13:07.153
and I really mean it. Come over
to me on the conference floor.

00:13:07.153 --> 00:13:13.159
Everyone turn around and say
hello to Russ. He's in charge of

00:13:16.996 --> 00:13:23.002
DEF CON operations and someone
that you can throw things at. >>

00:13:26.806 --> 00:13:32.812
(Indiscernible). >> That's
probably not a good thing to ask

00:13:34.981 --> 00:13:38.051
me because of my background. I
have mixed feelings and would

00:13:38.051 --> 00:13:40.753
argue lit or assembly. If you
take for example, in fact, I'm

00:13:40.753 --> 00:13:43.222
going to talk about that in a
minute. (Indiscernible) kind of

00:13:43.222 --> 00:13:45.725
a little bit of skills that I
think that everyone is

00:13:45.725 --> 00:13:48.194
considering themselves a hacker
is a basic set of skills that

00:13:48.194 --> 00:13:50.663
everyone should have. You would
be amazed that people who are

00:13:50.663 --> 00:13:52.699
basically elite don't have a
knowledge of certain things.

00:13:52.699 --> 00:13:55.868
When I get to that point, I'm
going to explain to you why I

00:13:55.868 --> 00:13:58.104
think that assembly is
important. It has to do with

00:13:58.104 --> 00:14:00.306
extraction and if you don't
understand what is going on

00:14:00.306 --> 00:14:03.009
under the hood, you are not
going to code in certain ways

00:14:03.009 --> 00:14:05.244
and I think that everyone should
understand. Not to the

00:14:05.244 --> 00:14:07.280
nitty-gritty, but fundamentally.
How do I make a fricking

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:09.782
processor for that? If you
explain to a 4-year-old or a

00:14:09.782 --> 00:14:12.185
5-year-old how that extraction
working. I have literally a

00:14:12.185 --> 00:14:17.890
cutter and I can turn it off by
a switch. Everyone goes, I know

00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:23.796
that computers use binary and
ones and zeros. You all must be

00:14:23.796 --> 00:14:29.335
very educated because computers
use binary and I say, what does

00:14:29.335 --> 00:14:31.337
that mean? They don't unction
what it means, they are just

00:14:31.337 --> 00:14:33.339
regurgitating. I wanted to talk
about the life of a file. Yay or

00:14:33.339 --> 00:14:35.341
Ney? Shout it out. >>
(Indiscernible). >> Sure. I can

00:14:35.341 --> 00:14:37.343
also play devil's advocate and
because I have vast knowledge, I

00:14:37.343 --> 00:14:39.345
can play quickly and adequately.
We as hackers need to have the

00:14:39.345 --> 00:14:41.347
benefit of the deep knowledge of
the understanding and taking the

00:14:41.347 --> 00:14:43.349
knowledge that I understand it.
Looking it up in the Chinese

00:14:43.349 --> 00:14:45.351
dictionary is more effective
than drawing my finger in a text

00:14:45.351 --> 00:14:47.353
box. I can use tech in a way
that shortcuts that process and

00:14:47.353 --> 00:14:49.355
goes back to Java and the whole
point of Java programming is to

00:14:49.355 --> 00:14:51.357
extract. Let's move past that.
Basically, I was going to talk

00:14:51.357 --> 00:14:53.359
about how DAT files are created.
I believe that mathematics is

00:14:53.359 --> 00:14:55.361
the language of science. Anyway,
we don't want to talk about that

00:14:55.361 --> 00:14:57.363
so... I'm pausing long enough
for you to read the slides for

00:14:57.363 --> 00:14:59.365
those of you that were
interested in how to break a/b.

00:14:59.365 --> 00:15:01.300
How many of you know what movie
this picture is from? He's

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:03.302
trying to seek out the magical
power and it is kind of

00:15:03.302 --> 00:15:05.304
Dorothy's slippers. Go play with
it. If you don't know what it

00:15:05.304 --> 00:15:07.306
is, how many of you know what
MetaSport is? The authors of

00:15:07.306 --> 00:15:09.308
this are here at DEF CON.
Everyone asks my opinion, who

00:15:09.308 --> 00:15:11.310
should I hear talk? If you want
to have your mind blown, go and

00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:13.312
listen to Gary's talk. He's a
pure genius and created chip

00:15:13.312 --> 00:15:15.314
set. We are slowly moving down a
step. First, we were using stuff

00:15:15.314 --> 00:15:17.316
in the software. And then, OS.
And then, the network. And now,

00:15:17.316 --> 00:15:19.318
you are hearing about BIOS and
the shift is happening. Shift

00:15:19.318 --> 00:15:21.320
set takes you lower in talking
to processors and the reason

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:23.322
that it is applicable in this
day in age is because it is

00:15:23.322 --> 00:15:25.324
applicable to Hypergliser. How
many of you know what a

00:15:25.324 --> 00:15:27.326
Hypergliser is? I'm not trying
to make you feel stupid. It is

00:15:27.326 --> 00:15:29.328
the underlying piece that allows
you to have the virtualization

00:15:29.328 --> 00:15:31.330
properly and because a lot of
our systems are on the cloud and

00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:33.332
everything else and learning how
to attack viper and getting down

00:15:33.332 --> 00:15:35.334
lower in the stack is important.
The purpose for me, up here in

00:15:35.334 --> 00:15:37.336
the 101 and throwing you nuggets
of information that you may not

00:15:37.336 --> 00:15:39.338
have heard of or thought of.
This is 101. If you want the

00:15:39.338 --> 00:15:41.340
deep DAT stuff, start tomorrow.
I'm going to give you the quick

00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:43.342
basics that are a pet peeve of
mine. I was thinking of taking

00:15:43.342 --> 00:15:45.344
this out of my talk this year.
The reason I left them this is

00:15:45.344 --> 00:15:47.346
because still to this day, I'm
having interactions with people

00:15:47.346 --> 00:15:53.352
on how to security conference
with people and some of the

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:18.604
things require a fundamental
knowledge that some people are

00:17:18.604 --> 00:17:24.610
lacking even though they may be
a genius in a particular area.

00:17:29.215 --> 00:17:35.221
If you consider yourself a
computer person or a hacker, you

00:17:39.058 --> 00:17:45.064
should know these things. It is
really fundamental stuff. So,

00:17:47.967 --> 00:17:53.973
here we go. How am I doing on
time? I have no idea? Anyone?

00:18:00.379 --> 00:18:06.385
What are we supposed to go to,
four? Everyone hold up your

00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:17.096
right hand. We are going to
count in binary. If you don't

00:18:21.801 --> 00:18:27.807
know how to count in binary, I'm
going to cry because you are at

00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:40.286
DEF CON. It 1, 2, 3, 4. All
right, you have all flipped me

00:18:46.792 --> 00:18:54.567
off at DEF CON. If you can't
take bits and write it, out in a

00:18:54.567 --> 00:19:00.506
series and I mean quickly, then
go home and learn how to do

00:19:15.988 --> 00:19:21.994
that. You need to know how to do
that, especially, if you are

00:19:35.875 --> 00:19:37.877
going to do reversing and
hacking, it is going to help

00:19:37.877 --> 00:19:40.546
you. I talk to people who are
way above my level on a lot of

00:19:40.546 --> 00:19:42.548
subjects that can't do simple
things like that. They rely on

00:19:42.548 --> 00:19:44.550
their tools so much. It is
amazing. The same thing with

00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:46.685
hex. [ NO AUDIO ] Interesting,
what would be the largest digit

00:19:46.685 --> 00:19:48.687
possible in Bart Simpson's phone
number? Why? How many fingers

00:19:48.687 --> 00:19:50.690
did the simple son characters
have? What did they count on? >>

00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:52.692
(Indiscernible). [ LAUGHTER ] >>
What number base do you think

00:19:52.692 --> 00:19:54.827
that a pirate would count in?
Radial. 6. Why? Five fingers and

00:19:54.827 --> 00:19:56.829
a hook. We created a thing
called radix. It is a

00:19:56.829 --> 00:19:58.998
hexadecimal. There is a word
list out there for you. If you

00:19:58.998 --> 00:20:01.167
don't, know what they are, I
would suggest you look them up.

00:20:01.167 --> 00:20:03.335
By the way, I totally encourage
you to approach the speakers at

00:20:03.335 --> 00:20:05.704
DEF CON. I say this every year,
if you approach someone at DEF

00:20:05.704 --> 00:20:08.240
CON and they are too high and
mighty to talk to you, then they

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:10.576
are a douchebag and I don't want
them here anyway. We have too

00:20:10.576 --> 00:20:12.578
many people in our community
that think they are rock stars

00:20:12.578 --> 00:20:15.114
and too cool to talk to anybody
and that's got to stop. We have

00:20:15.114 --> 00:20:17.116
enough problems with people
trying to cram back doors into

00:20:17.116 --> 00:20:19.452
our back systems and it has to
stop. I love our community and I

00:20:19.452 --> 00:20:21.787
dedicate a lot of my time and
money to make DEF CON happen

00:20:21.787 --> 00:20:24.490
every year. By the way, going
back to my discussion on

00:20:24.490 --> 00:20:30.496
tinkering, if you don't know how
to set-up a VP and experiment

00:20:36.702 --> 00:20:39.705
with stuff that would otherwise
put you in jail in the real

00:20:39.705 --> 00:20:42.374
world, learn. The players are
free. People are giving out VM's

00:20:42.374 --> 00:20:45.478
of stuff and virtual boxes and
one of the ways of doing it

00:20:45.478 --> 00:20:47.880
without going to jail these days
is virtualization. Any comments

00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:51.016
on the list so far? Come on. You
guys are smart. I don't

00:20:51.016 --> 00:20:54.386
generally give my slides out and
this is the first time I that I

00:20:54.386 --> 00:20:57.990
have allowed my 101 be recorded.
I know when I go for a new talk

00:20:57.990 --> 00:21:01.527
and I watch it, and realize it
is six years old and I wasted my

00:21:01.527 --> 00:21:04.430
time, but I will make these
slides available on the lost boy

00:21:04.430 --> 00:21:07.800
website. If I forget to do that,
send me an email and say, you

00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:11.170
said you would put those slides
up, and I will put them up. >>

00:21:11.170 --> 00:21:14.039
Thank you. >> Yep. I want to
make a comment about tinkering

00:21:14.039 --> 00:21:16.942
as far as hardware is concerned.
How many of you know about

00:21:16.942 --> 00:21:19.345
Digi-Key? It breaks my heart.
How many of you remember

00:21:19.345 --> 00:21:21.747
(Indiscernible) from Radio Shack
and it was printed on graph

00:21:21.747 --> 00:21:24.884
paper and how many of you, that
book changed your life? It hurt

00:21:24.884 --> 00:21:28.821
my soul that Radio Shack turned
into a place that only sold cell

00:21:28.821 --> 00:21:33.425
phones and why? Because that was
a place that you went and

00:21:33.425 --> 00:21:36.862
tinkered with stuff. Nowadays,
we have suppliers and that's

00:21:36.862 --> 00:21:40.699
enough. Go to the websites of
these companies and request

00:21:40.699 --> 00:21:44.904
their catalogs and I say this
about Digi-Key because it is

00:21:44.904 --> 00:21:50.242
larger than most phone books and
it is great for if you need to

00:21:50.242 --> 00:21:53.312
drill something underneath.
Coming up with the challenges

00:21:53.312 --> 00:21:58.817
and it is hard because I have to
stay ahead of you guys, which

00:21:58.817 --> 00:22:01.954
are smarter and I have to have
stuff that is Google proof and

00:22:01.954 --> 00:22:05.157
solvable within a finite amount
of time. Every year, I think I'm

00:22:05.157 --> 00:22:07.159
going to learn a little bit
about like getting a

00:22:07.159 --> 00:22:09.161
subscription to a magazine that
I have no interest about. So,

00:22:09.161 --> 00:22:11.163
for you, get the Digi-Key
catalog and thumb through it

00:22:11.163 --> 00:22:13.165
when you are in your bathroom.
>> (Indiscernible). >> Yeah,

00:22:13.165 --> 00:22:15.201
excellent. This goes deeper into
my secret. How many of you know

00:22:15.201 --> 00:22:18.070
who Lady Ava is? She puts out a
list of where you can get free

00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:20.706
samples of and all you have to
do is say I'm going to make

00:22:20.706 --> 00:22:23.175
fifty thousand of it. You go and
make a fake Gmail account. Often

00:22:23.175 --> 00:22:25.444
times you will get free shipping
and they are going to put

00:22:25.444 --> 00:22:28.480
T-shirts in, as well. Get on
some of these lists and figure

00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:31.550
out where you can get these
parts. There are people who make

00:22:31.550 --> 00:22:34.587
enclosures and I have scripts
that I run and free stuff every

00:22:34.587 --> 00:22:37.656
often and I figured out where
the window of abuse is. Don't

00:22:37.656 --> 00:22:40.960
get greedy and if you go to
maxim and request a chip, they

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:44.530
are going to send you five. Lady
Ava keeps a list. How are we

00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:47.066
doing? Are you bored? Am I
talking too fast? Louder? Is

00:22:47.066 --> 00:22:51.670
this better? >> Yeah. >> Here's
another fun way of doing an

00:22:51.670 --> 00:22:59.411
exercise regardless of what
field you are in. Pick an

00:22:59.411 --> 00:23:05.351
illegal activity and find a
legal way of doing the activity.

00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:13.826
You will be amazed of what you
will learn. How many of you read

00:23:18.631 --> 00:23:26.372
"spam nation" and he talked
about the Russian hackers and

00:23:26.372 --> 00:23:32.378
everything else. He talked about
what a lot of us know about. If

00:23:36.415 --> 00:23:42.421
you are trying to procure an
infrastructure and have it not

00:23:44.890 --> 00:23:50.629
traced back to you. By the way,
I'm not going to talk about why

00:23:50.629 --> 00:23:56.635
I have the right to privacy and
if I hear the argument, I'm not

00:23:59.338 --> 00:24:05.277
doing anything illegal and have
nothing to hide. Well, when you

00:24:10.716 --> 00:24:16.722
are having sex with your wives,
it is not illegal, but do you

00:24:24.229 --> 00:24:30.235
want someone watching that?
Taking a dump in the bathroom?

00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:40.646
I'm not going to have an
argument with you why I have to

00:24:48.153 --> 00:24:54.159
justify why I should have
privacy and this is some of the

00:24:56.996 --> 00:24:59.565
stuff that I have done in the
past year and trying to find

00:24:59.565 --> 00:25:02.167
legal ways of doing illegal
activities and there is places

00:25:02.167 --> 00:25:04.169
where you can go online and
register a email and there are

00:25:04.169 --> 00:25:06.171
many places that check the
address of the registration of

00:25:06.171 --> 00:25:08.173
the card and many of the gift
cards that you buy are going to

00:25:08.173 --> 00:25:10.175
get flagged and you can't use
them to buy certain things like

00:25:10.175 --> 00:25:12.177
VPN access. What these allow,
you buy them with cash, and you

00:25:12.177 --> 00:25:14.179
register an address for the
card. The address can be

00:25:14.179 --> 00:25:16.181
anything that you want. I will
tell you a hint. Certain sites

00:25:16.181 --> 00:25:18.183
are going to look at the
geolocation of the IP address

00:25:18.183 --> 00:25:20.185
and just find a particular VPN
the state that matches what you

00:25:20.185 --> 00:25:22.187
registered with the card. Some
of the fun that I found with

00:25:22.187 --> 00:25:24.189
this. How many of you see the
charge on December 9, 2014.

00:25:24.189 --> 00:25:26.191
Yeah, that was me playing with
the illegal stuff and someone

00:25:26.191 --> 00:25:28.193
tried to charge $1 million to
that card. I thought it was

00:25:28.193 --> 00:25:30.195
funny and the most funny thing
about it, if you look; it is

00:25:30.195 --> 00:25:32.197
listed as a reoccurring
installment. Wait a second.

00:25:32.197 --> 00:25:34.199
These guys are completely off
their rocker until they did it

00:25:34.199 --> 00:25:36.201
again. [ LAUGHTER ] And again.
If you look, I have two charges

00:25:36.201 --> 00:25:38.203
on 12/9 for restricted country
and when you do this, this is

00:25:38.203 --> 00:25:40.205
what you find out when you stuff
like this. A million dollars and

00:25:40.205 --> 00:25:42.207
this one had $100 load on it.
Don't get caught up with the

00:25:42.207 --> 00:25:44.209
media definition of what a
hacker is. Anyone that has

00:25:44.209 --> 00:25:46.211
pressed your sins? How many of
you have a yellow badge? For

00:25:46.211 --> 00:25:48.213
those of you that are new to DEF
CON, we have special press

00:25:48.213 --> 00:25:50.215
policies and we try and be
hacker and anonymity-friendly

00:25:50.215 --> 00:25:52.217
and anyone with a big yellow
disk around their neck and if

00:25:52.217 --> 00:25:54.219
you turn it around and the back
of the press badge this year is

00:25:54.219 --> 00:25:56.221
a guy like this. [ LAUGHTER ]
The 101 panel probably said, I

00:25:56.221 --> 00:25:58.223
was wasn't in here, but they
usually do. Take it for what

00:25:58.223 --> 00:26:00.159
it's worth; the press is not
your friend. They really aren't.

00:26:00.159 --> 00:26:02.161
I have seen friends get burned.
I have been burned. There are

00:26:02.161 --> 00:26:04.163
very few in the media that I
trust. They are coming here

00:26:04.163 --> 00:26:06.165
because they want to get a Sound
Byte and put something up in the

00:26:06.165 --> 00:26:08.167
news and that is going to shock
mom and pop U.S.A. Be careful

00:26:08.167 --> 00:26:10.169
what you say to anyone in the
press. Be aware of the fact that

00:26:10.169 --> 00:26:12.171
you are going to be misquoted.
That's the end of my rant. What

00:26:12.171 --> 00:26:14.173
do you think about that? Do you
think I'm full of crap? Tell the

00:26:14.173 --> 00:26:17.075
truth. [ APPLAUSE ] So, that's
the end of my little notes

00:26:17.075 --> 00:26:23.081
there. I'm happy to answer
questions and anything that you

00:26:25.317 --> 00:26:31.323
guys have for whatever time we
have left. Can you use the mic

00:26:36.061 --> 00:26:42.067
so people can hear? >> Why did
you stick a hubcap on us this

00:26:47.606 --> 00:26:53.612
year? >> For those of you that
are new to DEF CON, we do a

00:26:59.985 --> 00:27:05.924
Tick-Tock cycle and Joe Bran was
one of the first to do an

00:27:10.662 --> 00:27:16.435
electronic badge. Every
conference has an electronic

00:27:16.435 --> 00:27:22.441
badge. It would be pass say. We
always try and do something new

00:27:25.744 --> 00:27:32.484
and different and fun. This is a
non-electronic year. It was

00:27:32.484 --> 00:27:38.490
actually my wife's idea to come
up with the record. Not that I'm

00:27:42.995 --> 00:27:49.001
trying to throw the hate at her.
>> She's a lot smarter than you.

00:27:55.107 --> 00:28:01.313
>> Yes. These are seven-inch. I
couldn't do a five-inch because

00:28:01.313 --> 00:28:07.319
no one makes records anymore. By
the way, I will tell you here,

00:28:15.961 --> 00:28:21.967
but I'm going to talk more in
detail about the badges

00:28:30.342 --> 00:28:36.348
tomorrow, but I will tell you
that we printed hatch as many LP

00:28:47.326 --> 00:28:53.332
records that Taylor swift has
put out in her entire career.

00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:07.646
Also, the vinyl in these, when
they came here, weighed over two

00:29:09.715 --> 00:29:15.721
tons. That's how many people are
going to be at DEF CON this

00:29:53.291 --> 00:29:55.894
year. Any other questions? I
almost forgot! Thank you for

00:29:55.894 --> 00:29:59.264
reminding me. Those of you that
follow me on Twitter, I got a

00:29:59.264 --> 00:30:01.867
tweet back from William
Schattner. Are you a fan? Fake

00:30:01.867 --> 00:30:05.771
it if you are not. I'm going to
stick with our own policy and I

00:30:05.771 --> 00:30:08.874
would like to take a selfie per
request of William Schattner of

00:30:08.874 --> 00:30:12.277
this sign. I'm going to hold my
phone up and send it to him. [

00:30:12.277 --> 00:30:18.283
LAUGHTER ] Thank you. [ APPLAUSE
] These are for tomorrow and I'm

00:30:27.926 --> 00:30:33.932
going to explain in detail. This
is an Uber badge. This year,

00:30:47.813 --> 00:30:53.819
there are six radioactive
badges. I'm going to explain

00:30:57.656 --> 00:31:03.595
that tomorrow. Thank you for
coming. [ APPLAUSE ]
