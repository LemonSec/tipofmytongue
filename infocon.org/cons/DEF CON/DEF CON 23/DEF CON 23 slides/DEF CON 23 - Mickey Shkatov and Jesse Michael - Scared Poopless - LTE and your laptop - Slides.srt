00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.673
 >> alright, you hear me
alright? >> Good morning

00:00:06.673 --> 00:00:14.815
everyone. >> Good morning. >>
All right. Ready to see some

00:00:14.815 --> 00:00:25.192
cool shit? >> Yeah. >> Okay.
Now, we are about to scare you a

00:00:25.192 --> 00:00:33.333
little bit, but a little bit of
disclaimer and trigger warning

00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:43.710
we use a lot of stock photos
just for kicks so enjoy them and

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:54.087
thank you to Goldy and Smig, you
don't know them, but we do. They

00:00:54.087 --> 00:01:04.464
helped us out they are awesome.
We would like to say a big thank

00:01:04.464 --> 00:01:12.606
you to (indiscernible) thank you
guys. It has been a pleasure

00:01:12.606 --> 00:01:20.747
working with you compared to
some others. These two CDs have

00:01:20.747 --> 00:01:29.623
been recorded and that is length
for the patch that has been

00:01:29.623 --> 00:01:39.232
released this morning. If you
need a minute to copy it -- and

00:01:39.232 --> 00:01:45.906
we're going do something
different this time and start

00:01:45.906 --> 00:01:52.579
with a demo. Sound broke?
(indiscernible) all right. I'm

00:01:52.579 --> 00:02:01.455
duplicating. Here you go. All
right. H is going to be ugly.

00:02:01.455 --> 00:02:11.832
Got a little OCD. Here you go.
So what we have here on the

00:02:11.832 --> 00:02:20.707
table is a tablet. No wires.
Windows 1. 1 standard tablet the

00:02:20.707 --> 00:02:29.583
only difference is this has 4GLP
enabled. Now, to show you that

00:02:29.583 --> 00:02:39.192
-- all right. T mobile. We're
all good. Tablet is fine. Now I

00:02:39.192 --> 00:02:48.068
have a server, amazon that I'm
going to connect to. And I'm

00:02:48.068 --> 00:02:56.209
going the start listening. In
the meantime I'm going to reboot

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:06.586
the tablet. Just to be clear, it
is only LT right now, now WiFi.

00:03:06.586 --> 00:03:15.462
I will reboot the tablet real
quick. Watch the left side of

00:03:15.462 --> 00:03:22.135
the screen and the tablet
restarting. Time for awkward

00:03:22.135 --> 00:03:30.277
silence. If you guys have any
questions, this the DEF CON,

00:03:30.277 --> 00:03:38.418
feel free to interrupt. >> Left
side is your (indiscernible) >>

00:03:38.418 --> 00:03:45.092
Yes. Discount they believe.
Externally on the internet. This

00:03:45.092 --> 00:03:52.499
is externally on the internet.
>> (indiscernible) >> Um, no.

00:03:52.499 --> 00:04:01.374
(laughter) why is the tablet so
slow? Can I do this with

00:04:01.374 --> 00:04:10.984
iPhones? >> No. Here we go. So
wait for it. Just keeping you

00:04:10.984 --> 00:04:20.594
alive. What you see on the left
side a reverse shell coming from

00:04:20.594 --> 00:04:29.469
the internal LT module. This is
not fun part yet. Wait wait

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:39.079
wait. Told you I'm going the
scare you. Just have to wait for

00:04:39.079 --> 00:04:44.985
the tablet. Yes. >>
(indiscernible) >> Not they

00:04:44.985 --> 00:04:52.392
tablet the internal LT module
inside the tablet connected back

00:04:52.392 --> 00:05:03.503
to my server. >> Take a mic. >>
So we have no code running into

00:05:03.503 --> 00:05:10.911
the tablet but we have
compromised the firmware of just

00:05:10.911 --> 00:05:18.318
the LT at this point. >>
Starting point LT compromising

00:05:18.318 --> 00:05:28.695
LT module. Sorry. >> So we have
a tablet up. Now, what I'm going

00:05:28.695 --> 00:05:39.072
to do from remote is I'm going
to get a malicious CD image from

00:05:39.072 --> 00:05:47.214
our trusted server (laughter)
I'm going to run a script now

00:05:47.214 --> 00:05:54.621
keep your eye on the tablet.
(indiscernible) (laughter) I am.

00:05:54.621 --> 00:06:04.231
This a the problem with a demo.
Windows has this thing they need

00:06:04.231 --> 00:06:12.372
to refresh their devices. Let do
this again. Hacking in progress.

00:06:12.372 --> 00:06:19.779
All right. Wait for the
printers. There you go. Anyone

00:06:19.779 --> 00:06:30.156
can think of a problem with this
demo? >> Yes. >> Speak up. >>

00:06:30.156 --> 00:06:38.298
(indiscernible) >> Say that
again. >> I didn't do nothing on

00:06:38.298 --> 00:06:44.204
the tablet but running a
firmware update. >>

00:06:44.204 --> 00:06:52.345
(indiscernible) >> What I'm
doing in front of you is telling

00:06:52.345 --> 00:07:01.955
the module to display a CD ROM
to host platform. Yes. >> The

00:07:01.955 --> 00:07:09.362
device manager refresh. This is
something odd with windows we

00:07:09.362 --> 00:07:19.739
have to tell it to sometimes not
always we have to tell it to

00:07:19.739 --> 00:07:27.147
refresh and rescan devices for
no apparent reason. They just

00:07:27.147 --> 00:07:34.554
need some sort of interruption.
Technically, yes. So anyone else

00:07:34.554 --> 00:07:41.962
can think of another problem
within demo? Come on. Autorun.

00:07:41.962 --> 00:07:50.837
Who said that? Okay. He knows
the talk. We all fail. All

00:07:50.837 --> 00:07:58.978
right. Autorun is enabled is
which is not enabled by default

00:07:58.978 --> 00:08:10.824
in windows but -- this is a part
where I scare you. I am going to

00:08:10.824 --> 00:08:17.497
go into (indiscernible) opening
a command prompt and shutting

00:08:17.497 --> 00:08:27.107
down into options. This is going
to be fast so I do a

00:08:27.107 --> 00:08:35.248
troubleshoot and now the tablet
restarts and will appear in the

00:08:35.248 --> 00:08:43.390
virus window. There are ways
around that. If you shut the

00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:52.999
screen off, the tablet you think
it is asleep, but still awake. I

00:08:52.999 --> 00:09:01.875
go to bed you would never know.
So what happens now is

00:09:01.875 --> 00:09:09.282
everything power cycles, so the
module itself is restarting and

00:09:09.282 --> 00:09:19.659
it is trying to require 4LG
signal and go back to my in my

00:09:19.659 --> 00:09:27.801
amazon system. Now we wait. Any
other questions? How much room

00:09:27.801 --> 00:09:36.676
do I have to drop on the module?
Sixty megs. >> (indiscernible)

00:09:36.676 --> 00:09:47.053
>> Power shell. What? How much
room do I have on the module to

00:09:47.053 --> 00:09:56.663
drop in the file? Sixty megs.
Here we go. Good thing I have

00:09:56.663 --> 00:10:04.804
this guy. So I'm loading or
telling the module to display

00:10:04.804 --> 00:10:13.680
another composition to the host
and when that is done, I'm going

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:23.289
to end this script and this goes
into you can't see it clearly

00:10:23.289 --> 00:10:31.431
but goes to reboot and disables
it. >> (indiscernible) >> Nope.

00:10:31.431 --> 00:10:38.838
We will get to that. >>
(indiscernible) >> What? >>

00:10:38.838 --> 00:10:45.512
(indiscernible) >> The keyboard
driver, are we emulating a

00:10:45.512 --> 00:10:54.387
keyboard driver? >> Yes. We
emulate a USB device. This is a

00:10:54.387 --> 00:11:02.529
live video. >> (indiscernible)
>> what we have a remote across

00:11:02.529 --> 00:11:09.936
the internet USB mouse keyboard
and device. Someone scared? >>

00:11:09.936 --> 00:11:16.609
(indiscernible) >> Yeah. >>
What? Someone asked a question?

00:11:16.609 --> 00:11:25.485
Which tablet does this effect?
This is not any problem with the

00:11:25.485 --> 00:11:35.094
tablet itself. We're going to go
into that so to scare you more

00:11:35.094 --> 00:11:43.236
this has nothing to do with
specific plate forms. This will

00:11:43.236 --> 00:11:53.613
work on any machine that has M2
slot and we will get to that

00:11:53.613 --> 00:12:01.754
too. Lap demos are so boring. >>
(indiscernible) >> Has anyone

00:12:01.754 --> 00:12:08.428
(indiscernible) taken to dinner?
>> Maybe. (laughter) I don't

00:12:08.428 --> 00:12:15.835
know anyone from (indiscernible)
so while this tablet is booting

00:12:15.835 --> 00:12:23.243
I have the module pinging
google. Now, here is another

00:12:23.243 --> 00:12:32.118
scary thing I will put thing air
plan mode. Watch the ping.

00:12:32.118 --> 00:12:39.525
(CLAPPING) it time for that
tradition. (laughter) is it? >>

00:12:39.525 --> 00:12:50.637
Yes. >> So give me one second I
need to finish this demo. So now

00:12:50.637 --> 00:12:57.310
I'm disabling my autoconnect
back script and rebooting the

00:12:57.310 --> 00:13:05.451
module. The module is you
brought your own. The module is

00:13:05.451 --> 00:13:14.327
restarting and if you look to
the right, the right side, there

00:13:14.327 --> 00:13:23.202
takes a while. We have normal LT
connection. Just normal. DEF CON

00:13:23.202 --> 00:13:32.078
is canceled by the way. No. >>
(indiscernible) >> You have to

00:13:32.078 --> 00:13:39.485
wait for the talk itself. We
started with the demo.

00:13:39.485 --> 00:13:47.627
(laughter) >> All right. So
there is this tradition at DEF

00:13:47.627 --> 00:13:57.236
CON where the goons come and
tell the speaker to take a shot.

00:13:57.236 --> 00:14:08.347
So we said this time we're going
to let the goons take a shot so

00:14:08.347 --> 00:14:18.725
any goons in here now? Are you a
goon? >> So goons are not

00:14:18.725 --> 00:14:26.866
allowed to take a shot. We have
dispensation for the speaker.

00:14:26.866 --> 00:14:35.742
These guys are not allowed to
drink while on duty. I would

00:14:35.742 --> 00:14:46.119
love to give them a shot but
they are not allowed to do that.

00:14:46.119 --> 00:14:54.994
So anyway, so don't drink yet.
So this is for your new

00:14:54.994 --> 00:15:06.105
speakers, and I want to take a
shot for the new -- so it's all

00:15:06.105 --> 00:15:14.981
about you, so cheers to anyone.
(CLAPPING) >> Now you have to

00:15:14.981 --> 00:15:23.856
take another one. We fucked up
and didn't give them their first

00:15:23.856 --> 00:15:34.967
shot. He has a special stash. We
have to do this. >> You want to

00:15:34.967 --> 00:15:45.344
do it Scout. >> I am totally up
for this. >> All right. If

00:15:45.344 --> 00:15:56.455
anyone else want to do a shot
this is time to come up here. >>

00:15:56.455 --> 00:16:05.331
All right. Not the stage.
(CLAPPING) so you guy -- I want

00:16:05.331 --> 00:16:15.708
you guys to come on stage. You
get the fire ball. >> Shit. >>

00:16:15.708 --> 00:16:27.553
Come on. I want you guys to come
up on the stage while we do it.

00:16:27.553 --> 00:16:36.429
So this is because we didn't
shoot them the first time. This

00:16:36.429 --> 00:16:43.836
is revenge people, revenge shot.
>> So these guys (indiscernible)

00:16:43.836 --> 00:16:53.446
one second. Use a cup. These
guys represent all of you, so to

00:16:53.446 --> 00:17:01.587
DEF CON. (CLAPPING) >> Now, we
can start the presentation. So

00:17:01.587 --> 00:17:10.463
first of all to the tablet
question guy, this a Dell. This

00:17:10.463 --> 00:17:19.338
is not any OEM problem. Doesn't
have to do with what device

00:17:19.338 --> 00:17:28.214
you're using the problem we with
going to describe is a simple

00:17:28.214 --> 00:17:35.621
firmware update for internal
module. Adam -- these guys never

00:17:35.621 --> 00:17:41.527
forget secure firmware updates.
If you remember (indiscernible)

00:17:41.527 --> 00:17:51.137
everyone remembers bad USB. Cool
thing in the medial it is a bad

00:17:51.137 --> 00:17:58.544
way of doing security updates.
The problem is across many

00:17:58.544 --> 00:18:07.420
platforms and devices and we
want to show this as a not

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:13.326
specific vendor specific
something, this is across the

00:18:13.326 --> 00:18:22.201
market a problem. Hi. That is
Jesse he is awesome. He also

00:18:22.201 --> 00:18:31.077
talks and will do it later. So
we're talking about in internal

00:18:31.077 --> 00:18:40.686
3G, 4G module that people use in
their tablets, the in ones ultra

00:18:40.686 --> 00:18:50.296
books you name the factor if it
has the right connector in it

00:18:50.296 --> 00:19:01.407
you can put the module in. Put
in a sim card and good to go.

00:19:01.407 --> 00:19:09.548
You see these devices all around
mainly in big corporations. The

00:19:09.548 --> 00:19:16.956
reason we mention business
devices because it is easier to

00:19:16.956 --> 00:19:25.097
get with support LG or G
connective. Some are these are

00:19:25.097 --> 00:19:33.973
sold as LTE computer LTE laptop.
Anyone have a LT in laptop

00:19:33.973 --> 00:19:42.114
tablet or device this raise your
hands. Talk to Charlie Miller.

00:19:42.114 --> 00:19:49.522
What about hot spots? Good
question. Same problem. Okay. So

00:19:49.522 --> 00:19:58.397
how are these cards or modules
plugged into your lab top or

00:19:58.397 --> 00:20:06.539
tablet. We have this M2
connector. What you see is the

00:20:06.539 --> 00:20:15.414
picture one and the key. So it
is basically the replacement for

00:20:15.414 --> 00:20:22.822
mini-PCI cards so smaller and
everything is using this new

00:20:22.822 --> 00:20:32.431
slot. If you are a device and
mini-PCI card and you want to

00:20:32.431 --> 00:20:42.041
put the card in but looks like
the same connector that is it.

00:20:42.041 --> 00:20:50.182
This thing has these pro-focals
passes over it. 2PCA buss, USB,

00:20:50.182 --> 00:21:00.559
hell, yes. This thing goes with
USB 3. 0 as well and USB3 is

00:21:00.559 --> 00:21:11.670
fast as hell. So you can do a
lot of bad things fast. So why

00:21:11.670 --> 00:21:20.546
did we choose to go with this
device anyway? We could have

00:21:20.546 --> 00:21:27.219
choosen anything else. Any
internal device would work the

00:21:27.219 --> 00:21:36.095
point is not the device. The
point is this is a platform

00:21:36.095 --> 00:21:42.768
insider net. This is a
independent device inside your

00:21:42.768 --> 00:21:50.176
machine. This is how they look.
These modules are available

00:21:50.176 --> 00:21:58.317
worldwide. obviously you can get
them on e-mail for 50 bucks.

00:21:58.317 --> 00:22:04.990
Yes? >> (indiscernible) >> Some
organizations use these devices

00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:14.600
to backhaul data over firewalls.
>> We can do that. Can you write

00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:21.273
that done? (laughter) okay
anyone else getting more scared?

00:22:21.273 --> 00:22:29.415
(laughter) >> Airplane mode --
don't matter to us. Yes? >>

00:22:29.415 --> 00:22:39.024
(indiscernible) >> I have no
idea. Do you have an ATM to give

00:22:39.024 --> 00:22:44.930
me? All right. Any other
questions? Interrupts, comments

00:22:44.930 --> 00:22:53.072
random remarks. >> So this
device was found because it has

00:22:53.072 --> 00:23:01.947
the LT connection so we do stuff
over the internet like this.

00:23:01.947 --> 00:23:10.089
Yes? >> (indiscernible) >> These
come in PCA as well. PCI

00:23:10.089 --> 00:23:18.964
compliance. I don't do that. >>
as a hardware guy PCI compliance

00:23:18.964 --> 00:23:25.638
doesn't really talk to me. >>
(indiscernible) >> (laughter)

00:23:25.638 --> 00:23:33.779
you have a question? How is this
powered? With the internal

00:23:33.779 --> 00:23:41.186
platform power. That depends per
platform some devices will have

00:23:41.186 --> 00:23:51.563
a direct link to the battery for
this thing so when you come up

00:23:51.563 --> 00:24:00.439
from sleep you will be powered
on and connected so you have

00:24:00.439 --> 00:24:07.112
consisted connection across
three boots. Most of them will

00:24:07.112 --> 00:24:16.722
power cycle everything that is
what we saw in the demo when we

00:24:16.722 --> 00:24:27.099
had to power cycle and we had to
wait for connect . Any other

00:24:27.099 --> 00:24:34.506
questions? This the not iPhone.
What? >> (indiscernible) >> That

00:24:34.506 --> 00:24:43.382
will be December 2018. Any other
questions? How the hell are we

00:24:43.382 --> 00:24:50.789
going to fix this? This has
alreadybeen fixed. Let's talk

00:24:50.789 --> 00:24:58.931
about the bigger picture in a
second. The patch has been

00:24:58.931 --> 00:25:06.338
released today. Awesome way of
communication with them. I did

00:25:06.338 --> 00:25:14.480
not expect that but it was very
responsive and very pleasant

00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:21.153
communication over months.
Kudos. Now let's talk about the

00:25:21.153 --> 00:25:31.530
hack itself. How are we on time?
Shit. Want to help me. So we

00:25:31.530 --> 00:25:41.140
have this -- as we said at the
beginning the entry point is

00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:49.281
malware running a software
update for the module or user is

00:25:49.281 --> 00:25:56.688
running malicious update. The
update utility we have for this

00:25:56.688 --> 00:26:04.830
specific module is running on
windows. The firm wire is packed

00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:12.971
into the utility. When we looked
at the firmware update utility

00:26:12.971 --> 00:26:20.379
we started looking around and
some things we spotted some

00:26:20.379 --> 00:26:29.254
things like Linux strings so it
looked interesting so we found a

00:26:29.254 --> 00:26:37.396
password file with the hard
coded DES password. We were able

00:26:37.396 --> 00:26:47.005
the crack that in about four
hours on the GPU cluster and get

00:26:47.005 --> 00:26:55.881
the password for the device
image and we wanted to take a

00:26:55.881 --> 00:27:04.756
closer look at the hardware
itself. >> We have a user name

00:27:04.756 --> 00:27:13.632
and password so all your units
this is how you crack windows.

00:27:13.632 --> 00:27:23.242
So we're looking at this thing.
It is this big. Tiny. And what

00:27:23.242 --> 00:27:32.851
are we going do we are hardware
people let's look at the test

00:27:32.851 --> 00:27:41.727
pad. We start with this. And
then we go okay, we accidently

00:27:41.727 --> 00:27:52.104
bricked it. >> So we probed each
of test points all found the UR

00:27:52.104 --> 00:28:00.245
connection so two of those wired
are sod considered and another

00:28:00.245 --> 00:28:11.356
wired to reset and one to ground
and we were able to do this for

00:28:11.356 --> 00:28:20.966
a couple of modules but do you
know how many we have gone

00:28:20.966 --> 00:28:30.576
through now? >> We broke about
four or six. got >> This was

00:28:30.576 --> 00:28:38.717
cumbersome to solder new wires
and removing it and insert it

00:28:38.717 --> 00:28:47.593
again to came up with a much
better solution. >> We found

00:28:47.593 --> 00:28:56.468
this kit that has the M2 slot
and breaks out everything with

00:28:56.468 --> 00:29:06.078
the sim card and USB in we
soldered for like two or three

00:29:06.078 --> 00:29:14.953
hours as process of getting this
fixed and ready these test pads

00:29:14.953 --> 00:29:24.563
are tiny and then you break the
thing in three minutes. And you

00:29:24.563 --> 00:29:34.172
were like shit. So we came up
with a better solution to break

00:29:34.172 --> 00:29:42.314
things and that is that.
Drilling a hole through the kit

00:29:42.314 --> 00:29:51.189
and using pins as you see the
right side the McGuyver-ness of

00:29:51.189 --> 00:29:57.863
it. This is duct taped.
(CLAPPING) and we have

00:29:57.863 --> 00:30:06.004
(indiscernible) yeah. That is
not exciting, I know. We have to

00:30:06.004 --> 00:30:15.614
do a happy show dance. And we
have to do success dance. Let's

00:30:15.614 --> 00:30:23.755
recap. We have a root shell on
the Linux powered independent

00:30:23.755 --> 00:30:29.661
device inside your platform
without anyway of you

00:30:29.661 --> 00:30:37.803
controlling it other than
opening it up and taking it out.

00:30:37.803 --> 00:30:45.210
>> As you see the firmware
instruction is awesome. The

00:30:45.210 --> 00:30:53.351
initial hack base got us access
to the degrees and started

00:30:53.351 --> 00:31:00.025
looking around and require
identify -- and we spent

00:31:00.025 --> 00:31:07.432
sometimes looking at the
mechanism in a figured out how

00:31:07.432 --> 00:31:16.308
basically as part of that doing
some changes and trying to flash

00:31:16.308 --> 00:31:25.183
update we discovered it was only
doing a CRC instead of firmware

00:31:25.183 --> 00:31:35.560
update. >> I was going the talk
about the -- so we spent some

00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:42.968
time reversing the firmware
structure and there was a CRC

00:31:42.968 --> 00:31:51.843
cover each of header block and
we're going write a tool to

00:31:51.843 --> 00:32:00.719
calculate those but we figured
out it was easier to patch the

00:32:00.719 --> 00:32:11.096
updater to do the work for us so
when you first you run the

00:32:11.096 --> 00:32:20.705
updated it has this image as
part of updater and it will go

00:32:20.705 --> 00:32:28.847
through check the CRC to make
sure everything works and then

00:32:28.847 --> 00:32:37.722
pass it over the modem so we
just changed the checks instead

00:32:37.722 --> 00:32:46.598
of doing compare branch if not
equal to just replace CRC and

00:32:46.598 --> 00:32:56.208
replace it in the firmware image
before it passes it on the modem

00:32:56.208 --> 00:33:05.083
where that does CRC check. We
only needed to change six up

00:33:05.083 --> 00:33:13.225
codes in the firmware upgrade
utility. Not for branch up codes

00:33:13.225 --> 00:33:22.834
but were not that many changes
at all in order to get this

00:33:22.834 --> 00:33:32.444
working. It works great. It a
easy do so they are not doing

00:33:32.444 --> 00:33:40.585
any kind of secure update and
because of this we can

00:33:40.585 --> 00:33:47.993
recalculate the CRC and this has
a complete android running

00:33:47.993 --> 00:33:56.134
inside the modem so question
created a live module in order

00:33:56.134 --> 00:34:05.744
the live patch -- within the USB
gad yet and we can reconfigure

00:34:05.744 --> 00:34:16.121
whatever want. We can have it do
mouse and keyboard have it do a

00:34:16.121 --> 00:34:24.996
CD ROM drive. You can have a USB
internet and bridge the

00:34:24.996 --> 00:34:33.138
connection. And one point to
remember about this is that all

00:34:33.138 --> 00:34:39.811
though it requires malware
pushing the firmware updates we

00:34:39.811 --> 00:34:49.421
can use that module as a root of
persistence for malware so you

00:34:49.421 --> 00:34:56.828
can wipe the US after it has
been compromised. Firmware

00:34:56.828 --> 00:35:06.438
update asks the module to switch
into this update mode, so if the

00:35:06.438 --> 00:35:14.579
module ignores that reset it is
difficult to guarantee that you

00:35:14.579 --> 00:35:21.252
have cleaned the module after
something like this has

00:35:21.252 --> 00:35:30.128
happened. So it a interesting
problem to run into. >> We keep

00:35:30.128 --> 00:35:38.269
saying module but the modem
module, this is an example. This

00:35:38.269 --> 00:35:44.175
is possible with many other
platform devices, platform

00:35:44.175 --> 00:35:52.317
components and the risk here
what we're trying to say is

00:35:52.317 --> 00:36:01.192
there is a platform risk and
this is like the worse case

00:36:01.192 --> 00:36:08.600
scenario where malware can't
persist across wipe outs. If you

00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:17.475
have a remote -- I can install
the US remote without you

00:36:17.475 --> 00:36:26.351
knowing it. That summed things
up. All right. There is such a

00:36:26.351 --> 00:36:35.226
thing as insider threat. And if
anyone of you is involved with

00:36:35.226 --> 00:36:42.634
firmware updates secure it very
well. >> So basically because

00:36:42.634 --> 00:36:50.775
all of these different devices
in the platform should have a

00:36:50.775 --> 00:36:58.917
secure update functionality and
lot of people used to think that

00:36:58.917 --> 00:37:07.792
USB was safe because but have
this arbitrary code in a place

00:37:07.792 --> 00:37:15.200
that is not viewable by
antivirus soft wire running on

00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:24.075
the host system, will not have a
ability to look inside the

00:37:24.075 --> 00:37:31.483
module unless the module gives
it that capable but answering

00:37:31.483 --> 00:37:38.890
back request. So many different
places you will have similar

00:37:38.890 --> 00:37:46.297
excuse environments where you
could have malware do a similar

00:37:46.297 --> 00:37:55.907
attack like this and we want to
let people know to secure update

00:37:55.907 --> 00:38:02.580
through all these different
forms is really important and

00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:09.988
that means than just a CRC
check. So do signature

00:38:09.988 --> 00:38:18.129
verifications. >> Before we go
to questions, we are going to

00:38:18.129 --> 00:38:28.506
run the video demo for the you
tube talk, if that is okay with

00:38:28.506 --> 00:38:38.883
you all. We see the tablet on
the right. My bad. You have a

00:38:38.883 --> 00:38:47.759
tablet on the right and we have
the remote connection, this is

00:38:47.759 --> 00:38:57.368
server on PC2. So powering on
the tablet. This one is going be

00:38:57.368 --> 00:39:05.510
faster, I promise. You can see
the go pro-light flashing when

00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:13.651
you go by. Connecting to our
server downloading a CD ROM

00:39:13.651 --> 00:39:23.261
image. This is what we did not
have to do with a device

00:39:23.261 --> 00:39:32.870
refresh. So we load a CD ROM
device first and we load the

00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:41.746
image CD getting in the driver.
Then the hacking is in progress.

00:39:41.746 --> 00:39:51.356
Just remembering that we can all
do this when air plan mode is

00:39:51.356 --> 00:39:59.497
enabled is interesting also. >>
You say interesting and I say

00:39:59.497 --> 00:40:09.874
scary. So this was in case we
failed with a live demo. So this

00:40:09.874 --> 00:40:19.484
is where we enabled the -- skip
forward a little bit. We load

00:40:19.484 --> 00:40:26.891
the configuration remotely. Tell
it to disable secure boot. The

00:40:26.891 --> 00:40:34.299
script is just shortening for
the key strokes. Disables it.

00:40:34.299 --> 00:40:43.174
Reboot. The module is pinging
google again. We are going to do

00:40:43.174 --> 00:40:51.316
refresh and airplane mode is on.
And then we restart operation

00:40:51.316 --> 00:41:01.693
and you see the LT module to the
right and it one internet. So

00:41:01.693 --> 00:41:12.070
now we have time for questions.
>> And I have a mic phone. That

00:41:12.070 --> 00:41:20.945
would be good. >> I have two
questions. Did you patch the

00:41:20.945 --> 00:41:29.087
firmware to keep the module
activated or is it always like

00:41:29.087 --> 00:41:38.696
that? >> In this case it was
always like that. >> Could you

00:41:38.696 --> 00:41:47.572
use the PCI express to gain
access to the hosts memory? >>

00:41:47.572 --> 00:41:55.713
Technically yes if you have a
PCI education press module. >>

00:41:55.713 --> 00:42:05.323
This particular code does not
have a PCI line in the M2 slot.

00:42:05.323 --> 00:42:15.700
>> Questions to the left. >> So
you said this is patch now. >>

00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:26.077
Yes >> Did they patch it to the
module itself or just patch the

00:42:26.077 --> 00:42:31.983
windows installer so firmware
updater does verification. >>

00:42:31.983 --> 00:42:40.124
Two step of verification here
one is software double check and

00:42:40.124 --> 00:42:47.532
one the module itself performs
secure boot. So the module

00:42:47.532 --> 00:42:57.141
itself is performing the check
so now you will not be able to

00:42:57.141 --> 00:43:06.017
load any un-authorized image to
this module. >> So one of the

00:43:06.017 --> 00:43:13.424
bullet points was to have more
security around security updates

00:43:13.424 --> 00:43:23.034
for the firm where so I am
curious how do make it more

00:43:23.034 --> 00:43:31.909
secure make a password you have
to to crack. >> I would

00:43:31.909 --> 00:43:38.583
recommend full RSA signature
verification. Have a big enough

00:43:38.583 --> 00:43:48.960
key that you can't crack. >> So
how you could attack this? >> We

00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:58.569
just give you a link and you
have a update for you module.

00:43:58.569 --> 00:44:07.445
That is it. For this specific
case. It varies per device. Any

00:44:07.445 --> 00:00:00.000
other questions? Me mind. Thank
you everyone.
