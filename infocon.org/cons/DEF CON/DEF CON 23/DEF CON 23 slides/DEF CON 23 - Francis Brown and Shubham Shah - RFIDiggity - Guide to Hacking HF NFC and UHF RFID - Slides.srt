00:00:00.367 --> 00:00:03.403
We're going to get started.
Welcome everybody. This is

00:00:03.403 --> 00:00:10.410
RFIdiggity. I'm Fran Brown, a
partner at Bishop Fox. I have

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:17.684
fun stuff for you today. I was
mixing it up at the end there

00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:22.189
and adding some of the newer
slides to the beginning to front

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:26.560
load it. I realized in looking
at the abstract, I took on a lot

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.665
of things. In case we don't get
to everything, we'll go over

00:00:31.665 --> 00:00:39.039
..(audio blipped).. So I got
some bad news and good news. The

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:44.244
good news trumps the bad news.
It's okay. For those of you who

00:00:44.244 --> 00:00:48.515
noticed in the abstract that it
said I would be giving out 100

00:00:48.515 --> 00:00:53.654
circuit boards for the new back
door version, I didn't get it in

00:00:53.654 --> 00:00:58.258
in time to get it printed for
this. I don't know how many of

00:00:58.258 --> 00:01:02.095
you guys were here when we did
it two years ago, but it was

00:01:02.095 --> 00:01:06.066
like a mad house. I think three
people got stabbed crawling over

00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:12.072
each other. It was pandemonium.
The good news, that trumps that,

00:01:15.008 --> 00:01:18.946
if you stick around to the end,
at the very end and remind me,

00:01:18.946 --> 00:01:23.850
I'm going to throw up an email
address and the first 100 people

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.022
that email me with their
physical address, I will mail

00:01:29.022 --> 00:01:32.359
the circuit boards once they
come in and then I'll send you

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:36.129
random letters and love letters
and things like that. Risk

00:01:36.129 --> 00:01:42.536
versus reward. But you have to
stick around until the end. The

00:01:42.536 --> 00:01:46.440
first 100 items in my inbox will
get one mailed out to them

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.979
pretty soon. I'm going to go
over to a little bit of logical

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:57.017
order some of these. In the
beginning here to kick things

00:01:57.017 --> 00:02:04.057
off I want to highlight a few of
the newer tools. With this talk

00:02:04.057 --> 00:02:07.961
what I want to do is in doing
research for this do practical

00:02:07.961 --> 00:02:13.266
penetration tests. I had the
issue of you have to read, you

00:02:13.266 --> 00:02:16.303
know, like 100 things before you
get the answer that you want.

00:02:16.303 --> 00:02:20.807
This is to be the best of tools
and techniques and what you need

00:02:20.807 --> 00:02:28.448
to know ..(audio blipped).. for
doing RFID hacking, UHF and HF.

00:02:28.448 --> 00:02:35.589
And there are new tools as well.
I mentioned that I was creating

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:40.227
the -- popular right now -- I
saw at BlackHat the guys

00:02:40.227 --> 00:02:44.064
released the BLE key. Are you
here? The guys that did that?

00:02:44.064 --> 00:02:50.070
Something similar to that. But
basically weaponizing the --

00:02:54.608 --> 00:03:00.781
circuit board to be a man in the
middle device. Instead of

00:03:00.781 --> 00:03:08.455
weaponizing -- how many people
have seen my last talk? I'm

00:03:08.455 --> 00:03:12.459
assuming a lot. Basically I
created this circuit board to

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:16.863
weaponize the reader and it
reads the -- input and I

00:03:16.863 --> 00:03:19.933
realized afterwards, that you
can make it a back door device

00:03:19.933 --> 00:03:25.939
as well and put in your own
reader. Trying to break into

00:03:28.341 --> 00:03:32.112
..(audio blipped).. and plant it
in there instead and it can

00:03:32.112 --> 00:03:38.718
capture -- values as it hits
them. By tapping into the wires.

00:03:38.718 --> 00:03:42.556
So I was like, okay, I have
basically what I need already.

00:03:42.556 --> 00:03:44.724
This goes into a reader and
reads it and passes it to the

00:03:44.724 --> 00:03:48.862
circuit board. If only I could
make it smaller and hook up

00:03:48.862 --> 00:03:54.367
bluetooth to it or something. I
was like, oh, how many are

00:03:54.367 --> 00:04:00.440
familiar with [indiscernible].
Reshrunk the -- bluetooth. That

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:06.446
is exactly what I'm looking for.
That made it easier. I'm

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:15.555
releasing a stripped down
version using the RFreno without

00:04:15.555 --> 00:04:19.259
the SD card to make it smaller
and plant it in any reader.

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:26.099
Other things that are new. I'll
get into more detail. I posted a

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:33.240
blog post on this. Traditional
RFID hacking techniques, trying

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:39.212
to walk by somebody and steal
their badge information, make a

00:04:39.212 --> 00:04:44.017
fake copy of a badge and break
into a building. Some of the

00:04:44.017 --> 00:04:50.824
newer technologies for RFID
physical security any way, with

00:04:50.824 --> 00:04:57.330
iCLASS, ..(audio blipped)..
eventually we have to imagine

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.500
people are going to get their
act together. Eventually it will

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:04.771
be no longer a bottle target to
go into Starbucks and walk by

00:05:04.771 --> 00:05:07.574
somebody and steal their badge.
We're going to attack the

00:05:07.574 --> 00:05:10.844
readers and the controllers
directly. Basically we're coming

00:05:10.844 --> 00:05:16.850
up with a few queries. I put in
three queries and found a few

00:05:22.556 --> 00:05:29.829
hundred controllers exposed to
the internet. And basically if

00:05:29.829 --> 00:05:31.832
you're familiar with these
controllers at all. If you have

00:05:31.832 --> 00:05:36.703
network connection -- it's game
over. There is basically --

00:05:36.703 --> 00:05:43.510
default credentials they can't
change of root and pass. If they

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:47.247
change it, it breaks the
product. If you have network

00:05:47.247 --> 00:05:51.351
connectivity at all to any of
these controllers, you need the

00:05:51.351 --> 00:05:54.087
physical security system. Not
supposed to be hooked up to the

00:05:54.087 --> 00:06:01.127
internet but quite a few people.
Especially universities. You can

00:06:01.127 --> 00:06:07.133
open the doors and things like
that over the internet. How many

00:06:11.271 --> 00:06:16.243
of you have seen any of my
Google hacking, Google diggity

00:06:16.243 --> 00:06:22.249
research before? The origins of
the Diggity name. This allows

00:06:27.887 --> 00:06:33.760
you to hook up to the API and
quickly do queries. We see a few

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:39.299
here. One other thing I should
mention is basically my slide

00:06:39.299 --> 00:06:43.737
decks are like the note sections
are like white papers. So if you

00:06:43.737 --> 00:06:46.006
want to follow up on any of
these things, if you download

00:06:46.006 --> 00:06:51.745
the slides the notes section
have links to resources. I cite

00:06:51.745 --> 00:06:58.918
most people in the slides but if
you're looking to follow up on

00:06:58.918 --> 00:07:02.355
this, the notes of the slides
are a great resource for that.

00:07:02.355 --> 00:07:08.361
Using that, just ran it. And
basically these guys have Tele

00:07:12.499 --> 00:07:18.505
net and FTP and a web interface
open for I believe this was for

00:07:20.774 --> 00:07:24.377
a college. Basically, I mean
this is two seconds that it took

00:07:24.377 --> 00:07:28.515
to put this together. And
quickly found [indiscernible]

00:07:28.515 --> 00:07:31.051
browsing them. And if you mouse
over any of the doors, it gives

00:07:31.051 --> 00:07:38.491
you a pop up of the last valid
badge. You can see there, that

00:07:38.491 --> 00:07:45.031
login, it's not going anyway,
because you can ..(audio

00:07:45.031 --> 00:07:49.202
blipped).. interface. It's one
of those things where it still

00:07:49.202 --> 00:07:53.907
amazes me what people hook up to
the internet and we can get

00:07:53.907 --> 00:07:59.913
access to. I came up with a few
scripts that were based on Brad,

00:08:03.783 --> 00:08:09.789
I believe his last name -- is
Brad in here from McCaferty? I

00:08:12.192 --> 00:08:19.366
butcher his last name. But Brad
..(audio blipped).. you'll see

00:08:19.366 --> 00:08:22.569
links to his research with
attacking readers and

00:08:22.569 --> 00:08:28.775
controllers. You can query and
get the exact version of the

00:08:28.775 --> 00:08:32.078
controllers one at a time and
I'll release them in the GitHub

00:08:32.078 --> 00:08:38.618
in a few random hacking scripts
and things like that. Feeding a

00:08:38.618 --> 00:08:44.324
couple hundred IPs to a script
and it can go out and query it

00:08:44.324 --> 00:08:46.459
and find out what kind of
controller it is and the

00:08:46.459 --> 00:08:52.532
version. These are the stats
after messing around for like an

00:08:52.532 --> 00:08:58.538
hour. So that's a quick preview
on the reader and controller.

00:09:05.912 --> 00:09:12.185
Getting back to the traditional
type of attacks that we covered

00:09:12.185 --> 00:09:16.456
in the last talk with the low
frequency RFID hacking. You get

00:09:16.456 --> 00:09:20.860
to the -- technology which is
extremely effective. If you want

00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:23.763
to break into a building, you're
looking at physical security

00:09:23.763 --> 00:09:27.200
systems. There are three simple
steps. You steal somebody's

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:33.406
badge information, you create a
copy of it, and third you go and

00:09:33.406 --> 00:09:37.076
break in. And to minimize the
amount of time you're a

00:09:37.076 --> 00:09:40.547
trespasser you want to plan a
back door so you can get out as

00:09:40.547 --> 00:09:46.553
quickly as possible. And we've
seen before the low frequency,

00:09:51.925 --> 00:09:56.496
the hit Prox stuff. This is I
class I90 long range reader.

00:09:56.496 --> 00:10:02.168
Without any modification at all.
If you have an RFID thief

00:10:02.168 --> 00:10:07.474
circuit board you can hook it up
to this long range reader and

00:10:07.474 --> 00:10:11.611
accomplish that type of attack
for most people out there. And

00:10:11.611 --> 00:10:16.649
cloning, I'll get into more
details but there are a number

00:10:16.649 --> 00:10:20.854
of cloners that have come out
based on the vulnerabilities in

00:10:20.854 --> 00:10:24.524
iCLASS. And the quickest and
easiest is the one that you buy

00:10:24.524 --> 00:10:30.697
from China. This is like by far
the easiest, just point and

00:10:30.697 --> 00:10:36.736
click and making clone copies of
high frequency high class cards.

00:10:36.736 --> 00:10:42.542
You have to do a bank transfer
to China and it had all these

00:10:42.542 --> 00:10:48.047
requirements which would turn
someone off to wanting to do it.

00:10:48.047 --> 00:10:51.951
I was getting weird looks in the
office when I was like, how do I

00:10:51.951 --> 00:10:55.722
transfer to China, this amount.
And people's ears were perking

00:10:55.722 --> 00:11:01.127
up. I sent the money to the guy
via paypal and he sent me the

00:11:01.127 --> 00:11:06.065
something. If that was what was
stopping you, just set up a

00:11:06.065 --> 00:11:12.472
paypal and he'll hook you up
with it. Yes, so we have step

00:11:12.472 --> 00:11:18.478
one, steal the badge information
for a high frequency system,

00:11:21.114 --> 00:11:27.120
step two make a clone copy. And
step three, how many of you are

00:11:30.023 --> 00:11:32.559
familiar with the
[indiscernible] plug. I would

00:11:32.559 --> 00:11:36.696
imagine most people. The power
pone version? The power pone

00:11:36.696 --> 00:11:42.702
version is like a power strip.
It's just a plug. And it costs a

00:11:44.871 --> 00:11:48.508
couple grand. And I think it's
discontinued now. It was

00:11:48.508 --> 00:11:54.881
awesome. Even when you could get
it it was 2 grand. I finished

00:11:54.881 --> 00:11:59.619
the designs and my printer broke
after printing the bottom half.

00:11:59.619 --> 00:12:06.059
It's two halfs. I created the 3D
print, top and bottom to create

00:12:06.059 --> 00:12:09.162
a custom case for the raspberry
buy that is like the power pone.

00:12:09.162 --> 00:12:15.168
You can get a raspberry pie and
print out the 3D halfs of this

00:12:18.471 --> 00:12:26.446
file and it's a Bishop fox
thing. And you can go to Home

00:12:26.446 --> 00:12:32.452
Depot and have a $2 --> 000 power
pone for like 40 bucks. So that

00:12:39.525 --> 00:12:43.763
should be up. Most of this stuff
will be up later today on the

00:12:43.763 --> 00:12:48.267
various sites or by the end of
tomorrow at the latest. Either

00:12:48.267 --> 00:12:53.806
our domain website, all this
stuff is always free. All of our

00:12:53.806 --> 00:12:57.477
tools are free. The website is
the best and that will link you

00:12:57.477 --> 00:13:01.948
to GitHub or the 3D universe for
the prints and tutorial videos

00:13:01.948 --> 00:13:07.954
and stuff like that. You have
step, one, two, and three for a

00:13:11.457 --> 00:13:15.128
high frequency system. How many
of you have been watching Mr.

00:13:15.128 --> 00:13:22.301
Robot? It's awesome. How many of
you saw the episode where he

00:13:22.301 --> 00:13:28.308
used the RFID thief. If you look
at the -- evil cord, it was

00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:38.284
three steps they basically had.
I figured I could show you guys

00:13:38.284 --> 00:13:44.257
a couple videos here. First is
the quick -- see what it looks

00:13:44.257 --> 00:13:50.263
like stealing. Just an iCLASS
card and with one circuit board,

00:13:54.100 --> 00:14:00.773
it goes and grabs it and stores
it and gives you everything you

00:14:00.773 --> 00:14:02.775
need. You can see it there, I
will blow it up later. It's

00:14:02.775 --> 00:14:08.781
basically a card number.
[indiscernible] (muffled). Not

00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:17.256
as impressive as Christian
Slater doing it. Like my mom and

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:30.369
dad get it now. That's what you
were talking about. They never

00:14:30.369 --> 00:14:34.941
watched the BlackHat talks but
Christian Slater gets them

00:14:34.941 --> 00:14:40.947
(muffled) weaponized version of
the iCLASS. (muffled audio) and

00:15:33.499 --> 00:15:39.505
then step 3. (muffled audio).
Basically the plan for taking

00:16:32.892 --> 00:16:38.698
down [indiscernible] was the
step one, two, three was is

00:16:38.698 --> 00:16:43.236
awesome. It's simple but it's
effective. In case you don't --

00:16:43.236 --> 00:16:46.405
they're not too slick, I think
he got caught a couple times

00:16:46.405 --> 00:16:49.475
doing stuff. If you don't want
to sit there and pull out of the

00:16:49.475 --> 00:16:55.481
wall somebody's thermostat and
mess with it, this is just your

00:17:02.088 --> 00:17:04.490
easy way of -- easy way to go
ahead and drop something instead

00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:08.327
of poking the wall apart. The
end result is the same. Planting

00:17:08.327 --> 00:17:11.497
a research berry pie as a
permanent resident on the

00:17:11.497 --> 00:17:17.503
internal network. This is a
brief over some of the newer

00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:26.746
things that we're releasing.
What am I talking about here. In

00:17:36.122 --> 00:17:40.960
the talk I gave in 2013, that
focused on low frequency RFID

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:45.197
hacking. It's great when an
article comes out and it's

00:17:45.197 --> 00:17:50.937
getting long distance on the low
frequency is hard to do. You can

00:17:50.937 --> 00:17:57.043
only get a couple feet. And most
people want to post links to --

00:17:57.043 --> 00:17:59.712
it's not a big deal at all. Here
is an antenna and it's like for

00:17:59.712 --> 00:18:05.351
UHF or something completely
different. There is a lot of

00:18:05.351 --> 00:18:08.921
misunderstanding and myths and
room for confusion when it comes

00:18:08.921 --> 00:18:16.228
to RFID hacking. In fact, I mean
I was pretty dedicated and it

00:18:16.228 --> 00:18:19.165
took me a while to get the most
basic answers that I wanted for

00:18:19.165 --> 00:18:23.102
myself for most of these. I
understand most people's

00:18:23.102 --> 00:18:25.438
confusion. There are three major
branches of RFID. The low

00:18:25.438 --> 00:18:31.444
frequency. The grossly insecure
stuff that most people today

00:18:36.182 --> 00:18:39.719
use. If you have an RFID card on
you, it probably is. With this

00:18:39.719 --> 00:18:45.324
talk I wanted to extend into the
high frequency and Ultra-High

00:18:45.324 --> 00:18:49.628
frequency aspects of it. The
newer physical security systems

00:18:49.628 --> 00:18:54.133
that use high frequency and
various other things that are

00:18:54.133 --> 00:18:59.372
blowing up all over the place.
Just some examples. It's used

00:18:59.372 --> 00:19:04.777
for everything. It's all over
the place now. The internet and

00:19:04.777 --> 00:19:06.879
everything is connected.
Everybody is talking to

00:19:06.879 --> 00:19:12.184
everybody. From your credit
cards to your Disney fast passes

00:19:12.184 --> 00:19:15.154
to green cards, to passports,
some people use their hand to

00:19:15.154 --> 00:19:20.459
open doors like they're Darth
Vader or something. It looks

00:19:20.459 --> 00:19:26.465
cool. To hospitals which is
scary. To I noticed in the

00:19:32.605 --> 00:19:39.412
airport on the way here, just
the vending machines are all

00:19:39.412 --> 00:19:44.984
Wi-Fi based. Maintenance
systems, NFC, that is the same

00:19:44.984 --> 00:19:50.556
frequency as high frequency.
I've seen weird things. Somebody

00:19:50.556 --> 00:19:55.728
in my company found a secure
hard drive, what you see there

00:19:55.728 --> 00:20:02.401
in the top row, second from the
left, that basically to utilize

00:20:02.401 --> 00:20:06.605
the external hard drive you need
an RFID badge near it to unlock

00:20:06.605 --> 00:20:12.645
it. All kinds of weird things.
Enhanced driver's licenses. How

00:20:12.645 --> 00:20:17.683
many knew the hotel room keys
here were RFID. More and more

00:20:17.683 --> 00:20:23.689
have them, especially in Vegas.
These types of attacks are only

00:20:32.865 --> 00:20:38.838
becomes more and more useful.
This is a basic physical

00:20:38.838 --> 00:20:43.642
security set up in terms of how
things flow. Whether it's credit

00:20:43.642 --> 00:20:48.414
cards or somebody's physical
security system, or your coke

00:20:48.414 --> 00:20:53.953
rewards. How many people have
coke rewards? MyCoke rewards?

00:20:53.953 --> 00:20:59.058
No. Everybody? Nobody. Pepsi
crowd, huh? Basically what we're

00:20:59.058 --> 00:21:05.131
looking at is somebody is
carrying around something with

00:21:05.131 --> 00:21:11.137
them, whether it's their phone
or tab or Obi-Wan Kenobi tab.

00:21:14.273 --> 00:21:20.713
The attacks are going to be
similar. Just different

00:21:20.713 --> 00:21:24.583
approaches. We walk by somebody
and skim it off them without

00:21:24.583 --> 00:21:29.955
them knowing like Christian
Slater did with his backpack and

00:21:29.955 --> 00:21:34.693
make a copy. Do things like
directly attack the readers or

00:21:34.693 --> 00:21:38.931
controllers and ..(audio
blipped).. badge at all. Go

00:21:38.931 --> 00:21:44.370
right to the source. We want to
do things like make copies of

00:21:44.370 --> 00:21:48.741
badges and have devices that can
emulate badges. They don't have

00:21:48.741 --> 00:21:54.747
to be a fake copy. You have some
interesting things like relay

00:21:57.349 --> 00:22:03.355
attacks. Which we see in which
case as things start to escalate

00:22:03.355 --> 00:22:07.159
and more FID systems. You have
two guys, one guy is at the door

00:22:07.159 --> 00:22:13.165
with a payment system with the
device and another guy is

00:22:20.472 --> 00:22:23.709
following behind you. It starts
passing the information back and

00:22:23.709 --> 00:22:27.780
forth and relaying it. Power
pone version we're seeing more

00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:34.019
and more of these. As people are
locking down the badges, whether

00:22:34.019 --> 00:22:41.760
they have -- fly gear, RFID
blocking skinny jeans. Who has

00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:47.766
RFID blocking skinny jeans?
They're coming. Your kids are

00:22:50.669 --> 00:22:57.076
going to love it. But as people
start to do stuff like that and

00:22:57.076 --> 00:23:01.347
the badge gets harder to copy
and clone and steal, people are

00:23:01.347 --> 00:23:03.649
going to start moving along to
these different types of

00:23:03.649 --> 00:23:09.655
attacks. Maybe we can't steal
the badge, can we brute force

00:23:12.491 --> 00:23:16.128
badges. If we know one badge
number can we guess the next. If

00:23:16.128 --> 00:23:20.099
I bought one Disney ticket, can
I predict what the next three

00:23:20.099 --> 00:23:23.636
sold are. Can you predict
values. The uses are getting

00:23:23.636 --> 00:23:29.642
diverse and crazy but the types
of thought processes and how you

00:23:32.311 --> 00:23:38.317
attack them are the same across
the board. So as we get into a

00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:45.991
few attack types I'll show other
gear. I like to give you the

00:23:45.991 --> 00:23:50.095
gist of free -- technology. What
are the main attacks you want to

00:23:50.095 --> 00:23:54.900
perform and the main tools you
want to use. There is a lot of

00:23:54.900 --> 00:24:01.573
noise out there. And I bet -- in
my last talk, for years, during

00:24:01.573 --> 00:24:04.877
kind of the hay day of RFID
hacking you could read --

00:24:04.877 --> 00:24:08.013
certain tools and this tool did
this and all these things and

00:24:08.013 --> 00:24:14.253
you found 100 articles about
something that doesn't exist.

00:24:14.253 --> 00:24:20.726
Never got released. Just a photo
of it on the internet. And

00:24:20.726 --> 00:24:25.397
you're trying to do a
penetration test and find a tool

00:24:25.397 --> 00:24:31.170
that can help you now. And the
first 500 Google hits are

00:24:31.170 --> 00:24:37.943
referring to a tool that was
never publicly released. These I

00:24:37.943 --> 00:24:43.015
covered before: You have the
custom long range readers.

00:24:43.015 --> 00:24:47.019
Taking a circuit board and
plugging into a long range

00:24:47.019 --> 00:24:52.157
reader for hit prox or iCLASS as
you saw there. Programmable

00:24:52.157 --> 00:24:58.330
cards. These are some of the
things I covered in the last

00:24:58.330 --> 00:25:05.070
talk so I don't want to go over
them too much. The RFID stuff.

00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:08.507
The RFID stuff in the middle
there, those are great. Most

00:25:08.507 --> 00:25:10.509
people aren't aware of those.
They're not a security tool,

00:25:10.509 --> 00:25:15.848
they're a troubleshooting tool
for engineers in the field for

00:25:15.848 --> 00:25:21.854
RFID stuff. B sticks, one high
frequency and one low frequency.

00:25:21.854 --> 00:25:25.557
If you have a card that doesn't
have any physical indications as

00:25:25.557 --> 00:25:29.528
to what type of technology it
is, you don't know the type of

00:25:29.528 --> 00:25:33.599
card, you can use these things
to find out what type of card

00:25:33.599 --> 00:25:39.972
something is. Which is extremely
useful. I'm getting into the

00:25:39.972 --> 00:25:45.978
high frequency stuff. The
must-have tools. That's a little

00:25:48.180 --> 00:25:54.186
blurry? Anybody? A little
blurry? ..(audio blipped).. one,

00:25:59.525 --> 00:26:04.263
how many people have the prox
mark three. It's one of the main

00:26:04.263 --> 00:26:06.665
tools you get. They make sure
you have the high frequency

00:26:06.665 --> 00:26:12.171
antenna. You can use that for
some of the other tools. The one

00:26:12.171 --> 00:26:18.911
on the bottom left, this is
basically your Swiss army knife

00:26:18.911 --> 00:26:21.013
of high frequency hacking. For
using that iCLASS cloner that I

00:26:21.013 --> 00:26:27.686
referenced there, that works
with this reader. You can use

00:26:27.686 --> 00:26:31.990
this reader to read credit cards
and for all sorts of things.

00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:36.595
People working with kali and
Linux, it's the No. 1 tool to

00:26:36.595 --> 00:26:40.399
interact with. The top right,
you have [indiscernible] do NFC

00:26:40.399 --> 00:26:45.370
hacking. There is not a lot of
hardware that works with it. If

00:26:45.370 --> 00:26:51.510
you want to use some NFC tools
that is a good one. In the last

00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:57.516
year or two there has been an
explosion of mobile platform

00:27:03.589 --> 00:27:06.592
penetration testing. How many
people here have done a wireless

00:27:06.592 --> 00:27:09.228
pen test where you carry around
the big ..(audio blipped).. and

00:27:09.228 --> 00:27:15.334
walking around like this. That
was like the toy three years

00:27:15.334 --> 00:27:20.439
ago. It was the standard and
people are like, what are you

00:27:20.439 --> 00:27:27.279
looking for. It's a nerd
detector. It's been great. And

00:27:27.279 --> 00:27:34.853
in the last couple years you've
seen the pony express done the

00:27:34.853 --> 00:27:38.490
pone plug release. The Pone pad
which is an android --

00:27:38.490 --> 00:27:45.531
[indiscernible] pentesting
tools. RFID hacking tools and

00:27:45.531 --> 00:27:51.737
bluetooth tools. More recent,
how many of you have heard of

00:27:51.737 --> 00:27:57.910
kali's net hunter? A decent
amount. Ten percent of the

00:27:57.910 --> 00:28:03.849
crowd. It's relatively new. Less
than a year old. Kali released

00:28:03.849 --> 00:28:08.053
images for android tablets that
you can load on the nexus 7 or

00:28:08.053 --> 00:28:14.059
10 there and it has a kali
android phone. RFID hacking,

00:28:19.665 --> 00:28:22.568
you're physically trying to
break into a site. Physically at

00:28:22.568 --> 00:28:29.241
Starbucks like Christian Slater
to have small portable devices

00:28:29.241 --> 00:28:34.212
that are highly functional. This
is -- it's a good step in the

00:28:34.212 --> 00:28:38.083
right direction. The prox mark
that I mentioned. These slides

00:28:38.083 --> 00:28:43.555
have a number of references to
blog posts. How to run the prox

00:28:43.555 --> 00:28:49.494
mark from the android phone or
something. If you use that to

00:28:49.494 --> 00:28:53.498
make fake copies you use the
phone and it's more convenient

00:28:53.498 --> 00:29:00.706
than carrying around the big
laptop. I mentioned before the

00:29:00.706 --> 00:29:03.909
prox mark. This is some of the
commands in terms of high

00:29:03.909 --> 00:29:10.015
frequency to give an overview.
It's like a Swiss army knife. It

00:29:10.015 --> 00:29:14.653
can read cards, clone cards,
emulate cards. High frequency

00:29:14.653 --> 00:29:20.259
and low frequency. It can
basically do anything. The one

00:29:20.259 --> 00:29:25.530
limitation is distance which is
why we came up with the RFID to

00:29:25.530 --> 00:29:29.868
steal somebody's badge from
further away. That is pretty

00:29:29.868 --> 00:29:33.472
much one of the only limitation.
It can pretty much do everything

00:29:33.472 --> 00:29:41.013
else. The high frequency
commands. ..(audio blipped)..

00:29:41.013 --> 00:29:45.183
always updated. Library of
python scripts for doing various

00:29:45.183 --> 00:29:49.488
hacking things and it's loaded
with kali Linux. If you want to

00:29:49.488 --> 00:29:52.624
up and run quickly, you can
download the kali Linux image

00:29:52.624 --> 00:29:54.626
and be up and running quickly.
The readers which I mentioned.

00:29:54.626 --> 00:30:00.632
The RFID tools which you can use
to scan to figure out this is my

00:30:08.073 --> 00:30:12.210
card for work or this is my card
for my parking lot in my

00:30:12.210 --> 00:30:15.414
apartment or something. It
doesn't have anything on it that

00:30:15.414 --> 00:30:19.584
lets me know the technology. You
can use this software to figure

00:30:19.584 --> 00:30:25.891
out what the technology is. You
can scan it and make a fake copy

00:30:25.891 --> 00:30:32.064
and get free parking. Whatever
you want to do to the thing.

00:30:32.064 --> 00:30:37.469
That's what it's good for. This
is getting into some of the

00:30:37.469 --> 00:30:41.773
stuff that we covered.
Especially with the high

00:30:41.773 --> 00:30:46.278
frequency stuff it's harder --
the iCLASS there was a reader

00:30:46.278 --> 00:30:50.482
that I showed. It's coming back
to one of the biggest

00:30:50.482 --> 00:30:54.786
limitations is distance. As
people come up with ways of

00:30:54.786 --> 00:30:57.923
breaking some of these
technologies what we've always

00:30:57.923 --> 00:31:00.926
seen is this is so broken and it
makes head lines and it ends up

00:31:00.926 --> 00:31:06.932
being you have to get within a
centimeter or two to steal

00:31:06.932 --> 00:31:13.705
somebody's badge. And it was
glossed over. There was a talk

00:31:13.705 --> 00:31:18.043
before, it was referred to as
the ass grabbing method of RFID

00:31:18.043 --> 00:31:24.249
hacking. This is through a lot
of slides and videos and

00:31:24.249 --> 00:31:26.818
presentations. This technology
is broken, look how easy it is

00:31:26.818 --> 00:31:32.824
to steal somebody's information.
Okay, you can read it and clone

00:31:35.861 --> 00:31:39.664
it and all but distance is
always a problem. It makes it

00:31:39.664 --> 00:31:42.434
really a risk. What is really
practical that you need to worry

00:31:42.434 --> 00:31:48.440
about. If Jonathan west used it
in the corner and he is walking

00:31:52.811 --> 00:31:56.114
around the campus grab-assing
you, you're going to catch him.

00:31:56.114 --> 00:32:02.254
It's not that big of a risk.
These the circuit boards that we

00:32:02.254 --> 00:32:08.093
saw before that weaponized
existing RFID readers. Some of

00:32:08.093 --> 00:32:12.230
the early problems that the
tools that got talked about,

00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:14.766
there's a million things for it.
Some of the main reasons they

00:32:14.766 --> 00:32:19.404
never got released were due to
being threatened with patent

00:32:19.404 --> 00:32:24.643
disputes. Like, oh, you created
a reader that reads these cards,

00:32:24.643 --> 00:32:30.448
we have a patent on the device
that reads these cards. You

00:32:30.448 --> 00:32:34.619
can't create one of your own.
That stifled a lot of the

00:32:34.619 --> 00:32:39.958
release of tools from 2007 to a
couple years ago. With this

00:32:39.958 --> 00:32:45.297
circuit board you're not
creating, you're weaponizing an

00:32:45.297 --> 00:32:52.504
existing reader. That is how we
got around that and can build

00:32:52.504 --> 00:32:58.677
tools that are practical for
penetration tests. What we see

00:32:58.677 --> 00:33:01.546
here is basically you can put --
that's my sketch of Christian

00:33:01.546 --> 00:33:04.783
Slater with his backpack.
Basically I designed this to

00:33:04.783 --> 00:33:10.789
easily plug into any reader to
weaponize it and it -- the

00:33:17.996 --> 00:33:22.167
output of the reader any badge
that it reads what the badge

00:33:22.167 --> 00:33:27.539
value is. I created it for only
one reason to begin with. It

00:33:27.539 --> 00:33:31.643
plugs into the high frequency
[indiscernible] and I changed it

00:33:31.643 --> 00:33:35.480
to a back door device that you
can plug in and interpret the

00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:42.554
results of readers as well. And
basically the circuit board is

00:33:42.554 --> 00:33:47.692
still pretty effective. It takes
some power, takes in the output

00:33:47.692 --> 00:33:53.198
of the reader and outputs to SD
card and into the screen. It

00:33:53.198 --> 00:33:58.870
outputs it over bluetooth into
your phone. And what we're

00:33:58.870 --> 00:34:02.641
looking at here is what it's
tapping into. This main output

00:34:02.641 --> 00:34:07.679
of -- any reader that reads a
badge for the most part when it

00:34:07.679 --> 00:34:12.150
comes to physical security,
sends it to a controller like we

00:34:12.150 --> 00:34:16.955
saw over the internet and it's
data one and data 0. Green and

00:34:16.955 --> 00:34:22.961
white wires for sending ones and
zeros for badge value. I

00:34:25.931 --> 00:34:33.204
mentioned here, in thinking
about this. [indiscernible]

00:34:33.204 --> 00:34:40.579
global is the No. 1 when it
comes to RFID. They have four

00:34:40.579 --> 00:34:45.684
major product families of RFID
they have. Two low frequency and

00:34:45.684 --> 00:34:48.219
two high frequency. There is
more than this but mostly it's

00:34:48.219 --> 00:34:54.526
these four major families. We
have HIPprox and my class for

00:34:54.526 --> 00:35:02.200
the high frequency. They
released long range readers for

00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:07.372
three out of four of the product
families there. We weaponized

00:35:07.372 --> 00:35:12.277
three out of four and have long
range readers and can do the Mr.

00:35:12.277 --> 00:35:17.983
Robot attack for three out of
the major four product families

00:35:17.983 --> 00:35:21.386
of RFID were covered. That long
range problem is solved for

00:35:21.386 --> 00:35:25.590
those three. Unfortunately they
don't have a long range

00:35:25.590 --> 00:35:32.564
commercial MIFARE reader to
weaponize. So that's -- you

00:35:32.564 --> 00:35:35.500
know, we have to wait for them
to come out with something like

00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:43.174
that to weaponize to avoid the
patent. I showed you guys the

00:35:43.174 --> 00:35:49.180
RFDUO which is awesome. In terms
of extending the functionality,

00:35:52.150 --> 00:35:58.156
there are [indiscernible]. Have
you seen the smallest cell phone

00:36:02.727 --> 00:36:08.033
add on that I've seen yet. They
are normally bulky. They send

00:36:08.033 --> 00:36:11.569
you the cards that it finds in a
text message with every card

00:36:11.569 --> 00:36:14.606
that it finds. These devices are
getting smaller and easier to

00:36:14.606 --> 00:36:20.578
use. The RFDUENO, let's make a
smaller version with bluetooth

00:36:20.578 --> 00:36:26.584
on it. Every week it's getting
easier to get these. This is the

00:36:32.924 --> 00:36:37.228
R90 long range reader. You can
buy these on E-bay for a couple

00:36:37.228 --> 00:36:43.234
hundred bucks. And just plug and
play with the circuit board. So

00:36:47.305 --> 00:36:53.411
basically getting into high
frequency hacking for physical

00:36:53.411 --> 00:36:57.716
access and control of systems.
You have the MIFARE and iCLASS

00:36:57.716 --> 00:36:59.717
two product [indiscernible]
physical security systems for

00:36:59.717 --> 00:37:04.856
the most part. There is a lot of
research on this. Basically for

00:37:04.856 --> 00:37:12.263
iCLASS, the big problem they had
was the security was based on

00:37:12.263 --> 00:37:16.367
people not knowing what a
certain key value was. Keeping a

00:37:16.367 --> 00:37:20.472
secret value. Somebody was able
to dump the firmware of a

00:37:20.472 --> 00:37:25.910
reader, extract the secret key
from it and it was game over.

00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:29.114
And then it just made it
possible to do all the same

00:37:29.114 --> 00:37:36.755
types of attacks for the step
one, step two, and step three

00:37:36.755 --> 00:37:44.262
because of that. Again, for $200
you can get an order from XFPGA

00:37:44.262 --> 00:37:50.835
.com, this iCLASS cloner. Send
the money over paypal. It's the

00:37:50.835 --> 00:37:54.272
easiest by far to point and
click and make a copy of an

00:37:54.272 --> 00:38:01.446
iCLASS card. This guy did a lot
of reverse engineering of his

00:38:01.446 --> 00:38:04.182
tool. He put a lot of
restrictions on it. You can't

00:38:04.182 --> 00:38:06.651
fashion a debuger to it.
[indiscernible] which sucks. It

00:38:06.651 --> 00:38:12.657
has a physical USB dongle for
licensing. He is hard core with

00:38:15.693 --> 00:38:23.701
protecting his product. If you
want to share it with people --

00:38:23.701 --> 00:38:28.907
physically pass around a laptop
with these cloner on it or ship

00:38:28.907 --> 00:38:30.909
it out to somebody if you're
doing a pen test. It's a

00:38:30.909 --> 00:38:37.048
problem. But I have in there a
couple -- one VMware setting

00:38:37.048 --> 00:38:42.887
that you can set to get around
being able to do it. The thing

00:38:42.887 --> 00:38:44.889
that killed me is it has to
..(audio blipped).. older

00:38:44.889 --> 00:38:46.891
version of the software and it's
32 bit and won't run on 64 bit

00:38:46.891 --> 00:38:52.897
or VMware. So I had to get a
different laptop to use the tool

00:38:56.100 --> 00:38:59.904
because I needed to use a 32 bit
system. If you guys buy this,

00:38:59.904 --> 00:39:05.643
just you can check it out, it's
in the notes. It's funny,

00:39:05.643 --> 00:39:11.649
because all it is, is basically
an older version of -- demo

00:39:14.586 --> 00:39:20.592
application that came with
30API, an older version of it.

00:39:23.361 --> 00:39:27.398
He copied that. Just demo code
from hit global and then altered

00:39:27.398 --> 00:39:33.404
it. If you looked at the
executable it said contact list

00:39:37.842 --> 00:39:41.913
demo [indiscernible] executable.
He copied it off somebody else.

00:39:44.482 --> 00:39:47.218
So I don't feel bad about
breaking his thing. You're not

00:39:47.218 --> 00:39:52.156
in the crowd, are you? Good.
Fingerprint reader. There is

00:39:52.156 --> 00:39:58.162
newer stuff now that just came
out but for the most part it's

00:40:04.302 --> 00:40:09.841
ridiculous. If you -- so the
threat is, okay, Christian

00:40:09.841 --> 00:40:13.077
Slater is walking by you at star
bucks and picks up your card

00:40:13.077 --> 00:40:16.581
value. He has everything he
needs to break into evil Corp.

00:40:16.581 --> 00:40:23.721
By adding biometrics and
fingerprinting, at least I can't

00:40:23.721 --> 00:40:27.191
..(audio blipped).. and get
everything I need. He didn't

00:40:27.191 --> 00:40:33.731
know what his pin is. He doesn't
have his fingerprint. So it's

00:40:33.731 --> 00:40:38.770
harder. Except this came from
[indiscernible]. Not supposed to

00:40:38.770 --> 00:40:43.041
do this but you can piece it
together from this white paper.

00:40:43.041 --> 00:40:46.878
Basically by defaulted these bio
class, the iCLASS biometric

00:40:46.878 --> 00:40:50.948
stuff, it basically when you put
your finger down, it validates

00:40:50.948 --> 00:40:53.818
that your fingerprint that is on
there now is the same one on the

00:40:53.818 --> 00:41:00.591
card. Say Christian Slater took
that guys thing and it came up

00:41:00.591 --> 00:41:05.997
and had that. Christian would
make a copy with Christian's

00:41:05.997 --> 00:41:12.770
fingerprint and pin number and
it validates it as the same on

00:41:12.770 --> 00:41:18.810
the card. So it's useless. So if
you get one of these readers you

00:41:18.810 --> 00:41:24.649
can create your own pin and take
your own fingerprint and have

00:41:24.649 --> 00:41:29.287
those values and use some
cloning tools like the PGA when

00:41:29.287 --> 00:41:32.724
making a fake copy to write your
own values for your fingerprint

00:41:32.724 --> 00:41:36.260
when doing it as well. And this
white paper is listed there with

00:41:36.260 --> 00:41:42.266
the exact values and where you
would do that. Biometrics in

00:41:44.936 --> 00:41:51.175
general, Dan Petro in here? He
has a lot of -- [indiscernible]

00:41:51.175 --> 00:41:56.514
shouldn't be used in general
when it comes to physical

00:41:56.514 --> 00:42:01.319
security. A password that you
can never change and you leave

00:42:01.319 --> 00:42:05.757
behind on everything you touch.
You can't revoke it. It's the

00:42:05.757 --> 00:42:10.328
worst ever. You can't hash the
values because fingerprints

00:42:10.328 --> 00:42:15.400
aren't exact so there has to be
a fudge factor. You can't hash

00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:22.340
them to somebody. They're
terrible when trying to

00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:27.578
physically secure something.
Fortunately there's ..(audio

00:42:27.578 --> 00:42:35.420
blipped).. attacks against the
cards is extremely viable. I

00:42:35.420 --> 00:42:43.161
gave you a preview, that brad
antenna that I mentioned, he is

00:42:43.161 --> 00:42:51.002
coming up with pretty cool tools
as well. If once your kids all

00:42:51.002 --> 00:42:55.173
start rocking the RFID blocking
skinny jeans there is nothing

00:42:55.173 --> 00:42:59.510
you can do anymore from that
attack vector. You have to go

00:42:59.510 --> 00:43:03.714
after the readers and pop the
lids off them. People mention

00:43:03.714 --> 00:43:08.186
this all the time. The Gecko.
Unless you're friends and he

00:43:08.186 --> 00:43:14.725
lets you borrow it's, it's of no
use to you. It was one of the

00:43:14.725 --> 00:43:20.531
first back door devices to
implant. Not only recording the

00:43:20.531 --> 00:43:25.069
values that it sees, but you can
walk up with the phone and say

00:43:25.069 --> 00:43:31.676
hey, you send one of the badge
values that you know about to

00:43:31.676 --> 00:43:38.616
the badge directly and it opens
the door for you. It's like a

00:43:38.616 --> 00:43:41.452
smart home lock. You're not
supposed to have access to open

00:43:41.452 --> 00:43:45.890
the doors without the badge.
These guys came up with the BLE

00:43:45.890 --> 00:43:51.896
key which is basically similar
functionality as well. Extremely

00:43:59.470 --> 00:44:04.809
small. [indiscernible] at a
target facility. You can come up

00:44:04.809 --> 00:44:09.413
with bluetooth and have your
phone and dump the list of

00:44:09.413 --> 00:44:12.717
values that it's seen and open
the door by replaying the

00:44:12.717 --> 00:44:19.991
values. The BLE guys in here?
That's cool. This just came out

00:44:19.991 --> 00:44:25.997
a couple days ago. You can see
how small it is there. So that's

00:44:31.002 --> 00:44:33.804
attacking the reader basically.
In the middle of the night, you

00:44:33.804 --> 00:44:36.274
pop the lid off the reader and
putting something in there to

00:44:36.274 --> 00:44:43.948
tamper with it. The reader talks
to the controller that makes the

00:44:43.948 --> 00:44:47.552
access decisions. Basically
Brad's talks he released this on

00:44:47.552 --> 00:44:54.492
GitHub, basically a number of
Artunio tools to do brute

00:44:54.492 --> 00:45:01.666
forcing. Instead of doing it
over the air, going up to the

00:45:01.666 --> 00:45:04.802
reader and physically blocking
it and brute forcing it is five

00:45:04.802 --> 00:45:10.675
times faster. As well as a back
door device of his own. Here is

00:45:10.675 --> 00:45:16.681
a few of them. Basically being
able to brute force. Emulator.

00:45:18.783 --> 00:45:25.256
The key and things that we
mentioned. A number of scripts.

00:45:25.256 --> 00:45:29.460
If you have access, open up the
doors or dump out the cache to

00:45:29.460 --> 00:45:34.665
the controller. If you have
network access to the controller

00:45:34.665 --> 00:45:39.937
at all, this is game over. Other
tools. Releasing tools for

00:45:39.937 --> 00:45:47.078
scanning to identify these
things on the network. How many

00:45:47.078 --> 00:45:49.714
people here have run -- are
physical security? Two? Three?

00:45:49.714 --> 00:45:53.818
It's all pentesters. So I mean
when you look at these things,

00:46:01.726 --> 00:46:04.362
most physical security people I
know are ex-cops. They didn't

00:46:04.362 --> 00:46:09.000
come from an IT background.
They're ex-cops. Typically

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:12.770
products that are purchased
outside of the traditional IT

00:46:12.770 --> 00:46:17.775
purchasing infrastructure. IT
buys and gets licenses for

00:46:17.775 --> 00:46:20.911
everything except for the
physical security guys that pick

00:46:20.911 --> 00:46:26.083
out these technologies and run
with them. These networks aren't

00:46:26.083 --> 00:46:30.921
supposed to be hooked up to
corporate networks you shouldn't

00:46:30.921 --> 00:46:34.959
be able to sit in a cube and
ping the badge reader at the

00:46:34.959 --> 00:46:40.965
front door. These guys are
watching the cameras and want to

00:46:43.367 --> 00:46:47.605
check out their fantasy football
stats and browse the web.

00:46:47.605 --> 00:46:52.910
They're on the network that is
the physical network every time

00:46:52.910 --> 00:46:57.648
they end up getting bridged in
some way because of that. All I

00:46:57.648 --> 00:47:01.152
can look at is the camera and
the badges. I'm going to check

00:47:01.152 --> 00:47:06.490
what my team is doing.
Eventually they end up on the

00:47:06.490 --> 00:47:10.728
internet. You find a few hundred
buildings open on the internet,

00:47:10.728 --> 00:47:15.599
nah is how they happens and
they're easier to find because

00:47:15.599 --> 00:47:17.902
you have these tools, this
discovery tool that goes out.

00:47:17.902 --> 00:47:23.207
They have their own language and
-- global was nice enough to

00:47:23.207 --> 00:47:26.944
register their Mac address. If
you scan a bunch of devices you

00:47:26.944 --> 00:47:28.946
can ..(audio blipped).. that
begins with 00, 06, 80. As

00:47:28.946 --> 00:47:30.948
people do these mass scanning
projects of the internet, and

00:47:30.948 --> 00:47:32.950
huge data repositories of every
device on the internet, it makes

00:47:32.950 --> 00:47:38.956
it a lot easier to sort through
them to find physical security

00:47:51.168 --> 00:47:57.174
devices that you're looking for.
If you have access to a Tele net

00:47:59.543 --> 00:48:05.483
web, it's going to be root pass.
They can't change it. Open all

00:48:09.587 --> 00:48:15.593
the doors, close all the doors.
Badge values. This is just --

00:48:19.363 --> 00:48:22.733
(muffled) this is the
PowerPoint, the slides are old.

00:48:22.733 --> 00:48:28.739
You can download the kali Linux
image as well as pony express.

00:48:32.176 --> 00:48:37.081
There is links to a number of
things. You get a raspberry pie

00:48:37.081 --> 00:48:41.285
and download the SD card and --
plug type images and preprint

00:48:41.285 --> 00:48:47.291
the files that we'll have on our
site and for 40 bucks you're

00:48:49.593 --> 00:48:52.963
good to go with your own
realistic looking back door. So

00:48:52.963 --> 00:48:56.066
you don't have to be like Mr.
Robot and pull down the wall,

00:48:56.066 --> 00:49:02.006
stuff. [indiscernible] the
Nintendo one. This is the

00:49:06.877 --> 00:49:12.116
longest thing I've ever printed.
I had to put disks on them to

00:49:12.116 --> 00:49:18.088
keep them from curling up. They
just snap off. But the pressure

00:49:18.088 --> 00:49:23.928
loads. It's all taken care of.
You download and print it. How

00:49:23.928 --> 00:49:29.934
are we doing on time? It's
getting close to time here. I

00:49:37.408 --> 00:49:42.379
pushed these to the end. Credit
cards. Quite frankly the first

00:49:42.379 --> 00:49:46.183
question a reporter asks is tell
me about mobile payment systems

00:49:46.183 --> 00:49:50.387
and credit cards and RFID. It's
the first question. They're

00:49:50.387 --> 00:49:55.593
pretty locked down. It's the
least sexy RFID hacking there

00:49:55.593 --> 00:49:59.096
is. There is really not a lot
you can do to get over on the

00:49:59.096 --> 00:50:01.498
credit card companies. And I'm
on Google earth and there's a

00:50:01.498 --> 00:50:05.269
news article with a critical
vulnerability found in Apple pay

00:50:05.269 --> 00:50:11.275
and you're reading through it
and five paragraphs in, and I'm

00:50:13.978 --> 00:50:19.083
reading this one, basically
people set up access point and

00:50:19.083 --> 00:50:22.586
redirected browser traffic and
said enter your credit card

00:50:22.586 --> 00:50:28.192
number and it was for an iPhone.
That was the head line. Apple

00:50:28.192 --> 00:50:33.964
pay vulnerability and it had
nothing to do with it

00:50:33.964 --> 00:50:36.700
whatsoever. And people are
stretching for that. The credit

00:50:36.700 --> 00:50:39.470
card companies, there is
basically not a lot you can do.

00:50:39.470 --> 00:50:44.475
There is a good blog there. It's
highlighted, the URL from Brad

00:50:44.475 --> 00:50:50.447
and analyze what is on your
card. The two best resources are

00:50:50.447 --> 00:50:55.953
those two there and Christian
Pagent's talk. If you read the

00:50:55.953 --> 00:51:00.324
blog post and saw that talk,
that gives you the best overall

00:51:00.324 --> 00:51:07.498
view of credit card hacking.
Dynamic CDV. If you're going to

00:51:07.498 --> 00:51:11.468
order a pizza and you put in the
credit card number and name and

00:51:11.468 --> 00:51:15.406
expiration date. When you do
RFID the security code is

00:51:15.406 --> 00:51:19.643
different every time. And the
credit card knows they're not

00:51:19.643 --> 00:51:21.645
going to be in order. If I scan
your badge, every transaction I

00:51:21.645 --> 00:51:26.216
have to walk by you four times.
I have to get the next four

00:51:26.216 --> 00:51:32.222
security codes. If you bought
pizza with RFID before I did

00:51:38.362 --> 00:51:42.066
that you present a newer version
and I present an older version.

00:51:44.368 --> 00:51:46.937
There is not a lot you can do,
it's not really sexy. Passports

00:51:46.937 --> 00:51:52.943
and travel documents in general.
There [indiscernible] scary is

00:51:57.581 --> 00:52:00.551
the Ultra-High frequency. You
have passport books and passport

00:52:00.551 --> 00:52:03.921
cards. The books are high
frequency and the cards are

00:52:03.921 --> 00:52:07.024
Ultra-High frequency. Green
cards are Ultra-High frequency.

00:52:07.024 --> 00:52:13.030
And they serve no practical
purpose except for human

00:52:15.566 --> 00:52:19.870
behavior pattern establishment.
Pattern of life establishment.

00:52:19.870 --> 00:52:23.874
Tracking what isle in Walgreens
you went up and down, where you

00:52:23.874 --> 00:52:29.847
went in the city. Enhanced
driver's license, it's the

00:52:29.847 --> 00:52:35.853
federal ID. Something you have
on your person at all times.

00:52:40.591 --> 00:52:46.597
They can track where you're
going. That is the only real

00:52:50.934 --> 00:52:54.738
purpose it serves. It's
ridiculous. This is a tool you

00:52:54.738 --> 00:52:58.475
can use -- ski passes. Put it on
your helmet and go to the ski

00:52:58.475 --> 00:53:03.981
lodge. If you can read it at all
from several miles away you can

00:53:03.981 --> 00:53:07.217
read it and copy. I have a copy
of my buddy's green card if

00:53:07.217 --> 00:53:13.223
anyone is looking for that. Got
it. Defenses, you can read these

00:53:15.392 --> 00:53:21.932
slides later. The skinny jeans.
And blazers now, RFID blocking

00:53:21.932 --> 00:53:28.272
blazers for the business person
on the go. Check out this and

00:53:28.272 --> 00:53:30.274
thanks everybody.
