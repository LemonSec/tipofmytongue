00:00:00.267 --> 00:00:04.037
So, yes, I'm Jason Larsen. This
is Marina Krotofil and this is

00:00:04.037 --> 00:00:10.043
rocking the pocketbook. We're a
team of an academic and a

00:00:12.112 --> 00:00:18.118
hacker. I'm the evil hacker and
she's the cute academic. We're

00:00:20.621 --> 00:00:26.627
here to play who wants to be a
millionaire. If you're in Vegas

00:00:31.365 --> 00:00:36.036
probably you want to be rich. So
this talk is about giving you

00:00:36.036 --> 00:00:40.173
all the tools to get rich and
get all the girls like in the

00:00:40.173 --> 00:00:47.514
movies. If you want to get rich
and have money, maybe you want

00:00:47.514 --> 00:00:51.885
to hack some process control
networks. So industrial control

00:00:51.885 --> 00:00:55.489
systems. So in general,
industrial control systems are

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:58.358
just a whole bunch of computers
that have only one thing that is

00:00:58.358 --> 00:01:00.594
different than all the other
computers in the world. They run

00:01:00.594 --> 00:01:03.664
physical stuff out in the real
world. They run power grids,

00:01:03.664 --> 00:01:10.137
chemical plants, all of that
type of stuff. So typically run

00:01:10.137 --> 00:01:14.708
for the benefit of man kind. So
industry means big business and

00:01:14.708 --> 00:01:19.780
big business means big dollars.
So some smart hacker starts in a

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:25.118
coffee shop and sits down and
clicks on a keyboard and half a

00:01:25.118 --> 00:01:29.323
world away, of course all the
movies will tell us that fire

00:01:29.323 --> 00:01:32.960
and destruction breaks out at
some factory over there. But all

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.329
the stuff that happens in the
middle is one of the big

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:43.170
mysteries of the 21st century.
So the typical understanding of

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:49.176
SCADA hacking, there's this
magic big red button and

00:01:52.346 --> 00:01:55.549
whatever your thing is, it
either shuts down the process

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:59.886
nicely or it hits the button and
everything blows up. In reality,

00:01:59.886 --> 00:02:04.791
the hacker has to build the big
red button there's not one there

00:02:04.791 --> 00:02:12.499
for him. >> To start with, the
attacker has to decide what he

00:02:12.499 --> 00:02:19.606
wants to do to the process. Like
impacts can be divided into

00:02:19.606 --> 00:02:26.713
three groups. You can for
example -- you can go after the

00:02:26.713 --> 00:02:32.352
production, for example, you can
spoil the product, production

00:02:32.352 --> 00:02:35.689
that's more expensive so the
product will be less competitive

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:41.194
on the market. And these two
groups of damage will never make

00:02:41.194 --> 00:02:44.965
the headlines because the
companies do not need to report

00:02:44.965 --> 00:02:49.770
them and it's bad for their
reputation. So if you want to

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.672
change the company and make it
public, then have you to make

00:02:52.672 --> 00:02:58.679
the company noncompliant. The
most damaging attack will be the

00:03:05.719 --> 00:03:13.527
attack on occupational and
environmental safety. The

00:03:13.527 --> 00:03:18.999
productions of contractual
agreements. And when the

00:03:18.999 --> 00:03:25.005
attacker decides well what do I
select out of this list. So he

00:03:29.176 --> 00:03:36.983
has to kind of follow some
thinking process. So, for

00:03:36.983 --> 00:03:43.256
example, damage equipment,
damage comes to hacker mind

00:03:43.256 --> 00:03:51.064
first. The disadvantage is it's
irreversible. You can't undo it

00:03:51.064 --> 00:03:57.070
later on. The problem is it's
difficult to understand what is

00:03:59.673 --> 00:04:05.078
collateral damage. Public
information is easily available.

00:04:05.078 --> 00:04:12.919
Again the problem is the
collateral damage is unclear if

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:18.925
you contaminate the water you
may kill the fish. So many

00:04:21.394 --> 00:04:27.100
people get upset with that. This
type of attack, probably might

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:32.773
be what you want. But if you are
not unclear how well you hide

00:04:32.773 --> 00:04:38.578
your traces, you might not want
to do. Like it may be problem

00:04:38.578 --> 00:04:44.251
for you because investigating
the case. So out of this

00:04:44.251 --> 00:04:50.524
consideration, the production --
nobody needs to report them,

00:04:50.524 --> 00:04:55.629
nothing get killed. So for the
attack it sounds like more safer

00:04:55.629 --> 00:05:00.000
scenario. And this is exactly
will be what we will be

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.070
considering in this talk. We
will illustrate the attack from

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:08.141
the beginning to end, how we
will cause persistent economic

00:05:08.141 --> 00:05:12.512
damage to the plant. And the key
word here is persistent. So you

00:05:12.512 --> 00:05:17.851
want make it hurt for a long
time. The thing that you have to

00:05:17.851 --> 00:05:20.487
make sure that the attack will
not be attributed to cyber. >>

00:05:20.487 --> 00:05:25.792
So process control. We're going
to go over a little of process

00:05:25.792 --> 00:05:31.798
control basics. This a 101
track. If you go and look at the

00:05:41.541 --> 00:05:43.543
thermostat, on the thermostat
you've got a sensing element

00:05:43.543 --> 00:05:45.545
that measures the temperature
and then you have a set point.

00:05:45.545 --> 00:05:47.547
So whatever temperature you set
it to, you say I want my house

00:05:47.547 --> 00:05:49.549
to be set to 72 degrees and keep
it at 72 degrees. So we do this

00:05:49.549 --> 00:05:51.551
because in the 21st century
nobody likes to run up and down

00:05:51.551 --> 00:05:53.553
and kick the furnace on every
time they want it on and off. So

00:05:53.553 --> 00:05:55.555
in process control terms this is
a control loop. You have sensors

00:05:55.555 --> 00:05:57.557
and they feedback through the
control systems and the

00:05:57.557 --> 00:05:59.559
actuators turn things off and on
whenever the control point is

00:05:59.559 --> 00:06:01.494
set. In the control system this
is just another way to look at a

00:06:01.494 --> 00:06:03.496
control system. Here we have all
the same processes and the

00:06:03.496 --> 00:06:05.498
measured actual set point is
called the process variable. The

00:06:05.498 --> 00:06:07.500
observed temperature in the
house right now is called a

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.502
measured variable and it feeds
back in the little red X over

00:06:09.502 --> 00:06:11.504
there we make decisions on
whether we should kick things on

00:06:11.504 --> 00:06:13.506
and kick things off. So if you
go up to a large scale, then you

00:06:13.506 --> 00:06:15.508
can't really fit all of the
logic that needs to run a whole

00:06:15.508 --> 00:06:17.510
big chemical plant inside a
little thermostat. We stick them

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:19.512
in larger boxes. We call these
program controllers. They're

00:06:19.512 --> 00:06:21.514
specialized computers. In
general, the internals of a PLC,

00:06:21.514 --> 00:06:23.516
you have a whole bunch of
sensors that are plugged into

00:06:23.516 --> 00:06:25.518
it, one time per scan cycle, it
takes all the readings and

00:06:25.518 --> 00:06:27.520
copies it into input memory and
runs logic and those outputs are

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.522
turned around and run all the
actuators. So the PLC is the

00:06:29.522 --> 00:06:31.524
brains of the control that are
running it. Most PLCs are

00:06:31.524 --> 00:06:33.526
programmed rapidly. Back from
the day when everybody still ran

00:06:33.526 --> 00:06:35.528
processes and peg boards you
would have your input plugged

00:06:35.528 --> 00:06:37.530
into the. And so we did that
graphically and it's still

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:39.532
programmed that way. So most of
the time. So the most common

00:06:39.532 --> 00:06:41.534
control algorithm that's out
there is PID. This is a complex

00:06:41.534 --> 00:06:43.536
set of equations that run to try
and keep the process within

00:06:43.536 --> 00:06:46.940
certain limits. So outside the
PLC you have the PLC and wires

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:52.946
running out into plants. Those
are cabled up and run into big

00:06:58.985 --> 00:07:04.924
wiring closets and these are
mostly analog things. This is

00:07:08.962 --> 00:07:14.968
usually not IP-based technology.
So even though the PLC has all

00:07:19.839 --> 00:07:22.008
this logic and everything can
throw into it, we still need

00:07:22.008 --> 00:07:24.844
humans. So a good friend of mine
that works in nuclear says that

00:07:24.844 --> 00:07:27.447
any chemical plant you build is
in an imminent state of failure

00:07:27.447 --> 00:07:29.582
and it stays that way forever.
So things go wrong all the time

00:07:29.582 --> 00:07:35.588
in plants. Everybody knows it
doesn't hum along batch after

00:07:56.609 --> 00:08:02.549
batch like a computer program.
So the operator has to sit there

00:08:20.867 --> 00:08:24.104
and see all the alarms coming
over there and figure out what

00:08:24.104 --> 00:08:26.906
to do and generally keep things
in control. >> So specifically

00:08:26.906 --> 00:08:29.709
for this talk it is extremely
important to understand what is

00:08:29.709 --> 00:08:32.512
the different between IT hacking
and OT hacking. Because what we

00:08:32.512 --> 00:08:35.048
are going to do is not IT
hacking. It's operational

00:08:35.048 --> 00:08:37.317
technology. We have PLC which
prevent operator from observing

00:08:37.317 --> 00:08:40.420
the real state of the process.
So after the attack was

00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:42.555
discovered, figure out how does
it happen. What interrupted the

00:08:42.555 --> 00:08:47.027
flow. None of them has any sense
to the operator. He doesn't give

00:08:47.027 --> 00:08:52.065
a shit. Only what he says is
like, I'm not controlling the

00:08:52.065 --> 00:08:58.071
process. And this is in OT
security, the security that you

00:09:39.212 --> 00:09:45.218
need to observe, observability
and controllability. You need to

00:10:49.682 --> 00:10:54.654
be able to measure the process
in order to be able to control

00:10:54.654 --> 00:10:57.023
it. If you are not measuring, if
you are not observing the

00:10:57.023 --> 00:10:59.792
process, you are not controlling
it. So you're not having a

00:10:59.792 --> 00:11:05.732
process. >> So an attacker that
wants to do something behind

00:11:12.572 --> 00:11:15.542
beyond simple may yes, ma'am
will want to control the

00:11:15.542 --> 00:11:19.913
process. If you run over there
and say there's a burner

00:11:19.913 --> 00:11:26.419
underneath this tank and I'll
crank it up and bad things will

00:11:26.419 --> 00:11:31.024
happen. Usually what you're
going to do is exercise the

00:11:31.024 --> 00:11:36.029
shutdown logic of the process.
Once you hook everything in the

00:11:36.029 --> 00:11:39.265
process together, they're
actually related in the physics

00:11:39.265 --> 00:11:41.701
relationship. So if you crank up
the temperature, you're going to

00:11:41.701 --> 00:11:44.404
change the pressure and the
flows and everything else that's

00:11:44.404 --> 00:11:46.406
going to happen downstream. So
in order to actually attack the

00:11:46.406 --> 00:11:48.408
process, you need to remain in
control of the process. And you

00:11:48.408 --> 00:11:50.410
need to work in terms of control
theory and not in terms of

00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:52.412
hacker like injections and
scripting involved. >> So in the

00:11:52.412 --> 00:11:54.414
domain, the attacker and
operator, they competing for the

00:11:54.414 --> 00:11:56.416
controls over the process. And
the attacker wants to be -- so

00:11:56.416 --> 00:11:58.418
the security is in the IT domain
are actual controllability, the

00:11:58.418 --> 00:12:00.353
availability describe the state
of the process. So just to

00:12:00.353 --> 00:12:02.355
remember CIA this for
information security, CO 2 for

00:12:02.355 --> 00:12:04.357
control security. And I know
that the guys who grew up with

00:12:04.357 --> 00:12:06.359
this state of mind they will
hate it. But just shake it off.

00:12:06.359 --> 00:12:08.361
(Laughter.) >> So when the
attacker goes and hits the

00:12:08.361 --> 00:12:10.363
process, he can take one of a
few approaches. So he can either

00:12:10.363 --> 00:12:12.365
take control of process and
reliably control it through the

00:12:12.365 --> 00:12:14.367
entire life cycle of the attack.
And this is what we'll talk

00:12:14.367 --> 00:12:16.369
about later. He can take control
of the process and control it

00:12:16.369 --> 00:12:18.371
into a state that then puts it
in failure and just let it go

00:12:18.371 --> 00:12:24.377
and let bad things happen. And
that's what I talked about a few

00:12:29.082 --> 00:12:35.088
days ago at Def Con. Or you can
make the process unusable by

00:12:46.366 --> 00:12:52.372
messing with the controls. So
let's consider a car and a

00:13:00.947 --> 00:13:06.619
driver. So the attacker has
hacked into a car and he has

00:13:06.619 --> 00:13:12.625
control of the brakes. So if he
comes over and grabs the left

00:13:39.252 --> 00:13:45.258
brake, the driver is going to
compensate and go to the left.

00:13:49.762 --> 00:13:54.267
The hacker is going to
compensate the other way until

00:13:54.267 --> 00:13:58.304
they're going back and forth
trying to keep the car under

00:13:58.304 --> 00:14:03.276
control. So since the attacker
is a computer, the attacker will

00:14:03.276 --> 00:14:08.715
always be able to anticipate and
win this one. We call these

00:14:08.715 --> 00:14:13.820
multiadaptive algorithms. In the
case of the car, the human is

00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:17.724
called the hidden actor in the
process. So any subset of a

00:14:17.724 --> 00:14:22.228
process can be modeled as a
hidden actor. So if you have a

00:14:22.228 --> 00:14:29.035
refining phase you can consider
that the hidden actor and apply

00:14:29.035 --> 00:14:32.338
multifeedback or multiadaptive
algorithm loops, run them back

00:14:32.338 --> 00:14:36.209
and forth and try to get things
to run out of control. So this

00:14:36.209 --> 00:14:42.482
is actually a single set of
algorithms that's based on the

00:14:42.482 --> 00:14:46.486
algorithms we use to
automatically tune process

00:14:46.486 --> 00:14:51.657
control variable loops. Except
we're applying them to remove

00:14:51.657 --> 00:14:55.628
the variation to add more and
more variation over time. So you

00:14:55.628 --> 00:14:58.531
can grab them and apply them to
a car or apply them to a boiler

00:14:58.531 --> 00:15:06.172
and they work just as well
either way. >> All right. So we

00:15:06.172 --> 00:15:12.378
are ready to start. So whenever
you want like -- before you even

00:15:12.378 --> 00:15:14.981
start something like -- you need
to learn like -- and also you

00:15:14.981 --> 00:15:16.983
need to test your attack. It's
really possible to buy a

00:15:16.983 --> 00:15:20.386
chemical plant the problem is
plants are extremely expensive.

00:15:20.386 --> 00:15:22.588
Also you cannot relocate them
easily and you need more than

00:15:22.588 --> 00:15:24.590
two people to run them. You will
need more money to fix it. So

00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:26.592
hacking into a real plant is not
sustainable. So the -- more

00:15:26.592 --> 00:15:28.594
common to use a model of the
processes. So researcher been

00:15:28.594 --> 00:15:30.596
using a model -- it's a plant
which produce a commodity

00:15:30.596 --> 00:15:32.598
chemical vinyl acetate which is
used to produce chemical plastic

00:15:32.598 --> 00:15:38.604
and so on. And that's like also
release two models of chemical

00:15:42.608 --> 00:15:48.614
plants which transform into the
framework physical exercises.

00:16:24.483 --> 00:16:31.891
Wanted to show you quickly how
it looks like. >> So this is a

00:16:31.891 --> 00:16:37.897
how much far we can get to the
open source. All chemical like,

00:16:45.304 --> 00:16:51.310
all models processes, this is
information -- yeah. (Laughter.)

00:16:54.614 --> 00:17:00.553
Oh, no. >> The problem is --
model of the plant what you see

00:17:08.995 --> 00:17:15.001
on the website is on the left
side is actually the set point

00:17:22.408 --> 00:17:28.748
into the process. So if it will
kick in a little bit inside,

00:17:28.748 --> 00:17:35.154
this is the plant, this will be
-- this is the source code which

00:17:35.154 --> 00:17:42.028
actually schedules all the
report, CCC processes. >> I have

00:17:42.028 --> 00:17:48.034
something for you. How are they
doing? (Applause.) >> As you all

00:17:50.269 --> 00:17:56.475
know, it is not easy to get
accepted as speakers at Def Con

00:17:56.475 --> 00:17:59.779
and you two have accomplished
this, congratulations and thank

00:17:59.779 --> 00:18:07.253
all of you for staying here late
and seeing them. So give

00:18:07.253 --> 00:18:13.259
yourselves a round of applause.
You all know the drill. Here's

00:18:19.332 --> 00:18:25.237
to Def Con. (Applause.) Now I
just want to see you continue.

00:18:25.237 --> 00:18:31.243
(Laughter.) So for example the
advantage of the model they're

00:18:35.414 --> 00:18:41.420
easy to understand and it's
extremely to -- for example go

00:18:45.891 --> 00:18:49.829
here, integrated the blogs where
we can for example model

00:18:49.829 --> 00:18:54.000
different attacks on the signals
and here the different we can

00:18:54.000 --> 00:19:01.240
select the different attacks and
so on. And here we go inside.

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:06.579
This is the control levels which
handles like if it can see this

00:19:06.579 --> 00:19:12.485
is attack here and so on. Just
to give you feelings like what

00:19:12.485 --> 00:19:17.123
we've been working in and we
build all of this. So if we will

00:19:17.123 --> 00:19:21.527
go one more here. So this is
entire control structure of the

00:19:21.527 --> 00:19:24.063
plant with all of the
controllers. Transmitters,

00:19:24.063 --> 00:19:31.337
sensors. A lot of parameters and
everything we have been

00:19:31.337 --> 00:19:36.509
introducing you in this
beginning, the attacker cannot

00:19:36.509 --> 00:19:40.546
have the process if he does not
understand the principle how do

00:19:40.546 --> 00:19:46.552
you tune them and so on. So that
was just to just give you what

00:19:54.193 --> 00:20:01.033
we've been talking from. >> The
stages of cyber physical

00:20:01.033 --> 00:20:07.873
attacks. When you're attacking a
process you need a final pay

00:20:07.873 --> 00:20:12.445
load that you deliver to the
process. This is going to be

00:20:12.445 --> 00:20:16.348
carried out on the target
process and final pay loads are

00:20:16.348 --> 00:20:21.520
always bespoke. You can't take
the final payload for one vinyl

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:24.990
acetate plant and play it on
other vinyl acetate plant. So an

00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:26.992
attacker that is remotely
attacking a process is

00:20:26.992 --> 00:20:28.994
immediately gifted with complete
knowledge and all the things he

00:20:28.994 --> 00:20:30.996
has to manipulate before he gets
to deliver this final pay load

00:20:30.996 --> 00:20:32.998
to the process. And generally
you run through the attacks in

00:20:32.998 --> 00:20:35.000
stages but your knowledge is
never complete. So once you

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.002
first get into the process, you
don't know anything about it and

00:20:37.002 --> 00:20:39.004
you start figuring out stuff and
you move through the stages of

00:20:39.004 --> 00:20:41.006
them and then you have to circle
back and say I need to know more

00:20:41.006 --> 00:20:43.008
about the process before I can
start controlling the process.

00:20:43.008 --> 00:20:45.578
And continue on from there. So
the first staining of hacking

00:20:45.578 --> 00:20:48.581
process is access. So you have
the guy in the coffee shop in

00:20:48.581 --> 00:20:51.117
France and he's running over and
hacking in the process. In

00:20:51.117 --> 00:20:53.452
general SCADA networks, have
them click on to the business

00:20:53.452 --> 00:20:55.454
network. So generally process
control networks have firewalls

00:20:55.454 --> 00:20:57.456
and additional protections away
from the business network. So

00:20:57.456 --> 00:20:59.458
there you've got to get across
antiviruses, patch management

00:20:59.458 --> 00:21:02.361
systems and into the process
control network. But once you're

00:21:02.361 --> 00:21:05.464
into the process control network
then you stop having to use

00:21:05.464 --> 00:21:07.466
hackers tools. Because most of
the things in the process

00:21:07.466 --> 00:21:09.468
control network will respond to
any properly formatted commands.

00:21:09.468 --> 00:21:11.470
If you take a modbus controller
and throw that pump on, it will

00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:13.472
take that command and run on it.
So you can move freely. Now

00:21:13.472 --> 00:21:15.474
there's people that will sell
you exploit packs. You can run

00:21:15.474 --> 00:21:17.476
to the network, apply a bunch of
credit card to the problem,

00:21:17.476 --> 00:21:19.478
you're all done and you have a
bunch of exploits for the SCADA

00:21:19.478 --> 00:21:25.484
network. There is an alternative
approach. One of the things you

00:21:47.973 --> 00:21:53.979
can do nowadays, if you don't
really care who you're hacking

00:22:21.173 --> 00:22:27.179
into, show me all the industrial
controllers on the Internet.

00:22:46.832 --> 00:22:51.103
There's way more than there
should be. Go grab a bunch. Pop

00:22:51.103 --> 00:22:57.109
pop pop. And a third approach
you can get sensors are getting

00:22:59.245 --> 00:23:01.981
smarter and smarter. They're
getting IP stacks and are all

00:23:01.981 --> 00:23:07.987
getting to be part of the thing.
So if you looked at my

00:23:11.223 --> 00:23:17.596
presentation in 2014, I
described how to take the SCADA

00:23:17.596 --> 00:23:21.367
attack and miniaturize it. You
just have to get the sensor into

00:23:21.367 --> 00:23:28.707
the middle of the process and it
can unpack itself and keep on

00:23:28.707 --> 00:23:34.947
going. So after that you have
discovery. >> Okay. So you're

00:23:34.947 --> 00:23:38.317
in. So how much do you know
about the plant? Well, I'm in

00:23:38.317 --> 00:23:42.855
some plant. You really need to
understand lot of things about

00:23:42.855 --> 00:23:48.861
it. Do you know what stripper
is? (Laughter.) No. It's not

00:23:52.364 --> 00:23:59.038
exotic dancer. It's a stripping
column. So you really need to

00:23:59.038 --> 00:24:02.608
understand the treatment when
you try to hack a plant. So in

00:24:02.608 --> 00:24:06.578
general hacker need to know this
much information about the

00:24:06.578 --> 00:24:08.580
plant. The actual kinetics are
proprietary, how the process is

00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:12.051
controlled. What is the control
strategy, how the plant --

00:24:12.051 --> 00:24:18.057
basically how the sensors
connected to the PLCs and very

00:24:30.703 --> 00:24:34.373
important what is the physical
constraints of the plant. These

00:24:34.373 --> 00:24:39.545
stages very long time old
fashioned espionage. And for

00:24:39.545 --> 00:24:45.651
example most information you
will need to hack is for example

00:24:45.651 --> 00:24:52.825
most of the treatment is
designed by third-parties. And

00:24:52.825 --> 00:24:55.260
actually the attack is
understood the necessity of the

00:24:55.260 --> 00:25:00.999
stage long time ago. The
industry started long time ago

00:25:00.999 --> 00:25:06.305
with the samples. And just to
quote you the description of one

00:25:06.305 --> 00:25:09.908
of the ATTs is that the goal of
the attackers appear to be

00:25:09.908 --> 00:25:14.580
intellectual property such as
documents, formulas and

00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:19.385
manufacturing processes. So the
attacker knows what to do. So

00:25:19.385 --> 00:25:22.988
then you'll be looking something
like that looks like chemical

00:25:22.988 --> 00:25:28.727
formulas, instrumentation
diagrams, instrumentation list,

00:25:28.727 --> 00:25:34.733
and he will understand how the
plant is built and operate, he

00:25:39.772 --> 00:25:43.742
will start thinking what can I
do to cause persistent economic

00:25:43.742 --> 00:25:49.748
damage. So at this stage you
already understand how the plant

00:25:54.753 --> 00:26:00.893
works. So in general the easiest
way to cause economic damage is

00:26:00.893 --> 00:26:06.098
to destroy the pipes that
carries the final product. It's

00:26:06.098 --> 00:26:10.769
not persistent. The plant can be
divided into two parts. Reaction

00:26:10.769 --> 00:26:14.540
to refinement. It's just
approximately 1 kilometer long.

00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:20.012
A lot of opportunities to mess
up with these things but

00:26:20.012 --> 00:26:24.016
operators have opportunities to
notice and correct things.

00:26:24.016 --> 00:26:29.488
Moreover you can always recycle
product back and try to refine

00:26:29.488 --> 00:26:34.460
it again. In contrast the
reaction process in the reactor,

00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:38.297
you reliably produce less
product. So that it's good

00:26:38.297 --> 00:26:42.201
scenario for the persistent
economic damage. And important

00:26:42.201 --> 00:26:45.604
to understand that even this
simple analysis is not possible

00:26:45.604 --> 00:26:51.610
without input of experts. So
after this -- then the attacker

00:26:57.149 --> 00:27:00.686
has to start -- needs to figure
out how the plant is -- this is

00:27:00.686 --> 00:27:06.358
one of the most time consuming
and difficult part of the SCADA

00:27:06.358 --> 00:27:11.663
hacking. So the hacker has to
figure out where the

00:27:11.663 --> 00:27:18.036
relationship between the tags
and the PLC and how it all looks

00:27:18.036 --> 00:27:24.376
on the diagrams. So most of the
process operate on the points,

00:27:24.376 --> 00:27:29.147
abstract player so everything
can be measured basically and

00:27:29.147 --> 00:27:34.086
set. The plant may have 10 --> 000
points. Where do they go, what

00:27:34.086 --> 00:27:40.292
do they do. You have to perform
all of this mapping. It's a lot

00:27:40.292 --> 00:27:47.432
of work and interestingly
enough, the malware first

00:27:47.432 --> 00:27:53.305
attempts on tackers could
actually map and mind their

00:27:53.305 --> 00:27:58.277
equipment in the field. So the
attackers already this far. So

00:27:58.277 --> 00:28:02.047
this stage he already could
figure out all of the mapping

00:28:02.047 --> 00:28:08.220
between equipment and
controllers. So we are back to

00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:15.694
-- we need to figure out the
location of the control loops.

00:28:15.694 --> 00:28:19.431
Once we have that, the attacker
needs to understand how those

00:28:19.431 --> 00:28:25.971
control loops are tuned. The
good place to go for that is

00:28:25.971 --> 00:28:30.642
instrument engineering
application, because they will

00:28:30.642 --> 00:28:38.584
have everything you need. We
will be looking for something

00:28:38.584 --> 00:28:43.288
like this is a pressure points
meter and it serves the reactor

00:28:43.288 --> 00:28:48.660
control loop. It, we have here
it will be the tag. It's

00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:54.666
actually -- there are all the
parameters, how the instrument

00:28:57.502 --> 00:29:02.975
used within the process. And
what is also very interesting,

00:29:02.975 --> 00:29:07.412
we have also had user who is
allowed to modify this

00:29:07.412 --> 00:29:10.649
equipment. So we now know what
account details we need to

00:29:10.649 --> 00:29:16.655
obtain. So what the attacker
needs to do is close. And nicely

00:29:21.627 --> 00:29:25.330
flow from left to right, they
flow all kinds of direction. For

00:29:25.330 --> 00:29:31.169
example, in this case vinyl
acetate it flows from tank to

00:29:31.169 --> 00:29:34.840
the reactor section and to the
refinement section. It's too bad

00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:39.111
for us because we need to
operate the valve and that means

00:29:39.111 --> 00:29:46.251
we will have to -- we would not
want to do that because we need

00:29:46.251 --> 00:29:51.957
to invade more devices. So this
is the attacker will find this

00:29:51.957 --> 00:29:56.261
information. So this stage we
already know everything about

00:29:56.261 --> 00:30:00.532
the control configuration and
location of the control valves.

00:30:00.532 --> 00:30:05.303
So in the contents of the
models, the controllers are

00:30:05.303 --> 00:30:10.509
called variables. Because we
like to be using it from one

00:30:10.509 --> 00:30:16.248
table. What is very difficult to
understand for the IT hackers is

00:30:16.248 --> 00:30:21.353
that obtaining control is not
being in control. So first of

00:30:21.353 --> 00:30:23.822
all the obtained control might
not be used, and the attacker

00:30:23.822 --> 00:30:29.828
might not be able to obtain
control. And what does it mean?

00:30:32.698 --> 00:30:39.938
That we go into the control
stage of the attack. So until

00:30:39.938 --> 00:30:45.243
now the attacker was discovered
information in the process. But

00:30:45.243 --> 00:30:49.648
physical purposes who have their
dynamics change over time and if

00:30:49.648 --> 00:30:54.553
you apply to it it will change.
So the attacker need to

00:30:54.553 --> 00:30:57.155
understand how much he can
control the process. What is his

00:30:57.155 --> 00:31:03.095
-- how much he can control the
process. >> So as I mentioned

00:31:06.164 --> 00:31:11.470
together earlier, once you hook
all the stuff together into a

00:31:11.470 --> 00:31:17.375
process, related to each another
with the physics, so if we

00:31:17.375 --> 00:31:22.514
adjust a valve over here, and
what happens to everything else

00:31:22.514 --> 00:31:25.550
downstream. So adjusting the
temperature can also adjust the

00:31:25.550 --> 00:31:28.320
pressure and the flow and all
the downstream effects need to

00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:32.124
be taken into account. One of
the things we need to understand

00:31:32.124 --> 00:31:36.561
is how much of the process can
we change before all the alarms

00:31:36.561 --> 00:31:39.598
and automatic shutdowns would
kick in and start shutting down

00:31:39.598 --> 00:31:45.470
the process. >> So this is
examples. In the red you have --

00:31:45.470 --> 00:31:49.141
as you can see everything
downstream has changed and

00:31:49.141 --> 00:31:55.147
changed in different scales, the
response has different shape and

00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:06.291
what is more interesting, for
example, in one case something

00:32:06.291 --> 00:32:10.962
goes up and this goes down. The
response of the process

00:32:10.962 --> 00:32:15.700
manipulations cannot be
predicted by the attack.

00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:21.506
Attacker. And this is what he
needs to figure out. And for

00:32:21.506 --> 00:32:26.344
example as you can see, why this
different in different control

00:32:26.344 --> 00:32:30.315
loops. Not only because all the
process, because also that

00:32:30.315 --> 00:32:33.852
because there are millions of
parameters which influence the

00:32:33.852 --> 00:32:38.223
process response. So this is a
control loop which we wouldn't

00:32:38.223 --> 00:32:42.160
show before. There are many
parameters in each stage that

00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:45.897
would be influence the response
to the manipulation. And the

00:32:45.897 --> 00:32:49.734
attacker needs to take into
account all of them. What is

00:32:49.734 --> 00:32:54.573
more important, the attacker
change something, he can never

00:32:54.573 --> 00:32:59.945
understand where the response is
to the attack or if it's because

00:32:59.945 --> 00:33:06.051
of the configuration of the
process. So just to give an

00:33:06.051 --> 00:33:11.089
example, when I've been
designing, I been considered

00:33:11.089 --> 00:33:14.893
several of those parameters and
I have to really include into my

00:33:14.893 --> 00:33:22.300
explored the way how I will be
dealing with them. One of the

00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:29.007
most difficult parts of hacking
continuous process is -- most of

00:33:29.007 --> 00:33:35.714
the physical processes are
nonlinear. What does it mean? In

00:33:35.714 --> 00:33:41.553
short it means that the process
is not proportional to the input

00:33:41.553 --> 00:33:44.956
into the process. For example,
if the process is heated, how

00:33:44.956 --> 00:33:49.127
does the process behave from
being heated 140 degrees to 150

00:33:49.127 --> 00:33:54.332
degrees is completely different
when heated to 160 degrees. And

00:33:54.332 --> 00:33:58.503
even if you never model the
process you don't know how the

00:33:58.503 --> 00:34:01.539
process will behave. The
behavioral process is known to

00:34:01.539 --> 00:34:05.911
control as well to the extent of
the modeling. So the control

00:34:05.911 --> 00:34:09.214
algorithm has never been tested
and designed to deal with the

00:34:09.214 --> 00:34:14.252
process control in the trench,
it will not be able to control

00:34:14.252 --> 00:34:20.458
it. The attacker will move the
process outside of the optimal

00:34:20.458 --> 00:34:23.862
envelope. So he have to deal
with all of those strange

00:34:23.862 --> 00:34:28.833
behaviors of the processes and
it's not easy. So just to give

00:34:28.833 --> 00:34:33.805
you an example what is
nonlinearity you see a simple

00:34:33.805 --> 00:34:38.777
response the reactor and the
temperature. And all of those

00:34:38.777 --> 00:34:41.680
are extremely annoying to the
attacker because it cause

00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:47.018
alarms. Because it heats maximum
values. Another problem one of

00:34:47.018 --> 00:34:53.024
the issues which we have to deal
hacking this particular process

00:34:53.024 --> 00:34:57.095
was that this was a very badly
configured plan and all the

00:34:57.095 --> 00:35:00.832
controls were purely controlled.
So whenever we try to change

00:35:00.832 --> 00:35:06.137
something to our benefits, many
control loops had an effect. So

00:35:06.137 --> 00:35:11.376
if you will see this like look
at the circle you can see like

00:35:11.376 --> 00:35:16.047
fluctuations, like why do we
even bother. The problem is

00:35:16.047 --> 00:35:20.285
those tiny fluctuation caused
enormous impact on other control

00:35:20.285 --> 00:35:24.489
loops. So unfortunately most the
control loops were causing

00:35:24.489 --> 00:35:30.095
alarms so we could not really
stay like end of the radar

00:35:30.095 --> 00:35:37.135
because we did not want to cause
any alarms. It took us a way to

00:35:37.135 --> 00:35:42.741
figure out how to deal with
that. In general we apply two

00:35:42.741 --> 00:35:48.847
types of attacks. Step attacks
is when you bring a product to a

00:35:48.847 --> 00:35:54.419
state and leave it there. And
periodic attacks is when you

00:35:54.419 --> 00:35:57.622
attack the process, let it
recover, attack the process

00:35:57.622 --> 00:36:03.495
again, let it recover and so on.
So we have to test all of those

00:36:03.495 --> 00:36:07.932
control loops which we've been
identifying in the reactor

00:36:07.932 --> 00:36:11.970
section. We've tested them for
multiple parameters. This was

00:36:11.970 --> 00:36:15.807
other mental model of the
dynamic behavior of the process.

00:36:15.807 --> 00:36:21.813
>> I do want to know whether you
measure yourself 5 foot 3 with

00:36:25.050 --> 00:36:31.056
or without your high heels on.
>> So obviously this is our

00:36:33.591 --> 00:36:38.997
first attempt to -- you see,
this is the first public talk on

00:36:38.997 --> 00:36:41.733
the complete attack from start
to end. So obviously this was

00:36:41.733 --> 00:36:44.469
the first attempt to understand
the dynamic behavior of the

00:36:44.469 --> 00:36:48.573
process. So we were not
obviously optimal. So we now

00:36:48.573 --> 00:36:51.509
trying to find a way to optimize
it so it would fit in a small

00:36:51.509 --> 00:36:55.780
payload. So the outcome of the
attacker will need to classify

00:36:55.780 --> 00:37:01.719
the available control loops,
like how they useful for -- how

00:37:01.719 --> 00:37:07.358
well he can control them. So
basically factors, for example

00:37:07.358 --> 00:37:12.163
we use the sensitivity of the
control loops. So highly

00:37:12.163 --> 00:37:16.468
sensitive loops are not reliably
controllable so you probably

00:37:16.468 --> 00:37:21.740
don't want to use them in your
final payload. Also the

00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:26.544
propagation, you want to know
what is the marginal parameters

00:37:26.544 --> 00:37:33.718
of the attack which do not cause
-- So now we want to know what

00:37:33.718 --> 00:37:38.356
we can control to which extent
and we can actually start

00:37:38.356 --> 00:37:44.429
designing the real attacks. And
transition to the damage stage.

00:37:44.429 --> 00:37:47.832
>> In the damage stage you're
trying to figure out okay, I

00:37:47.832 --> 00:37:50.235
know all this stuff I can do
about the process, what am I

00:37:50.235 --> 00:37:52.470
actually going to do about it.
The damage stage is the least

00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:57.242
familiar stage to IT hackers. So
there's a lot of good starting

00:37:57.242 --> 00:38:03.515
points when you go and start
looking at the damage stage. So

00:38:03.515 --> 00:38:07.285
one of the good basic principles
is that things happened in the

00:38:07.285 --> 00:38:11.089
real world by accident. You can
probably make them happen by

00:38:11.089 --> 00:38:14.359
malicious intent. So you can go
to all the places where these

00:38:14.359 --> 00:38:17.195
are recorded, to government
databases, the plant's own

00:38:17.195 --> 00:38:20.865
databases, the chemical safety
board, et cetera, and read about

00:38:20.865 --> 00:38:25.904
all the things that have gone
horribly wrong. And they're out

00:38:25.904 --> 00:38:31.476
there on the Internet for you to
go and read. So the target plant

00:38:31.476 --> 00:38:38.049
may not have been designed in
the hacker friendly way. So you

00:38:38.049 --> 00:38:41.252
may really, really want to know
what this particular value is,

00:38:41.252 --> 00:38:44.856
but there may be no sensor there
or no sensor close to it. And

00:38:44.856 --> 00:38:48.193
information may be spread out
across the process. And the

00:38:48.193 --> 00:38:51.996
control rooms could be designed
to control different parameters

00:38:51.996 --> 00:38:54.899
than the ones you want to reach
in and control. I would really

00:38:54.899 --> 00:38:58.603
like to change the pressure here
but there is no pressure control

00:38:58.603 --> 00:39:04.642
loop so I won't do it. So in
this case -- >> In this case,

00:39:04.642 --> 00:39:10.648
since we want to -- measure the
impact of the attacks we need to

00:39:21.793 --> 00:39:29.467
measure how much molecules --
the concentration of chemicals

00:39:29.467 --> 00:39:35.473
is usually measured by
analyzers. There are only flow

00:39:39.310 --> 00:39:43.248
and temperature. In order to
compute the volume we need

00:39:43.248 --> 00:39:47.986
actually the concentration and
the flow. A place where we could

00:39:47.986 --> 00:39:52.624
get those numbers is in the exit
of the plant. But measured in

00:39:52.624 --> 00:39:56.995
there is too late because the
values are available in like 8

00:39:56.995 --> 00:40:03.001
hours. So you will have to text
something and wait 8 hours. It

00:40:05.536 --> 00:40:07.538
is certainly not sustainable. So
we've been actually in

00:40:07.538 --> 00:40:10.441
desperation because it seems
like how do we proceed? Because

00:40:10.441 --> 00:40:14.379
we don't have numbers, we can't
evaluate how effective our

00:40:14.379 --> 00:40:18.716
attacks could be. This is a good
point, I remember the

00:40:18.716 --> 00:40:22.287
presentation of Jason from
another convention where he had

00:40:22.287 --> 00:40:25.823
been talking about proxy
sensors. The concept behind that

00:40:25.823 --> 00:40:29.761
is -- generally there are two
answers to measure something.

00:40:29.761 --> 00:40:33.331
It's technician and engineer
answer. Technician will tell you

00:40:33.331 --> 00:40:36.734
that something is decreasing or
increasing and engineer will

00:40:36.734 --> 00:40:42.840
tell you by how much. So by
using proxy sensors you actually

00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:47.478
can obtain at least a technician
answer. And a proxy sensor

00:40:47.478 --> 00:40:50.114
something will change with
respect to another parameter

00:40:50.114 --> 00:40:56.220
which you are interested in. So
in our case a proxy sensor is a

00:40:56.220 --> 00:40:59.390
temperature reactor exit. But if
temperature is decreasing it

00:40:59.390 --> 00:41:02.293
means that less reaction is
happening in the reactor. So at

00:41:02.293 --> 00:41:08.299
least we can see if our attack
is effective or not. That is

00:41:08.299 --> 00:41:12.437
already good start. It still
doesn't allow us to compare the

00:41:12.437 --> 00:41:16.174
effectiveness between the
attacks. So we desperately

00:41:16.174 --> 00:41:21.112
needed the engineering. And this
is where we started to sink

00:41:21.112 --> 00:41:28.152
further. Process algorithms are
extremely complex. There will be

00:41:28.152 --> 00:41:34.692
lots of intermediate
computations. So we decided to

00:41:34.692 --> 00:41:42.633
give a shot like maybe there
will be some numbers computed in

00:41:42.633 --> 00:41:46.371
between which can be useful to
us. So we started looking into

00:41:46.371 --> 00:41:50.174
the code and we knew that we
need to look into place to find

00:41:50.174 --> 00:41:55.012
differential equation. And
eventually we found code which

00:41:55.012 --> 00:41:59.250
seems like they're computing
what they need. The problem was

00:41:59.250 --> 00:42:03.087
that the numbers which were --
the numbers we couldn't do

00:42:03.087 --> 00:42:09.027
really anything with them. They
didn't come up to 0 or to 1 or

00:42:09.027 --> 00:42:14.165
to hundred. They are just too
small. So we didn't know what to

00:42:14.165 --> 00:42:17.502
do with it. But still they told
it was the right number so we

00:42:17.502 --> 00:42:20.838
spent two weeks try and play
with those numbers until we

00:42:20.838 --> 00:42:25.076
actually could figure it out. We
could compute the concentration

00:42:25.076 --> 00:42:31.282
of the vinyl acetate in the
reactor exit and we could

00:42:31.282 --> 00:42:36.921
actually finally measure the
effect of our attacks. So the

00:42:36.921 --> 00:42:42.593
outcome of the damage state is
the attacks which you classify

00:42:42.593 --> 00:42:48.599
as damage potential. And then
you just apply those attacks. So

00:42:53.071 --> 00:42:55.840
you would think that this is all
and we already done because we

00:42:55.840 --> 00:43:02.480
have our attacks coded and we
can go and hack it. >> So the

00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:09.153
final stage of hacking a control
system is cleanup. So in most IT

00:43:09.153 --> 00:43:11.689
scenarios you go hack into
something, I've got the

00:43:11.689 --> 00:43:15.660
databases and all the stuff,
erase all the stuff and I was

00:43:15.660 --> 00:43:19.864
never really there. In hacking
process control systems, if you

00:43:19.864 --> 00:43:22.900
leave the big smoking plant,
someone will investigate the big

00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:25.703
smoking plant. So you have to
convince the people that are

00:43:25.703 --> 00:43:30.107
actually investigating this that
the big smoking plant was the

00:43:30.107 --> 00:43:36.781
result of operator error,
misconfigured equipment, all

00:43:36.781 --> 00:43:44.555
those types of things. So having
a human in the loop turns this

00:43:44.555 --> 00:43:48.292
from just a purely cyber system
into a sociotechnical system. So

00:43:48.292 --> 00:43:52.830
since there's real people
playing with the process and

00:43:52.830 --> 00:43:55.733
real people that are going to
analyze the process when it's

00:43:55.733 --> 00:44:03.207
all bad and gone, then we can go
and attack the system. So

00:44:03.207 --> 00:44:05.910
creating a forensics footprint.
Somebody is going to notice and

00:44:05.910 --> 00:44:11.916
say why are we not making money
and they're going to try and fix

00:44:14.118 --> 00:44:21.826
it. But you can do things like
timing the attacks when a

00:44:21.826 --> 00:44:25.863
particular employee is on shift
and after a while they say

00:44:25.863 --> 00:44:29.967
whenever Bill is on shift, then
things go horribly wrong and we

00:44:29.967 --> 00:44:34.005
don't make money so let's beat
Bill a little bit. He must be

00:44:34.005 --> 00:44:37.975
the problem. So an employee
could end up getting

00:44:37.975 --> 00:44:41.879
investigated instead of the
process. In this particular case

00:44:41.879 --> 00:44:45.950
we're going to show you one
where we picked several ways

00:44:45.950 --> 00:44:50.021
that the temperature can be
increased. So our plan is we'll

00:44:50.021 --> 00:44:52.823
wait for the next scheduled
instrument calibration, we'll

00:44:52.823 --> 00:44:57.929
perform the first tack and then
wait for the maintenance guy to

00:44:57.929 --> 00:45:00.531
be yelled at. And we'll perform
the next one and he'll go back

00:45:00.531 --> 00:45:05.036
and tune it again and we'll
perform the next one and the

00:45:05.036 --> 00:45:11.342
next one. So here we see four
different attacks on the reactor

00:45:11.342 --> 00:45:17.081
temperature. And the results and
you can see they're different.

00:45:17.081 --> 00:45:21.619
So the lines and the changes
with the recalibrations, it just

00:45:21.619 --> 00:45:28.893
looks like the guy is messing up
and not getting the calibrations

00:45:28.893 --> 00:45:34.932
right. >> So eventually they
will start thinking probably the

00:45:34.932 --> 00:45:40.071
reactor is not performing well.
It is not possible to see into

00:45:40.071 --> 00:45:44.241
the reactor. So how the forensic
guys investigate, they have the

00:45:44.241 --> 00:45:47.645
metrics to complete to
understand what is happening

00:45:47.645 --> 00:45:53.117
with the reactor. You have to
understand how they do it in

00:45:53.117 --> 00:45:59.857
order to fool them. So this is
just like some of the metrics

00:45:59.857 --> 00:46:03.828
which we've been computing and
although they look similar, they

00:46:03.828 --> 00:46:09.500
all tell completely -- So just
change the fact according to the

00:46:09.500 --> 00:46:14.672
efforts of the plant personnel
and they will keep thinking

00:46:14.672 --> 00:46:20.711
they're not doing a good job. >>
So in general, we'll go through

00:46:20.711 --> 00:46:23.748
all of the stages and we plan
all this stuff out, some of

00:46:23.748 --> 00:46:27.385
which can be totally offline and
some of it on process, we take

00:46:27.385 --> 00:46:31.022
all of this stuff and wrap it up
into the final payload and

00:46:31.022 --> 00:46:34.091
that's what we're going to stick
inside of our tack and send into

00:46:34.091 --> 00:46:39.296
the process. So if all things go
well, then our tack works and we

00:46:39.296 --> 00:46:42.366
make lots of money and everybody
is happy. Well I guess everybody

00:46:42.366 --> 00:46:49.206
on the attacker's side is happy.
>> But it's a big problem right

00:46:49.206 --> 00:46:53.244
now. So the plant really goes
through tremendous

00:46:53.244 --> 00:47:00.317
modernization. So most of this
really for now -- the plants are

00:47:00.317 --> 00:47:07.458
now connected to the Internet
and the Internet can talk to the

00:47:07.458 --> 00:47:13.431
plants. So the attackers are
already in the plants. And

00:47:13.431 --> 00:47:17.968
although like the argument like
why we cannot improve the state

00:47:17.968 --> 00:47:20.071
of the security of the
industrial control system is

00:47:20.071 --> 00:47:26.711
like well you don't see any of
those attacks. The problem, all

00:47:26.711 --> 00:47:29.180
of those accidents are not
classified information and

00:47:29.180 --> 00:47:33.384
they're not allowed to be
public. But that does not mean

00:47:33.384 --> 00:47:38.022
we have to lean on our chairs
and do nothing. It can be

00:47:38.022 --> 00:47:44.695
studied and this should do it.
So by standing what the attacker

00:47:44.695 --> 00:47:50.701
needs to do and how, we can make
exploitation harder create a

00:47:53.204 --> 00:47:59.210
solution which works. Food for
thought if you're an attacker.

00:48:04.682 --> 00:48:08.052
>> So most of the things when
you actually get into breaking a

00:48:08.052 --> 00:48:13.157
process are about cost. So one
of the reasons the cyber

00:48:13.157 --> 00:48:16.594
physical attack is because all
the other people that are

00:48:16.594 --> 00:48:18.863
probably out making money right
now are studying cyber physical

00:48:18.863 --> 00:48:26.470
attack. So for most attackers
then the cost of an attack can

00:48:26.470 --> 00:48:29.106
quickly exceed the cost of the
damage or the cost of the

00:48:29.106 --> 00:48:32.543
benefit they get there. So if
you actually make it harder and

00:48:32.543 --> 00:48:36.847
the attacker has to hack into a
large number of devices or

00:48:36.847 --> 00:48:39.483
suppress a large number of
alarms and spoof a large number

00:48:39.483 --> 00:48:42.653
of data, his costs go way up and
his testing goes way up and his

00:48:42.653 --> 00:48:46.891
chance of failure goes way up.
Each process is unique. If we

00:48:46.891 --> 00:48:53.330
look at a wide range of
scenarios, then we can start

00:48:53.330 --> 00:48:56.834
seeing all the patterns. On the
other hand, the opposite is true

00:48:56.834 --> 00:48:59.737
too. As we figure out how to
deal with all the uniquenesses

00:48:59.737 --> 00:49:03.340
and all the processes, probably
attackers are going to get

00:49:03.340 --> 00:49:05.843
better at their job too and
figure out all those that can be

00:49:05.843 --> 00:49:11.015
applied to different ways. So
SCADA payloads are probably only

00:49:11.015 --> 00:49:17.021
a matter of time. So I guess in
the end, if you want to be the

00:49:19.790 --> 00:49:23.661
evil James bond villain and make
millions of dollars, going to

00:49:23.661 --> 00:49:27.898
start building your evil lair,
hacking chemical and process

00:49:27.898 --> 00:49:31.802
control systems is probably not
a bad place to start, but it is

00:49:31.802 --> 00:49:36.907
a very complex and it's very
challenging field of hacking. So

00:49:36.907 --> 00:49:41.879
anybody that wants to come and
join us and study hacking

00:49:41.879 --> 00:49:46.083
processes and physical damage,
then they should come and do so.

00:49:46.083 --> 00:49:52.890
>> So just go and check our
stuff there and you can get

00:49:52.890 --> 00:49:58.896
there right now as well. That's
the end of our talk. (Applause.)
