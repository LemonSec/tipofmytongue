00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:06.840
Hi everyone and welcome to track
one. The 3 p.m. talk. Today we

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:11.778
have our speaker is Ammomra and
he is going to speak about how

00:00:11.778 --> 00:00:15.616
to hack your way out of home
detention. Ladies and gentlemen,

00:00:15.616 --> 00:00:21.622
AmmonRa? >> Can you guys hear
me? Okay. >> Louder. >> Can you

00:00:29.496 --> 00:00:35.602
hear me now? Cool. So you know
who we are and you know what

00:00:35.602 --> 00:00:40.107
this talk is. Standard
introduction slides. Some of you

00:00:40.107 --> 00:00:46.580
know me, some of you don't. I
work for a security consultant

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:50.083
company. I should probably go
over disclaimers but you're all

00:00:50.083 --> 00:00:56.890
big kids and what you do is your
responsibility. I'm legitimately

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:02.963
on the system and not just a
hacker. Blah, blah, blah,

00:01:02.963 --> 00:01:08.602
academic use only. Don't be
evil. On a more serious note,

00:01:08.602 --> 00:01:13.340
authorities are very upset when
people tamper with their

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.444
systems. If you do try to use
this in the wild, you might be

00:01:17.444 --> 00:01:20.480
sent to jail for it. So I
recommend only doing it in a

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:26.486
lab. -- tracking systems. People
- reasonably regulate. A couple

00:01:31.458 --> 00:01:37.764
examples of crimes that have
been -- home detention is

00:01:37.764 --> 00:01:44.638
someone last year in LA received
-- for an integration scam. More

00:01:44.638 --> 00:01:48.909
recently someone hacked
someone's email and got some

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:55.482
home detention. They tend to be
nonviolent, relatively low-risk

00:01:55.482 --> 00:01:59.052
crimes. If you're a murder you
probably won't get home

00:01:59.052 --> 00:02:04.157
detention. How do these systems
work. How do they operate? The

00:02:04.157 --> 00:02:10.163
goal is to restrict movement of
a person who is been sentenced.

00:02:14.668 --> 00:02:18.005
Instead of being sent to jail
they have given some amount of

00:02:18.005 --> 00:02:24.011
time where they're not (audio
blipped). The sort of two

00:02:34.988 --> 00:02:39.826
general categories of tracking
systems, the older generation

00:02:39.826 --> 00:02:46.800
would have a clip that could
transmit a signal to a physical,

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.436
it was in the home. It was not
movable and that would

00:02:49.436 --> 00:02:52.139
communicate to the monitoring
station over a standard

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:57.978
telephone wire. Most of these
systems are considered legacy.

00:02:57.978 --> 00:03:01.481
The new systems don't work like
this. Because they're legacy

00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:06.987
systems, they're still widely
used. All of the modern ones are

00:03:06.987 --> 00:03:10.991
phasing into new tracker
systems. That system uses GPS.

00:03:10.991 --> 00:03:18.932
So it doesn't have to be -- uses
cell networks. So it's not

00:03:18.932 --> 00:03:22.736
restricted to wire telephone
lines but it still may use a

00:03:22.736 --> 00:03:28.842
local beacon which we'll look at
later in the talk. Is this

00:03:28.842 --> 00:03:35.782
relevant? Yes. I haven't found
recent statistics but from 2012,

00:03:35.782 --> 00:03:38.185
I found statistics that there
are hundred of thousand of

00:03:38.185 --> 00:03:44.391
people at home on detention. It
costs a lot of money to put

00:03:44.391 --> 00:03:49.896
someone in prison. It's cheaper
for the government if they can

00:03:49.896 --> 00:03:55.102
monitor you within your own
home. Obviously I have a device.

00:03:55.102 --> 00:04:02.542
Now how would I get one? I guess
somewhat reasonably the people

00:04:02.542 --> 00:04:08.548
that build and operate these
systems are reluctant to release

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:18.658
any information (audio blipped).
There is a simple way to get a

00:04:18.658 --> 00:04:26.266
hold of one, can you guess? You
can commit a minor crime. I

00:04:26.266 --> 00:04:32.139
decided to go a more legitimate
route. I found a company that

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:36.243
builds these units in Taiwan, I
managed to talk them into giving

00:04:36.243 --> 00:04:39.446
me a sample unit under the
preface that I was going to

00:04:39.446 --> 00:04:44.151
evaluate it for my company. I
don't care. I paid quite a bit

00:04:44.151 --> 00:04:48.755
of money. If you have done
business in southeast Asia,

00:04:48.755 --> 00:04:53.226
there is a fine line between
cost of products and bribery,

00:04:53.226 --> 00:04:59.933
but I have the system, so that's
all I care about. Because I

00:04:59.933 --> 00:05:02.636
bought it for the manufacturer,
they're not going to tell me who

00:05:02.636 --> 00:05:07.574
the customer base is and law
enforcement is secret about it.

00:05:07.574 --> 00:05:14.881
So I don't know where it's used.
It could be here. Maybe not

00:05:14.881 --> 00:05:18.084
anywhere in the states. Someone
somewhere is using the system

00:05:18.084 --> 00:05:23.590
because there is a market for
it. I don't know who. Some of

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:29.796
the vulnerables are relevant to
this system and probably not

00:05:29.796 --> 00:05:33.667
others. Some are reasonably
general issues and probably

00:05:33.667 --> 00:05:40.907
relevant to other systems as
well. I got my hands on it. It's

00:05:40.907 --> 00:05:45.979
a sample and it didn't come with
documentation. I wasn't able to

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:49.182
operate it properly. I did a
bunch of -- and it used the same

00:05:49.182 --> 00:05:55.188
code used for tracking cars and
I have a manual for that. It's

00:05:58.925 --> 00:06:03.964
vulnerable to the same flaws.
How does this particular system

00:06:03.964 --> 00:06:09.202
operate? It uses GPS. It has a
base unit with -- low frequency

00:06:09.202 --> 00:06:15.909
or lower frequency beacon and it
has a large amount of tamper

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:19.279
detection features which we'll
look at once we open the case.

00:06:19.279 --> 00:06:26.720
Battery life is around a week.
But you can recharge it on your

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:33.126
ankle so someone doesn't have to
come and recharge the battery.

00:06:33.126 --> 00:06:37.063
It communicates in two different
modes. Both -- and G -- you can

00:06:37.063 --> 00:06:43.069
get hit with text messages or a
server on the internet. You can

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:51.778
remotely reconfigure the device.
You can see the commands change,

00:06:51.778 --> 00:06:55.181
you can for example change the
position where the person has to

00:06:55.181 --> 00:07:00.253
remain remotely. You don't have
to necessarily go and update

00:07:00.253 --> 00:07:03.823
this. Here I have the base unit.
We're going to spend a lot of

00:07:03.823 --> 00:07:07.160
time looking at this. There is
not very much in it really. It's

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:14.034
a pretty simple system, tamper
detection. If you try to open up

00:07:14.034 --> 00:07:18.038
the case it will send a message
which is mediated by the anklet

00:07:18.038 --> 00:07:24.177
to the authorities. Most of the
interesting stuff is in the

00:07:24.177 --> 00:07:30.183
anklet itself. It's not that
much of interest. The Anklet bit

00:07:32.452 --> 00:07:37.223
that goes on the leg is more
interesting. This is what it

00:07:37.223 --> 00:07:41.227
looks like if we take off the
strap. This is the inside. We

00:07:41.227 --> 00:07:47.233
have a switch, a magnet in the
strap. If you remove it, it can

00:07:49.402 --> 00:07:56.009
detect that and it sends a
tamper warning to the people

00:07:56.009 --> 00:08:00.113
monitoring it. Same with the
push pin. There is infrared LED

00:08:00.113 --> 00:08:06.119
and sensor. This is for tamper
detection. How this works is

00:08:08.655 --> 00:08:11.124
there's a piece of fiberoptic
cable that runs around the

00:08:11.124 --> 00:08:16.830
strand. If ewe take bolt cutters
and try to cut it, it will

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:23.169
disrupt the signal and the
signal will be interrupted. The

00:08:23.169 --> 00:08:26.973
battery, the SIM card and some
kind of [indiscernible]. I

00:08:26.973 --> 00:08:33.213
haven't tried reprogramming it.
We open up like the circuitry

00:08:33.213 --> 00:08:39.219
and we can see what is in it. We
have an off the shelf -- cell

00:08:43.923 --> 00:08:49.929
network nodule. We have a
standard -- image which is used

00:08:53.066 --> 00:08:59.773
to store settings and locations
when logging is turned on. There

00:08:59.773 --> 00:09:05.512
is a vibration mode. So you can
automatically trigger alerts, so

00:09:05.512 --> 00:09:07.514
if someone is not somewhere
they're supposed to be or leaves

00:09:07.514 --> 00:09:13.520
an area. You can make the anklet
vibrate. We have a micro

00:09:23.229 --> 00:09:25.432
processer. This is off the
shelf. I'm not sure if you

00:09:25.432 --> 00:09:31.438
noticed but you will see this
module on the base unit as well.

00:09:35.475 --> 00:09:39.012
There is no identifying
information on it. So I don't

00:09:39.012 --> 00:09:44.884
know if it's custom built or off
the shelf. But it's obviously

00:09:44.884 --> 00:09:50.156
used for the local low frequency
radio transmissions. I don't

00:09:50.156 --> 00:09:55.695
know any more about it than
that. We have a GPS module that

00:09:55.695 --> 00:10:02.068
is pretty standard. When the
device is operating there is a

00:10:02.068 --> 00:10:06.639
large round of settings and
stuff you can change. These are

00:10:06.639 --> 00:10:09.409
the most interesting ones but
it's not an exhaustive list. I

00:10:09.409 --> 00:10:13.480
won't go over them in detail but
you can change the user name and

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:17.717
pass ward or the coordinates
where it must remain and all

00:10:17.717 --> 00:10:24.858
other kinds of features. So
that's enough for now about the

00:10:24.858 --> 00:10:28.862
security of this system. As we
know it communicates over the

00:10:28.862 --> 00:10:32.966
cell network. In this case
[indiscernible]. Being

00:10:32.966 --> 00:10:39.839
investigated a lot by other
people in the past. It's

00:10:39.839 --> 00:10:44.878
encrypted so you can't just view
traffic sent over the air. Will

00:10:44.878 --> 00:10:50.884
is a secret key in the SIM card.
It's a well-known issue that the

00:10:53.052 --> 00:10:57.624
reverse is not true. A SIM card
for a cell phone does not

00:10:57.624 --> 00:11:01.928
usually verify the communication
with the network. That means

00:11:01.928 --> 00:11:08.968
it's possible to [indiscernible]
a cell phone network. You can --

00:11:08.968 --> 00:11:11.738
on the fly once the SIM card is
-- the SIM card does not know

00:11:11.738 --> 00:11:17.744
it's own phone number. This is
relevant to what we'll be

00:11:22.815 --> 00:11:29.322
talking about. I have a RF, this
is a -- radio. I'm not going to

00:11:29.322 --> 00:11:32.592
go into that. Suffice it to say
it allows me to receive and

00:11:32.592 --> 00:11:39.499
transmit within the cell network
frequencies. The FAVGS (ph.) is

00:11:39.499 --> 00:11:46.139
an open source -- it allows Java
script and can change how the

00:11:46.139 --> 00:11:53.313
network operates. If you -- this
is publicly available

00:11:53.313 --> 00:11:58.551
information, the country number
of the network, you can spoof

00:11:58.551 --> 00:12:02.288
that network. It's illegal to do
this but from a technical point

00:12:02.288 --> 00:12:08.294
of the view it's not hard. I
have a DIY cage here. One is

00:12:10.897 --> 00:12:16.302
that I need to block some of the
signal because my transmitter is

00:12:16.302 --> 00:12:20.306
not very powerful. If I block
some cell phone signals, the

00:12:20.306 --> 00:12:25.612
devices might switch to my fake
network. And it's illegal to

00:12:25.612 --> 00:12:31.618
transmit without a license and I
don't want to go to jail. As I

00:12:33.686 --> 00:12:35.888
said there are two different
modes that this anklet operates

00:12:35.888 --> 00:12:43.029
in. It's not encrypted so you
can interfere with this. I

00:12:43.029 --> 00:12:49.035
haven't been able to do this
because I -- GPIs on the RF but

00:12:49.035 --> 00:12:51.938
there is nothing to stop you
from doing it. If it's in

00:12:51.938 --> 00:12:58.177
[indiscernible] mode it's more
difficult but it's not

00:12:58.177 --> 00:13:02.982
impossible. So let's assume that
we have a fake network and the

00:13:02.982 --> 00:13:07.053
device is authenticated to it.
When it receives a status update

00:13:07.053 --> 00:13:11.991
about where the person is, we
can see that message. Let's look

00:13:11.991 --> 00:13:15.561
at what the content to have
status updates are. The user

00:13:15.561 --> 00:13:21.567
name. This obviously (audio
blipped) update. This is a major

00:13:30.343 --> 00:13:34.814
issue because now we can just
capture the user name and replay

00:13:34.814 --> 00:13:37.417
it. We only need to get the pin
before we have full control of

00:13:37.417 --> 00:13:43.423
the system. (audio blipped) GPS
coordinate that is quite easy.

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:51.931
The last part is the -- but it's
not a signature. So we can

00:13:51.931 --> 00:13:58.504
recalculate the -- we don't need
a key for that. The final part

00:13:58.504 --> 00:14:02.208
of the message appears to be
[indiscernible] I haven't found

00:14:02.208 --> 00:14:08.247
documentation about what it is.
I can guess some of it or derive

00:14:08.247 --> 00:14:11.851
some of it. But we don't have
to. This is a message relayed to

00:14:11.851 --> 00:14:17.523
the base station, the charging
status is here. Things it might

00:14:17.523 --> 00:14:23.529
include but I'm not sure how
much battery is left.

00:14:31.704 --> 00:14:35.141
[indiscernible] It's possible to
-- information from a text

00:14:35.141 --> 00:14:40.747
message. Everything is a single
-- I'm sure you received

00:14:40.747 --> 00:14:46.219
messages from a company name.
The senior information is just a

00:14:46.219 --> 00:14:53.359
string. It's not forced to be a
cell phone number. People have

00:14:53.359 --> 00:14:59.966
set up fake cell phone networks
without much regulation -- local

00:14:59.966 --> 00:15:04.771
cell phone and pass it to the
local carrier and it has to

00:15:04.771 --> 00:15:09.375
transmit this information. So
they can send anything they

00:15:09.375 --> 00:15:13.279
want. You can fake a single
number. They cost a small amount

00:15:13.279 --> 00:15:19.285
of money but it's easy to do. If
you want to spoof a number you

00:15:22.155 --> 00:15:25.424
have to know what number you
want to spoof. The SIM card only

00:15:25.424 --> 00:15:31.430
has a unique identifier, not the
cell phone number. It's possible

00:15:33.666 --> 00:15:37.670
to get the cell phone number.
You can pull out the SIM card

00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:41.340
and place it in our control and
send ourselves a text message.

00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:47.914
If we open it, it's going to
send a warning, right, so we

00:15:47.914 --> 00:15:53.920
can't do that. A naÔve solution
is to wrap it in aluminum foil

00:15:56.289 --> 00:15:59.325
and block out the signal so it
can't see the tamper detection.

00:16:01.994 --> 00:16:05.464
The designers thought of this
and if it can't see the signal

00:16:05.464 --> 00:16:10.603
it writes it to memory and sends
the message as soon as it can.

00:16:10.603 --> 00:16:16.843
The trouble is it --
[indiscernible] the network,

00:16:16.843 --> 00:16:23.883
message delivered. It doesn't do
an end-to-end trip. If you have

00:16:23.883 --> 00:16:29.889
a fake network, it can say the
message is delivered fine (audio

00:16:35.161 --> 00:16:42.702
blipped) (lost audio
connection). -- take control of

00:16:42.702 --> 00:16:46.405
the device. Is it possible, so
the pin must be four characters.

00:16:46.405 --> 00:16:48.407
It cannot be longer or shorter.
It's only letters and numbers.

00:16:48.407 --> 00:16:50.409
No special characters. We have a
bit over a million and a half

00:16:50.409 --> 00:16:52.411
possible pins. I haven't been
able to get these - but you can

00:16:52.411 --> 00:16:54.413
get 30 messages a minute. That's
just about 40 days. So that's a

00:16:54.413 --> 00:16:56.415
really long time. But you're
sitting at home on home

00:16:56.415 --> 00:16:58.417
detention, so what else are you
going to do? Option No. 3. A

00:16:58.417 --> 00:17:00.353
tool for tracking --
communication. A guy much

00:17:00.353 --> 00:17:02.355
smarter than me has done
research in this and he released

00:17:02.355 --> 00:17:04.357
this tool. Basically it allows
you to capture -- off the ear

00:17:04.357 --> 00:17:06.359
and in certain circumstances
decrypt that. You can --

00:17:06.359 --> 00:17:08.361
messages and the cell network
will believe it came from the

00:17:08.361 --> 00:17:10.363
device because it has the same
key. You can fool it -- control

00:17:10.363 --> 00:17:12.365
and it will appear to come from
that SIM so you can get the

00:17:12.365 --> 00:17:14.367
number that way. The downside to
this is you can want intersect a

00:17:14.367 --> 00:17:16.369
block, when there are status
updates, because it's not on

00:17:16.369 --> 00:17:18.371
your network. I haven't done
this because I have one SDR but

00:17:18.371 --> 00:17:20.373
I think it's possible to place
the device with one SDR in a

00:17:20.373 --> 00:17:22.375
cage and have another SDR
outside the cage. And decrypt

00:17:22.375 --> 00:17:24.377
the traffic on the fly as it
flows through and filter out

00:17:24.377 --> 00:17:26.379
messages that you want to block.
The key to use -- quite often,

00:17:26.379 --> 00:17:28.381
every 15 minutes. If you can
swoop an incoming message, then

00:17:28.381 --> 00:17:30.383
you can get the pin number and
have control of the device. You

00:17:30.383 --> 00:17:32.385
will probably have to wait a
long time because it won't be

00:17:32.385 --> 00:17:34.387
updated frequently. So you and
the judge may have different

00:17:34.387 --> 00:17:36.389
definitions of alcoholics
anonymous. What we're going to

00:17:36.389 --> 00:17:38.391
be doing is, you have the
number. You have a -- cage and

00:17:38.391 --> 00:17:40.393
we're going to Spiff (ph.). We
get the status messages that the

00:17:40.393 --> 00:17:42.395
device is sending. Replace the
location information. Reencode

00:17:42.395 --> 00:17:44.397
the message. Send it to a
spoofing service and you see

00:17:44.397 --> 00:17:46.399
that the message has been
changed. Because it's encoded

00:17:46.399 --> 00:17:48.401
it's difficult to see that it's
changed. So I put together a

00:17:48.401 --> 00:17:52.538
Google map that will show us
which points were received by my

00:17:52.538 --> 00:17:56.309
cell phone. In this case it's
pretending to be the monitored

00:17:56.309 --> 00:18:00.046
section by the authorities and
which sections are caught on the

00:18:00.046 --> 00:18:05.217
spoof network. Here is the map.
So if we look at, I have a phone

00:18:05.217 --> 00:18:09.322
here, here is the message, it
has three messages that I sent

00:18:09.322 --> 00:18:13.459
earlier today. I have a script
which will kick the messages on

00:18:13.459 --> 00:18:17.596
the phone (keep) and just lay
them on a map. These green

00:18:17.596 --> 00:18:20.700
points are messages that were
delivered to the monitoring

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:24.503
station in this case. We're
going to start running -- this

00:18:24.503 --> 00:18:27.940
is the telephone network
basically. And we have a script

00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:31.711
which will search through all
the messages that it sees and

00:18:31.711 --> 00:18:35.848
then also describe them on the
map. They will be described in

00:18:35.848 --> 00:18:39.986
red. Because I have this case
open, it's going to beep because

00:18:39.986 --> 00:18:44.123
it thinks I'm tampering with it.
Now we're going to place this

00:18:44.123 --> 00:18:47.560
inside the cage with the
transmitter. And -- this might

00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:51.697
take a minute or so to start.
But we should start seeing

00:18:51.697 --> 00:18:55.134
network information. So that's
bringing up the radio, wants us

00:18:55.134 --> 00:18:59.271
to wait for the device to
authenticate to it. So it can

00:18:59.271 --> 00:19:03.342
take a few minutes. Not a few
minutes but it's configured to

00:19:03.342 --> 00:19:05.344
receive a status update around 3
times a minute. So we don't have

00:19:05.344 --> 00:19:10.216
to wait too long. As you can see
it's information about the low

00:19:10.216 --> 00:19:14.887
level network events. We should
see here soon the caution of one

00:19:14.887 --> 00:19:20.359
of the status updates. Yep. So
-- well, let me see if we can

00:19:20.359 --> 00:19:26.365
scroll up. Just here. This is
the content of one of the

00:19:30.469 --> 00:19:36.475
messages that it's seeing. Let's
look at the map. So as you can

00:21:59.285 --> 00:22:03.455
see we have some red points. The
green points are what's showing

00:22:03.455 --> 00:22:09.461
up on the phone. The red points
are faked. We should see all of

00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:18.837
these. Let's see ... We're going
to have a point there. Let's

00:22:18.837 --> 00:22:25.911
just kill the screen. Thanks. As
you can see ... Basically we're

00:22:25.911 --> 00:22:33.018
faking points. Normally what you
want to do is fake points that

00:22:33.018 --> 00:22:40.125
show you being at home when
really you're at the pub or

00:22:40.125 --> 00:22:47.233
somewhere. But in this case we
are not doing that. We're just

00:22:47.233 --> 00:22:53.839
going to fake that we are next
door. Because I can't leave and

00:22:53.839 --> 00:22:55.841
fake me being here. Okay. No
thank you. Sorry. Sorry. I'd

00:22:55.841 --> 00:22:57.843
rather not drink. So the base
unit. >> You don't get out of

00:22:57.843 --> 00:22:59.845
this. >> Yes, I do. >> You're
going to force me to drink? >>

00:22:59.845 --> 00:23:01.780
It's water. >> Welcome to
DEFCON. >> Thank you. Okay. So

00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:03.782
the base unit. Why would it have
this unit? It has GPS locator.

00:23:03.782 --> 00:23:05.784
The reason is that GPS is quite
expensive in terms of battery

00:23:05.784 --> 00:23:07.786
power and it's not particularly
accurate indoors. Most of the

00:23:07.786 --> 00:23:09.788
time you're going to be at home
near a base unit. So it can save

00:23:09.788 --> 00:23:11.790
a lot of power by transmitting a
local signal. When it takes that

00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:13.792
signal, it doesn't need a GPS
fix. This transmits around 344

00:23:13.792 --> 00:23:15.794
megahertz. You can see on the
right-hand side side of the

00:23:15.794 --> 00:23:17.796
screen that, it's an actual
sample I captured from this

00:23:17.796 --> 00:23:19.798
device. It transmits every 10
seconds. This is interesting. It

00:23:19.798 --> 00:23:21.800
transmits a static message. It
doesn't change, well it does

00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:23.802
change if you power on or off
the device. It doesn't change

00:23:23.802 --> 00:23:25.804
during the operate. So you can
just retransmit it. I don't know

00:23:25.804 --> 00:23:31.810
if it's unique to the device.
Record it. Retransmit it. So

00:23:47.493 --> 00:23:53.499
this has been kind of cool from
an academic point of view, but,

00:24:01.774 --> 00:24:07.780
let's look at how we can
actually use this in the real

00:24:38.344 --> 00:24:44.350
world. I mentioned earlier, if
you tamper with a system and are

00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:20.886
caught by the police, they will
be very upset and you can be

00:25:54.520 --> 00:26:00.459
sent to jail. If you tamper with
the system that is not yours,

00:26:24.783 --> 00:26:29.822
someone else may go to you and
they might come and get you in

00:26:29.822 --> 00:26:34.726
retaliation. So don't use it. So
what you can do is -- transmits

00:26:34.726 --> 00:26:40.732
a signal. We can look for that.
But it's obviously not a --

00:26:45.938 --> 00:26:52.010
[indiscernible] in the range of
someone's house. So you need

00:26:52.010 --> 00:26:58.016
special equipment to find it. It
might be easier to find where

00:27:00.085 --> 00:27:06.091
someone lives. If you find them
you can easily jam all of the

00:27:08.861 --> 00:27:16.335
signals from this device. It's
cheap to buy this equipment from

00:27:16.335 --> 00:27:22.341
China. You could maybe -- this
is very maybe, I think it would

00:27:25.110 --> 00:27:31.216
be hard but not necessarily
impossible to perform the

00:27:31.216 --> 00:27:37.222
attacks remotely. If you sat
outside the house in a van you

00:27:39.324 --> 00:27:45.330
might be able to do it. Can you
make money from the system?

00:27:47.399 --> 00:27:53.405
That's the obvious question. To
our advantage if someone tampers

00:28:55.033 --> 00:28:58.036
with the system or breaks the
terms of the home condition,

00:28:58.036 --> 00:29:02.574
they are usually set to jail.
The sentence is usually an

00:29:02.574 --> 00:29:06.144
alternative to a short time in
jail. Could we blackmail them

00:29:06.144 --> 00:29:10.882
and make it look like they're
tampering with their system and

00:29:10.882 --> 00:29:16.655
get them sent to jail? Maybe but
I think it would be difficult. A

00:29:16.655 --> 00:29:20.859
viable option would be to build
a device or service that can -

00:29:20.859 --> 00:29:23.829
alongside the tracker and
performs these attacks

00:29:23.829 --> 00:29:29.334
automatically once they leave
their home. That is feasible. I

00:29:29.334 --> 00:29:31.336
haven't done this obviously
because that would be

00:29:31.336 --> 00:29:37.342
[indiscernible]. The final
option is maybe you would be

00:29:37.342 --> 00:29:41.680
able to find someone who hates
the person on home retention and

00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:44.816
get them to give you money to
tamper the system and get that

00:29:44.816 --> 00:29:52.658
person sent to jail. So finally,
there are issues with these

00:29:52.658 --> 00:29:55.160
systems. We like to think
they're secure because they're

00:29:55.160 --> 00:30:00.365
part of the justice system but
they're not perfect by a long

00:30:00.365 --> 00:30:05.137
shot. Some of the things that I
found with this system can be

00:30:05.137 --> 00:30:07.506
easily fixed. There is no reason
not to fix these issues.

00:30:07.506 --> 00:30:13.512
Authenticate the, like, tracker
and the monitoring station. Not

00:30:17.015 --> 00:30:21.219
just one way. Encryption. People
rely on encryption but it's been

00:30:21.219 --> 00:30:26.858
well phone for a long time it's
not safe. So people shouldn't

00:30:26.858 --> 00:30:30.962
rely on that. They shouldn't
retransmit the user names. Those

00:30:30.962 --> 00:30:38.470
are easily fixed. No excuse for
that. Some of this stuff is very

00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:42.207
hard if not impossible to fix
with this design. Jamming of the

00:30:42.207 --> 00:30:46.311
system and finding out where the
users are. It's impossible to

00:30:46.311 --> 00:30:52.317
fix them. [indiscernible]. Yes.
Given how poor the system is, it

00:30:56.355 --> 00:31:04.296
might be possible to --
[indiscernible] packets. I don't

00:31:04.296 --> 00:31:08.967
know, I haven't tried that but
it would be cool to look at. The

00:31:08.967 --> 00:31:15.741
flash memory is a standard chip.
You can dump the code from that.

00:31:15.741 --> 00:31:18.977
You can potentially reverse
engineer it and look for bugs or

00:31:18.977 --> 00:31:24.049
vectors in the system. It would
be difficult to write any

00:31:24.049 --> 00:31:29.187
simulator that you put in the
phone that would pretend to be

00:31:29.187 --> 00:31:36.261
the input. You can spiff the GPS
location and it would think it's

00:31:36.261 --> 00:31:40.365
in a different location. Someone
is talking about that now in

00:31:40.365 --> 00:31:42.367
another room. There is a better
talk happening, why are you

00:31:42.367 --> 00:31:48.373
here? Questions? I don't know
how much time we have. Do you

00:31:54.513 --> 00:32:00.452
have any questions? Yes? So this
particular unit or home

00:32:06.892 --> 00:32:12.597
detention systems in general? It
was just a thing where I said I

00:32:12.597 --> 00:32:15.467
wonder how secure the systems
are and I thought that would be

00:32:15.467 --> 00:32:21.473
a cool project so I bought one.
Anything else? I spent a

00:32:25.076 --> 00:32:31.082
thousand dollars on hardware.
Yes? I don't know for sure. When

00:32:39.291 --> 00:32:45.897
I was researching manufacturers
I found a half dozen each with a

00:32:45.897 --> 00:32:50.669
few different models of tracker.
So I estimate on the order of a

00:32:50.669 --> 00:32:58.243
dozen. But I don't think it's
that many. Anybody else? Yes?

00:32:58.243 --> 00:33:04.182
Like I said people are cage y
about the information on these

00:33:09.888 --> 00:33:15.961
systems. They won't tell me who
the customers are or which

00:33:15.961 --> 00:33:21.967
system they use. So I can't find
out where things are used. So

00:33:41.019 --> 00:33:43.855
the question is, if we can
replay -- from the base station,

00:33:43.855 --> 00:33:45.857
why don't we do that? It's
easier than trying to attack the

00:33:45.857 --> 00:33:47.859
cell network communications. The
reason it's only sometimes it's

00:33:47.859 --> 00:33:53.865
useful. So the device can be
configured to always check the

00:33:59.304 --> 00:34:04.009
GPS location or configured to
only check when it's not in the

00:34:04.009 --> 00:34:08.647
home and you don't really know
without testing it whether it's

00:34:08.647 --> 00:34:14.653
in one of those two modes. If it
is, this is easier but you don't

00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:27.866
know that. Anybody else? You're
asking is anyone interested in

00:34:37.876 --> 00:34:43.882
building better systems? No.
None of the manufacturers or

00:34:46.017 --> 00:34:50.221
anyone have talked to me about
it. I don't really care, that's

00:34:50.221 --> 00:34:56.227
their problem. Yes? The IR
detention device? Sorry? So it's

00:35:06.571 --> 00:35:14.145
just an LED as far as I know and
it transmits a signal of some

00:35:14.145 --> 00:35:21.152
kind. Originally a detector fed
through a fiberoptic through the

00:35:21.152 --> 00:35:26.992
band. If you cut that, the light
is disrupted and it won't reach

00:35:26.992 --> 00:35:31.963
the receiver so it will receive
an alert. That is how tamper

00:35:31.963 --> 00:35:37.969
detection works. Possibly. With
my skill level, I could. But

00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:47.645
there are people who are tamper
with -- cables so I think that

00:36:11.636 --> 00:36:17.642
is plausible. Is that everybody?
Yes, I did read about that. I

00:36:25.717 --> 00:36:29.688
know for G Ss used in a number
of countries. This is not one of

00:36:29.688 --> 00:36:33.692
their devices but I wanted to
try to get the device but I

00:36:33.692 --> 00:36:39.697
couldn't get them to give me
one. Is that everybody? Cool.

00:36:42.333 --> 00:36:46.371
Well, thanks for coming.
...(applause)...
