00:00:00.767 --> 00:00:06.773
Everybody count off. Good,
thanks. If there's an empty seat

00:00:14.748 --> 00:00:20.754
next to you, raise your hand. It
looks pretty full. Anyone know

00:00:22.956 --> 00:00:29.429
if this place has a fire code or
not? Don't start fires. If you

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:35.435
start a fire, you have to share.
People who have their hands up,

00:00:40.641 --> 00:00:46.647
have a seat next to them so the
smart money goes that way. The

00:00:54.621 --> 00:01:00.561
smart money is not in Vegas. All
right. Hi there. I'm Bruce

00:01:21.148 --> 00:01:27.154
Schneier. Are there any
questions? It's good. That was

00:01:33.627 --> 00:01:37.864
the easiest talk I ever did. If
there are any questions, I'm

00:01:37.864 --> 00:01:44.738
happy to take them. There are
actually mics here. There's one

00:01:44.738 --> 00:01:47.808
there, there's one I can't see
behind the camera guy there. >>

00:01:47.808 --> 00:01:53.246
Do they work, though? >> Yes,
they work. That one works. >>

00:01:53.246 --> 00:01:59.419
Thanks for coming out again. The
question is, it's an old

00:01:59.419 --> 00:02:03.690
question and I'm wondering if
maybe you have any new insight

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:09.329
into answer on this. With
cryptography becoming more in

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:12.899
the collective consciousness,
especially with people who are

00:02:12.899 --> 00:02:18.472
less technically savvy, there
has been an argument for a long

00:02:18.472 --> 00:02:24.478
time trying to explain to people
that encryption is not security.

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.917
It's very common for people to
say we'll just encrypt the shit

00:02:30.917 --> 00:02:35.222
and we're secure which obviously
is total bullshit. Do you have

00:02:35.222 --> 00:02:38.992
any insight on how to better
explain to those people why

00:02:38.992 --> 00:02:42.763
that's fundamentally flawed? >>
I think you're right. A lot of

00:02:42.763 --> 00:02:46.600
people think of crypto as a
panacea where in fact it is just

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.871
a tool. And a very powerful
tool, actually it's for a bunch

00:02:50.871 --> 00:02:55.442
of reasons, but it doesn't
automatically make security on

00:02:55.442 --> 00:02:58.178
any data that has to be used.
One of the things that the

00:02:58.178 --> 00:03:02.282
Snowden documents has brought
forward is metadata. So this

00:03:02.282 --> 00:03:07.521
cell phone is a great
surveillance device because the

00:03:07.521 --> 00:03:13.527
metadata where this phone is has
to be in the clear. Otherwise it

00:03:18.031 --> 00:03:23.236
can't ring. Thinking about that
I should turn the ringer off. So

00:03:23.236 --> 00:03:27.774
there's a lot of things
encryption can't do. Encryption

00:03:27.774 --> 00:03:31.278
can protect data at rest, but if
you aren't going to make a

00:03:31.278 --> 00:03:34.581
target corporation, you have a
database of numbers that you're

00:03:34.581 --> 00:03:40.587
using, if it's encrypted the key
has to be there. I talk about

00:03:43.723 --> 00:03:48.395
encryption as a tool, not as
security, just like your door

00:03:48.395 --> 00:03:51.364
lock is a really important tool
but doesn't magically make your

00:03:51.364 --> 00:03:54.801
house secure. What encryption
does, I think this is real

00:03:54.801 --> 00:04:00.841
important, is it NSA
surveillance, it forces the

00:04:00.841 --> 00:04:08.148
listeners to target -- what we
know about the NSA is that they

00:04:08.148 --> 00:04:11.017
might have a bigger budget than
anyone else on the planet, but

00:04:11.017 --> 00:04:16.056
they're not made of magic. They
are limited by the same laws of

00:04:16.056 --> 00:04:19.926
physics and math and economics
as everybody else. And if data

00:04:19.926 --> 00:04:23.497
is unencrypted, if they can tap
a translated Internet cable,

00:04:23.497 --> 00:04:28.802
they can get everything. But if
stuff is encrypted, they have to

00:04:28.802 --> 00:04:32.339
target who they're listening to.
If the NSA wants into your

00:04:32.339 --> 00:04:34.608
computer, they are in. If
they're not, one it's illegal

00:04:34.608 --> 00:04:36.610
and they're following the law
and two you're not eye enough on

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.479
the priorities list. So what
encryption does is it forces

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:42.082
them to go through their
priorities list. They can hack

00:04:42.082 --> 00:04:44.651
into your computer, that's no
problem. They can't hack into

00:04:44.651 --> 00:04:47.854
everybody's computer. So
encryption is just a tool, but

00:04:47.854 --> 00:04:53.860
it's actually a really powerful
tool, because it denies a lot of

00:05:02.369 --> 00:05:08.341
the bulk access and forces the
listeners to do targeted access.

00:05:08.341 --> 00:05:14.347
And there's a lot of security
benefit in that. >> I wanted to

00:05:17.684 --> 00:05:22.022
see your opinion on the back
door that Obama wants.

00:05:22.022 --> 00:05:28.028
(Laughter.) I'm not sure Obama
personally has an opinion here.

00:05:37.671 --> 00:05:43.543
It's interesting. This is --
this is the same back door that

00:05:43.543 --> 00:05:47.447
the FBI has been wanting since
the mid '90s. We called it the

00:05:47.447 --> 00:05:53.186
crypto war and now we call it
the first crypto war. So number

00:05:53.186 --> 00:05:58.091
three, I'm done. It is you guys.
I only do two crypto wars per

00:05:58.091 --> 00:06:02.762
lifetime. (Laughter.) It's
interesting. >> You're referring

00:06:02.762 --> 00:06:09.636
to PTP? >> In general. The FBI
director gave an interesting

00:06:09.636 --> 00:06:16.209
talk at the Aspen security
forum. I recommend listening to

00:06:16.209 --> 00:06:20.714
these talks. This is a very high
level, mostly government

00:06:20.714 --> 00:06:23.250
discussions about security,
cyber security, national

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:26.753
security, really interesting
stuff. He was interviewed by I

00:06:26.753 --> 00:06:32.692
think Wolf Blitzer who actually
asked a great question. Why

00:06:35.428 --> 00:06:40.100
don't you like the term lone
wolf terrorist. That was kind of

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:44.704
funny. He was talking about the
going dark problem and the need

00:06:44.704 --> 00:06:48.008
for back doors and this is the
scenario he is worried about.

00:06:48.008 --> 00:06:53.313
And he's very explicit. It is an
ISIS scenario. ISIS is a new

00:06:53.313 --> 00:06:58.518
kind of adversary in the
government's eyes, because of

00:06:58.518 --> 00:07:02.922
the way it uses social media.
Unlike al Qaeda, ISIS does it

00:07:02.922 --> 00:07:08.928
with Twitter. And this freaks
the government out. So the

00:07:14.467 --> 00:07:17.904
story, and they square up and
down this -- swear up and down

00:07:17.904 --> 00:07:21.274
this happens, ISIS is really
good at social media at Twitter

00:07:21.274 --> 00:07:26.079
and YouTube and various other
websites, they get people to

00:07:26.079 --> 00:07:31.284
talk to them who are in the
U.S., like you guys, except you

00:07:31.284 --> 00:07:35.255
know, a little less socially
adept and maybe kind of a little

00:07:35.255 --> 00:07:39.592
crazier. But they find these
marginal people and they talk to

00:07:39.592 --> 00:07:45.498
them and the FBI can monitor
this and go FBI, rah rah. They

00:07:45.498 --> 00:07:52.439
say go use this secure app and
this radicalized American does,

00:07:52.439 --> 00:07:57.544
they talk more securely and the
FBI can't listen. And then you

00:07:57.544 --> 00:08:03.483
know, dot dot dot explosion. So
this is the scenario that the

00:08:05.585 --> 00:08:10.090
FBI is worried about. Very
explicitly. And they've used the

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:13.960
story again and again. And they
say this is real, this is

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:19.032
happening. Now -- >> It's not
going to work, though. >> It's

00:08:19.032 --> 00:08:25.605
sort of interesting. If this is
true -- let's take it as it is

00:08:25.605 --> 00:08:31.211
true. Another phrase they use,
they talk about the time between

00:08:31.211 --> 00:08:36.182
flash to bang. Flash is when
they find the guy, bang is when

00:08:36.182 --> 00:08:40.420
the explosion happens. And that
time is decreasing. So the FBI

00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:46.126
has to be able to monitor. So
they are pissed off that things

00:08:46.126 --> 00:08:51.398
like I-message and other apps
cannot be monitored, even if

00:08:51.398 --> 00:08:53.867
they get a warrant. And this
really bugs them. I have a

00:08:53.867 --> 00:08:58.104
warrant, damn it. Can can't I
listen? I can get the metadata,

00:08:58.104 --> 00:09:03.610
why can't I listen? So if you
think about that as a scenario,

00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:09.282
that it's true, it is not a
scenario that any kind of

00:09:09.282 --> 00:09:15.588
mandatory back door solves.
Because the problem isn't that

00:09:15.588 --> 00:09:20.193
the main security apps are
encrypted. The problem is there

00:09:20.193 --> 00:09:25.598
exists one security app that is
encrypted. Because the ISIS

00:09:25.598 --> 00:09:30.737
handler can say go download
signal, go download this random

00:09:30.737 --> 00:09:36.743
fire encryption app I just
uploaded ten minutes ago. So the

00:09:40.046 --> 00:09:44.751
problem is not what he thinks it
is. The problem is general

00:09:44.751 --> 00:09:49.189
purpose computers. The problem
is an international market in

00:09:49.189 --> 00:09:55.261
software. So I think the back
door is a really bad idea for a

00:09:55.261 --> 00:09:57.430
whole bunch of reasons. I've
written papers about this. But

00:09:57.430 --> 00:10:01.067
what I've come to realize in the
past few weeks is it's not going

00:10:01.067 --> 00:10:06.573
to solve the problem the FBI
claims it has and I think we

00:10:06.573 --> 00:10:09.542
need to start talking about
that. Because otherwise we're

00:10:09.542 --> 00:10:15.548
going to get some really bad
policy. (Applause.) >> Good

00:10:20.186 --> 00:10:24.557
morning. So this will probably
go less in the direction of for

00:10:24.557 --> 00:10:28.294
instance crypto. My question is
somewhat twofold but I'm going

00:10:28.294 --> 00:10:31.931
to focus more on the first one.
>> Do one at a time. >> In the

00:10:31.931 --> 00:10:36.136
course of day-to-day
interactions, both with security

00:10:36.136 --> 00:10:40.440
people and with less
security-minded folks, I've come

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:43.109
to the conclusion that
operational security is very

00:10:43.109 --> 00:10:47.947
difficult to instill. From your
experience, is there an easier

00:10:47.947 --> 00:10:51.818
approach to getting the
understanding through? >> I

00:10:51.818 --> 00:10:58.157
think ops sec is pretty much
impossible. If the director of

00:10:58.157 --> 00:11:04.097
the CIA can't get it right,
we're all done. We see that in

00:11:09.369 --> 00:11:14.274
the hackers that hack Sony. We
see people screwing it up again

00:11:14.274 --> 00:11:19.145
and again. I'm not sure there is
a solution. Because good op sec

00:11:19.145 --> 00:11:21.447
is really and truly annoying. It
means not using e-mail for

00:11:21.447 --> 00:11:23.449
certain things. I've come to the
belief that we're not going to

00:11:23.449 --> 00:11:26.819
be able to train people in good
op sec. That the best security

00:11:26.819 --> 00:11:32.825
is going to be pretty good
security that's ubiquitous. And

00:11:48.374 --> 00:11:51.878
we saw this in some more of the
Snowden documents. How many

00:11:51.878 --> 00:11:56.950
people read the recent article
that came out of Germany. Okay

00:11:56.950 --> 00:12:03.056
article, really great document
on how it works, the NSA

00:12:03.056 --> 00:12:05.058
flexible database for monitoring
the Internet. You can read their

00:12:05.058 --> 00:12:08.261
documents and they talk about
how they can find people using

00:12:08.261 --> 00:12:15.935
encryption and roll up the
networks. They can't read the

00:12:15.935 --> 00:12:23.610
traffic, but they know who is
talking to who. Metadata,

00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:28.348
encryption doesn't solve
everything. And I'm reading

00:12:28.348 --> 00:12:32.552
this, and it's clear you can do
this with PGP as well. You want

00:12:32.552 --> 00:12:37.056
to find out who's using
encryption, it's easy if you

00:12:37.056 --> 00:12:41.327
monitor enough of the Internet.
And what that tells me is that

00:12:41.327 --> 00:12:45.732
someone would be better off not
using the great encryption

00:12:45.732 --> 00:12:49.335
program they wrote or the really
powerful one they just

00:12:49.335 --> 00:12:54.307
downloaded, but the average one
that everyone else is using.

00:12:54.307 --> 00:12:59.178
That you actually are better off
using an iPhone with i message,

00:12:59.178 --> 00:13:04.617
even though I'm pretty sure the
FBI can get at it individually.

00:13:04.617 --> 00:13:08.888
But you can hide using it
because we're all using it. You

00:13:08.888 --> 00:13:14.894
don't stand out. So I think
there is a lot of power in that.

00:13:17.163 --> 00:13:20.133
You had a second part. Make it
quick. >> You answered it. It

00:13:20.133 --> 00:13:23.636
was for propers making the use
of op sec less obvious. >> Make

00:13:23.636 --> 00:13:28.441
it invisible. Think of SSL, good
security works if people don't

00:13:28.441 --> 00:13:35.748
even know it's there. Encryption
from the handset to the base

00:13:35.748 --> 00:13:38.251
station, it would be great if it
was better but it's working

00:13:38.251 --> 00:13:44.324
because nobody knows it's there.
>> So in thinking maybe not as

00:13:44.324 --> 00:13:48.294
thoroughly or deeply as I should
about like cyber terrorist

00:13:48.294 --> 00:13:52.932
threats and bad actors that want
to do corporations or

00:13:52.932 --> 00:13:56.769
infrastructure harm, these sorts
of things, or just the public,

00:13:56.769 --> 00:14:00.373
right, it seems like all the
ingredients are there for people

00:14:00.373 --> 00:14:04.577
to do really bad things and
there are a lot of holes and

00:14:04.577 --> 00:14:08.181
security flaws. What keeps there
from being enough motivated bad

00:14:08.181 --> 00:14:12.118
actors and people -- what keeps
them at bay? >> I think

00:14:12.118 --> 00:14:16.656
fundamentally people are good.
Right? Society works because

00:14:16.656 --> 00:14:21.127
most of us are honest. You kind
of look at me funny, but none of

00:14:21.127 --> 00:14:24.430
you have jumped up and attacked
the person sitting next to you.

00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:28.401
(Laughter.) You laugh, but if
this was a room of chimpanzees

00:14:28.401 --> 00:14:36.275
that would have happened. A room
full of a lot of strangers

00:14:36.275 --> 00:14:42.248
sitting quietly listening to me.
This sounds weird but I think a

00:14:42.248 --> 00:14:48.087
lot of what keeps the really bad
things from happening is most

00:14:48.087 --> 00:14:51.724
people don't want to do really
bad things. If that wasn't true,

00:14:51.724 --> 00:14:55.695
society wouldn't work. So I
think you're right, that all the

00:14:55.695 --> 00:14:58.898
pieces, a lot of the pieces are
there. There is a couple of

00:14:58.898 --> 00:15:04.237
things. Terrorism is harder than
you think. Yes, technically it

00:15:04.237 --> 00:15:09.809
can be easy, but the whole
operation is actually harder.

00:15:09.809 --> 00:15:13.946
Which is why you don't see a lot
of terrorist attacks. What you

00:15:13.946 --> 00:15:18.050
do see these lone wolfs that
wake up one morning say I'm

00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:22.121
going to do something bad,
there's no conspiracy to detect,

00:15:22.121 --> 00:15:24.690
there are no mistakes you can
make over the course of the

00:15:24.690 --> 00:15:31.063
planet that flash-to-bang time
is so short. So I really do

00:15:31.063 --> 00:15:34.634
think that's why. Something
interesting I would mention as

00:15:34.634 --> 00:15:39.038
long as we're on this topic,
that a new tactic we're seeing

00:15:39.038 --> 00:15:45.044
more of, the notion of
institutional boxing. You can go

00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:52.118
into a company, take all of
their stuff and publish it. It's

00:15:52.118 --> 00:15:56.055
freaking people out. This
happened to Sony, the hacking

00:15:56.055 --> 00:15:59.592
team. The guy who did that is in
this room, thank you very much.

00:15:59.592 --> 00:16:05.531
(Applause.) It's what might have
happened to Ashley Madison,

00:16:10.636 --> 00:16:14.907
which is a little more awkward
for some people. (Laughter.) And

00:16:14.907 --> 00:16:19.445
if you remember a few years ago
it was HB Gary federal. An I

00:16:19.445 --> 00:16:24.483
think this is a really
interesting tactic because it

00:16:24.483 --> 00:16:29.288
empowers individuals against
very powerful organizations. And

00:16:29.288 --> 00:16:35.528
it is the first, I think the
first real counterargument I've

00:16:35.528 --> 00:16:43.135
heard to the increasing practice
of hiring a sociopathic CEO. If

00:16:43.135 --> 00:16:48.241
you are worried about everything
your CEO says becoming public in

00:16:48.241 --> 00:16:53.279
three to five years, you might
not want to hire a jerk. But I

00:16:53.279 --> 00:16:57.016
expect to see more of this.
People are noticing that

00:16:57.016 --> 00:17:01.053
wikileaks is publishing Saudi
diplomatic cables. Someone

00:17:01.053 --> 00:17:09.028
hacked in and is dumping all
this stuff. So that's an

00:17:09.028 --> 00:17:15.001
interesting example of a new bad
thing that's being enabled by

00:17:15.001 --> 00:17:19.138
technology that's happening more
and more of. But in general, I

00:17:19.138 --> 00:17:24.076
do worry about the bad things
happening, but I think it's less

00:17:24.076 --> 00:17:26.979
common than we think, because
most people don't do them. It's

00:17:26.979 --> 00:17:30.816
the systemic stuff that bothers
me. The Internet of things,

00:17:30.816 --> 00:17:35.421
being able to hack cars and
planes and heart monitors and

00:17:35.421 --> 00:17:39.992
other stuff. And the
interconnection of those. I

00:17:39.992 --> 00:17:46.132
think we're going to see more
unanticipated vulnerabilities.

00:17:46.132 --> 00:17:49.669
Because remember complexity is
the worst enemy of security. It

00:17:49.669 --> 00:17:55.508
is nonlinear, tightly coupled
complexity and that's really

00:17:55.508 --> 00:18:01.447
what the net gives us so we've
got to be real careful there >>

00:18:05.318 --> 00:18:10.723
I had occasion to look at it
recently and at that time you

00:18:10.723 --> 00:18:16.095
guys had assessed that our
ability to analyze hash

00:18:16.095 --> 00:18:19.165
functions was a good ten to 20
years behind our ability to

00:18:19.165 --> 00:18:23.169
analyze the other primitives. I
wonder if you think that gap has

00:18:23.169 --> 00:18:27.273
closed. >> I think we're much
better at understanding hash

00:18:27.273 --> 00:18:30.977
functions right now. We're still
implementing bad ones but that's

00:18:30.977 --> 00:18:36.749
more legacy. It's a very hard --
mathematically it is hard

00:18:36.749 --> 00:18:41.420
because your assumptions are
squirrelly. I think I revised

00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:48.928
that in the revised edition of
that book which is cryptography

00:18:48.928 --> 00:18:53.633
engineering. But I do think we
understand crypto -- encryption

00:18:53.633 --> 00:18:58.204
primitives better than hash
primitives. Even though you can

00:18:58.204 --> 00:19:01.073
make one from the other. Which
is why I don't know if people

00:19:01.073 --> 00:19:04.276
remember when there was the hash
function con test that just ran

00:19:04.276 --> 00:19:10.316
five years ago, I built a hash
function on top of a symmetric

00:19:10.316 --> 00:19:13.085
algorithm because I felt I
understood that better. I'm not

00:19:13.085 --> 00:19:15.087
convinced the NSA understood the
hash functions well. Something

00:19:15.087 --> 00:19:17.089
they're using in military
applications much until

00:19:17.089 --> 00:19:23.095
recently. They didn't have their
rich history like they had with

00:19:28.634 --> 00:19:34.640
encryption. >> Thanks. >> The
code in rain Dale is not the

00:19:43.215 --> 00:19:45.484
code that's in -- I trust you
more than I trust the feds. Do

00:19:45.484 --> 00:19:49.088
you think that AES is a
trustworthy cypher? >> I think

00:19:49.088 --> 00:19:55.094
AES is. I trust AES. It is ring
dal. Everyone is happy with

00:20:01.634 --> 00:20:07.606
them. It is weird because you
can actually describe the

00:20:07.606 --> 00:20:11.677
algorithm in a linear -- in an
equation that fits on one page.

00:20:11.677 --> 00:20:14.280
It's kind of small type but it
fits on one page which kind of

00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:17.950
freaks people out a little bit.
But I do trust it. I think it is

00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:22.121
secure. I do not think there is
a back door or anything snuck

00:20:22.121 --> 00:20:26.759
in. I truly don't. NIST did a
great job with the AES process.

00:20:26.759 --> 00:20:33.732
I really do -- NIST
unfortunately got tarred with

00:20:33.732 --> 00:20:38.537
the new release generator and
they're trying to rebuild their

00:20:38.537 --> 00:20:40.873
trust but they've done a
fantastic job of crypto

00:20:40.873 --> 00:20:46.679
primitives by and large. I like
AES. Thanks for using two fish.

00:20:46.679 --> 00:20:52.685
I like it too. I use AES without
reservation. >> As disturbing as

00:20:58.390 --> 00:21:01.694
the current crypto war is,
something that scares me are

00:21:01.694 --> 00:21:07.233
lava bid or some of the other
companies getting national

00:21:07.233 --> 00:21:10.803
letters. I'm wondering what we
can do to defend against

00:21:10.803 --> 00:21:16.809
governments secretly ordering
companies to put back doors into

00:21:16.809 --> 00:21:20.112
their products. >> The thing
that should freak us out the

00:21:20.112 --> 00:21:22.414
most, and to me this is the
biggest deal revelation of

00:21:22.414 --> 00:21:28.487
Snowden and all the stories
around it. It's not that we

00:21:28.487 --> 00:21:34.493
believe that encryption was
perfect and nobody can break it.

00:21:36.862 --> 00:21:43.569
But we did believe that the tech
rose and fell on its own merits.

00:21:43.569 --> 00:21:48.541
And the idea that the government
can go into a company and say

00:21:48.541 --> 00:21:51.477
you have to break your
encryption and then lie to your

00:21:51.477 --> 00:21:57.249
customers about it is
terrifying. The law can subvert

00:21:57.249 --> 00:22:04.290
technology. And we cannot, as a
community, as a society, truly

00:22:04.290 --> 00:22:09.295
believe that anything is secure,
as long as that's true. I just

00:22:09.295 --> 00:22:13.465
talked about, you know, i
message and we don't know. And I

00:22:13.465 --> 00:22:15.534
blogged about this as couple of
days ago. It didn't get enough

00:22:15.534 --> 00:22:18.370
play. It's kind of the last part
of a post, but there's a

00:22:18.370 --> 00:22:24.743
persistent rumor going on around
right now that Apple is in court

00:22:24.743 --> 00:22:30.749
fighting an order to back door i
message and face time. And

00:22:32.885 --> 00:22:37.289
Nicholas Weaver has written
about how they could do that.

00:22:37.289 --> 00:22:40.526
How they can modify their
protocols to make that happen.

00:22:40.526 --> 00:22:46.565
And we don't know. That is
fundamentally terrifying. And I

00:22:46.565 --> 00:22:49.835
don't know how to fix that. We
have to fix that through the

00:22:49.835 --> 00:22:54.607
legal -- there's no tech fix. I
mean, the kind of things you can

00:22:54.607 --> 00:22:58.177
do, I think that if we thought
about it, we could rewrite the

00:22:58.177 --> 00:23:02.848
Apple protocols such that if
they did have to put a back door

00:23:02.848 --> 00:23:06.185
in, we would notice. We would
say why did you make the change

00:23:06.185 --> 00:23:08.187
they would say a bullshit
answer, we would know something

00:23:13.225 --> 00:23:19.498
was up. So maybe something
making your algorithms not back

00:23:19.498 --> 00:23:23.802
door proof, but backdoor
evident. So maybe think more

00:23:23.802 --> 00:23:29.575
about that. But this is a hard
one. And I don't have a good

00:23:29.575 --> 00:23:33.379
answer. And it is one that I
think really should disturb us.

00:23:33.379 --> 00:23:37.082
More open source is going to be
good here, more sunlight, harder

00:23:37.082 --> 00:23:43.789
to subvert. But as long as the
government can issue secret

00:23:43.789 --> 00:23:49.295
orders in secret courts based on
secret laws, we have a problem.

00:23:49.295 --> 00:23:55.301
And it is not a tech problem.
It's a legal problem. >> Hi. We

00:24:01.006 --> 00:24:05.477
seem to be in a situation where
the software industry can

00:24:05.477 --> 00:24:09.281
release software that runs on
billions of devices and is

00:24:09.281 --> 00:24:12.418
completely insecure and badly
written and there's no

00:24:12.418 --> 00:24:16.955
consequence whatsoever to those
companies for the problems that

00:24:16.955 --> 00:24:21.860
they create. Just recently what
comes to mind is heck on

00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:26.598
android. Can you discuss
generally what you think about

00:24:26.598 --> 00:24:29.568
this and from a legal
perspective and software

00:24:29.568 --> 00:24:34.173
companies being held liable,
accountable for the bad software

00:24:34.173 --> 00:24:38.143
that they write? >> I've always
been a fan of liabilities. I've

00:24:38.143 --> 00:24:41.714
written the first thing about it
in maybe '02 or something. Maybe

00:24:41.714 --> 00:24:49.355
even before. So here's the basic
argument. That right now as you

00:24:49.355 --> 00:24:53.659
say there are no costs to
writing bad software. You read a

00:24:53.659 --> 00:24:56.328
software license, it says if
this software maims your

00:24:56.328 --> 00:25:02.835
children and we told you it
would do that, we're not liable.

00:25:02.835 --> 00:25:08.841
Even security software says no
claims about security are made,

00:25:13.245 --> 00:25:20.285
even though they are. So
liability changes that. It adds

00:25:20.285 --> 00:25:26.291
a cost to not designing software
properly. It adds a cost to

00:25:26.291 --> 00:25:30.896
insecurity. It adds a cost to
nonreliability. And that has

00:25:30.896 --> 00:25:34.666
real value. Think about we are
already paying these costs,

00:25:34.666 --> 00:25:37.803
we're paying it in losses, we're
paying it aftermarket security

00:25:37.803 --> 00:25:41.340
devices, we're paying it in sort
of the entire industry that is

00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:44.376
strung up around dealing with
the fact that the software

00:25:44.376 --> 00:25:50.983
sucks. But with a liability we
would pay anyway, the cost would

00:25:50.983 --> 00:25:53.118
be passed on to us of course,
but at least we'll be getting

00:25:53.118 --> 00:25:58.323
more secure software out of it.
I see a collective action

00:25:58.323 --> 00:26:01.460
promise, the market is not
rewarding good security. The

00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:07.666
cost of insecurity is too low.
The value of insecurity is high.

00:26:07.666 --> 00:26:12.104
And liability changes that. It
is a lever we can use to

00:26:12.104 --> 00:26:17.643
rebalance this cost-benefit
ratio. And I think it's a

00:26:17.643 --> 00:26:20.245
powerful one. It is not a
panacea. Lots of ways

00:26:20.245 --> 00:26:24.883
liabilities go wrong. But
liabilities do a lot. They

00:26:24.883 --> 00:26:29.822
provide value. And I think they
would a hundred percent here in

00:26:29.822 --> 00:26:35.861
software. We know why the
Android vulnerability isn't

00:26:35.861 --> 00:26:41.400
being promulgated. They designed
their system, Google produced

00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:44.603
the patch but it won't go down
to the phones. The phone

00:26:44.603 --> 00:26:47.906
manufacturers don't care very
much. They don't have that tight

00:26:47.906 --> 00:26:54.446
connection like you have in the
iOS world. So the patch doesn't

00:26:54.446 --> 00:27:00.385
go downstream. If suddenly the
phone manufacturers were liable,

00:27:00.385 --> 00:27:02.821
I assure you that the patch
mechanism would work better,

00:27:02.821 --> 00:27:08.360
right? And that's a lever we
have as society, and we should

00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:11.263
use it. I think it's a better
one than regulation here,

00:27:11.263 --> 00:27:15.834
because it's one that's dynamic,
and tend to seek its own level.

00:27:15.834 --> 00:27:20.539
But that's why. That's why you
use it, and I'm a big fan of it.

00:27:20.539 --> 00:27:24.176
Actually, thinking about this,
hang on. Everybody, smile.

00:27:26.478 --> 00:27:29.815
There's more of you than fits on
this screen. That's not going to

00:27:29.815 --> 00:27:33.652
work. Hang on. People at the
edges, you don't have to smile.

00:27:33.652 --> 00:27:39.658
Thanks. Who's next? >> Bruce, it
seems like less and less surveys

00:27:41.860 --> 00:27:44.263
seem to show that Americans are
concerned about the privacy of

00:27:44.263 --> 00:27:47.432
their information. Often you
hear terms like I'm not hiding

00:27:47.432 --> 00:27:52.104
anything, so I'm not worried.
And it seems like people my age

00:27:52.104 --> 00:27:54.173
and younger don't have much of
an understanding of Edward

00:27:54.173 --> 00:27:58.110
Snowden or the relevance of what
he released. What would you say

00:27:58.110 --> 00:28:02.447
to those perspectives? >> I
don't know if people know I had

00:28:02.447 --> 00:28:08.453
a book published in March called
David and Goliath. I spent a

00:28:10.556 --> 00:28:15.027
whole chapter on that question
on privacy, why it's important.

00:28:15.027 --> 00:28:19.531
And it's not true that people
don't care about privacy. It's

00:28:19.531 --> 00:28:23.201
actually young people don't. All
surveys show that they do.

00:28:23.201 --> 00:28:25.404
They're very concerned about it.
And you know this is true. You

00:28:25.404 --> 00:28:31.176
remember being a teenager. You
don't care about the government,

00:28:31.176 --> 00:28:34.680
because who cares, but you're
concerned about the privacy in

00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:41.653
your world. And you know, people
who are fluent kids teenagers

00:28:41.653 --> 00:28:44.923
who are fluent in the net are
fluent in how to maintain their

00:28:44.923 --> 00:28:49.895
privacy. They might not do a
good job but they try a lot. I

00:28:49.895 --> 00:28:56.335
argue that it's fundamental to
individuality, to who we are.

00:28:56.335 --> 00:29:01.373
Without privacy we became
conformists. We don't speak out.

00:29:03.408 --> 00:29:06.645
And I think it's a really
interesting argument in social

00:29:06.645 --> 00:29:14.486
change. We're in a year where
gay marriage is legal in all 50

00:29:14.486 --> 00:29:20.492
states. (Applause.) That issue
went from impossible to

00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:31.570
inevitable with no intervening
middle ground. It's amazing. But

00:29:31.570 --> 00:29:35.674
what it means is, and you can
take legalization of pot, you

00:29:35.674 --> 00:29:37.676
can take a lot of issues you can
take in this way. Back then,

00:29:37.676 --> 00:29:43.682
something is illegal and let's
say immoral. It goes from

00:29:45.784 --> 00:29:50.155
illegal and immoral to, you
know, some cool kids are doing

00:29:50.155 --> 00:29:54.493
it. To illegal and we're not
sure. And then suddenly it

00:29:54.493 --> 00:29:59.364
becomes legal. But in order to
get from here to here, you've

00:29:59.364 --> 00:30:02.100
got to be a point here where the
thing is illegal and people do

00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:04.770
it anyway. Because you've got to
do it and say you know what?

00:30:04.770 --> 00:30:10.075
That gay sex wasn't that bad.
(Laughter.) That was kind of

00:30:10.075 --> 00:30:16.915
okay. You know? I tried pot and
the world didn't end. And it

00:30:16.915 --> 00:30:20.919
might take 40 years and a couple
of generations, but then you get

00:30:20.919 --> 00:30:25.657
to the point where it is legal.
Interracial marriage. Any of

00:30:25.657 --> 00:30:31.096
these issues. But if you have
surveillance here. If you can

00:30:31.096 --> 00:30:35.600
stop people from trying the
thing and saying, you know? It's

00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:41.173
not that bad, maybe we're wrong,
you never get to the point where

00:30:41.173 --> 00:30:46.344
the majority of us believe we're
wrong. I think surveillance,

00:30:46.344 --> 00:30:53.051
broad government surveillance
will really have a stifling

00:30:53.051 --> 00:30:59.691
influence on social progress.
Because it won't let experiments

00:30:59.691 --> 00:31:05.630
to happen. Now, the argument you
can make to anybody, but I think

00:31:07.632 --> 00:31:11.436
it is probably the most
important one. But really,

00:31:11.436 --> 00:31:15.774
anyone who says I have nothing
to hide, you know they're lying,

00:31:15.774 --> 00:31:19.711
right? I mean, there aren't
cameras in Scott McNeeley's

00:31:19.711 --> 00:31:25.283
house because he has nothing to
hide. I think you have to point

00:31:25.283 --> 00:31:30.288
out that those arguments aren't
true and that privacy isn't

00:31:30.288 --> 00:31:33.525
about something to hide. It is
about maintaining your sense of

00:31:33.525 --> 00:31:39.197
self in a public world. I get to
determine what I tell you people

00:31:39.197 --> 00:31:42.134
and what I don't tell you
people. And that is empowering.

00:31:42.134 --> 00:31:45.237
And if I lose that, I am
fundamentally a prisoner of

00:31:45.237 --> 00:31:52.644
society. So attaching privacy to
something to hide, to secrets,

00:31:52.644 --> 00:31:55.614
is just wrong. It's about human
dignity and it's about liberty.

00:31:55.614 --> 00:31:57.616
I spent a whole chapter on that
and I do it better in the

00:31:57.616 --> 00:32:04.790
chapter. So I offer that up. >>
Thank you. >> Yes? >> Most

00:32:04.790 --> 00:32:07.259
people seem to me more worried
about back doors and forced

00:32:07.259 --> 00:32:13.832
government back doors, but I'm
sort of more worried about

00:32:13.832 --> 00:32:19.704
sneakers where what is your
opinion on quantum computing and

00:32:19.704 --> 00:32:23.008
current encryption and also
quantum encryption and its

00:32:23.008 --> 00:32:26.678
rebuttal to quantum computing.
>> Quantum encryption has

00:32:26.678 --> 00:32:29.648
nothing to do with quantum
computing. Quantum computing is

00:32:29.648 --> 00:32:35.821
going to become real. Probably
not in our lifetime. I think we

00:32:35.821 --> 00:32:40.325
can factor like 24 now. But it
will get better. It has

00:32:40.325 --> 00:32:44.296
potential to change crypto, but
not destroy it. It will break

00:32:44.296 --> 00:32:50.302
all of the common algorithms, so
RSA, and those. It will break

00:32:53.505 --> 00:32:56.741
those in linear time and be very
nasty. But we do have public key

00:32:56.741 --> 00:32:58.743
algorithms that do work. His
early one that the work factor

00:32:58.743 --> 00:33:00.679
of a square instead of
exponential. They're less

00:33:00.679 --> 00:33:04.850
efficient, but they still work.
In theory, the best quantum

00:33:04.850 --> 00:33:10.856
photography does is have your
key length. It reduces your

00:33:36.448 --> 00:33:40.018
brute force search by a factor
of a square root. So double your

00:33:40.018 --> 00:33:45.724
key length and you're done. NIST
is actually hosting conferences

00:33:45.724 --> 00:33:51.730
on post quantum cryptography.
How can we build resistant to

00:33:55.267 --> 00:34:01.773
quantum computing theoretical
world. Quantum crypto is really

00:34:01.773 --> 00:34:04.476
quantum key exchange. It is a
clever way to exchange keys

00:34:04.476 --> 00:34:10.482
using quantum properties. Really
neat, great science, great

00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:21.993
physics, something I as a
cryptographer have no need for.

00:34:21.993 --> 00:34:27.999
So I think it is kind of
pointless from a practical point

00:34:32.837 --> 00:34:37.208
of view. Great science, but I
would never buy such a device

00:34:37.208 --> 00:34:40.145
because I would use one of the
math systems and they work just

00:34:40.145 --> 00:34:47.319
fine. So that's sort of my quick
quantum primer. But it's great

00:34:47.319 --> 00:34:50.989
science and I love the research.
And eventually, yes. We'll be

00:34:50.989 --> 00:34:54.059
able to factor numbers very
quickly, which will be cool.

00:34:54.059 --> 00:34:56.328
Yes? >> I was wondering if you
caught the previous talk by

00:34:56.328 --> 00:34:58.330
Eijah demonsaw. >> I definitely
want things -- this is the

00:34:58.330 --> 00:35:00.265
answer about the opsec. Same
thing. The more you make it

00:35:00.265 --> 00:35:02.267
invisible, the more you make it
transparent, easy to use, no

00:35:02.267 --> 00:35:04.269
work. Even sacrificing some
security, I think we do better.

00:35:04.269 --> 00:35:06.271
I'm really liking -- on my
iPhone. It's a great program. It

00:35:06.271 --> 00:35:08.273
has a really clean interface. It
works. I can actually all the

00:35:08.273 --> 00:35:10.275
key exchange happens in the
background, it's well designed.

00:35:10.275 --> 00:35:12.277
I can confirm there's no man in
the middle. I don't have to but

00:35:12.277 --> 00:35:14.279
the fact that I can is enough of
a deterrent of people trying it.

00:35:14.279 --> 00:35:16.281
So I really like simple stuff.
Because I want everyone to use

00:35:16.281 --> 00:35:18.283
it. There's value in it being
ubiquitous. Expert-only

00:35:18.283 --> 00:35:20.285
encryption has much less
effectiveness. One last comment

00:35:20.285 --> 00:35:22.287
to the quantum guy. One of the
things we know about the NSA

00:35:22.287 --> 00:35:24.289
documents, they have a budget
line but it's not very large. >>

00:35:24.289 --> 00:35:26.291
First of all, Bruce, you're my
security crush and do you mind

00:35:26.291 --> 00:35:28.293
if I take a picture with you
after the show? >> I don't but

00:35:28.293 --> 00:35:34.299
you guys all have weird pie
plates on your chest. I'm just

00:35:39.771 --> 00:35:45.777
saying. You look like some
embarrassing cult. >> It's

00:36:13.605 --> 00:36:19.611
Flava-flav. With the explosion
of software defined networking,

00:36:44.402 --> 00:36:47.972
do you have specific concerns
around the security of such

00:36:47.972 --> 00:36:52.310
leading edge technology and this
virtualization of router

00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:55.380
switches, firewall et cetera, do
you have thoughts on that? >> I

00:36:55.380 --> 00:36:59.117
don't have any specific
concerns, just a general of more

00:36:59.117 --> 00:37:03.154
complexity, more things to be
insecure, and another layer of

00:37:03.154 --> 00:37:09.861
organization. Those are my
concerns. I mean, there's huge

00:37:09.861 --> 00:37:13.398
value in this. I'm a big fan of
security outsourcing for

00:37:13.398 --> 00:37:17.769
organizations. It's very hard to
do right and the more you can

00:37:17.769 --> 00:37:21.272
consolidate the expertise, I
think the better you'll do. But

00:37:21.272 --> 00:37:28.179
there are legal risks. We've
been seeing some court cases

00:37:28.179 --> 00:37:33.785
that the FBI can survey warrant
on Facebook for your stuff

00:37:33.785 --> 00:37:40.058
bypassing you. They can do that.
And that does cause problems.

00:37:40.058 --> 00:37:46.064
But in general I think the value
of outsourcing is great. And

00:37:48.166 --> 00:37:52.403
there are security risks but I
think in benefit I tend to like

00:37:52.403 --> 00:37:56.174
that technology. >> So it's a
balance, no major concerns over

00:37:56.174 --> 00:38:00.678
shared control planes? >> That's
it. You've got to know all that.

00:38:00.678 --> 00:38:04.649
Those are things to be concerned
about. But are they major

00:38:04.649 --> 00:38:07.152
concerns? They're like
regular-sized concerns. >> All

00:38:07.152 --> 00:38:09.888
right, thanks. >> First of all,
thank you for everything you do.

00:38:09.888 --> 00:38:13.625
>> With the pie plate also, I'm
saying. >> My question is, even

00:38:13.625 --> 00:38:17.662
if they wanted to, would policy
makers be able to stay current

00:38:17.662 --> 00:38:22.667
with the pace of technology? >>
It's interesting. I think I've

00:38:22.667 --> 00:38:25.503
got to the belief that the
United States, probably other

00:38:25.503 --> 00:38:28.106
countries are becoming
fundamentally ungovernable.

00:38:28.106 --> 00:38:33.178
That's one of the reasons that
technology is moving so fast,

00:38:33.178 --> 00:38:38.049
that the people who understand
it can run rings around policy

00:38:38.049 --> 00:38:43.788
makers. And whether it's writing
laws that five years in

00:38:43.788 --> 00:38:46.658
retrospect you realize whoa,
they understood that and put

00:38:46.658 --> 00:38:51.663
that sentence in and we didn't
understand that this is hard. I

00:38:51.663 --> 00:38:55.099
like seeing laws that are
invariant. Write laws that don't

00:38:55.099 --> 00:38:57.101
have to keep up. Laws about
assault and murder don't really

00:38:57.101 --> 00:39:03.041
care about the weapon. I could
write a law about privacy for

00:39:06.144 --> 00:39:12.150
communications that doesn't care
if it's e-mail or voice or voice

00:39:15.987 --> 00:39:23.861
over IP. I can do that. I think
that's better. I'm not sure it

00:39:23.861 --> 00:39:30.168
will happen. There's so much
co-option of the legal and

00:39:30.168 --> 00:39:34.572
policy process by people who
stand to make and lose a lot of

00:39:34.572 --> 00:39:39.310
money. Right now the cyber
security bill, that's probably

00:39:39.310 --> 00:39:44.082
going to get signed, has got all
sorts of amendments and riders

00:39:44.082 --> 00:39:46.651
and what it actually does isn't
what they say it does. And

00:39:46.651 --> 00:39:49.954
that's an easy one. You start
doing something like health care

00:39:49.954 --> 00:39:57.929
or climate change, forget it. So
I'm not optimistic about

00:39:57.929 --> 00:40:01.366
lawmakers staying current
because of technology. I think

00:40:01.366 --> 00:40:03.968
we're going to have to go
through some bad times before we

00:40:03.968 --> 00:40:09.274
realize how to create law in a
society where tech moves so

00:40:09.274 --> 00:40:14.045
fast. There's an argument to be
made that the modern

00:40:14.045 --> 00:40:18.716
constitutional democracy is the
best form of government mid 18th

00:40:18.716 --> 00:40:23.821
century technology could invent.
Travel and communications are

00:40:23.821 --> 00:40:27.125
hard so we've got to pick one of
us to go all the way over there

00:40:27.125 --> 00:40:35.066
to make laws in our name. It
made since in 1782. There's a

00:40:35.066 --> 00:40:39.337
lot of ways that our systems
that were designed when nation

00:40:39.337 --> 00:40:44.409
states started becoming a thing
are sort of breaking now because

00:40:44.409 --> 00:40:47.979
things are different. Things are
moving too fast. The

00:40:47.979 --> 00:40:51.049
communication is different. It's
all different. And I think we

00:40:51.049 --> 00:40:55.119
have to redesign democracy. This
of course is ridiculous and will

00:40:55.119 --> 00:41:00.258
never happen. But I think we
kind of need to. That wasn't an

00:41:00.258 --> 00:41:05.997
optimistic answer, was it? >> A
few months ago there was news

00:41:05.997 --> 00:41:10.335
about Chris Roberts being
detained at the airport after he

00:41:10.335 --> 00:41:17.175
posted a tweet -- >> Is he here?
Okay. >> And then your blog said

00:41:17.175 --> 00:41:23.014
that maybe FBI knew that Chris
Roberts works in the field of

00:41:23.014 --> 00:41:28.619
avionics and that's why he was
detained. And there was news

00:41:28.619 --> 00:41:35.893
that they had posted a warning
about it even though they claim

00:41:35.893 --> 00:41:42.200
it was an IT issue. So what do
you think -- is the emphasis on

00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:48.639
security -- the issue was
similar. >> So we didn't know

00:41:48.639 --> 00:41:54.345
that Chris Roberts says that he
actually was being watched by

00:41:54.345 --> 00:41:58.316
the FBI. That he had talked to
them before. The Chris Roberts

00:41:58.316 --> 00:42:00.952
says is very complicated and I
stopped commenting when I

00:42:00.952 --> 00:42:03.287
realized it was way more
complicated than I understood.

00:42:03.287 --> 00:42:09.761
This is the case of him being on
a plane and saying something

00:42:09.761 --> 00:42:14.432
about going into the avionics
bus via the USB port in his

00:42:14.432 --> 00:42:18.736
seat. Which would be crazy if
you could, but it wouldn't

00:42:18.736 --> 00:42:24.942
surprise me if Airbus forgot
about that. It really seems

00:42:24.942 --> 00:42:28.312
every time you put physical
security people and give them an

00:42:28.312 --> 00:42:32.116
IT security problem, they
completely forget they should

00:42:32.116 --> 00:42:38.122
talk to a security IT person.
Anyone follow the hack on the

00:42:38.122 --> 00:42:42.627
Brinks safe? It's completely
embarrassing. They never even

00:42:42.627 --> 00:42:44.896
open an IT security book. Oh,
yeah, we can do this. No

00:42:44.896 --> 00:42:50.902
problem. I don't know how much
proactive -- it does seem like

00:42:53.438 --> 00:42:58.543
the FBI is monitoring more
groups and more individuals. And

00:42:58.543 --> 00:43:02.847
we see them monitoring the
occupy movement or black lives

00:43:02.847 --> 00:43:09.420
matter. I mean, real social
change movements that might not

00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:15.426
be as, I don't know, as
mainstream as they could be. So

00:43:17.628 --> 00:43:22.667
there's a lot of that going on.
How much -- in those cases I

00:43:22.667 --> 00:43:26.771
don't know. The wall street case
I have no idea. Certainly

00:43:26.771 --> 00:43:31.409
there's always a lot of bragging
that might not be true. >> But

00:43:31.409 --> 00:43:35.947
then they posted it the day
before. >> Yeah, I don't know. I

00:43:35.947 --> 00:43:40.518
don't know the details. And it's
hard to speculate. I think there

00:43:40.518 --> 00:43:44.155
is more monitoring than we all
think. This is the point of

00:43:44.155 --> 00:43:47.458
fusion centers, this is the
point of information sharing

00:43:47.458 --> 00:43:49.961
between the NSA and others and I
think a lot of it is going on.

00:43:52.296 --> 00:43:55.399
>> So do you trust elliptic
curves? >> I've been skeptics

00:43:55.399 --> 00:44:01.339
for the bunch of years. Most do
trust them. My feeling is that

00:44:13.184 --> 00:44:15.686
there's a lot we don't know
about elliptic curve

00:44:15.686 --> 00:44:21.692
mathematics. The NSA uses
elliptic curve crypto. So I can

00:44:23.895 --> 00:44:29.901
tell you that. So in some
instances it is secure. But I

00:44:35.139 --> 00:44:41.078
also know that they have, in
some cases, tried to influence

00:44:41.078 --> 00:44:46.417
curve selection. Now, for good
or for bad, I can't tell you. So

00:44:46.417 --> 00:44:50.555
I worry about elliptic curves
where the curve selection

00:44:50.555 --> 00:44:55.993
process isn't transparent. Now,
if you want to use elliptic

00:44:55.993 --> 00:45:01.165
curves in your system, Dan
Bernstein, a guy we all trust

00:45:01.165 --> 00:45:06.737
had a public process and they
are available and I would use

00:45:06.737 --> 00:45:09.674
those without reservation. The
NSA said here's some great

00:45:09.674 --> 00:45:14.946
curves, I would say, you know,
huh? (Laughter.) So that's my

00:45:14.946 --> 00:45:19.050
feeling on that. I think the
math is sound, but I think there

00:45:19.050 --> 00:45:22.153
are things we don't fully
understand. I'm getting the get

00:45:22.153 --> 00:45:27.258
off stage soon signal so I'm
going to take -- do you have a

00:45:27.258 --> 00:45:32.396
yes or no question? >> No.
(Laughter.) >> All right. Short

00:45:32.396 --> 00:45:36.300
answer. Go. >> So you got me
into security, I've been in this

00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:41.305
industry ten years. Thank you so
much. So my question is, now

00:45:41.305 --> 00:45:44.375
that I found myself in a
position, hypothetically, where

00:45:44.375 --> 00:45:47.278
I'm working with a government
agency, where they use the same

00:45:47.278 --> 00:45:49.714
shitty software as everyone
else, they've got the same

00:45:49.714 --> 00:45:52.583
problems as everyone else, and
I'm convinced that the actions

00:45:52.583 --> 00:45:56.487
of stock piling zero days,
weakening crypto all that stuff

00:45:56.487 --> 00:46:02.226
is harmful. >> Quick, quick. >>
What can I do to convince or

00:46:02.226 --> 00:46:05.863
show these people that actually
these other arms of the

00:46:05.863 --> 00:46:08.633
government are doing things that
hurt us. >> This is hard and a

00:46:08.633 --> 00:46:12.536
lot of us are trying to do this.
Keep saying it. This is not the

00:46:12.536 --> 00:46:18.542
tech process. I'm doing a book
signing at 4:00. Come by and say

00:46:21.178 --> 00:46:25.650
hi. Not all of you at once. I'm
going to go outside right now

00:46:25.650 --> 00:46:30.021
assuming there is space to
breathe. Thank you very much for

00:46:30.021 --> 00:46:33.591
coming. Thanks for sitting. Have
a good weekend. (Applause.)
