00:00:00.234 --> 00:00:03.303
All right. For anybody who is in
this back corner over here, is

00:00:03.303 --> 00:00:06.673
if you want to hear clear audio
I suggest you go to this side of

00:00:06.673 --> 00:00:11.144
the room. We just have problem
with the air wall there, if you

00:00:11.144 --> 00:00:14.982
want to hear clear audio come on
over to this side. That being

00:00:14.982 --> 00:00:22.055
said, welcome to the talk. This
is general purpose computing,

00:00:22.055 --> 00:00:27.961
computers, sorry and without
further adue Cory Doctorow. >>

00:00:27.961 --> 00:00:34.801
Thank you. Thanks for coming.
Thank you. So, you know, two

00:00:34.801 --> 00:00:38.038
years ago I came to DEF CON and
I gave a talk where I predicted

00:00:38.038 --> 00:00:41.308
that things were going to get
really ugly in the Internet of

00:00:41.308 --> 00:00:45.245
things. After all we live in a
world made out of computers and

00:00:45.245 --> 00:00:48.115
not just in that kind of
metaphorical sense where like if

00:00:48.115 --> 00:00:51.618
you download those glossy
videos, promoting the Internet

00:00:51.618 --> 00:00:54.288
of things where like it all
looks like it's been set dressed

00:00:54.288 --> 00:00:57.124
by someone involved in the Tron
production and everything is

00:00:57.124 --> 00:01:00.928
like white and linear and
jumpsuity people walk in these

00:01:00.928 --> 00:01:04.765
houses they like wave their
hands and the lights come on. I

00:01:04.765 --> 00:01:08.368
had someone the other day, yeah,
I've had those like awesome

00:01:08.368 --> 00:01:12.172
computer controlled lights for
months now. And I went to a

00:01:12.172 --> 00:01:14.908
hotel I was like, you have to
touch a light switch like an

00:01:14.908 --> 00:01:17.377
animal. Then they walk into the
kitchen and they wave their hand

00:01:17.377 --> 00:01:19.846
again the lights come on. They
say like, tea, black, hot, early

00:01:19.846 --> 00:01:25.352
grey. Right? And it feels
futuristic like tomorrow we'll

00:01:25.352 --> 00:01:31.358
live in world made of computers,
one of the implications that may

00:01:34.628 --> 00:01:37.364
occur to you as you watch this
person walk through their

00:01:37.364 --> 00:01:40.200
gesture and voice controlled
house is that a house that you

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.403
can gesture and talk to no
matter where you are is a house

00:01:43.403 --> 00:01:48.041
microphone listening to you and
camera watching you wherever you

00:01:48.041 --> 00:01:51.478
are. And this is where things
start to get ugly with the

00:01:51.478 --> 00:01:55.882
Internet of things. Now, we
don't have to wait for the Tron

00:01:55.882 --> 00:01:59.920
future to live in a world made
out of computers. We already in

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.124
habit a world where the most
salient fact about many of the

00:02:04.124 --> 00:02:07.094
things that we put our bodies
into and we put inside of our

00:02:07.094 --> 00:02:10.330
bodies the most important thing
about them is their internal

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.234
logic. It's the computers that
they run on. They are in effect

00:02:14.234 --> 00:02:17.771
special purpose computers that
do things like let's you live

00:02:17.771 --> 00:02:21.241
inside of them. Or drive around
in them. Or keep your heart

00:02:21.241 --> 00:02:26.747
rolling. And so, when you hear
about, for example, sub prime

00:02:26.747 --> 00:02:29.683
car lending which is the newest
way to like monetize poor

00:02:29.683 --> 00:02:34.321
people, right? You give them a
car loan, and then you turn that

00:02:34.321 --> 00:02:38.825
car loan, the return on that car
loan into a bond and you float

00:02:38.825 --> 00:02:43.530
that on the street and the way
that you securitize car loan is

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:49.636
you fit the ignition system on
that car with a network location

00:02:49.636 --> 00:02:52.839
aware ignition override that
makes sure that you're adhering

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:56.610
to the lease terms or the loan
terms or disables your ignition

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.180
system so if you drive outside
the tri-county area, if that's a

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:05.552
term of your loan, they can
remote shut down your car. And

00:03:05.552 --> 00:03:08.121
you hear about that you realize
that the most important fact

00:03:08.121 --> 00:03:11.425
about that car is the computer
inside of it. Doesn't have to be

00:03:11.425 --> 00:03:14.261
one of those Jeeps that just got
recalled because over the

00:03:14.261 --> 00:03:17.497
Internet you can disabled the
steering and the brakes these

00:03:17.497 --> 00:03:21.101
things are designed to be
disabled over the Internet. And

00:03:21.101 --> 00:03:23.670
people have broken into those
systems and use them to shut

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.773
down cars in the middle of
highway or IM mobilize every car

00:03:26.773 --> 00:03:31.478
ever sold. Not just cars that
are computers that we put our

00:03:31.478 --> 00:03:37.684
bodies into, a 747 is a flying
fancy aluminum case connected to

00:03:37.684 --> 00:03:43.056
tragically badly secured Scada
controllers. The thing about the

00:03:43.056 --> 00:03:45.392
Internet of things, the thing
about world made out of

00:03:45.392 --> 00:03:49.529
computers is that it's
inheriting the worst fact about

00:03:49.529 --> 00:03:52.432
the early years of compute
commerce is the Ink jet printer

00:03:52.432 --> 00:03:57.304
business model. Where the things
are sold in a way that they are

00:03:57.304 --> 00:04:01.308
intended to act as a platform
where the manufacturer controls

00:04:01.308 --> 00:04:05.846
that platform and gets to
monetize it and at high margins

00:04:05.846 --> 00:04:10.283
by controlling who can sell
add-ons for it and who can sell

00:04:10.283 --> 00:04:13.987
consumeables for it and who can
add features to it. This is very

00:04:13.987 --> 00:04:16.656
useful if you're the
manufacturer, for example, you

00:04:16.656 --> 00:04:20.594
can charge a lot of money for
like the extra stuff that plugs

00:04:20.594 --> 00:04:25.665
into it like whatever you use up
in it like the chargers, or the

00:04:25.665 --> 00:04:29.536
gasoline or the windshield wiper
fluid, also great if you're the

00:04:29.536 --> 00:04:32.873
manufacturer because you can
make covenants to third parties

00:04:32.873 --> 00:04:34.875
who might subsidize the
purchase. If you make third --

00:04:34.875 --> 00:04:39.479
if you make smart thermostats
you might be able to get a power

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:42.349
company to subsidize buying
millions for everybody who

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:45.719
livers in a district by being
able to warrant that you'll

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:49.756
never sell software for it or
allow software that allows the

00:04:49.756 --> 00:04:53.894
user that have thermostat to
adjust it when the power company

00:04:53.894 --> 00:04:56.663
turns it down or up. If the
power company says, we're

00:04:56.663 --> 00:05:01.101
running out of head room in the
power infrastructure, we're

00:05:01.101 --> 00:05:04.571
going to turn down everyone's
air conditioning by two degrees,

00:05:04.571 --> 00:05:06.673
they want to be able to make
sure that you don't just walk

00:05:06.673 --> 00:05:09.242
over to it turn the air
conditioning back to where you

00:05:09.242 --> 00:05:11.711
had it before. That's great way
to subsidize the hardware. So

00:05:11.711 --> 00:05:14.981
everybody wants this Ink jet
printer business model where you

00:05:14.981 --> 00:05:18.318
get to control the software, the
consumeables and every other

00:05:18.318 --> 00:05:23.690
piece that have ecosystem. And
we have given a gift to people

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:27.661
who want to design these Ink jet
printer business models, a

00:05:27.661 --> 00:05:30.864
legislative gift in this country
in the form of a section of the

00:05:30.864 --> 00:05:34.968
digital copywrite act called
section 1201 the

00:05:34.968 --> 00:05:39.606
anti-circumvention component
digital millennium. If you break

00:05:39.606 --> 00:05:45.612
a law that is used to secure
access to a copyrighted work

00:05:47.981 --> 00:05:52.152
that even if accessing that
copyrighted work is lawful,

00:05:52.152 --> 00:05:56.756
breaking the lock is not. And so
all you need to do to make sure

00:05:56.756 --> 00:05:59.426
that nobody can plug stuff in
that you don't want plugged in

00:05:59.426 --> 00:06:02.529
or run software that you don't
want run, or add consumeables

00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:07.367
that you don't want added to
your platform, is put the

00:06:07.367 --> 00:06:10.604
thinnest creditible lock that
you can imagine around the

00:06:10.604 --> 00:06:14.874
system and then the government
will spend unlimited number of

00:06:14.874 --> 00:06:19.112
tax dollars prosecuting people
who remove that lock to add

00:06:19.112 --> 00:06:23.383
otherwise lawful functionality.
That you'd be crazy not to take

00:06:23.383 --> 00:06:27.921
up uncle Sam on this offer to
defend your dumb business model

00:06:27.921 --> 00:06:32.993
with every tax dollar at their
disposal. And the DMCA you don't

00:06:32.993 --> 00:06:36.296
even have to like get action
against you under the DMCA for

00:06:36.296 --> 00:06:40.967
the DMCA to work. To stop people
from getting involved in

00:06:40.967 --> 00:06:45.138
breaking these Ink jet printer
business model tools because it

00:06:45.138 --> 00:06:49.909
has such incredible horrific
penalties that all you need to

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:54.614
do is ask yourself, am I willing
to go to jail for five years on

00:06:54.614 --> 00:06:58.051
a first offense and spend
$500 --> 000 in fines on my first

00:06:58.051 --> 00:07:00.987
offense to see whether or not I
can unlock some functionality in

00:07:00.987 --> 00:07:04.624
this device the answer is
usually, no. You don't even need

00:07:04.624 --> 00:07:08.194
a lot of proscutions to get
everybody who is capability of

00:07:08.194 --> 00:07:11.164
doing that unlocking step to
kind of say, actually there's

00:07:11.164 --> 00:07:14.367
something better somewhere else
out there with fewer penalties.

00:07:14.367 --> 00:07:18.371
My risk calculus said I'd rather
not do this. Now, the

00:07:18.371 --> 00:07:23.176
interesting thing about DMCA1201
there is almost no litigation

00:07:23.176 --> 00:07:26.880
history. We don't really know
whether or not the courts would

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:31.785
fine $500 --> 000 in five years in
jail for listening to music the

00:07:31.785 --> 00:07:35.288
wrong way or watching TV the
wrong way or plugging in some

00:07:35.288 --> 00:07:39.259
additional functionality or
unauthorized charger to your

00:07:39.259 --> 00:07:43.596
device as write proportional.
Because the other side gets to

00:07:43.596 --> 00:07:49.736
decide when to prosecute people
for violating 1201. And they

00:07:49.736 --> 00:07:52.939
generally speaking only go after
people who they think they can

00:07:52.939 --> 00:07:55.608
win against who have really bad
facts and don't look like the

00:07:55.608 --> 00:07:58.578
kind of people you want to stand
up in front of a judge. So one

00:07:58.578 --> 00:08:02.382
of the only cases where 1201 has
ever been litigated was when

00:08:02.382 --> 00:08:07.320
"2600" magazine which don't get
me wrong, "2600" is an amazing

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:11.424
magazine, I've written for it,
Manny does God's work but "2600"

00:08:11.424 --> 00:08:15.628
magazine published DCSS for
decrypting DVDs the film

00:08:15.628 --> 00:08:19.099
industry said we're going to
fight this one all the way to

00:08:19.099 --> 00:08:23.103
the end. Because "2600" magazine
is in New York where the second

00:08:23.103 --> 00:08:25.605
circuit and judges don't really
understand technology, not like

00:08:25.605 --> 00:08:28.808
out in California where they
really clued in on this stuff

00:08:28.808 --> 00:08:33.046
and "2600" calls it's the hacker
quarterly. And we can be

00:08:33.046 --> 00:08:35.982
reliably assured that the
magazine and all of its

00:08:35.982 --> 00:08:40.520
supporters are going to show up
in court wearing black T-shirts

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.956
that say things that judges
don't understand and find

00:08:42.956 --> 00:08:46.726
vaguely disturbing. These are
the people we want to fight in

00:08:46.726 --> 00:08:50.964
court. We got our butts and
handed to us in "2600". The

00:08:50.964 --> 00:08:54.534
courts said there's no free
speech interest in magazines

00:08:54.534 --> 00:08:59.305
being allowed to publish math.
And they said that this is about

00:08:59.305 --> 00:09:02.475
whether or not people should be
allowed to defend their

00:09:02.475 --> 00:09:04.878
investments or whether or not
anyone who can figure how to

00:09:04.878 --> 00:09:08.548
steal their stuff should be able
to because they know how to

00:09:08.548 --> 00:09:11.251
remove a lock. A terrible
judgment. Couple of years later

00:09:11.251 --> 00:09:16.055
we had a great chance to stand
up to right kind, because Ed

00:09:16.055 --> 00:09:23.163
felton was at principle deputy
CTO of the White House was led a

00:09:23.163 --> 00:09:26.933
team or worked with a team that
broke SDMI which was this really

00:09:26.933 --> 00:09:31.070
crazy dumb idea to watermark
digital music so that when you

00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:35.241
converted it to analog back to
digital again, that somehow that

00:09:35.241 --> 00:09:38.878
watermark would survive even
against an adversary who wanted

00:09:38.878 --> 00:09:42.382
to remove it and that watermark
would be detectable by digital

00:09:42.382 --> 00:09:45.919
to analog converters just say,
I'm sorry, I refuse to convert

00:09:45.919 --> 00:09:49.289
that analog music back to
digital because it has been

00:09:49.289 --> 00:09:54.394
marked as non-convertible and we
won't do it. The SDMI

00:09:54.394 --> 00:09:56.930
consortium, they spent a lot of
money, hundreds of millions of

00:09:56.930 --> 00:10:00.099
dollars, they spend years on it,
smartest people going, working

00:10:00.099 --> 00:10:04.404
on it they offered big bounty to
anyone who could break it on

00:10:04.404 --> 00:10:07.006
condition that you signed a
non-disclosure. Of course Ed and

00:10:07.006 --> 00:10:09.776
his team didn't want to bounty
they want tenure and

00:10:09.776 --> 00:10:14.347
publication. They wrote a paper
on it submitted it to usenix

00:10:14.347 --> 00:10:18.818
symposium the record industry
went bananas they threatened Ed

00:10:18.818 --> 00:10:21.921
and Musnix gives this paper
about stats at a technical

00:10:21.921 --> 00:10:25.124
conference, we're going to sue
him and the technical

00:10:25.124 --> 00:10:31.030
conference, we were like, oh,
yeah, this is the one we want.

00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:34.467
Because we really want a judge
to decide whether or not record

00:10:34.467 --> 00:10:37.570
executives should be in charge
of what kind of math Princeton

00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:40.974
professors can talk about the
learned conferences. That is the

00:10:40.974 --> 00:10:43.843
question I want to stand up in
front of a judge all day long,

00:10:43.843 --> 00:10:46.846
right? If we get the right
answer, well then "2600" can

00:10:46.846 --> 00:10:51.284
publish all the DCSS that they
want. As soon as we stepped up

00:10:51.284 --> 00:10:54.020
at electronic frontier
foundation to represent Ed the

00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:56.823
record industry dropped the
threat. They not only dropped

00:10:56.823 --> 00:10:59.259
the threat they offered us to
covenant saying they would never

00:10:59.259 --> 00:11:03.997
pursue Ed for SDMI ever, just to
stop us from going to the judge

00:11:03.997 --> 00:11:06.232
asking for what's called a
declaratory judgment which is

00:11:06.232 --> 00:11:10.803
when you say, I've got this
threat in writing, they put it

00:11:10.803 --> 00:11:12.805
in writing, I've got this threat
in writing from the record

00:11:12.805 --> 00:11:15.041
industry against my client, my
client has the right to know

00:11:15.041 --> 00:11:17.477
even though they have withdrawn
the threat he had the right to

00:11:17.477 --> 00:11:20.380
know how it would turn out.
Because they had given us

00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:24.584
covenant saying we're never
going to go after Ed, well the

00:11:24.584 --> 00:11:27.020
judge said, you don't have any
standing to ask that question.

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:29.856
Because you know the answer. The
answer is they're never going

00:11:29.856 --> 00:11:34.294
after Ed. There's almost no
litigation history in 1201 which

00:11:34.294 --> 00:11:38.731
works great if your hope that
1201 will intimidate people who

00:11:38.731 --> 00:11:41.935
don't know how a lawsuit might
turn out because there's no case

00:11:41.935 --> 00:11:44.604
law on it. And you want to just
have them stay the hell away

00:11:44.604 --> 00:11:48.074
from anything that interferes
with your dumb Ink jet cartridge

00:11:48.074 --> 00:11:51.945
business model it's a great
situation to be in. Now we do

00:11:51.945 --> 00:11:55.148
have a little bit more case law
and this is actually kind of

00:11:55.148 --> 00:11:57.650
interesting. It's kind of an
interesting example of how the

00:11:57.650 --> 00:12:01.421
Internet of things has changed
the the calculous here in 2004

00:12:01.421 --> 00:12:05.091
there were two companies that
sued over the DMCA one was

00:12:05.091 --> 00:12:09.896
called Lexmark division of IBM
which sued a competitor that was

00:12:09.896 --> 00:12:13.733
refilling Ink jet cartridges and
changing the software in them it

00:12:13.733 --> 00:12:17.003
had a bit that was set that
said, I have been discharged.

00:12:17.003 --> 00:12:20.306
That bit was not supposed to be
settable back to I now full

00:12:20.306 --> 00:12:24.444
again. And they were resetting
that bit to say, I am full. And

00:12:24.444 --> 00:12:27.413
I have never been discharged
they were refilling the

00:12:27.413 --> 00:12:30.216
cartridges. Another one called
Skylink that made garage door

00:12:30.216 --> 00:12:33.519
openers there was third party
company that was making

00:12:33.519 --> 00:12:37.924
replacement handsets to open the
garage door. And in both cases,

00:12:37.924 --> 00:12:40.727
so one was consumeables the
other one was add-ons they went

00:12:40.727 --> 00:12:43.730
to the court, to the federal
circuit who are not known for

00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:47.767
their technological where all
the dumb patent cases are heard

00:12:47.767 --> 00:12:51.938
where we get the worst judgments
out of but they went to the

00:12:51.938 --> 00:12:57.310
federal circuit they said, we
think that 1201 protects us from

00:12:57.310 --> 00:12:59.912
people refilling Ink jet
cartridges, these are copywrited

00:12:59.912 --> 00:13:05.852
ink jet cartridges. I've been
looking for your copyrighted

00:13:09.922 --> 00:13:14.861
work in this I can only find one
the DRM. Like the only code

00:13:14.861 --> 00:13:18.498
running in this thing is the DRM
the DRM is supposed to be

00:13:18.498 --> 00:13:23.903
against the law to remove DRM
that protects that controls

00:13:23.903 --> 00:13:27.840
access to a copyrighted work,
but if the copyrighted work that

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:32.512
the DRM is protecting you
against is the DRM, just feels a

00:13:32.512 --> 00:13:38.017
bit circular. So the judge, he
bounced both of those. Now,

00:13:38.017 --> 00:13:40.286
things have changed since 2004.
Here we are in 2015 and every

00:13:40.286 --> 00:13:42.288
single computerized systemed has
real substantial copyrighted

00:13:42.288 --> 00:13:44.290
works inside of it. Because
these days you don't build like

00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:50.296
PLC or FPGA or special
purpose-based controllers for

00:13:52.498 --> 00:13:58.504
most of our little things,
controllers are so cheap now

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:07.380
that for 60 cents you can buy a
TCPIP stack in an embedded

00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:10.283
controller that you can stick in
your light bulb. And so, why

00:14:10.283 --> 00:14:12.952
would you build something that
was small and light weight and

00:14:12.952 --> 00:14:15.288
didn't have a substantial
copyrighted work in it when you

00:14:15.288 --> 00:14:19.859
can get like some light weight
version of Linux all on chip for

00:14:19.859 --> 00:14:23.629
pennies. Everybody from light
bulbs on up now has a

00:14:23.629 --> 00:14:27.400
copyrighted work inside it. So,
as soon as you add a lock to it,

00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:30.570
it's against the law to remove
that lock because now it's

00:14:30.570 --> 00:14:35.141
protecting access to a real bona
fide copyrighted work beyond the

00:14:35.141 --> 00:14:40.813
DRM itself. That means that we
now have this restriction on

00:14:40.813 --> 00:14:47.787
jail breaking HVA Doctor systems
and insulin pumps and jail

00:14:47.787 --> 00:14:54.060
breaking 747s and jail breaking
IM planted pacemakers and

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:58.131
implanted defibrillators. And it
just keeps going, right? Just

00:14:58.131 --> 00:15:01.534
keep getting more and more
things that are protected by

00:15:01.534 --> 00:15:04.837
digital locks and where it's
against the law to remove those

00:15:04.837 --> 00:15:08.040
locks because someone has used
them to protect a business

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:11.844
model. So those tall willowy
office towers that you see going

00:15:11.844 --> 00:15:15.348
up in the finance districts of
the great cities of the world

00:15:15.348 --> 00:15:17.350
where you look at them you're
like, how the hell does

00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:20.520
something that tall and skinny
stay up. Well they use computer

00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:24.624
controlled dynamic load
adjustment to dynamically

00:15:24.624 --> 00:15:27.794
readjust themselves against
seismic and wind stresses from

00:15:27.794 --> 00:15:32.265
moment to moment. That building
is a case Mod that bankers hang

00:15:32.265 --> 00:15:38.271
out in. And it's protected under
the DMCA. You just saw 1.4

00:15:38.271 --> 00:15:41.507
million Jeeps are recalled
because they could be accessed

00:15:41.507 --> 00:15:46.345
over the Internet and have their
steering and brakes disabled. A

00:15:46.345 --> 00:15:51.851
client ever EFF Chris Roberts,
has claimed that there are ways

00:15:51.851 --> 00:15:57.356
to get into the control systems
of united's planes through it's

00:15:57.356 --> 00:16:01.360
in flight Wi-Fi system. And the
thing about this is that it's

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:05.398
not only crazy for business
purposes, not only is way for

00:16:05.398 --> 00:16:08.134
companies to rip you off by
charging you a lot of money for

00:16:08.134 --> 00:16:11.003
consumeables or locking you out
of features that you might

00:16:11.003 --> 00:16:13.439
otherwise want to have. All
those there's a lot of that.

00:16:13.439 --> 00:16:18.244
Make no mistake. It's also
deadly for security, because we

00:16:18.244 --> 00:16:22.114
have exactly one methodology for
determining whether or not a

00:16:22.114 --> 00:16:26.953
security system works and that's
disclosure and adversarial peer

00:16:26.953 --> 00:16:30.223
review, right? It's when your
friends tell you about the dumb

00:16:30.223 --> 00:16:33.159
mistakes you made and your
enemies make fun ever you for

00:16:33.159 --> 00:16:37.463
having made them, right? And
that methodology if it sounds

00:16:37.463 --> 00:16:40.833
familiar it's because it's the
methodology that we use to go

00:16:40.833 --> 00:16:44.604
from the dark ages to the
enlightenment. Before the

00:16:44.604 --> 00:16:48.207
enlightenment we had one kind of
science, it was called alchemy.

00:16:48.207 --> 00:16:51.010
Alchemist never submitted. They
fell prey to the most frail of

00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:57.917
human frailties our ability to
deceive ourselves about what we

00:16:57.917 --> 00:17:01.354
think we know. So they would
conduct experiments, they would

00:17:01.354 --> 00:17:04.891
go, I think it came out the way
I predicted it would. I'm not

00:17:04.891 --> 00:17:06.893
going to tell anyone else about
it because I've discovered

00:17:06.893 --> 00:17:10.062
something awesome, this is why
every alchemist discovered the

00:17:10.062 --> 00:17:13.933
hardest way possible that
drinking mercury was a bad idea.

00:17:13.933 --> 00:17:16.969
And it wasn't untill alchemist
started publishing and

00:17:16.969 --> 00:17:20.806
submitting to peer review we
found out about the dumb

00:17:20.806 --> 00:17:24.110
mistakes. The entightenment, we
call what came out of it

00:17:24.110 --> 00:17:26.112
science. What we use to
determine whether anything

00:17:26.112 --> 00:17:28.114
works. Why our bridges stand up
and it's why our security stands

00:17:28.114 --> 00:17:30.116
up when it does. It's because we
allow third parties who don't

00:17:30.116 --> 00:17:37.490
like us to look at what -- look
at the stuff that we've done and

00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:40.126
figure out the dumb mistakes
that we've made in order to

00:17:40.126 --> 00:17:42.428
humiliate us in the public
sphere, that's the only

00:17:42.428 --> 00:17:46.065
methodology we have for knowing
whether security works. But

00:17:46.065 --> 00:17:52.038
under 1201, it's against the law
to reveal information that could

00:17:52.038 --> 00:17:56.375
be used to remove a lock. EG
like, where was the key hidden?

00:17:56.375 --> 00:18:01.280
Or there is a buffer overrun. Or
there is -- that makes it

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:04.350
insecure and would allow
adversary to gain access it to

00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:08.721
and override the access controls
built into the system that the

00:18:08.721 --> 00:18:11.490
manufacturer was hoping would be
intact through it's entire duty

00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:15.161
cycle. And what that means is
not that vulnerabilities don't

00:18:15.161 --> 00:18:17.930
exist, they do. And not that
vulnerabilities don't get

00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:20.666
discovered by hostile parties,
they do, one of the things we

00:18:20.666 --> 00:18:24.136
saw when the NSA take tailor
access manual leaked their

00:18:24.136 --> 00:18:27.306
manual of like premade hacks
that field agents can request

00:18:27.306 --> 00:18:33.312
from their I.T. people to use in
the field is that the NSA

00:18:35.348 --> 00:18:39.218
routinely discovers weaponizes
zero days this they use against

00:18:39.218 --> 00:18:42.054
other people and that in
particular those zero days are

00:18:42.054 --> 00:18:44.757
longer lived when they're in
systems where it's against the

00:18:44.757 --> 00:18:47.460
law for independent security
researchers to disclose those

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:52.164
zero days. They last longer. So,
making it illegal to disclose

00:18:52.164 --> 00:18:58.104
doesn't stop those Vones from
discovered or exploited. It just

00:18:58.104 --> 00:19:03.376
makes it harder for normal
people who don't anticipate

00:19:03.376 --> 00:19:06.812
Vones in the systems that they
rely on for life and limb from

00:19:06.812 --> 00:19:10.282
being discovered. Because after
all, your phone is more than a

00:19:10.282 --> 00:19:14.120
super computer and your pocket
that you use to throw pigs at

00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:17.323
birds, right? Your phone is a
super computer in your pocket

00:19:17.323 --> 00:19:20.760
that knows who all your friends
are, and knows what you talk --

00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:24.130
where you are, where you go, and
it knows how your banker and you

00:19:24.130 --> 00:19:26.565
talk to each other and
authenticate your conversations,

00:19:26.565 --> 00:19:29.201
how your lawyer and you talk to
each other and authenticate

00:19:29.201 --> 00:19:33.072
conversation, is that maybe off
token to your house's front door

00:19:33.072 --> 00:19:37.443
lock and your car it has a
microphone and only way you can

00:19:37.443 --> 00:19:41.013
know whether those are on or off
is if the phone security model

00:19:41.013 --> 00:19:44.583
is intact. Otherwise, the camera
and microphone could be covertly

00:19:44.583 --> 00:19:48.788
operated and making it against
the law to tell you about Vones

00:19:48.788 --> 00:19:51.457
in that phone to make sure sure
that you don't run software that

00:19:51.457 --> 00:19:54.660
didn't come from the
manufacturer's app store, is

00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:57.830
grotesque not just because it
rips off independent software

00:19:57.830 --> 00:20:00.966
vendors and limits innovation
it's grotesque because it puts

00:20:00.966 --> 00:20:04.670
you at risk in every conceivable
way from asshole to appetite. Of

00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:09.709
vulnerabilities being discovered
and festering and being used to

00:20:09.709 --> 00:20:13.345
exploit you. Every three years
the copyright office olds these

00:20:13.345 --> 00:20:17.583
hearings on 1201 where they ask,
are there any ways that 1201 is

00:20:17.583 --> 00:20:21.153
like getting in people's -- and
should we grant an exemption up

00:20:21.153 --> 00:20:24.223
till the next hearing. They just
concluded one you probably heard

00:20:24.223 --> 00:20:28.728
couple of examples from it, for
example, John Deere tractors a

00:20:28.728 --> 00:20:35.334
farmer put forward a petition to
allow him to jail break his John

00:20:35.334 --> 00:20:38.003
Deere tractor, the story went
that he was getting out there to

00:20:38.003 --> 00:20:40.940
Till the fields with his John
Deere tractor and it wouldn't

00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:45.010
run, he called tech support, and
they said, yeah, looks like the

00:20:45.010 --> 00:20:49.515
inflations sensor on one of your
tires has gone south, we can

00:20:49.515 --> 00:20:53.052
dispatch a part in a couple of
days, he said the tire is fine,

00:20:53.052 --> 00:20:55.654
can I just go into the firmware
disabled that sensor, no, you

00:20:55.654 --> 00:20:59.625
can't. He said well I really
want to be able to track that,

00:20:59.625 --> 00:21:02.128
John Deere doesn't really care
whether or not you tweak it what

00:21:02.128 --> 00:21:05.765
they do care about the fact that
they do send a meter accurate

00:21:05.765 --> 00:21:10.136
soil density surveys through the
torque sensors in the wheels

00:21:10.136 --> 00:21:13.772
while you're tilling your fields
and they sell that information

00:21:13.772 --> 00:21:17.309
to seed companies like Monsanto
but not to the farmer. The only

00:21:17.309 --> 00:21:21.413
way for the farmer to know about
her fields' soil density is to

00:21:21.413 --> 00:21:25.217
pay the seed company and
covenant only to use that seed

00:21:25.217 --> 00:21:28.287
company's seeds. They went to
the copyright office said we

00:21:28.287 --> 00:21:30.589
want to jail break our Monsanto
tractors -- our John Deere

00:21:30.589 --> 00:21:32.591
tractors and John Deere came
back and said, no, that's not

00:21:32.591 --> 00:21:35.461
your tractor, it's our tractor,
you've only been licensed the

00:21:35.461 --> 00:21:38.330
tractor, it's copyrighted work.
In case there was any doubt,

00:21:38.330 --> 00:21:44.336
G.M. uses this to lock mechanics
out of their cars because they

00:21:46.505 --> 00:21:49.341
want to make sure that only
mechanics who sign a contract

00:21:49.341 --> 00:21:53.145
that says, I buy original G.M.
parts, that we charge major mark

00:21:53.145 --> 00:21:57.550
ups on and not third party parts
that only those people can get

00:21:57.550 --> 00:22:02.254
diagnostics off the motor and
so, G.M. filed petition whose

00:22:02.254 --> 00:22:05.124
bakes summary was, you remember
that ad where we said that's not

00:22:05.124 --> 00:22:08.294
your father's Oldsmobile, we
weren't speaking metaphoricly,

00:22:08.294 --> 00:22:15.234
right? So, if you want to read
stuff that will make the hair on

00:22:15.234 --> 00:22:19.205
the back of your neck stand up,
look up 2015 copyright office

00:22:19.205 --> 00:22:22.841
1201 tri-anial proceedings, read
what the security researchers

00:22:22.841 --> 00:22:26.078
wrote how this stuff getting in
their way. Guy name Jay

00:22:26.078 --> 00:22:29.548
Radcliffe who is security
research erat rapid 7 also a

00:22:29.548 --> 00:22:33.118
type 1 diabetic. If you're a
type 1 diabetic you get insulin

00:22:33.118 --> 00:22:36.355
pump instead of relying on human
beings who are after all the

00:22:36.355 --> 00:22:40.492
shitiest lab techs to figure out
when you need more. You get an

00:22:40.492 --> 00:22:43.729
insulin pump, it means that your
insulin dose is titrated very

00:22:43.729 --> 00:22:46.632
carefully and very tight ly
through the day and really good;

00:22:46.632 --> 00:22:53.172
lock step with your blood sugar
you live many more years. But

00:22:53.172 --> 00:22:56.342
Jay Radcliffe has audited the
insulin pumps he won't get one.

00:22:56.342 --> 00:23:00.646
He is prepared to sacrifice
years off his life to not get

00:23:00.646 --> 00:23:04.316
one because he knows what the
wireless interface in this thing

00:23:04.316 --> 00:23:08.053
can get access. To and after
all, insulin can be fatally

00:23:08.053 --> 00:23:12.358
overdosed on pretty trivially.
He won't get a type 1 he reports

00:23:12.358 --> 00:23:16.328
on this. Also said he's audited
a bunch of other medical devices

00:23:16.328 --> 00:23:19.665
he estimates that 40% of the
code in implanted medical

00:23:19.665 --> 00:23:22.401
devices has never been audited.
Also heard from security

00:23:22.401 --> 00:23:25.204
presearchers who work on voting
machines, they say that voting

00:23:25.204 --> 00:23:27.439
machines are horrifically
insecure but because they have a

00:23:27.439 --> 00:23:30.175
lock that protects access to a
copyrighted work they can't tell

00:23:30.175 --> 00:23:32.478
the people who are proceed
during them for their local

00:23:32.478 --> 00:23:36.181
elections about the
vulnerabilities in them. The

00:23:36.181 --> 00:23:38.550
most hair raising thing in it
was there's a security

00:23:38.550 --> 00:23:41.620
researcher, we don't know which
one there's a filing from about

00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:45.457
half a dozen super eminent, ivy
league, big ten security

00:23:45.457 --> 00:23:49.395
researchers and in their filing
they said, one of us, not naming

00:23:49.395 --> 00:23:54.600
any names, has been advised by
counsel not to tell you what

00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:59.104
area she or he works in because
merely disclosing that counsel

00:23:59.104 --> 00:24:04.143
believes will bring 1201 action
against him or her, right? This

00:24:04.143 --> 00:24:09.948
is the first rule of 1201 club
you don't talk about 1201 club.

00:24:09.948 --> 00:24:13.719
Internet of things investors are
really big on this 1201 stuff

00:24:13.719 --> 00:24:18.324
they all want these devices to
ship with ecosystems, lock in,

00:24:18.324 --> 00:24:22.828
lock in for add-ons, lock in for
consumeables. And in a real

00:24:22.828 --> 00:24:26.298
market where like that lock in
can be broken, this stuff

00:24:26.298 --> 00:24:30.936
doesn't work, right? Keurig put
a lock on the 2.0 coffee pod

00:24:30.936 --> 00:24:34.239
machines you can only buy coffee
pods from Keurig not from

00:24:34.239 --> 00:24:37.810
competitors. They lost 25% of
their market share in the first

00:24:37.810 --> 00:24:40.279
year. They did an investor call
where the CEO had to eat his hat

00:24:40.279 --> 00:24:44.650
and say, we made a really dumb
mistake. Because like nobody

00:24:44.650 --> 00:24:50.389
woke up this morning said, gosh,
I wish there were fewer vendors

00:24:50.389 --> 00:24:54.860
who could supply software for my
cochlear implant or fewer ways

00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:58.163
that I can read my E-books or
fewer people who would sell me

00:24:58.163 --> 00:25:01.367
coffee for my coffee pod
machine. The absence of one of

00:25:01.367 --> 00:25:08.540
these things there's no way that
you can work. But in 2015 we now

00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:12.845
have a system where by this
competition is harder and harder

00:25:12.845 --> 00:25:17.649
to come by. The future looks
pretty grim in terms of 1201 how

00:25:17.649 --> 00:25:22.054
it interacts with the Internet
of things. Like, I'm working on

00:25:22.054 --> 00:25:25.557
a catalog of design fiction,
ideas about what kind of devices

00:25:25.557 --> 00:25:29.561
we don't have and should have or
might see in the future as a

00:25:29.561 --> 00:25:32.531
result of 1201 called the
catalog of missing devices. One

00:25:32.531 --> 00:25:36.468
of the ideas that our UX
futurist types came up with is

00:25:36.468 --> 00:25:39.605
product that unlocks your fridge
so it can chill third party

00:25:39.605 --> 00:25:45.310
butter. But you know, I told you
about those sub prime cars,

00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:47.679
there's another really
interesting example of where the

00:25:47.679 --> 00:25:51.083
Internet of things is headed.
There's a guy named Hugh Hare

00:25:51.083 --> 00:25:55.254
who runs the prosthetics lab at
the MIT media lab. I'm a words

00:25:55.254 --> 00:25:59.224
guy, he's got pictures, awesome
slides. I'm like PowerPoint

00:25:59.224 --> 00:26:02.895
corrupt I never use pictures.
He's got awesome slides of all

00:26:02.895 --> 00:26:05.330
of the ways the computers have
been woven tightly into -- to

00:26:05.330 --> 00:26:08.100
improve their lives in IM
measurable ways, hands and feet

00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:13.005
and neural prosthesis that use
very powerful magnets to

00:26:13.005 --> 00:26:15.574
suppress activity in parts of
the brain that cause otherwise

00:26:15.574 --> 00:26:19.678
untreatable depression. And so
Hare I saw him do this talk,

00:26:19.678 --> 00:26:23.949
amazing, he shows us slides the
last slide is him. He's clinging

00:26:23.949 --> 00:26:27.553
to the side of a mountain like a
gecko he's all in Gortex, super

00:26:27.553 --> 00:26:32.057
ripped. You can see from the
knees down he's just got stumps.

00:26:32.057 --> 00:26:35.127
His stumps are in these great
robotic mountain climbing

00:26:35.127 --> 00:26:38.597
prosthesis. He's been standing
here like this the whole time.

00:26:38.597 --> 00:26:41.066
He says, didn't I mention,
right? Like forget one more

00:26:41.066 --> 00:26:44.570
thing in Steve Jobs, didn't I
mention, rolls up his pants leg

00:26:44.570 --> 00:26:48.774
he's robot from the leg down. He
starts running up and down the

00:26:48.774 --> 00:26:52.044
stage like a mountain goat.
Leaping into the air. It's

00:26:52.044 --> 00:26:55.280
incredible, best demo I've seen.
First question anyone asks, was

00:26:55.280 --> 00:27:00.052
how much did your legs cost? He
names a price you could buy like

00:27:00.052 --> 00:27:05.491
a house in mayfair or brownstone
on lower east side. The second

00:27:05.491 --> 00:27:08.393
question anyone asks, who can
afford those legs? He said, of

00:27:08.393 --> 00:27:11.964
course anyone can afford those
legs if it's a choice between 60

00:27:11.964 --> 00:27:14.733
year mortgage to get your house
and 60 year mortgage to have

00:27:14.733 --> 00:27:17.169
legs, everyone is going to pick
the legs all day long which I

00:27:17.169 --> 00:27:21.573
think is probably true. When you
combine sub prime immobilizers

00:27:21.573 --> 00:27:27.112
and legs you get somewhere very
ugly, right? When you miss the

00:27:27.112 --> 00:27:31.984
payment, the legs walk you back
to the repo depot to take them

00:27:31.984 --> 00:27:35.821
back. Anyone who pawns those
legs because it's again the law

00:27:35.821 --> 00:27:41.960
can make your legs take you
anywhere they want. So, EFF

00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:47.499
loves litigating stupid tech
laws. This is one of our secret

00:27:47.499 --> 00:27:53.105
super powers that I think a lot
of people don't appreciate.

00:27:53.105 --> 00:27:58.243
America has this amazing back
door to its legislative system.

00:27:58.243 --> 00:28:01.113
In other countries without
strong constitutional traditions

00:28:01.113 --> 00:28:03.549
the way that it works is
lawmakers make an incredibly

00:28:03.549 --> 00:28:07.052
stupid law then you have to wait
until there's now lawmakers and

00:28:07.052 --> 00:28:09.855
enough of them to make that law
go away. You have to bring

00:28:09.855 --> 00:28:11.990
pressure against them. You have
to get majority of those law

00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:15.661
makers to change that law. But
because America has independent

00:28:15.661 --> 00:28:18.797
judiciary and strong
constitutional tradition, in

00:28:18.797 --> 00:28:22.801
America if you can just convince
enough federal judges, some

00:28:22.801 --> 00:28:26.271
times only one, that a law
violates the constitution they

00:28:26.271 --> 00:28:29.474
can make the law go away. This
ha has down sides because law

00:28:29.474 --> 00:28:31.543
makers can make dumb laws
knowing it's good red meat for

00:28:31.543 --> 00:28:35.681
the base, the judges will make
them go away before they cause

00:28:35.681 --> 00:28:39.418
too much harm. On balance it
means that we get a legislative

00:28:39.418 --> 00:28:42.621
second resort in the courts. And
that means that when you have

00:28:42.621 --> 00:28:47.025
audiological blindness in
congress to bad technology

00:28:47.025 --> 00:28:51.230
ideas, if we can get the right
defendant in front of a judge,

00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:54.666
we can make the fact that
congress is full of people who

00:28:54.666 --> 00:28:56.702
don't understand technology
irrelevant to the legislative

00:28:56.702 --> 00:28:59.605
landscape. So our best example
of this was Bernstein. Some of

00:28:59.605 --> 00:29:02.574
you probably know about
Bernstein. In the early '90s

00:29:02.574 --> 00:29:06.912
government had this weird idea
hard time imagining that anyone

00:29:06.912 --> 00:29:11.149
had this idea civilians couldn't
have access to crypto. Kind of

00:29:11.149 --> 00:29:14.453
crazy idea. Amazing that anyone
could have ever had that really

00:29:14.453 --> 00:29:17.289
dumb idea back in the early '90s
for those of you who don't know

00:29:17.289 --> 00:29:22.561
this has come back in 2015, FBI
wants to ban civilian access to

00:29:22.561 --> 00:29:24.963
crypto. The NSA had this idea
that civilians shouldn't be able

00:29:24.963 --> 00:29:28.867
to use crypto, they class it as
munition, made it illegal to

00:29:28.867 --> 00:29:33.605
traffic in strong crypto. And
people made lots of arguments in

00:29:33.605 --> 00:29:37.709
front of congress about why this
was dumb. John Gilmore one of

00:29:37.709 --> 00:29:40.379
the EFF's founders and employee
number six one of the principal

00:29:40.379 --> 00:29:43.482
authors of GCC and Solaris, he
made a computer that was

00:29:43.482 --> 00:29:50.856
optimized for brute forcing Dez
50 the cipher that the NSA said.

00:29:50.856 --> 00:29:54.159
For quarter million dollars he
made computer that could exhaust

00:29:54.159 --> 00:29:58.930
Des 50 in two hours. He said
this is like the entire American

00:29:58.930 --> 00:30:01.600
banking system can be beat for
250 grand with this thing the

00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:07.105
size of a bar fridge by a guy
who looks like a hippie, right?

00:30:09.274 --> 00:30:11.510
Congress said, yeah, that's very
nice. Why don't you leave now.

00:30:11.510 --> 00:30:14.579
We made arguments about
international competitiveness,

00:30:14.579 --> 00:30:18.083
economists joined on, nobody
cared. Then we found Daniel J.

00:30:18.083 --> 00:30:21.887
Bernstein may know today at DJM
an eminent cryptographer,

00:30:21.887 --> 00:30:28.427
professor at UC Berkeley, grad
student, who is publishing

00:30:28.427 --> 00:30:34.566
strong ciphers on usenet.
Remember usenet? We argued that

00:30:34.566 --> 00:30:36.735
his source code was form of
speech. That programmers had

00:30:36.735 --> 00:30:43.108
first amendment right to publish
source. In the 9th circuit

00:30:43.108 --> 00:30:47.446
appellate said you're absolutely
right. Congress is wrong.

00:30:47.446 --> 00:30:50.282
Whether or not this should be
classes of munition, classing it

00:30:50.282 --> 00:30:53.752
as munition violates the first
amendment and we can have strong

00:30:53.752 --> 00:30:57.556
crypto that's how we got crypto.
That's how we got here today. We

00:30:57.556 --> 00:31:03.495
love -- [ applause ] We love
litigating bad laws with good

00:31:05.697 --> 00:31:12.270
clients. Watching this stuff
happen, I left EFF about ten

00:31:12.270 --> 00:31:16.708
years ago to go be a novelist
make up stories to help you pass

00:31:16.708 --> 00:31:20.145
along boring hours between the
cradle and the grave. And after

00:31:20.145 --> 00:31:23.248
about ten years of that, I
looked around at this stuff

00:31:23.248 --> 00:31:26.918
said, like, this is dire. Like,
as much as I'm interested in

00:31:26.918 --> 00:31:30.455
making sure that, you know, I
can live the Cushy glamorous

00:31:30.455 --> 00:31:34.926
life of science fiction writer I
also don't want my daughter

00:31:34.926 --> 00:31:38.730
growing up in a world that like
makes Dystopian science fiction

00:31:38.730 --> 00:31:43.168
book like my little pony
episode. I came back to EFF to

00:31:43.168 --> 00:31:46.605
work on a project that we call
Apollo 1201. It's a mission to

00:31:46.605 --> 00:31:53.311
kill all the DRM in the world
within a decade. [Applause]

00:31:53.311 --> 00:31:59.317
We're going to do it with your
help. Because we know that

00:32:02.521 --> 00:32:05.123
people in this room, people who
come to this conference, people

00:32:05.123 --> 00:32:09.194
who work in this field, violate
1201 all day long. It's

00:32:09.194 --> 00:32:11.797
impossible to do security
research without doing it. But

00:32:11.797 --> 00:32:14.900
it's the love that dare not
speak its name. We have a pact

00:32:14.900 --> 00:32:19.404
effectively with the people who
want to defend 1201 and keep it

00:32:19.404 --> 00:32:22.474
intact. It's that security
researchers just don't make a

00:32:22.474 --> 00:32:26.578
big deal out of the 1201. Like
they research mobile malware,

00:32:26.578 --> 00:32:31.817
the paper starts with, I got
some apps. They don't say, I

00:32:31.817 --> 00:32:34.419
took a jail broken phone
decrypted a bunch of apps in

00:32:34.419 --> 00:32:37.656
memory just say, I got apps.
Then I discovered this

00:32:37.656 --> 00:32:40.625
interesting thing. So long as
nobody talks about it too

00:32:40.625 --> 00:32:44.196
plowedly the other side doesn't
come back and everybody kind of

00:32:44.196 --> 00:32:48.099
trundles along. But meanwhile,
devices that we rely on every

00:32:48.099 --> 00:32:51.403
day become reservoirs of long
lived digital pathogens that

00:32:51.403 --> 00:32:56.875
threaten you, me and everybody
we love. So, we want to talk to

00:32:56.875 --> 00:32:59.644
you about this stuffer as they
said in "Oceans 11" we're

00:32:59.644 --> 00:33:03.381
putting together a team. We want
to know about the work that

00:33:03.381 --> 00:33:05.784
you're doing. We want to know in
particular when you're scared

00:33:05.784 --> 00:33:10.288
about 1201, we want to help you
figure out how to structure that

00:33:10.288 --> 00:33:13.325
research so that it's as
litigation hardened as possible.

00:33:13.325 --> 00:33:16.661
So that if you decide that a
critical piece of your presearch

00:33:16.661 --> 00:33:19.965
is describing the 1201 elements
or someone on the other side

00:33:19.965 --> 00:33:22.434
decides they want to make an
example of you and put your head

00:33:22.434 --> 00:33:25.036
on a pke the way that your
research is structured to

00:33:25.036 --> 00:33:28.773
optimized for making sure that
the judgment that comes out of

00:33:28.773 --> 00:33:32.110
it is a shining beacon on a hill
for everyone else who is

00:33:32.110 --> 00:33:36.381
thinking about 1201 not a
terrifying icon of how bad it is

00:33:38.583 --> 00:33:40.886
when you go up against the
machine. We want to make this

00:33:40.886 --> 00:33:45.590
structured in such a way that
1201 eventually goes away

00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:51.062
altogether because with 12301
gone DRM goes, too. Right? And

00:33:51.062 --> 00:33:57.702
once it's not illegal to
eliminate DRM, people will

00:33:57.702 --> 00:34:00.939
eliminate DRM because DRM is
only used to protect high

00:34:00.939 --> 00:34:05.210
margins and as Jeff Bezos said
in alarming candor to book push,

00:34:05.210 --> 00:34:09.014
your margin is in my
opportunity. Everyone of those

00:34:09.014 --> 00:34:12.484
stores that's taking 30% out of
the hide of software vendors, is

00:34:12.484 --> 00:34:15.987
ripe to be disrupted by someone
who makes another store if that

00:34:15.987 --> 00:34:20.258
takes 20% out of their hides or
10% or monetizes it different by

00:34:20.258 --> 00:34:23.628
everything some kind ever
platform strategy. Every device

00:34:23.628 --> 00:34:26.131
that has high priced
consumableful. Every John Deere

00:34:26.131 --> 00:34:29.100
tractor selling information back
to farmers that they're

00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:31.236
generating by driving their own
tractors around the field ever

00:34:31.236 --> 00:34:33.238
one is market opportunity. And
everyone of those will be taken

00:34:33.238 --> 00:34:39.744
advantage of in the DRM will
disappear as soon as the status

00:34:39.744 --> 00:34:43.648
of DRM is legally ambiguous or
positive for people who break

00:34:43.648 --> 00:34:49.287
it. It's not hard to break DRM.
Hiding devices that are owned by

00:34:49.287 --> 00:34:51.289
that keeping -- that you leave
in the bank robber's house is a

00:34:51.289 --> 00:34:56.795
bad idea. Right? Even leave
those keys will always be

00:34:56.795 --> 00:35:02.734
subject to interrogation.
Remember in DRM crypto you don't

00:35:04.936 --> 00:35:08.073
have Alice and Bob and Carol.
You have Alice and Bob. Bob

00:35:08.073 --> 00:35:11.443
gives a listen ciphered message,
has the key, then Bob crosses

00:35:11.443 --> 00:35:16.114
his fingers and hope that Alice
never figures out where the key

00:35:16.114 --> 00:35:20.819
is and puts it in another device
that does things Bob doesn't

00:35:20.819 --> 00:35:23.888
like. That is the wishful
thinking business model is the

00:35:23.888 --> 00:35:26.992
-- of crypto. It doesn't work.
[Applause] So, here is my pitch

00:35:26.992 --> 00:35:28.994
to you. If you're a hacker
you're doing security research,

00:35:28.994 --> 00:35:35.000
come and talk to us I'm real
easy to find the first Cory in

00:35:41.072 --> 00:35:45.510
Google. I'm Cory, the first
result is my homepage one e-mail

00:35:45.510 --> 00:35:48.380
address on it. The same e-mail
address my mom and my wife use

00:35:48.380 --> 00:35:51.883
to get in touch with me. E-mail
tell me about your 1201 stuff we

00:35:51.883 --> 00:35:55.687
want to talk to you figure out
how we can help you or if we can

00:35:55.687 --> 00:35:59.591
help you talk about the contours
of the law and give you good

00:35:59.591 --> 00:36:02.861
surprise. Thing we've been doing
for 25 years now we're awesome

00:36:02.861 --> 00:36:06.765
at it. But if you're a designer,
if you are UX person those

00:36:06.765 --> 00:36:10.702
people come to -- get in touch
with me about the catalog of

00:36:10.702 --> 00:36:12.804
missing devices because we're
putting together design

00:36:12.804 --> 00:36:16.941
intervention as part of the 1201
project so help people start to

00:36:16.941 --> 00:36:19.778
realize what's missessing
because of 1201. This is an

00:36:19.778 --> 00:36:22.313
under appreciated fact about
1201 that there are all these

00:36:22.313 --> 00:36:25.850
devices missing from the field
it's hard to notice what's not

00:36:25.850 --> 00:36:28.953
there. With the patent fight,
there's a device everybody

00:36:28.953 --> 00:36:32.557
loves, some patent troll has a
dumb patent they make that

00:36:32.557 --> 00:36:38.930
device disappear, everybody gets
angry. But with DMCA1201 the

00:36:38.930 --> 00:36:41.633
device just never shows up in
the field and people don't even

00:36:41.633 --> 00:36:44.536
notice it's there they assume
that maybe it's like physics. Is

00:36:44.536 --> 00:36:47.272
the reason that you stick a CD
in your computer and the

00:36:47.272 --> 00:36:50.108
computer wakes up and runs some
manufacturer supplied software

00:36:50.108 --> 00:36:53.278
that mixes and burns your CD to
put on your mobile device but

00:36:53.278 --> 00:36:55.780
you stick a DVD in all it let's
you do is same thing that you

00:36:55.780 --> 00:36:59.517
could do with it in 1996 and
watch it. People are like, I

00:36:59.517 --> 00:37:02.921
guess there must be something
like technically impossible

00:37:02.921 --> 00:37:06.791
about doing more stuff with DVDs
we're making this catalog of all

00:37:06.791 --> 00:37:12.063
the stuff that was stolen from
your future. If you're into this

00:37:12.063 --> 00:37:14.899
stuff, if you're a UX or UI
designer, product designer get

00:37:14.899 --> 00:37:18.336
in touch with me talk to me
about contributing to the

00:37:18.336 --> 00:37:22.140
catalog of missing devices. We
can also offer you tax receipts

00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:25.043
for the consulting that you do
on this stuff. For the value of

00:37:25.043 --> 00:37:27.679
your consulting because we're
501(c)3 lots of ways to make

00:37:27.679 --> 00:37:32.183
this good for names who want to
work on it with us we'll also

00:37:32.183 --> 00:37:34.886
make sure that you get credit
and be help can out an important

00:37:34.886 --> 00:37:39.624
way. Then my last plead to all
of you is, if you're a W3C, the

00:37:39.624 --> 00:37:44.596
worldwide web consortium or work
for a company that is a member

00:37:44.596 --> 00:37:49.534
of the consortium get in touch
with me because it took the

00:37:49.534 --> 00:37:53.638
dangerous and awful step of
adding DRM to the realm of

00:37:53.638 --> 00:37:56.574
technologies that they're
willing to standardize for the

00:37:56.574 --> 00:38:01.112
web. Which means that our
web-based frontends which are

00:38:01.112 --> 00:38:04.883
supposed to replace plug-in
based or app-based front ends

00:38:04.883 --> 00:38:09.053
for everything from our pace
makers to our thermostats, will

00:38:09.053 --> 00:38:12.056
all have components that are
unlawful to report

00:38:12.056 --> 00:38:15.093
vulnerabilities in and will thus
be subject to having those

00:38:15.093 --> 00:38:18.963
vulnerabilities fester in them.
We have a project to reform the

00:38:18.963 --> 00:38:22.967
way that the W3C deals with it
if you're involved with the W3C

00:38:22.967 --> 00:38:27.205
I want to hear from you. So the
DMCA has been festering since

00:38:27.205 --> 00:38:31.543
1998 it's unsightly boil on the
American legal system and it's

00:38:31.543 --> 00:38:34.112
spread ail over the world thanks
to the U.S. trade

00:38:34.112 --> 00:38:37.682
representative. And as it stops
being enforced in America,

00:38:37.682 --> 00:38:41.052
everyone of the countries that
has adopted their own version of

00:38:41.052 --> 00:38:45.523
1201, at the behest of this
government, will be poised to

00:38:45.523 --> 00:38:48.726
remove their own 1201 laws
because after all if you're in a

00:38:48.726 --> 00:38:51.996
suicide pact and other guys
backs out, we won't make these

00:38:51.996 --> 00:38:56.834
products it's natural for you to
want to back out, too. With your

00:38:56.834 --> 00:39:00.672
help we're going to squeeze this
eZit for every and everywhere in

00:39:00.672 --> 00:39:06.678
the world. Thank you. [ Applause
] I have about ten minutes for

00:39:10.648 --> 00:39:16.921
Q&A? Ten minutes for Q&A? I
don't know if we have Mics I can

00:39:16.921 --> 00:39:20.725
repeat the questions. I remind
you a long rambling statement

00:39:20.725 --> 00:39:22.961
followed by what you think that
have isn't is a question but not

00:39:22.961 --> 00:39:27.432
a good one. I will at between
people who identify as women or

00:39:27.432 --> 00:39:29.968
non-binary and men because
otherwise the Q&A is us a the

00:39:29.968 --> 00:39:35.974
sausage fest. So, go! Yes. [
inaudible ] Right. So the

00:39:58.863 --> 00:40:01.266
question is, are there still
cases where DRM works like for

00:40:01.266 --> 00:40:03.334
example, subsidy consoles,
right, where they sell the

00:40:03.334 --> 00:40:08.906
console below cost then they use
games and money from the games

00:40:08.906 --> 00:40:14.545
to realize a recoupment on those
costs. Or other models where I

00:40:14.545 --> 00:40:16.748
take a picture I send it to you
but I want to make sure you

00:40:16.748 --> 00:40:20.919
don't share it on. How do I do
that without DRM. And I think

00:40:20.919 --> 00:40:22.920
that those are two separate
cases I'm going to take them

00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:26.758
separately. In the second case
the snap chat case that only

00:40:26.758 --> 00:40:30.862
works -- what snap chat is good
for or all those other

00:40:30.862 --> 00:40:34.265
disappearing ink tools are good
for is a system in which you

00:40:34.265 --> 00:40:38.336
trust the other party but you
don't trust their Opsec you say,

00:40:38.336 --> 00:40:41.572
we're going to share a document
we're both going to delete it

00:40:41.572 --> 00:40:44.742
after we've looked at it, but
sometimes you forget because

00:40:44.742 --> 00:40:50.248
human beings are crappy
computers, right? That works

00:40:50.248 --> 00:40:54.118
really well, right? Auto
enforcing opsec, great. Totally

00:40:54.118 --> 00:40:57.221
terrible at stopping people you
don't trust from sharing

00:40:57.221 --> 00:41:00.758
information that you shared with
them asked them not to share on.

00:41:00.758 --> 00:41:04.929
Because if you send me a photo
to my device like at bare

00:41:04.929 --> 00:41:08.166
minimum I can take a picture
much it. But also it's my device

00:41:08.166 --> 00:41:11.936
you've hidden some keys in it
then expect I'm not going to

00:41:11.936 --> 00:41:16.708
find it again we're back to
wishful thinking, right? So like

00:41:16.708 --> 00:41:18.710
would the world be a better
place if we could figure out how

00:41:18.710 --> 00:41:22.280
to turn off gravityf someone
with chronic back pain, yes. But

00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:25.616
like are we going to defend
things that don't have any nexus

00:41:25.616 --> 00:41:29.787
with turning on gravity but let
people pretend that we do and

00:41:29.787 --> 00:41:33.324
have all these horrible side
effects, no. As to like protect

00:41:33.324 --> 00:41:36.928
subsidy hardware by allowing the
state to like spend unlimited

00:41:36.928 --> 00:41:39.931
number of tax dollars to
prosecute people who do

00:41:39.931 --> 00:41:44.602
otherwise lawful things to that
subsidy hardware, I guess the

00:41:44.602 --> 00:41:47.271
answer is, whether or not you
think the state should be

00:41:47.271 --> 00:41:51.242
deciding which business models
work. And I think that we have

00:41:51.242 --> 00:41:54.278
lots of hardware that works
without subsidy, like nobody

00:41:54.278 --> 00:41:57.181
came down off of mountain with
two stone tablets that said the

00:41:57.181 --> 00:42:00.585
only way a console shall ever be
monetized is through discount

00:42:00.585 --> 00:42:03.888
hardware. And in the games world
it's especially interesting

00:42:03.888 --> 00:42:07.959
because the games world has got
long history of not being

00:42:07.959 --> 00:42:11.829
protected by law. So back in the
days of sloppy -- flop fee and

00:42:11.829 --> 00:42:14.565
CD the games industry were one
of the first major

00:42:14.565 --> 00:42:18.703
constituencies to go to the law
bodies say are, we're being

00:42:18.703 --> 00:42:22.140
pirated into the ground. Of
course, lawmakers hated the

00:42:22.140 --> 00:42:25.243
games industry so their response
was, that's awesome. So the

00:42:25.243 --> 00:42:27.245
games industry invented
network-based play, like war

00:42:27.245 --> 00:42:29.247
craft which became larger than
all of the other games ever

00:42:29.247 --> 00:42:31.249
invented. So they will adapt or
die. We have video games before

00:42:31.249 --> 00:42:33.251
we had subsidy hardware, we'll
have video games after subsidy

00:42:33.251 --> 00:42:39.257
hardware, if the question is do
we get to know about

00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:45.062
vulnerabilities and consoles in
our living rooms with cameras or

00:42:45.062 --> 00:42:52.437
subsidy hardware for Mario
reboots, I'll take the knowing

00:42:52.437 --> 00:43:00.011
about the vones and cameras. Any
people who identify as women or

00:43:00.011 --> 00:43:06.017
non-binary like to ask the next
question? Anyone? Any dudes who

00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:15.426
would like to ask a question. >>
There's been discussion applying

00:43:18.129 --> 00:43:23.034
DRM to allow people to protect
their private information when

00:43:23.034 --> 00:43:27.338
they share it with a website or
some sort of a service. Can you

00:43:27.338 --> 00:43:32.343
comment on how -- what you think
about that. >> What about IRM

00:43:32.343 --> 00:43:34.812
which is what this is called
when Microsoft first launched

00:43:34.812 --> 00:43:37.782
it. Information rights
management. The ideas I encrypt

00:43:37.782 --> 00:43:41.986
the data, I send it to you, you
have a client that has the keys

00:43:41.986 --> 00:43:44.956
to decrypt it, the client looks
for business rules that come

00:43:44.956 --> 00:43:48.059
along with encrypted document
like no print, no forward, no

00:43:48.059 --> 00:43:51.529
view after six hours. And then
either obeys those rules or

00:43:51.529 --> 00:43:57.335
obeys those rules enforces those
rules against you. So, again,

00:43:57.335 --> 00:44:00.838
this is a great tool inside a
firm if you want to make sure

00:44:00.838 --> 00:44:04.175
that opsec happens
automatically. Like if the thing

00:44:04.175 --> 00:44:07.612
is that you and I have agreed
that after we both looked at

00:44:07.612 --> 00:44:10.381
this document and dispensed with
it we're not going to retain it,

00:44:10.381 --> 00:44:13.284
like a seven-year document
retention window want to dispose

00:44:13.284 --> 00:44:16.654
of everything after seven years,
so ever a lawsuit against us

00:44:16.654 --> 00:44:20.791
discovery process won't involve
old documents we forgot to get

00:44:20.791 --> 00:44:26.097
rid of that we have to pay
counsel $400 an hour to view,

00:44:26.097 --> 00:44:30.935
great tool. The idea like, I'm a
giant company based in either

00:44:30.935 --> 00:44:34.505
mountain view or Redmond or
Cupertino and you are going to

00:44:34.505 --> 00:44:38.009
send me a bunch of personal
identifying compromising

00:44:38.009 --> 00:44:43.548
information, but you're going to
like lock it up with DRM that I

00:44:43.548 --> 00:44:48.953
will run the client that you
trust and I'll make sure that --

00:44:48.953 --> 00:44:52.456
that software will make sure
that I never do anything

00:44:52.456 --> 00:44:55.793
untoward with it. That seems
really -- like technologically

00:44:55.793 --> 00:44:58.462
IM plausible we're back to like,
it would be awesome if gravity

00:44:58.462 --> 00:45:02.967
didn't work sometimes. If you
don't trust your adversary and

00:45:02.967 --> 00:45:06.671
you send them both the keys to
decrypt the document and the

00:45:06.671 --> 00:45:09.640
document, then you ask them
nicely not to do bad things with

00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:12.310
that information, it seems
really unlikely that that will

00:45:12.310 --> 00:45:17.648
work, right? Like we have
attacks on DRM encrypted E-books

00:45:17.648 --> 00:45:24.188
that are totally non-encryption
breaking, like screen scripting,

00:45:24.188 --> 00:45:27.525
where you just run a screen
scripting toolkit that just

00:45:27.525 --> 00:45:32.997
advances the page once a second
screen shots predictable

00:45:32.997 --> 00:45:37.001
rectangle it shows up runs
through OCR you send me a

00:45:37.001 --> 00:45:39.003
million line spread sheet, it's
just not that hard for me to

00:45:39.003 --> 00:45:43.374
convert that back to machine
readable data with no

00:45:43.374 --> 00:45:49.013
restrictions. So the fact that
it would be awesome if that did

00:45:49.013 --> 00:45:52.817
work doesn't mean that it does
work. It needs to be

00:45:52.817 --> 00:45:56.854
technologically plausible as
well as a good idea. And the

00:45:56.854 --> 00:46:00.057
problem is that the way that we
defend that today is by saying,

00:46:00.057 --> 00:46:02.093
well, you go to jail if you
report a vulnerability that

00:46:02.093 --> 00:46:04.095
would allow you to do that kind
of thing, as we've seen it

00:46:04.095 --> 00:46:06.564
doesn't stop bad guys whatever
your definition of bad guy is

00:46:06.564 --> 00:46:11.969
whether that is state level
actors that sit in your own

00:46:11.969 --> 00:46:14.538
government's capital or state
level actors that sit in other

00:46:14.538 --> 00:46:19.110
government's capital or script
kids or identity thieves or

00:46:19.110 --> 00:46:22.146
voyeurs, doesn't stop them from
violating the law. It's a bit

00:46:22.146 --> 00:46:25.983
like the rule against extracting
keys to rip DVDs like if you're

00:46:25.983 --> 00:46:29.587
already prepared to share a DVD
and break the law, the fact that

00:46:29.587 --> 00:46:34.091
extracting keys to rip the DVD
not much of deterrent. It's like

00:46:34.091 --> 00:46:36.193
law is going to break this law I
found out I'd be breaking

00:46:36.193 --> 00:46:38.195
another law so I stopped
breaking the law. It doesn't

00:46:38.195 --> 00:46:41.499
seem likely that is going to
happen. I am all for having

00:46:41.499 --> 00:46:44.869
things that make companies
better about their document

00:46:44.869 --> 00:46:46.871
handling and retention
especially in respect to

00:46:46.871 --> 00:46:50.274
personal information. And I love
ideas like, going to insurance

00:46:50.274 --> 00:46:52.376
underwriters and saying, you
know, you're allowing the

00:46:52.376 --> 00:46:56.914
companies that you write
policies for to treat personal

00:46:56.914 --> 00:46:59.717
information as though the only
cost associated with it is hard

00:46:59.717 --> 00:47:02.486
drives. And really what you
should be doing is factoring in

00:47:02.486 --> 00:47:05.556
the full cost of the event
breach that have information

00:47:05.556 --> 00:47:08.359
because we have exactly one gold
standard for not having

00:47:08.359 --> 00:47:10.961
information breaches, that's not
collecting and retaining

00:47:10.961 --> 00:47:16.100
information. So, companies that
are able to subsidize themselves

00:47:16.100 --> 00:47:20.371
by getting insurers to write
them cheap policies because for

00:47:20.371 --> 00:47:24.675
some reason insurers are acting
like there's no risk to

00:47:24.675 --> 00:47:29.380
retaining PII that's crazily
dumb. I think that -- like not

00:47:29.380 --> 00:47:33.217
passing laws that require deep
document retention like we have

00:47:33.217 --> 00:47:37.154
in the EU being proposed in the
U.S., that is a -- also really

00:47:37.154 --> 00:47:41.225
good way to get away from this
stuff. Right now a lot of firms

00:47:41.225 --> 00:47:45.896
are bound through compliance to
gather and retain tons of PII.

00:47:45.896 --> 00:47:49.700
And that's just asking for
trouble. David Cameron, the

00:47:49.700 --> 00:47:53.270
prime minister of the United
Kingdom, a counry I just

00:47:53.270 --> 00:47:57.475
emigrated from, those two facts
are not coincidences, has just

00:47:57.475 --> 00:48:00.177
announced that everyone who
operates a porn site that is

00:48:00.177 --> 00:48:03.681
accessible within the United
Kingdom is going to have to

00:48:03.681 --> 00:48:06.450
gather and retain proof of age
which in practice means credit

00:48:06.450 --> 00:48:09.553
card numbers for everyone who
visits the website to make sure

00:48:09.553 --> 00:48:13.090
that they're over 18. Or they
will be blocked at the national

00:48:13.090 --> 00:48:15.593
fire wall of the U.K. which was
instituted in the last

00:48:15.593 --> 00:48:21.232
parliament. And given that porn
sites are not better than the

00:48:21.232 --> 00:48:23.434
office personnel management at
protecting themselves from

00:48:23.434 --> 00:48:28.239
breaches what he just said is we
are going to gather and then

00:48:28.239 --> 00:48:34.078
release a financial net worth
indexed record of the

00:48:34.078 --> 00:48:37.515
pornography tastes of everyone
in the United Kingdom. Right?

00:48:37.515 --> 00:48:42.186
This is a crazily bad idea that
we don't need DRM to fix in

00:48:42.186 --> 00:48:45.356
terms of privacy. We just need
to like stop mandating that

00:48:45.356 --> 00:48:49.059
companies retain PII because we
should assume that the breach

00:48:49.059 --> 00:48:52.129
will always occur. How are we
for time? Two minutes. Anyone

00:48:52.129 --> 00:48:54.665
have really quick question
preferably someone female or

00:48:54.665 --> 00:48:57.501
non-binary. Just shout. [
inaudible ] A list of companies

00:48:57.501 --> 00:49:03.440
that are friendly towards 1201
versus not friendly there. Is a

00:49:07.011 --> 00:49:12.149
bit of one. If you look at the
1201 docket at the copywrite

00:49:12.149 --> 00:49:16.387
office the 1201 exemption docket
you'll see the companies that

00:49:16.387 --> 00:49:20.891
were insisted that 1201 is
requirement. Apple is one of

00:49:20.891 --> 00:49:25.696
them. Although Steve Jobs wrote
that letter saying DRM sucks,

00:49:25.696 --> 00:49:30.501
and although one of the jail
breaking exemptions that's been

00:49:30.501 --> 00:49:34.805
granted at the last couple
tri-enial. They're not tablets,

00:49:34.805 --> 00:49:38.209
the copywrite office can't tell
difference between tablet and

00:49:38.209 --> 00:49:43.514
laptop which suggests that they
probably shouldn't be regulating

00:49:43.514 --> 00:49:48.319
either of them. Apple every year
when this comes up says the sky

00:49:48.319 --> 00:49:52.122
will fall if you are allowed to
decide what software runs on

00:49:52.122 --> 00:49:54.792
your iPhone. There are bunch of
thieves companies. You can also

00:49:54.792 --> 00:49:57.528
see the companies that insisted
that DRM should be work product.

00:49:57.528 --> 00:50:00.731
W3C those are the big ones. On
other side, there are companies

00:50:00.731 --> 00:50:06.737
that play both sides of the
fence. When Amazon was hoping to

00:50:11.141 --> 00:50:16.847
open a music store to rival
Apple's DRM locked music store,

00:50:16.847 --> 00:50:20.684
they launched the MP3 store, the
slogan, DRM, don't restrict me.

00:50:20.684 --> 00:50:26.557
Then they bought audible, which
had -- sells digital audio

00:50:26.557 --> 00:50:31.161
books. They said, by the way, if
you make audio books and sell

00:50:31.161 --> 00:50:34.565
them through our platform which
is -- responsible for 90% of the

00:50:34.565 --> 00:50:37.635
audio book sales in the world is
the sole supplier of spoken word

00:50:37.635 --> 00:50:41.438
to the iTunes store, you must
have DRM. Lot of those companies

00:50:41.438 --> 00:50:44.141
play both sides of the fence.
We're out of time. I'm going to

00:50:44.141 --> 00:50:47.478
sign books at the press people
over in the champagne room.

00:50:47.478 --> 00:50:53.183
There are books in the champagne
room. There are books there. I

00:50:53.183 --> 00:50:55.986
will see you there. Thank you.
