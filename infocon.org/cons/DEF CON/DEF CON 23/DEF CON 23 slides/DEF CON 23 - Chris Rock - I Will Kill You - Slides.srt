00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.471
So when I was going through a
schedule trying to see what

00:00:04.471 --> 00:00:08.175
speakers we will be watching I
saw this description and said

00:00:08.175 --> 00:00:14.281
oh, yeah. I got to come check
this out. This is not stunt

00:00:14.281 --> 00:00:20.287
double. This is Chris Rock and
he will talk about messing with

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:28.795
identity. Let's give him a big
hand [ applause ] >> Is that

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.416
better? No. Okay. Guys my name
is Chris Rock. I'm not the black

00:00:53.153 --> 00:00:59.159
comedian. Today I'm going to
talk about the Def city and we

00:01:01.795 --> 00:01:07.801
will talk about the city and we
will make it glooming again and

00:01:11.305 --> 00:01:17.311
how to combine those death and
birth and vulnerability and make

00:01:19.346 --> 00:01:24.785
money out of virtual people.
This is a global problem that we

00:01:24.785 --> 00:01:28.188
have. This is not an American
problem. I originally did my

00:01:28.188 --> 00:01:34.194
research on the Australian
research. Further this is end of

00:01:40.901 --> 00:01:46.573
life fundability. It's not so
much vulnerability it's just a

00:01:46.573 --> 00:01:54.281
fuck up. And it's a global fuck
up. Okay. Anyone with this

00:01:54.281 --> 00:01:58.986
knowledge can kill another
person. Multiple people or even

00:01:58.986 --> 00:02:05.225
yourself. I have not contacted
any vendor for fixes. This is a

00:02:05.225 --> 00:02:11.231
definition of irresponsible
disclosure. So why do I research

00:02:13.467 --> 00:02:21.375
the def industry? I was watching
the news Melbourne where I'm

00:02:21.375 --> 00:02:29.249
from [ inaudible ]...they've
moved into the internet world

00:02:29.249 --> 00:02:35.255
where you can kill 200 off
quickly with a button on a

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:45.665
mouse. So I look into the def
industry in Australia. Here's

00:02:45.665 --> 00:02:52.572
the global view of the process,
when someone dies, in America

00:02:52.572 --> 00:02:56.643
certificate of death. 24 hours
to fill this out. This contains

00:02:56.643 --> 00:03:03.050
details cause of death, name of
victim and next of kin. And

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:08.622
passes down to the funereal
director and 7 days to dispose

00:03:08.622 --> 00:03:14.161
of the body. This is the same
document in America, in

00:03:14.161 --> 00:03:18.565
Australia there's two separate
documents. Once that has been

00:03:18.565 --> 00:03:24.971
completed its passed down and
then they will issue the

00:03:24.971 --> 00:03:31.144
certificate to the next of kin.
When we look at the security

00:03:31.144 --> 00:03:38.085
process we need to compromise
step 2 and speculate 3. First we

00:03:38.085 --> 00:03:42.689
look at the doctor's component.
Traditional certificate of

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:49.629
death. In states. The top part
is filled out by the funereal

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:55.635
director include the where the
person is bury and down the

00:03:59.372 --> 00:04:03.310
medical practitioner will fill
out cause of death. In Australia

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:09.883
we've moved into an online
system. The doctor puts their

00:04:09.883 --> 00:04:16.490
first name last name license
number and submit. Once they

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:23.763
submit that form, the details
will be made available to the

00:04:23.763 --> 00:04:28.502
doctor. In America, you are
using the system use electronic

00:04:28.502 --> 00:04:34.508
death system. It's online as
well. When the doctor logs on to

00:04:39.646 --> 00:04:42.048
fill this certificate, they will
get like this. This is an

00:04:42.048 --> 00:04:48.989
example of this. There's some
security protection there.

00:04:48.989 --> 00:04:56.062
Here's an example of edrs look
like once the doctor is logged

00:04:56.062 --> 00:05:02.002
on and drop down boxes such as
autopsy details. This is a

00:05:05.272 --> 00:05:11.278
snapshot of the Californian
system. One thing to note there

00:05:13.313 --> 00:05:17.117
there's an autopsy form. It's
important to note that because

00:05:17.117 --> 00:05:21.254
when we are talking about
killing people down the track

00:05:21.254 --> 00:05:24.324
and if you have selected life
insurance policy are you a

00:05:24.324 --> 00:05:30.330
smoker, not likely to smoker and
die of lung cancer [ inaudible

00:05:34.968 --> 00:05:40.974
]. This is used for mass
surveillance. Here's an example

00:05:43.143 --> 00:05:49.149
where the death occurred from
drowning. The government like

00:05:51.318 --> 00:05:57.324
this because it has the accurate
record. Instead of waiting for

00:06:01.228 --> 00:06:06.366
doctor, I can get death records
very quickly and shows what the

00:06:06.366 --> 00:06:11.972
person died of. This is
important where the government

00:06:11.972 --> 00:06:17.544
planning whether it's cancer
orchids not wearing bike helmets

00:06:17.544 --> 00:06:23.550
and makes it easy to fix. How do
attacks get into this? Here's

00:06:25.619 --> 00:06:29.456
the form the doctor will fill
out, first name, last name,

00:06:29.456 --> 00:06:35.462
e-mail address, and license
number. This is the paper based

00:06:37.964 --> 00:06:43.970
form. It gets sent into the
department. Dra registration.

00:06:48.775 --> 00:06:55.482
Again. Same information. This is
what the doctor to first time

00:06:55.482 --> 00:07:00.620
register. Not all doctor use
ers. When somebody dies in the

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:05.158
hospital that job is done by the
medical examiner. Like in a

00:07:05.158 --> 00:07:12.666
prison or hospital examiners do
that. But a doctor such as look

00:07:12.666 --> 00:07:19.572
after old age patient where
dying is normal they will use

00:07:19.572 --> 00:07:27.080
that system. You can see some of
the questions on another states

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:31.551
based system asking for those
details. The doctor can choose

00:07:31.551 --> 00:07:38.391
their own password and find out
address details. Now when you

00:07:38.391 --> 00:07:44.397
use this system it will do a
look up against license detail

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:52.706
as long as the e-mail match, you
can register yourself as a

00:07:55.041 --> 00:07:57.977
doctor. There's a system in
place to find the doctor.

00:07:57.977 --> 00:08:03.917
Google, and it will give you all
the license detail. I've put

00:08:09.689 --> 00:08:15.695
some examples up there. I'm not
shitting on the U.S. I'll be

00:08:18.264 --> 00:08:24.270
shitting on candidate as well
when I go there. So doctors have

00:08:29.576 --> 00:08:36.182
six years of study. So you can
see here from the cause of death

00:08:36.182 --> 00:08:40.787
certificate here we've got a to
d the actual cause of death. In

00:08:40.787 --> 00:08:47.327
this example the actual age is
what the person actually end up

00:08:47.327 --> 00:08:54.667
dying of. At the bottom the
doctor said liver cancer. Liver

00:08:54.667 --> 00:09:00.607
failure. And blood clot and last
one is blood clot in the lung.

00:09:03.309 --> 00:09:09.315
The important detail to look for
is down the bottom 32 autopsy

00:09:11.351 --> 00:09:18.691
performed. If a doctor thinks
it's unnatural death it has to

00:09:18.691 --> 00:09:25.398
get referred to a coroner
examiner. This document out with

00:09:25.398 --> 00:09:31.404
examples on how to pay somebody
off produced by the cdc. So you

00:09:34.674 --> 00:09:40.680
can learn doctors speak very
quick. The role of medical

00:09:42.682 --> 00:09:46.886
examiner coroner is a doctor
with few qualification. Coroner

00:09:46.886 --> 00:09:52.025
is a word for representative of
the crown. No specific skill.

00:09:52.025 --> 00:09:58.932
Elected into the role. Look at
the chart here when filling out

00:09:58.932 --> 00:10:02.769
cause of death because you don't
want the case to go to coroner.

00:10:02.769 --> 00:10:09.075
Using this float chart you can
see which one goes to the

00:10:09.075 --> 00:10:17.050
coroner, examiner. Dying in a
hospital, prison o unnatural

00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:23.056
death. Another thing to look out
for is review death. You will go

00:10:26.893 --> 00:10:32.899
to the coroner. In other words,
if you are going to kill your

00:10:35.301 --> 00:10:40.607
kids off later on. Virtual kids.
Don't be greedy to put more than

00:10:40.607 --> 00:10:46.613
one. [ laughs ]. Okay. That's
the bit of ers facility. How to

00:10:51.284 --> 00:10:55.021
get access and fill out the
form. The next the funereal

00:10:55.021 --> 00:10:57.624
director takes over. The next of
kin to choosing the funereal

00:10:57.624 --> 00:11:03.563
director. Funeral director will
log in and fill out that form.

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:23.816
So what we are looking at is the
top section the funereal

00:11:23.816 --> 00:11:28.221
director component. How does
funeral director get access?

00:11:28.221 --> 00:11:33.993
Same as doctor. They fill out
their detail. License number.

00:11:33.993 --> 00:11:41.267
First name, last name, user
name. And they have dri

00:11:41.267 --> 00:11:48.541
registers as well. And example
of user as a mortician

00:11:48.541 --> 00:11:54.414
practitioner. Where do you get
that license? They are online as

00:11:54.414 --> 00:12:00.353
well. Google. You can check the
doctor's detail, work with the

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:16.736
next of kin and also apply for
burial permits. And if you have

00:12:22.075 --> 00:12:24.077
to filling these out there's [
inaudible ] as well. Okay.

00:12:24.077 --> 00:12:28.114
Instead of doing the forge
Atlanta case of funereal

00:12:28.114 --> 00:12:34.120
director I thought I'll be one
myself. So I setup the website.

00:12:40.426 --> 00:12:46.432
Name of my company and funereal
at it happen end of it. Stuck up

00:12:54.807 --> 00:13:00.747
some flowers and apply online to
become a funereal director. [

00:13:11.324 --> 00:13:17.330
laughs ]. Three days later I got
an automated response [ applause

00:13:26.406 --> 00:13:30.843
] I'm a funereal director. No
verifying calls. Nothing. So now

00:13:30.843 --> 00:13:36.149
I can register deaths. So in
this case for example I was

00:13:36.149 --> 00:13:41.888
shaky I thought I'll kill Hugh
Jackman off. You can see the top

00:13:41.888 --> 00:13:48.061
of the box deceased, et cetera.
Are at the top. If you are like

00:13:48.061 --> 00:13:53.499
me a little lazy, you can kill
multiple people off. This has an

00:13:53.499 --> 00:14:00.506
advantages when you want to do
that quickly. [ laughs ]. Okay.

00:14:00.506 --> 00:14:05.812
That's the Australian way
system. So here are some

00:14:05.812 --> 00:14:11.718
research to become a funereal
director in the U.S. California

00:14:11.718 --> 00:14:16.889
for example you need a degree.
In Colorado you need nothing.

00:14:16.889 --> 00:14:22.895
Nevada you need $375. So why to
go through all this process? If

00:14:28.101 --> 00:14:34.107
you want to commit insurance
fraud, it's better to see that

00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:43.616
tomb from out of the ground.
It's just as easy to kill

00:14:47.954 --> 00:14:54.494
someone off the UK. So that
completes the two parts of four

00:14:54.494 --> 00:14:57.930
to get the death certificate.
Once those documents are

00:14:57.930 --> 00:15:01.234
complete and online licenses are
complete the register then issue

00:15:01.234 --> 00:15:07.406
the death certificate. And send
the that to the next of kin. And

00:15:07.406 --> 00:15:13.780
you might ask how may I get that
certificate when I'm killing

00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:20.720
someone off. You are filling out
the form. [ laughs ]. I know

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:28.161
it's not in good spirit to kill
the host. But here's one of Jeff

00:15:28.161 --> 00:15:35.368
Moss. But on paper he's dead.
That's going to be a problem

00:15:35.368 --> 00:15:41.507
when he travels. It's going to
be a general pain in the ass.

00:15:41.507 --> 00:15:47.513
Okay. Jeff's dead. That was fun.
But I know Jeff's got a lot of

00:15:51.684 --> 00:15:57.690
money. I want some of it. I have
a certificate. I fill a will

00:15:59.892 --> 00:16:05.832
online. Now to be recognized as
an executer of a will you need

00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:14.273
to do something called probate
petition. That's saying to the

00:16:14.273 --> 00:16:19.212
court I have a death certificate
and will I want access to Jeff's

00:16:19.212 --> 00:16:24.083
account. It's a document to send
to the court that you have the

00:16:24.083 --> 00:16:28.855
license to shut this person
down. You then use a company

00:16:28.855 --> 00:16:35.661
letter like the one I put.
Standard template, I'm writing

00:16:35.661 --> 00:16:41.667
to the bank. The bank will give
me the money. They will shut the

00:16:45.171 --> 00:16:51.177
victim down. Pay out the debits.
If you want to do it maliciously

00:16:54.013 --> 00:17:01.387
you take the money and run. You
can petition online. The video

00:17:01.387 --> 00:17:07.960
of that it's completely removed.
You don't have to go to court.

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:10.363
Why would you want to kill
somebody? Financial. Killing

00:17:10.363 --> 00:17:17.303
yourself. So I want to enjoy
your insurance money while you

00:17:17.303 --> 00:17:24.577
are alive [applause] the other
one is kill your parents.

00:17:24.577 --> 00:17:30.583
Parents are not dying as quickly
as they used to and they are

00:17:34.053 --> 00:17:41.327
handing out money very slowly.
Better off killing them in

00:17:41.327 --> 00:17:47.166
advantage and runner. Okay.
Revenge. On your ex-wife,

00:17:47.166 --> 00:17:53.172
partner. The good thing is they
don't even know it. Don't shut

00:17:55.908 --> 00:18:00.012
your bank accounts. Just when
they get their new license,

00:18:00.012 --> 00:18:06.018
oops. Kill your bosses, he's an
asshole. [ laughs ]. Okay.

00:18:09.422 --> 00:18:15.428
Hinder. If you are under
investigation, [ laughs ]. [

00:18:22.768 --> 00:18:27.873
applause ] dead people find it
difficult to travel. If you are

00:18:27.873 --> 00:18:31.644
committing this crime against
somebody they are more

00:18:31.644 --> 00:18:35.948
interested in protecting their
own life and financial history

00:18:35.948 --> 00:18:42.722
in track than chasing you. Kill
your opposing lawyer or the

00:18:42.722 --> 00:18:49.729
judge. [ laughs ]. Okay. This is
a bit of a problem for the law

00:18:49.729 --> 00:18:54.133
because the law is not ready for
this stuff here. There's a case

00:18:54.133 --> 00:18:58.137
in 2013 where illegally dead man
said dead even though he's

00:18:58.137 --> 00:19:04.076
alive. He was declared dead.
After missing for five years.

00:19:12.051 --> 00:19:18.624
Obviously his wife wanted to
move on. The 61-year-old come

00:19:18.624 --> 00:19:21.794
back and he wants to be
reinstated. The judge said too

00:19:21.794 --> 00:19:27.266
late. I had a 3 year window to
bring you back to live. The

00:19:27.266 --> 00:19:33.272
judge said even though you are
here, there's nothing I can do.

00:19:37.176 --> 00:19:42.715
You are dead. So have you heard
of someone state less, this one

00:19:42.715 --> 00:19:48.721
is body less. Okay. I hope that
plays all right. I put a video

00:19:52.625 --> 00:19:57.730
of my first kill. It wasn't a
clean kill. It's a bit like

00:19:57.730 --> 00:19:59.732
Dexter Morgan and Harry. [ video
] [dramatic music ]. >> Has

00:19:59.732 --> 00:20:05.738
mistakenly announced of more
than 200 patients. [ music

00:21:27.887 --> 00:21:33.893
playing ]. [ applause ] >> Thank
you. Okay. [ laughs ]. I've been

00:22:30.349 --> 00:22:36.355
given the wrap up. Now I've
killed somebody, what about

00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:54.466
birthing. It's easier. We commit
fraud on one side. Step one baby

00:24:54.893 --> 00:24:59.198
is born. Step two doctor or
midwife fill out form. Step

00:24:59.198 --> 00:25:02.768
three parent filled out the
detail. Traditional birth

00:25:02.768 --> 00:25:08.774
certificate half filled out by
the doctor and half by the

00:25:12.111 --> 00:25:18.650
parents. That's moving online to
ebr. One example of a Canadian

00:25:18.650 --> 00:25:24.656
one and Australian one as well
and U.S. one at the bottom of

00:25:24.656 --> 00:25:31.663
the link. Okay. Again for online
birth registers for U.S. is the

00:25:31.663 --> 00:25:36.902
same as death. Using operating
system databases register as

00:25:36.902 --> 00:25:43.308
doctor or midwife. It's the same
database. Once you have logged

00:25:43.308 --> 00:25:48.847
up, it's just matter of putting
the detail of where the baby is

00:25:48.847 --> 00:25:53.485
born. This is not identity
death. So while government made

00:25:53.485 --> 00:25:59.491
the birth certificate stronger
it's not identity theft. So then

00:26:03.262 --> 00:26:07.433
I got the idea I can kill
somebody and birth somebody, can

00:26:07.433 --> 00:26:13.439
I combine the two together to
make some money. A shell company

00:26:18.377 --> 00:26:24.983
it's an illegal accounting term
used to protect assets. A

00:26:24.983 --> 00:26:30.989
company took that shelf company
further, pays taxes and file

00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:40.699
annual return and builds up
credit writing. Why? Is to get

00:26:40.699 --> 00:26:46.705
around money laundering. What
can I do this with my baby?

00:26:50.409 --> 00:26:56.415
Social security number. Tax
benefits. I call it the virtual.

00:27:01.887 --> 00:27:05.624
The virtual we have to have home
loans pay taxes, multiple life

00:27:05.624 --> 00:27:11.263
insurances and also do stock
trading. Why would you want to

00:27:11.263 --> 00:27:17.269
do all this? Borrow millions of
money and not pay it back. And

00:27:22.441 --> 00:27:28.447
if you fuck up get a new i.d. a
real i.d. again life insurance

00:27:32.718 --> 00:27:35.187
policies do an online life
insurance policy, when you have

00:27:35.187 --> 00:27:39.925
enough babies, kill it off and
do running. Research I've done

00:27:39.925 --> 00:27:45.931
is derivatives. Currency money,
euro going up, use two virtuals.

00:27:49.234 --> 00:27:55.240
One is going to be winner and
the other loser. The loser you

00:27:59.711 --> 00:28:03.048
can put back on the shelf, who
cares. Also obtaining firearm,

00:28:03.048 --> 00:28:09.054
go with a virtual i.d. extra
layer of anonymity. Protect

00:28:16.862 --> 00:28:20.499
ourselves, one step further,
protect yourself and use a

00:28:20.499 --> 00:28:26.505
virtual i.d. okay. Why is it so
vulnerable? Doctor/midwife in

00:28:30.108 --> 00:28:37.316
portal, that's just shit. At
least you guys have portal. They

00:28:37.316 --> 00:28:45.157
are behind on adr but the same
are adrs. The license online

00:28:45.157 --> 00:28:51.163
when needed if you are a doctor
you need a job from another

00:28:53.665 --> 00:28:58.904
hospital, you need that to
verify. Funereal director

00:28:58.904 --> 00:29:04.643
there's no licensing around the
world and using dri service

00:29:04.643 --> 00:29:12.050
portals. Why is it swiss cheese?
The government want centralized

00:29:12.050 --> 00:29:15.487
record. These information have
been lost. This fixes all this.

00:29:15.487 --> 00:29:23.228
It's centralized. Everything is
accurate. The government have

00:29:23.228 --> 00:29:29.234
babies registered my hometown a
lot of babies are not

00:29:34.673 --> 00:29:40.679
registered, remote people or
disadvantaged people on drugs.

00:29:43.015 --> 00:29:47.986
They get estimate of 2.5% based
on when people start school and

00:29:47.986 --> 00:29:53.992
age 5 they be certificate. You
can take five years off your

00:29:56.795 --> 00:30:02.801
shelf baby by registering a bit
later in life. The government

00:30:05.303 --> 00:30:08.373
historically based the fact that
you need two parties inclusion

00:30:08.373 --> 00:30:13.779
to bury somebody to get rid of
the body. But you see from the

00:30:13.779 --> 00:30:18.950
portal you can become both
persons. If you did, these are

00:30:18.950 --> 00:30:26.224
virtual, don't use your own i.d.
and moving from paper based

00:30:26.224 --> 00:30:32.364
system to online system
obviously fault a major. I've

00:30:32.364 --> 00:30:35.534
written a talk on this topic. On
how to raise your virtual, use

00:30:35.534 --> 00:30:41.540
stockmarket to your yourself,
kill your and bankrupt your

00:30:41.540 --> 00:30:47.546
baby. You can buy that on
Amazon. Thank you for your time.

00:30:49.781 --> 00:30:54.586
Thank you. That's it. [ applause
