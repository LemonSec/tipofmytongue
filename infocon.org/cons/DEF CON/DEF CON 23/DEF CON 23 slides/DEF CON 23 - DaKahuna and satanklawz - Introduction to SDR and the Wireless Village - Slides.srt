00:00:35.068 --> 00:01:46.940
So who am i? who the hell am i?
who is this weird guy? I'm DEF

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:52.946
CON's official cartographer and
puzzle master. I created the

00:02:40.093 --> 00:02:46.099
hardware hacking village, I have
been doing puzzles and mystery

00:03:39.119 --> 00:03:45.125
challenges for many, many years.
This is my lovely wife and yes,

00:04:50.023 --> 00:04:56.029
that's a Dr. Seuss book on the
right. Who wants to come to Las

00:05:08.275 --> 00:05:12.512
Vegas in the summertime with a
bunch of sweaty people that

00:05:12.512 --> 00:05:18.518
don't shower and rub elbows? I'm
not a Vegas person. This is for

00:06:02.796 --> 00:06:08.802
noobs and not for any particular
subject area. Who knows who Matt

00:06:28.188 --> 00:06:30.957
Blaze is? It says don't be shy.
A quick shoutout and APG and a

00:06:30.957 --> 00:06:33.593
couple others. I have some good
props. Everyone should do that.

00:06:33.593 --> 00:06:39.599
Disclaimer. I'm not going to sit
up here and read slides to you.

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:09.996
I will not advocate criminal
activity. You can determine what

00:07:42.729 --> 00:07:48.735
that access is for later. How
many of you notice a certain

00:08:10.323 --> 00:08:16.329
folder on my desktop when I came
in here? I'm going to open that.

00:08:26.706 --> 00:08:30.310
What was the folder? You asked
for it. Remember, you asked for

00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:36.316
this. Oh! [ APPLAUSE ] Dang. How
many of you notice the name of

00:09:22.495 --> 00:09:28.501
this song. How many of you are
going to take another weird ass

00:09:36.276 --> 00:09:38.778
look at the name of this song
and read just the first letter

00:09:38.778 --> 00:09:41.614
of the word that is there? First
of all, you are full of crap

00:09:41.614 --> 00:09:44.484
because this is a bull bullshit
and arrogant in our community.

00:09:44.484 --> 00:09:49.422
Get over the bullshit. Every
person in this room, especially,

00:09:49.422 --> 00:09:51.424
if you are from the United
States, look it up. It is

00:09:51.424 --> 00:09:54.394
talking about what type of
research securities are legal

00:09:54.394 --> 00:09:56.696
and not legal. Big joke,
everyone came to DEF CON this

00:09:56.696 --> 00:09:58.698
year and now, you have a record.
Ah-ha see what you did there.

00:09:58.698 --> 00:10:04.704
This is a hacker and if you see
him at the conference thank him

00:10:21.588 --> 00:10:27.594
and shake his hand and thank him
for putting this together. The

00:10:42.408 --> 00:10:48.414
first two talks before DEF CON
actually starts. How many of you

00:11:03.196 --> 00:11:09.202
have been through the hellacious
red line? How many people took

00:11:22.282 --> 00:11:28.288
five hours? Six hours? Seven
hours? How was it this year? [

00:11:46.573 --> 00:11:52.579
APPLAUSE ] So, we got a whole
bunch of red folks and the same

00:12:04.257 --> 00:12:10.263
thing with the swag. Was it
awful? Tell the truth. >> Better

00:12:17.303 --> 00:12:23.309
than last year. >> Anyway, for
those of you that are familiar

00:12:53.706 --> 00:12:55.708
with the contests and the
puzzles that I do, there are

00:12:55.708 --> 00:12:57.710
people who are working on the
crypto challenges and it takes

00:12:57.710 --> 00:12:59.712
up their entire DEF CON time.
For me, it takes an entire year

00:12:59.712 --> 00:13:01.648
to put together everything that
I do and I'm entirely busy. He

00:13:01.648 --> 00:13:03.816
would always bug me for slides
and a title. I kept putting him

00:13:03.816 --> 00:13:06.019
off and off. So, he would start
making up talk titles. Now, the

00:13:06.019 --> 00:13:08.054
title is kind of a tradition.
Highways came up with that. I'm

00:13:08.054 --> 00:13:10.423
the brunt of that joke, as well
as you guys. Anyway. How many of

00:13:10.423 --> 00:13:12.458
you have seen "Spinal Tap"? How
many of you get the reference?

00:13:12.458 --> 00:13:14.827
There is a scene in "Spinal Tap"
and they are like what the hell

00:13:14.827 --> 00:13:17.030
are we going to talk about?
There is some jazz that you can

00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:19.032
bullshit through all of that. I
would encourage you if someone

00:13:19.032 --> 00:13:21.401
says something that doesn't make
sense to you, challenge the

00:13:21.401 --> 00:13:23.603
speaker. Challenge me. That's
how we are going to get better.

00:13:23.603 --> 00:13:25.605
That's the whole point of a
conference like this. Don't go

00:13:25.605 --> 00:13:27.607
in and listen to a guy who is
giving basically a vendor

00:13:27.607 --> 00:13:29.609
speech. If someone is saying
something that is bullshit,

00:13:29.609 --> 00:13:31.611
challenge them. We are going to
get better that way. How many of

00:13:31.611 --> 00:13:33.613
you have heard my 101 speech
before? Because of all of the

00:13:33.613 --> 00:13:35.615
puzzles in crypto and mysterious
things that I do, I'm accused of

00:13:35.615 --> 00:13:38.451
thinking outside of the box.
Most of the time I talk to

00:13:38.451 --> 00:13:44.457
reporters and they are like you
are creative and you think

00:13:50.496 --> 00:13:56.502
outside of the box. That's one
of my biggest pet peeves right

00:14:13.519 --> 00:14:19.525
now. How many of you know where
the term "thinking outside of

00:14:36.576 --> 00:14:42.582
the box" comes from? Connect all
of the dots. Don't let your pen

00:14:55.928 --> 00:15:01.868
leave the paper. If this is not
your cup of tea, feel free to

00:15:19.252 --> 00:15:25.258
leave. I will not be offended at
all. I will talk about some

00:15:51.717 --> 00:15:57.723
technical issues, but 101.
That's what it is." So the nine

00:16:06.866 --> 00:16:09.936
dot problem. You are often
presented with connect all of

00:16:09.936 --> 00:16:12.572
the dots. Can't lift the pen
from the paper or you have a

00:16:12.572 --> 00:16:14.774
limit etc.? And everyone knows
that you have to extend the

00:16:14.774 --> 00:16:16.809
lines past the mental imposed
box. The presenter, like Tony

00:16:16.809 --> 00:16:19.212
Robinson or something will come
down and like, oh, ha ha I'm

00:16:19.212 --> 00:16:21.447
going to challenge you to be
creative. Especially, for us, as

00:16:21.447 --> 00:16:23.883
a hacker, and coming up with
solutions to problems and as a

00:16:23.883 --> 00:16:26.319
hacker, you have to think
outside of the box and come up

00:16:26.319 --> 00:16:28.921
with a different method or a
abuse the system in a way that

00:16:28.921 --> 00:16:30.957
nobody else has thought of.
There is another examination and

00:16:30.957 --> 00:16:33.526
basically says that all I have
to do to make people sign that

00:16:33.526 --> 00:16:35.528
nine dot problem is to tell them
they are mentally constraining

00:16:35.528 --> 00:16:37.530
themselves and there are studies
that show that's not true. There

00:16:37.530 --> 00:16:39.532
are studies that even ahead of
time you cannot -- you have to

00:16:39.532 --> 00:16:41.534
draw outside of this imposed
space in order to solve this

00:16:41.534 --> 00:16:44.670
problem. The same person
(Indiscernible) oh, that

00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:50.676
particular puzzle. The ones that
could do it could do it anyway

00:16:59.719 --> 00:17:05.658
and the ones that couldn't,
couldn't. The only thing that

00:17:15.201 --> 00:17:22.074
helped was the study of the
generation. How many of you are

00:17:22.074 --> 00:17:25.144
in high school? College
students? Fresh out of school?

00:17:25.144 --> 00:17:28.447
How many people are looking for
jobs? No, I'm serious. It is a

00:17:28.447 --> 00:17:34.220
great place to get recruited.
How many people are looking for

00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:37.590
jobs? Let's do that again. How
many people are looking for

00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:43.596
jobs? How many people are
looking to hire someone?

00:18:12.558 --> 00:18:18.564
Everybody see that? Okay, just
trying to help. You're welcome.

00:18:36.282 --> 00:18:43.889
[ LAUGHTER ] The reason I bring
that up is that we have a

00:18:43.889 --> 00:18:49.895
generation of wanna be hackers
and the epithermal moments are

00:19:38.644 --> 00:19:44.183
not going to come from thinking
outside of the box, but from

00:19:44.183 --> 00:19:51.123
what you are exposed to. I used
to teach at the university and

00:19:51.123 --> 00:19:56.962
students would come up and ask
questions. I would say first,

00:19:56.962 --> 00:20:03.369
have you tried what you have
tested? And I'm afraid that we

00:20:03.369 --> 00:20:09.775
have a generation of hackers
that have or have not be in

00:20:09.775 --> 00:20:16.182
school and they don't tinkle
anymore and we are going to put

00:20:16.182 --> 00:20:22.588
constraints on people and if you
do these things, you are going

00:20:22.588 --> 00:20:30.062
to go to jail. You are going to
get arrested. You are going to

00:20:30.062 --> 00:20:36.068
get a record. You are not going
to be able to get a job. We are

00:20:38.604 --> 00:20:43.409
scaring this younger generation
where they are not tinkering

00:20:43.409 --> 00:20:50.349
anymore. We have to break that.
Or we are not going to have

00:20:50.349 --> 00:20:55.688
these epiphrenal moments and I
have a brand-new daughter, who

00:20:55.688 --> 00:21:01.627
is in the front row and I want
her to be able to explore like I

00:21:03.696 --> 00:21:09.702
used to and not go to jail for
it. Not get a record for it.

00:21:14.273 --> 00:21:20.279
That's my bullshit and would you
argue with me? Agree with me?

00:21:23.149 --> 00:21:29.155
That's a good point. I have to
Google proof everything that I

00:21:32.024 --> 00:21:38.030
do. What's going to happen the
first time that someone gets a

00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:46.906
piece of information that I give
and I have to Google proof of it

00:21:51.243 --> 00:21:57.249
because they are going to throw
it into Google? That's correct.

00:21:59.385 --> 00:22:05.224
It goes back to the
informational knowledge and

00:22:05.224 --> 00:22:11.230
gives you the epiphany and so
you can have these pivotal

00:22:13.365 --> 00:22:19.371
moments and break through to the
next great thing. When I was in

00:22:22.975 --> 00:22:28.981
college. Like magic and as a
kid, I would see magic tricks

00:22:31.850 --> 00:22:37.856
and try and figure out how it
was done and when a kid sees

00:22:42.194 --> 00:22:48.200
magic tricks now, he goes to
Google and the magic trick is

00:22:51.070 --> 00:22:58.477
ruined because they have instant
gratification. How many of you

00:22:58.477 --> 00:23:04.416
have looked at the code on your
lanyard already? Well, that code

00:23:06.852 --> 00:23:10.389
is deliberately deceptive. I
will tell you that it is not

00:23:10.389 --> 00:23:16.395
simple. I will also tell you
that everything that I do that

00:25:32.698 --> 00:25:36.235
you see in my puzzles and
challenges require people and

00:25:36.235 --> 00:25:42.241
require you to have
communication. If you look at

00:26:19.044 --> 00:26:25.050
where a lot of our great tech
came from, it came are from

00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:08.961
Belfast. How many of you know
what I mean by bell labs? No one

00:27:08.961 --> 00:27:12.564
wants to foot the bill for
places like bell labs. You had a

00:27:12.564 --> 00:27:15.367
giant group of people that had
diverse subject knowledge and

00:27:15.367 --> 00:27:18.670
they all had direct access to
each other. If we don't have

00:27:18.670 --> 00:27:22.007
bell labs anymore, where is the
next great thing going to come

00:27:22.007 --> 00:27:25.978
from? How many of you in here,
Java is your first coding

00:27:25.978 --> 00:27:29.915
language? You don't even know
what an object is. I totally

00:27:29.915 --> 00:27:35.921
disagree with that way of
teaching things. And then, you

00:28:07.953 --> 00:28:10.656
have to think to yourself, why
did we start with Java? We are

00:28:10.656 --> 00:28:12.691
trying to spit out a guy that
can work for a meat factory as

00:28:12.691 --> 00:28:14.693
far as coding is concerned and
you are not going to get

00:28:14.693 --> 00:28:16.695
mitigration with that happening.
Talk to me. >> (Indiscernible).

00:28:16.695 --> 00:28:18.697
>> I love the way that you are
thinking. >> Can I interrupt? >>

00:28:18.697 --> 00:28:20.699
Sure. >> I came out of a school
where Java is taught and he said

00:28:20.699 --> 00:28:22.701
that we have an intuitive
knowledge of objects. That's

00:28:22.701 --> 00:28:24.703
bullshit. I grew up with
computers since I was in

00:28:24.703 --> 00:28:26.705
elementary school.
(Indiscernible) when I took

00:28:26.705 --> 00:28:28.707
(Indiscernible) coming out of
high school and I was with a

00:28:28.707 --> 00:28:30.709
group of people all the same
type of nerd as me. Our minds

00:28:30.709 --> 00:28:32.711
were melted by objects when we
has been scripting our entire

00:28:32.711 --> 00:28:34.713
career. It took five weeks of
doing these labs and everything

00:28:34.713 --> 00:28:36.715
for us to have that epiphany,
oh, objects. >> Thank you for

00:28:36.715 --> 00:28:38.717
that comment. It sounds like we
all need to get together and

00:28:38.717 --> 00:28:40.719
have a drink. People who say
stuff like that are full of crap

00:28:40.719 --> 00:28:42.721
and I really mean it. Come over
to me on the conference floor.

00:28:42.721 --> 00:28:48.727
Everyone turn around and say
hello to Russ. He's in charge of

00:29:00.305 --> 00:29:06.311
DEF CON operations and someone
that you can throw things at. >>

00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:21.426
(Indiscernible). >> That's
probably not a good thing to ask

00:29:28.033 --> 00:29:34.039
me because of my background. I
have mixed feelings and would

00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:47.886
argue lit or assembly. If you
take for example, in fact, I'm

00:29:56.995 --> 00:30:03.001
going to talk about that in a
minute. (Indiscernible) kind of

00:30:10.842 --> 00:30:16.114
a little bit of skills that I
think that everyone is

00:30:16.114 --> 00:30:21.420
considering themselves a hacker
is a basic set of skills that

00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:25.757
everyone should have. You would
be amazed that people who are

00:30:25.757 --> 00:30:30.328
basically elite don't have a
knowledge of certain things.

00:30:30.328 --> 00:30:36.335
When I get to that point, I'm
going to explain to you why I

00:31:00.525 --> 00:31:06.531
think that assembly is
important. It has to do with

00:31:22.180 --> 00:31:28.787
extraction and if you don't
understand what is going on

00:31:28.787 --> 00:31:31.490
under the hood, you are not
going to code in certain ways

00:31:31.490 --> 00:31:36.061
and I think that everyone should
understand. Not to the

00:31:36.061 --> 00:31:39.731
nitty-gritty, but fundamentally.
How do I make a fricking

00:31:39.731 --> 00:31:44.169
processor for that? If you
explain to a 4-year-old or a

00:31:44.169 --> 00:31:47.939
5-year-old how that extraction
working. I have literally a

00:31:47.939 --> 00:31:50.342
cutter and I can turn it off by
a switch. Everyone goes, I know

00:31:50.342 --> 00:31:52.344
that computers use binary and
ones and zeros. You all must be

00:31:52.344 --> 00:31:54.346
very educated because computers
use binary and I say, what does

00:31:54.346 --> 00:31:56.348
that mean? They don't unction
what it means, they are just

00:31:56.348 --> 00:31:58.350
regurgitating. I wanted to talk
about the life of a file. Yay or

00:31:58.350 --> 00:32:00.285
Ney? Shout it out. >>
(Indiscernible). >> Sure. I can

00:32:00.285 --> 00:32:02.287
also play devil's advocate and
because I have vast knowledge, I

00:32:02.287 --> 00:32:04.289
can play quickly and adequately.
We as hackers need to have the

00:32:04.289 --> 00:32:06.291
benefit of the deep knowledge of
the understanding and taking the

00:32:06.291 --> 00:32:08.293
knowledge that I understand it.
Looking it up in the Chinese

00:32:08.293 --> 00:32:10.295
dictionary is more effective
than drawing my finger in a text

00:32:10.295 --> 00:32:12.297
box. I can use tech in a way
that shortcuts that process and

00:32:12.297 --> 00:32:14.299
goes back to Java and the whole
point of Java programming is to

00:32:14.299 --> 00:32:16.301
extract. Let's move past that.
Basically, I was going to talk

00:32:16.301 --> 00:32:18.303
about how DAT files are created.
I believe that mathematics is

00:32:18.303 --> 00:32:20.305
the language of science. Anyway,
we don't want to talk about that

00:32:20.305 --> 00:32:22.307
so... I'm pausing long enough
for you to read the slides for

00:32:22.307 --> 00:32:24.309
those of you that were
interested in how to break a/b.

00:32:24.309 --> 00:32:26.311
How many of you know what movie
this picture is from? He's

00:32:26.311 --> 00:32:29.915
trying to seek out the magical
power and it is kind of

00:32:29.915 --> 00:32:34.219
Dorothy's slippers. Go play with
it. If you don't know what it

00:32:34.219 --> 00:32:38.523
is, how many of you know what
MetaSport is? The authors of

00:32:38.523 --> 00:32:42.461
this are here at DEF CON.
Everyone asks my opinion, who

00:32:42.461 --> 00:32:47.666
should I hear talk? If you want
to have your mind blown, go and

00:32:47.666 --> 00:32:53.672
listen to Gary's talk. He's a
pure genius and created chip

00:33:03.248 --> 00:33:09.254
set. We are slowly moving down a
step. First, we were using stuff

00:33:40.452 --> 00:33:46.458
in the software. And then, OS.
And then, the network. And now,

00:33:58.637 --> 00:34:01.907
you are hearing about BIOS and
the shift is happening. Shift

00:34:01.907 --> 00:34:07.913
set takes you lower in talking
to processors and the reason

00:34:11.683 --> 00:34:17.689
that it is applicable in this
day in age is because it is

00:34:23.228 --> 00:34:29.234
applicable to Hypergliser. How
many of you know what a

00:34:32.137 --> 00:34:38.143
Hypergliser is? I'm not trying
to make you feel stupid. It is

00:34:42.814 --> 00:34:48.820
the underlying piece that allows
you to have the virtualization

00:34:51.723 --> 00:34:57.662
properly and because a lot of
our systems are on the cloud and

00:34:57.662 --> 00:35:02.334
everything else and learning how
to attack viper and getting down

00:35:02.334 --> 00:35:07.539
lower in the stack is important.
The purpose for me, up here in

00:35:07.539 --> 00:35:12.310
the 101 and throwing you nuggets
of information that you may not

00:35:12.310 --> 00:35:17.515
have heard of or thought of.
This is 101. If you want the

00:35:17.515 --> 00:35:22.287
deep DAT stuff, start tomorrow.
I'm going to give you the quick

00:35:22.287 --> 00:35:27.759
basics that are a pet peeve of
mine. I was thinking of taking

00:35:27.759 --> 00:35:29.961
this out of my talk this year.
The reason I left them this is

00:35:29.961 --> 00:35:33.198
because still to this day, I'm
having interactions with people

00:35:33.198 --> 00:35:36.034
on how to security conference
with people and some of the

00:35:36.034 --> 00:35:38.036
things require a fundamental
knowledge that some people are

00:35:38.036 --> 00:35:40.405
lacking even though they may be
a genius in a particular area.

00:35:40.405 --> 00:35:42.641
If you consider yourself a
computer person or a hacker, you

00:35:42.641 --> 00:35:45.744
should know these things. It is
really fundamental stuff. So,

00:35:45.744 --> 00:35:51.750
here we go. How am I doing on
time? I have no idea? Anyone?

00:35:55.253 --> 00:35:58.623
What are we supposed to go to,
four? Everyone hold up your

00:35:58.623 --> 00:36:02.193
right hand. We are going to
count in binary. If you don't

00:36:02.193 --> 00:36:06.431
know how to count in binary, I'm
going to cry because you are at

00:36:06.431 --> 00:36:10.635
DEF CON. It 1, 2, 3, 4. All
right, you have all flipped me

00:36:10.635 --> 00:36:15.173
off at DEF CON. If you can't
take bits and write it, out in a

00:36:15.173 --> 00:36:19.411
series and I mean quickly, then
go home and learn how to do

00:36:19.411 --> 00:36:23.681
that. You need to know how to do
that, especially, if you are

00:36:23.681 --> 00:36:26.451
going to do reversing and
hacking, it is going to help

00:36:26.451 --> 00:36:32.457
you. I talk to people who are
way above my level on a lot of

00:38:30.508 --> 00:38:36.514
subjects that can't do simple
things like that. They rely on

00:38:39.551 --> 00:38:45.557
their tools so much. It is
amazing. The same thing with

00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:54.566
hex. [ NO AUDIO ] Interesting,
what would be the largest digit

00:38:58.403 --> 00:39:04.342
possible in Bart Simpson's phone
number? Why? How many fingers

00:39:06.544 --> 00:39:12.550
did the simple son characters
have? What did they count on? >>

00:39:16.387 --> 00:39:22.393
(Indiscernible). [ LAUGHTER ] >>
What number base do you think

00:39:25.396 --> 00:39:31.402
that a pirate would count in?
Radial. 6. Why? Five fingers and

00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:41.246
a hook. We created a thing
called radix. It is a

00:39:44.282 --> 00:39:48.886
hexadecimal. There is a word
list out there for you. If you

00:39:48.886 --> 00:39:54.893
don't, know what they are, I
would suggest you look them up.

00:40:33.097 --> 00:40:35.099
By the way, I totally encourage
you to approach the speakers at

00:40:35.099 --> 00:40:37.101
DEF CON. I say this every year,
if you approach someone at DEF

00:40:37.101 --> 00:40:39.103
CON and they are too high and
mighty to talk to you, then they

00:40:39.103 --> 00:40:41.105
are a douchebag and I don't want
them here anyway. We have too

00:40:41.105 --> 00:40:43.107
many people in our community
that think they are rock stars

00:40:43.107 --> 00:40:45.109
and too cool to talk to anybody
and that's got to stop. We have

00:40:45.109 --> 00:40:47.111
enough problems with people
trying to cram back doors into

00:40:47.111 --> 00:40:49.113
our back systems and it has to
stop. I love our community and I

00:40:49.113 --> 00:40:51.115
dedicate a lot of my time and
money to make DEF CON happen

00:40:51.115 --> 00:40:53.117
every year. By the way, going
back to my discussion on

00:40:53.117 --> 00:40:55.119
tinkering, if you don't know how
to set-up a VP and experiment

00:40:55.119 --> 00:40:57.121
with stuff that would otherwise
put you in jail in the real

00:40:57.121 --> 00:40:59.123
world, learn. The players are
free. People are giving out VM's

00:40:59.123 --> 00:41:01.059
of stuff and virtual boxes and
one of the ways of doing it

00:41:01.059 --> 00:41:03.061
without going to jail these days
is virtualization. Any comments

00:41:03.061 --> 00:41:05.063
on the list so far? Come on. You
guys are smart. I don't

00:41:05.063 --> 00:41:07.065
generally give my slides out and
this is the first time I that I

00:41:07.065 --> 00:41:09.067
have allowed my 101 be recorded.
I know when I go for a new talk

00:41:09.067 --> 00:41:11.069
and I watch it, and realize it
is six years old and I wasted my

00:41:11.069 --> 00:41:13.071
time, but I will make these
slides available on the lost boy

00:41:13.071 --> 00:41:15.073
website. If I forget to do that,
send me an email and say, you

00:41:15.073 --> 00:41:17.075
said you would put those slides
up, and I will put them up. >>

00:41:17.075 --> 00:41:19.077
Thank you. >> Yep. I want to
make a comment about tinkering

00:41:19.077 --> 00:41:21.079
as far as hardware is concerned.
How many of you know about

00:41:21.079 --> 00:41:23.081
Digi-Key? It breaks my heart.
How many of you remember

00:41:23.081 --> 00:41:25.083
(Indiscernible) from Radio Shack
and it was printed on graph

00:41:25.083 --> 00:41:27.085
paper and how many of you, that
book changed your life? It hurt

00:41:27.085 --> 00:41:29.087
my soul that Radio Shack turned
into a place that only sold cell

00:41:29.087 --> 00:41:31.089
phones and why? Because that was
a place that you went and

00:41:31.089 --> 00:41:33.091
tinkered with stuff. Nowadays,
we have suppliers and that's

00:41:33.091 --> 00:41:35.093
enough. Go to the websites of
these companies and request

00:41:35.093 --> 00:41:37.095
their catalogs and I say this
about Digi-Key because it is

00:41:37.095 --> 00:41:39.097
larger than most phone books and
it is great for if you need to

00:41:39.097 --> 00:41:41.099
drill something underneath.
Coming up with the challenges

00:41:41.099 --> 00:41:43.101
and it is hard because I have to
stay ahead of you guys, which

00:41:43.101 --> 00:41:45.103
are smarter and I have to have
stuff that is Google proof and

00:41:45.103 --> 00:41:47.105
solvable within a finite amount
of time. Every year, I think I'm

00:41:47.105 --> 00:41:49.107
going to learn a little bit
about like getting a

00:41:49.107 --> 00:41:51.109
subscription to a magazine that
I have no interest about. So,

00:41:51.109 --> 00:41:53.111
for you, get the Digi-Key
catalog and thumb through it

00:41:53.111 --> 00:41:55.113
when you are in your bathroom.
>> (Indiscernible). >> Yeah,

00:41:55.113 --> 00:41:57.115
excellent. This goes deeper into
my secret. How many of you know

00:41:57.115 --> 00:41:59.117
who Lady Ava is? She puts out a
list of where you can get free

00:41:59.117 --> 00:42:01.052
samples of and all you have to
do is say I'm going to make

00:42:01.052 --> 00:42:03.054
fifty thousand of it. You go and
make a fake Gmail account. Often

00:42:03.054 --> 00:42:05.056
times you will get free shipping
and they are going to put

00:42:05.056 --> 00:42:07.058
T-shirts in, as well. Get on
some of these lists and figure

00:42:07.058 --> 00:42:09.060
out where you can get these
parts. There are people who make

00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:11.062
enclosures and I have scripts
that I run and free stuff every

00:42:11.062 --> 00:42:13.064
often and I figured out where
the window of abuse is. Don't

00:42:13.064 --> 00:42:15.066
get greedy and if you go to
maxim and request a chip, they

00:42:15.066 --> 00:42:17.068
are going to send you five. Lady
Ava keeps a list. How are we

00:42:17.068 --> 00:42:19.070
doing? Are you bored? Am I
talking too fast? Louder? Is

00:42:19.070 --> 00:42:21.072
this better? >> Yeah. >> Here's
another fun way of doing an

00:42:21.072 --> 00:42:23.074
exercise regardless of what
field you are in. Pick an

00:42:23.074 --> 00:42:25.076
illegal activity and find a
legal way of doing the activity.

00:42:25.076 --> 00:42:27.078
You will be amazed of what you
will learn. How many of you read

00:42:27.078 --> 00:42:29.080
"spam nation" and he talked
about the Russian hackers and

00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:31.082
everything else. He talked about
what a lot of us know about. If

00:42:31.082 --> 00:42:33.084
you are trying to procure an
infrastructure and have it not

00:42:33.084 --> 00:42:35.086
traced back to you. By the way,
I'm not going to talk about why

00:42:35.086 --> 00:42:37.088
I have the right to privacy and
if I hear the argument, I'm not

00:42:37.088 --> 00:42:39.090
doing anything illegal and have
nothing to hide. Well, when you

00:42:39.090 --> 00:42:41.092
are having sex with your wives,
it is not illegal, but do you

00:42:41.092 --> 00:42:43.094
want someone watching that?
Taking a dump in the bathroom?

00:42:43.094 --> 00:42:45.096
I'm not going to have an
argument with you why I have to

00:42:45.096 --> 00:42:47.098
justify why I should have
privacy and this is some of the

00:42:47.098 --> 00:42:49.100
stuff that I have done in the
past year and trying to find

00:42:49.100 --> 00:42:51.102
legal ways of doing illegal
activities and there is places

00:42:51.102 --> 00:42:53.104
where you can go online and
register a email and there are

00:42:53.104 --> 00:42:55.106
many places that check the
address of the registration of

00:42:55.106 --> 00:42:57.108
the card and many of the gift
cards that you buy are going to

00:42:57.108 --> 00:42:59.110
get flagged and you can't use
them to buy certain things like

00:42:59.110 --> 00:43:01.045
VPN access. What these allow,
you buy them with cash, and you

00:43:01.045 --> 00:43:03.047
register an address for the
card. The address can be

00:43:03.047 --> 00:43:05.049
anything that you want. I will
tell you a hint. Certain sites

00:43:05.049 --> 00:43:07.051
are going to look at the
geolocation of the IP address

00:43:07.051 --> 00:43:09.053
and just find a particular VPN
the state that matches what you

00:43:09.053 --> 00:43:11.055
registered with the card. Some
of the fun that I found with

00:43:11.055 --> 00:43:13.057
this. How many of you see the
charge on December 9, 2014.

00:43:13.057 --> 00:43:15.059
Yeah, that was me playing with
the illegal stuff and someone

00:43:15.059 --> 00:43:17.061
tried to charge $1 million to
that card. I thought it was

00:43:17.061 --> 00:43:19.063
funny and the most funny thing
about it, if you look; it is

00:43:19.063 --> 00:43:21.065
listed as a reoccurring
installment. Wait a second.

00:43:21.065 --> 00:43:23.067
These guys are completely off
their rocker until they did it

00:43:23.067 --> 00:43:25.069
again. [ LAUGHTER ] And again.
If you look, I have two charges

00:43:25.069 --> 00:43:27.071
on 12/9 for restricted country
and when you do this, this is

00:43:27.071 --> 00:43:29.073
what you find out when you stuff
like this. A million dollars and

00:43:29.073 --> 00:43:31.075
this one had $100 load on it.
Don't get caught up with the

00:43:31.075 --> 00:43:33.077
media definition of what a
hacker is. Anyone that has

00:43:33.077 --> 00:43:35.079
pressed your sins? How many of
you have a yellow badge? For

00:43:35.079 --> 00:43:37.081
those of you that are new to DEF
CON, we have special press

00:43:37.081 --> 00:43:39.083
policies and we try and be
hacker and anonymity-friendly

00:43:39.083 --> 00:43:41.085
and anyone with a big yellow
disk around their neck and if

00:43:41.085 --> 00:43:43.087
you turn it around and the back
of the press badge this year is

00:43:43.087 --> 00:43:45.089
a guy like this. [ LAUGHTER ]
The 101 panel probably said, I

00:43:45.089 --> 00:43:47.091
was wasn't in here, but they
usually do. Take it for what

00:43:47.091 --> 00:43:49.093
it's worth; the press is not
your friend. They really aren't.

00:43:49.093 --> 00:43:51.095
I have seen friends get burned.
I have been burned. There are

00:43:51.095 --> 00:43:53.097
very few in the media that I
trust. They are coming here

00:43:53.097 --> 00:43:55.099
because they want to get a Sound
Byte and put something up in the

00:43:55.099 --> 00:43:57.101
news and that is going to shock
mom and pop U.S.A. Be careful

00:43:57.101 --> 00:43:59.103
what you say to anyone in the
press. Be aware of the fact that

00:43:59.103 --> 00:44:01.038
you are going to be misquoted.
That's the end of my rant. What

00:44:01.038 --> 00:44:03.040
do you think about that? Do you
think I'm full of crap? Tell the

00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:05.042
truth. [ APPLAUSE ] So, that's
the end of my little notes

00:44:05.042 --> 00:44:07.044
there. I'm happy to answer
questions and anything that you

00:44:07.044 --> 00:44:09.046
guys have for whatever time we
have left. Can you use the mic

00:44:09.046 --> 00:44:11.048
so people can hear? >> Why did
you stick a hubcap on us this

00:44:11.048 --> 00:44:13.050
year? >> For those of you that
are new to DEF CON, we do a

00:44:13.050 --> 00:44:15.052
Tick-Tock cycle and Joe Bran was
one of the first to do an

00:44:15.052 --> 00:44:17.054
electronic badge. Every
conference has an electronic

00:44:17.054 --> 00:44:19.056
badge. It would be pass say. We
always try and do something new

00:44:19.056 --> 00:44:21.058
and different and fun. This is a
non-electronic year. It was

00:44:21.058 --> 00:44:23.060
actually my wife's idea to come
up with the record. Not that I'm

00:44:23.060 --> 00:44:25.062
trying to throw the hate at her.
>> She's a lot smarter than you.

00:44:25.062 --> 00:44:27.064
>> Yes. These are seven-inch. I
couldn't do a five-inch because

00:44:27.064 --> 00:44:29.066
no one makes records anymore. By
the way, I will tell you here,

00:44:29.066 --> 00:44:31.068
but I'm going to talk more in
detail about the badges

00:44:31.068 --> 00:44:33.070
tomorrow, but I will tell you
that we printed hatch as many LP

00:44:33.070 --> 00:44:35.072
records that Taylor swift has
put out in her entire career.

00:44:35.072 --> 00:44:37.074
Also, the vinyl in these, when
they came here, weighed over two

00:44:37.074 --> 00:44:39.076
tons. That's how many people are
going to be at DEF CON this

00:44:39.076 --> 00:44:41.078
year. Any other questions? I
almost forgot! Thank you for

00:44:41.078 --> 00:44:43.080
reminding me. Those of you that
follow me on Twitter, I got a

00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:45.082
tweet back from William
Schattner. Are you a fan? Fake

00:44:45.082 --> 00:44:47.084
it if you are not. I'm going to
stick with our own policy and I

00:44:47.084 --> 00:44:49.086
would like to take a selfie per
request of William Schattner of

00:44:49.086 --> 00:44:51.088
this sign. I'm going to hold my
phone up and send it to him. [

00:44:51.088 --> 00:44:53.090
LAUGHTER ] Thank you. [ APPLAUSE
] These are for tomorrow and I'm

00:44:53.090 --> 00:44:55.092
going to explain in detail. This
is an Uber badge. This year,

00:44:55.092 --> 00:44:57.094
there are six radioactive
badges. I'm going to explain

00:44:57.094 --> 00:44:59.096
that tomorrow. Thank you for
coming. [ APPLAUSE ]
