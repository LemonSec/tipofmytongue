00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.272
All right So we're ready to go
it 6 oclock First of I want to

00:00:05.272 --> 00:00:13.080
thank everyone for coming out so
late. Your coming in for my talk

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.885
so I guess theres a lot of
competitions here I am

00:00:17.885 --> 00:00:21.388
unfortuantely not as funny as
some of the other host right

00:00:21.388 --> 00:00:24.224
now. So this is staying
persistent in software defined

00:00:24.224 --> 00:00:27.527
networks. My name is Gregory
Pickett with hell fire security.

00:00:27.527 --> 00:00:33.133
I am part of the cyber security
operation group. Over view of

00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:39.206
todays talk White box
internet What is it? Its not

00:00:39.206 --> 00:00:43.477
common knowledge right now.
Emerging really. After that is

00:00:43.477 --> 00:00:48.348
stupid is as stupid does. Next
is exploiting it. Pointing

00:00:48.348 --> 00:00:52.920
number a witnesses and how we
can take advantage of them. Next

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.891
is moving forward. How do we
remediate and also to mitigate

00:00:57.891 --> 00:01:02.729
those weakness and vulnerability
how do they evolve. And finally

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:08.535
wrapping up where this taking is
us and where we can accomplish.

00:01:08.535 --> 00:01:14.341
What I am trying to accomplish
like talk like this. All right

00:01:14.341 --> 00:01:19.179
let start wipe box Ethernet.
Well is standard hardware. Blank

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:25.018
slate. Running merchant silicon
trident and broadcon chip sets.

00:01:25.018 --> 00:01:29.423
Intel AMD power pc processers.
Using an open operating system

00:01:29.423 --> 00:01:35.295
that is often Linux. So I think
I dont see that it is not

00:01:35.295 --> 00:01:40.133
linux. The idea is to move the
hardware from the equation. To

00:01:40.133 --> 00:01:43.570
make it a commodity by using off
the shelf components. So from

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.241
that point forward will be the
software that will make the

00:01:48.241 --> 00:01:52.446
difference. It is critical for
software to find working. But it

00:01:52.446 --> 00:01:57.651
can be use without it. Of course
question, why do it. Why are we

00:01:57.651 --> 00:02:01.688
moving to this direction? Well
the same reason why theyre

00:02:01.688 --> 00:02:05.892
implementing software to find
that working. Reducing cost.

00:02:05.892 --> 00:02:08.462
Increasing flexibility. Looking
of course to gain more control.

00:02:08.462 --> 00:02:14.334
From can gain the control to
means can you actually remote to

00:02:14.334 --> 00:02:19.806
white box either switch SHH you
can issue command to define the

00:02:19.806 --> 00:02:24.845
switch the bigger the network
like you would with a regular

00:02:24.845 --> 00:02:28.982
switch traditional switch. Can
you also script for management

00:02:28.982 --> 00:02:34.921
purposes or you can load an
agent on it a puppet. Chef. To

00:02:34.921 --> 00:02:39.026
make a part Def ops right this
network automation

00:02:39.026 --> 00:02:43.597
orchestration. Or you can gain
that control with software to

00:02:43.597 --> 00:02:46.800
find networking. Software define
networking control plane,

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.837
essentializing the controller.
This makes the network flexible

00:02:50.837 --> 00:02:53.740
and of course responsive.
Everything in software.

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:59.046
[Inaudible] hardware data plain.
White box even in your data ban.

00:02:59.046 --> 00:03:04.918
The data plan because just as
flexible. Use what ever you

00:03:04.918 --> 00:03:09.189
want. You're not tie into
vendors. Propriety hardware.

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:14.528
Your Technology. Any sort of
command you know requires cisco

00:03:14.528 --> 00:03:20.400
certified are required that sort
of things to point out one

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.371
particular vendor you're hooked
with and stuck with them right.

00:03:24.371 --> 00:03:30.377
All right. Now to make all this
possible to make white box

00:03:32.746 --> 00:03:38.819
essentially plug and play they
adapt to oni. Its firmware for

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:43.890
bare mineral network switches.
They're a booth underneath.

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:50.530
Which you grab to booth the
system. And then oni is there to

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.532
booth the network. You grab
install conference system. And

00:03:52.532 --> 00:03:54.534
in the event you like a new one
you can change the software and

00:03:54.534 --> 00:03:59.372
then go grab a new one a
conference install. Different

00:03:59.372 --> 00:04:04.377
one. Change whenever you like.
Onnie comes pre-installed on

00:04:04.377 --> 00:04:09.382
network switches part of the
firmware and automates that

00:04:09.382 --> 00:04:13.386
switch deployment. So white box
internet. The blank slate and

00:04:13.386 --> 00:04:20.627
Oni that boot order what could
go wrong? There are number of

00:04:20.627 --> 00:04:25.532
weakness in operating system.
Onee is linux based. Privilege

00:04:25.532 --> 00:04:32.205
account The has no password and
ONEE will not foresee you to

00:04:32.205 --> 00:04:37.177
change the password. It remain
still. Management services. Use

00:04:37.177 --> 00:04:42.716
tolnet. Insecure by design. HSS
is weak too. Insulation mode,

00:04:42.716 --> 00:04:49.756
key is only 18 bits in each
computer. Hyper mode 26 bits not

00:04:49.756 --> 00:04:53.727
looking good so far. The
installer has weaknesses as

00:04:53.727 --> 00:04:57.597
well. It uses a set of
predicable URLs as well as

00:04:57.597 --> 00:05:01.735
define in the standard. One year
off fist and another year after

00:05:01.735 --> 00:05:05.172
that basically goes through
series of URLS better define by

00:05:05.172 --> 00:05:09.309
the standard by the process is
does cares out the install and

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:12.913
where is goes it is very defined
in the standard for stalk you

00:05:12.913 --> 00:05:16.516
get or you get the exact URL
from DHCP. After the assignment.

00:05:16.516 --> 00:05:24.124
After that build the URL from
the DHCP response, after that

00:05:24.124 --> 00:05:30.130
look to neighbor for insulation
and from that that fail go to

00:05:32.365 --> 00:05:36.469
protective waterfall so is very
predictable where onee is going

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:39.206
to be looking. And when we
arrive to a particular location

00:05:39.206 --> 00:05:43.944
it goes then and looks for a
particular file. Then it goes to

00:05:43.944 --> 00:05:47.614
a series of particular filenames
better define by the standard.

00:05:47.614 --> 00:05:53.053
So as an attacker we know head
of time where we are going to be

00:05:53.053 --> 00:05:57.524
looking. And you know ahead of
time what you are asking for. So

00:05:57.524 --> 00:06:00.961
you can hand onee a compromised
installation and onee will

00:06:00.961 --> 00:06:04.030
install and that's possible.
Because there is no encryption

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:10.036
no authentication. So should you
hand Onee a compromised

00:06:12.138 --> 00:06:15.842
installation any sort of the
installation. Once that

00:06:15.842 --> 00:06:20.046
compromised is running Ones
partition is exposed. Exposed

00:06:20.046 --> 00:06:24.551
that could be modify. Be itself
be compromised. And those secure

00:06:24.551 --> 00:06:28.255
boot there is really nothing
could stop that compromise

00:06:28.255 --> 00:06:31.524
installation. And it can
compromise Onee and will

00:06:31.524 --> 00:06:34.928
continue to operate over and
over again and doing what ever

00:06:34.928 --> 00:06:40.267
the intruders told it to do.
that means what does this mean

00:06:40.267 --> 00:06:45.205
of course? With all these
weaknesses. There a lot of

00:06:45.205 --> 00:06:49.442
opportunity to blow Onee up. It
is not very well protected. So

00:06:49.442 --> 00:06:54.347
you can blow it up. And first
stop of course is to compromise

00:06:54.347 --> 00:06:58.518
it directly. With the root
password starts with blank.

00:06:58.518 --> 00:07:03.056
[inaudible] And you could of
course log in. We could sniff

00:07:03.056 --> 00:07:08.495
the traffic. Apply a man in
middle modify. try to close the

00:07:08.495 --> 00:07:13.967
telnet, or easily access the SSH
but that's not likely. Onee just

00:07:13.967 --> 00:07:18.972
throwing a number up 0.0001% Its
job is to install conference

00:07:18.972 --> 00:07:24.878
system all 45 seconds. Once it
is done with that it does a

00:07:24.878 --> 00:07:28.948
reboot variable. [inaudible]
Reboot the switch and then the

00:07:28.948 --> 00:07:34.854
conference system and will run
for the rest of the time. Like a

00:07:34.854 --> 00:07:39.726
99.9% of the time. Next slide is
can be compromise the

00:07:39.726 --> 00:07:45.465
installation rouge DHCP server.
From the IPv6 neighbor Or maybe

00:07:45.465 --> 00:07:49.569
spoof a Kvp server. Also very
difficult. So is like right

00:07:49.569 --> 00:07:53.506
place right time. If you happen
to be there at the right time

00:07:53.506 --> 00:07:59.145
you get it, you get comes
insulation to it, you're there

00:07:59.145 --> 00:08:05.318
for however long but you don't
gain that nirvana layer which is

00:08:05.318 --> 00:08:09.756
persistent. Are you going to be
in the right place right time

00:08:09.756 --> 00:08:12.959
again? So is there a better way.
Compromising it indirectly. You

00:08:12.959 --> 00:08:18.965
know the conferences is good and
will be up 99.9% of the time.

00:08:21.201 --> 00:08:24.537
See what you have to work with.
You're passing in our conference

00:08:24.537 --> 00:08:29.142
system. Modify only. we have an
exposed partition. Take

00:08:29.142 --> 00:08:34.714
advantage of that. Compromise
Onee no secure box is stopping

00:08:34.714 --> 00:08:39.352
you from doing this and take
advantage of ONEE. So over and

00:08:39.352 --> 00:08:45.291
over again. Onee will keep doing
that you told it to do.

00:08:45.291 --> 00:08:49.262
Compromise our conference
system. Now you compromise Onee

00:08:49.262 --> 00:08:54.200
and every time a new conference
is installed youre basically

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:59.139
back again. Now you're in the
firmware, your essentially there

00:08:59.139 --> 00:09:04.077
forever. And that's we are
looking for as attackers or

00:09:04.077 --> 00:09:08.548
white head penetration we are
looking for that persistent.

00:09:08.548 --> 00:09:12.118
Network operating systems,
installed by ONEE operate the

00:09:12.118 --> 00:09:14.754
switch to do all the packet
forwarding and all the different

00:09:14.754 --> 00:09:18.324
features that you like to see in
the switch. Onee compiled the

00:09:18.324 --> 00:09:24.130
distributions right. There a lot
of network operating systems but

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:28.601
only a handful that have ONIE
compatible distributions. And

00:09:28.601 --> 00:09:31.971
the number is growing. And they
just edit peak 8 a couple of

00:09:31.971 --> 00:09:35.208
months ago. But when I started
this there was only about 4 that

00:09:35.208 --> 00:09:40.280
were really prevalent. First is
open network Linux after that is

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:47.353
switch light QX linux and non
XOS. Open network linux

00:09:47.353 --> 00:09:51.090
distribution for bare metals
with is switches. And of course

00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:54.828
as they are all are. Debian in
Linux is very popular. Bare

00:09:54.828 --> 00:09:58.865
bones no features. It will run
the switch but you are going to

00:09:58.865 --> 00:10:01.935
have a really hard time finding
the switch configuring the

00:10:01.935 --> 00:10:05.371
network because it is really
just a reference. Is a started

00:10:05.371 --> 00:10:09.375
that could open project came up
with. They want you to use this

00:10:09.375 --> 00:10:11.878
to develop your own network
operating system. Obviously

00:10:11.878 --> 00:10:15.882
there to promote ONNE so you are
getting them a starter. So they

00:10:15.882 --> 00:10:19.619
are telling you to start a new
connection that will run with

00:10:19.619 --> 00:10:23.022
Onee. And that's what switch
light did. I looked at version

00:10:23.022 --> 00:10:29.028
2.6. Is a package open network
clinic. That took that starter.

00:10:31.664 --> 00:10:37.570
They added SO rest which
operates allot like OBS 2 B to

00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:41.174
define the switch. [inaudible]
Open flow agent for loading the

00:10:41.174 --> 00:10:45.211
flow tables like configure the
network. It is not a standalone.

00:10:45.211 --> 00:10:48.648
Is really is a part of a total
solution called big cloud

00:10:48.648 --> 00:10:50.917
fabric. The idea is to plug the
ideas in the network and big

00:10:50.917 --> 00:10:55.655
cloud fabric will take over. You
are actively discourage from

00:10:55.655 --> 00:11:00.360
managing the switches. And for
all instance and purposes at

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:06.032
least while look at it to ban
the network switch fabric we

00:11:06.032 --> 00:11:11.104
will see the how well that turns
out. And of course the whole the

00:11:11.104 --> 00:11:15.808
total solution is maintained by
big switch networks. We should

00:11:15.808 --> 00:11:22.782
next look at 2.5.4 is important
to know that I'm looking at the

00:11:22.782 --> 00:11:27.120
latest versions were so I want
you to know what those versions

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:33.960
were. Based on debeian Linux as
well. You install puppet chief

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:38.464
antible cicada network
environment manage the rest of

00:11:38.464 --> 00:11:41.434
your infrastructure. And is
maintaining by cumulous

00:11:41.434 --> 00:11:47.473
networks. Finally we have non
SOS this is version 3.3.4. Based

00:11:47.473 --> 00:11:54.214
on enterprise base5. There is a
newer version 3.4 but it turns

00:11:54.214 --> 00:11:59.085
out all the problems that 3.3
has they're still there on 3.4

00:11:59.085 --> 00:12:04.057
just thought you should know
that. You would install puppet

00:12:04.057 --> 00:12:08.861
chef. Antible to make it part of
a ops amounted or e switch or to

00:12:08.861 --> 00:12:14.601
make a part of an SDM
environment it is very flexible.

00:12:14.601 --> 00:12:17.704
Maintain by technologies. So we
of course this is what I do

00:12:17.704 --> 00:12:21.774
here. Introduce you to these and
then talk about really the

00:12:21.774 --> 00:12:25.578
weaknesses. No encryption no
authentication on switch light

00:12:25.578 --> 00:12:30.550
indigo. Nor V switch. With
indigo its a matter of spoofing

00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:36.556
the controller. E-switch you
just talk to it. It will listen

00:12:39.158 --> 00:12:45.164
to whatever you tell and will do
what you tell it to do. Outdated

00:13:11.424 --> 00:13:13.426
open SSL this is done because
honestly I need to fill the

00:13:13.426 --> 00:13:15.428
slide a little bit. I didn't
want a lot of blank spaces. So

00:13:15.428 --> 00:13:17.430
they're running a bit behind
open SSL and when I saw it I

00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:19.432
think did check that and hard
bleed is not a problem. As

00:13:19.432 --> 00:13:21.434
someone was looking at these
they think. How hard these

00:13:21.434 --> 00:13:23.436
environments are I dont like to
see old software I dont think

00:13:23.436 --> 00:13:25.438
any of us do. So with no
encryption or authentication on

00:13:25.438 --> 00:13:27.440
these of course these are normal
to topology flow or modification

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:29.442
through unauthorized access. Add
access, remove access, hide

00:13:29.442 --> 00:13:31.444
traffic change traffic. I
mentioned in the press a bit

00:13:31.444 --> 00:13:33.446
about east dropping and that's
of course what would likely

00:13:33.446 --> 00:13:35.481
happens on a switch light
network on non SLS not running

00:13:35.481 --> 00:13:40.119
an e switch. But there are
bigger problems and this is what

00:13:40.119 --> 00:13:44.557
is going to end up leading to
the persistent. Start up with

00:13:44.557 --> 00:13:48.828
something rather simple. Default
switch accounts. Switch light

00:13:48.828 --> 00:13:54.667
has admin. Cumulus has cumulous
and non xos has admin which is

00:13:54.667 --> 00:13:58.337
low priveledge or safe accounts.
These is big deal for two

00:13:58.337 --> 00:14:03.376
reasons. First that you have a
limited ability to add other

00:14:03.376 --> 00:14:09.115
uses. You have stuck with these
guys. [inaudible] But I'm going

00:14:09.115 --> 00:14:13.786
to show you some command
injection. Get around these

00:14:13.786 --> 00:14:19.092
limitations as I mentioned they
try to put on. Show that in a

00:14:19.092 --> 00:14:22.395
bit here and then the second
reason is a big deal because

00:14:22.395 --> 00:14:26.866
these accounts are the only
obsticle and only obstacle that

00:14:26.866 --> 00:14:31.771
would get you on the switches
which didnt sound so good

00:14:31.771 --> 00:14:37.577
right? This would tap your key
log in and the switch is yours

00:14:37.577 --> 00:14:42.949
and then the network. All right
and this is where all that

00:14:42.949 --> 00:14:48.154
begins. Easiest gate to show.
Switch light uses a wrapper type

00:14:48.154 --> 00:14:50.723
enable debug bash you are at the
shell. QX Linus you are actually

00:14:50.723 --> 00:14:55.428
connect to the operating system
and so you dont need to do any

00:14:55.428 --> 00:15:02.735
escape you already at the shell.
SOS well it has a very done

00:15:02.735 --> 00:15:09.475
shell however puppets there and
puppet do dirty work for you. So

00:15:09.475 --> 00:15:15.114
puppet will actually open up
back door which is not

00:15:15.114 --> 00:15:18.151
confrontation but will find it
if you pack the firmware always

00:15:18.151 --> 00:15:25.491
helpful and when you have that
shell you get instant elevation.

00:15:25.491 --> 00:15:31.697
You immediately become ready and
switch light turns out admin is

00:15:31.697 --> 00:15:35.468
UID is 0. But when you have that
shell are you immediately out

00:15:35.468 --> 00:15:41.941
wreck. So cumulous you have
unrestricted sudo access so you

00:15:41.941 --> 00:15:46.579
are a rouge equipment which is
also not good. And SOS you start

00:15:46.579 --> 00:15:50.917
the back door with admin so
running under admin privileges

00:15:50.917 --> 00:15:54.153
and when you exit back door and
you take a look at your UID it

00:15:54.153 --> 00:16:00.159
turn out that you are UID 0 also
ready privileges that one

00:16:03.129 --> 00:16:06.566
password get that out of the way
we know that to compromising a

00:16:06.566 --> 00:16:12.338
work station is trivial. Key
logging is trivial needs to full

00:16:12.338 --> 00:16:14.474
control of your network. First
the switch and then the network

00:16:14.474 --> 00:16:18.978
with authorized Access high
traffic change traffic. All

00:16:18.978 --> 00:16:22.181
three app systems. And then of
course compromise from the frame

00:16:22.181 --> 00:16:26.118
work on authorized x which gives
you access to the flash. Which

00:16:26.118 --> 00:16:31.858
gives you access to onee you can
do whatever you want on it. You

00:16:31.858 --> 00:16:35.995
can modify your firmware work
compromise. So your network is

00:16:35.995 --> 00:16:41.334
one key logger away. I'm going
to show you this here. Last year

00:16:41.334 --> 00:16:46.272
I did open source. Easy to get
access to. People always ask

00:16:46.272 --> 00:16:50.409
about vendor products because
you pay money good money for

00:16:50.409 --> 00:16:55.348
good vendor products and you
want to see if the money you

00:16:55.348 --> 00:17:01.120
paid is worth it. This year I
decided to make a point of using

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:06.058
vendor products and run test on
the vendor products as soon as

00:17:06.058 --> 00:17:10.997
you pay for and expect to be
better secure right? Thats what

00:17:10.997 --> 00:17:16.335
they claim. And in some case
they are but we want to make

00:17:16.335 --> 00:17:21.107
sure that they're are what they
say they are. So I start looking

00:17:21.107 --> 00:17:25.278
at these vendor products running
on equipment, network equipment.

00:17:25.278 --> 00:17:29.949
I started with big cloud fabric
controller. And I log in as

00:17:29.949 --> 00:17:33.686
admin as a little privilege
user. Look through the command.

00:17:33.686 --> 00:17:38.891
I like the word bash that word
sounds good to me and got shell

00:17:38.891 --> 00:17:42.962
there and if you are paying
attention on the account slide

00:17:42.962 --> 00:17:47.433
you saw what that is hidden and
disabled? They wanted you to

00:17:47.433 --> 00:17:51.170
stay away. Discourage you from
touching the switch. They want

00:17:51.170 --> 00:17:56.008
to big cloud fabric to take care
of everything. so with that in

00:17:56.008 --> 00:18:00.446
mind we have hidden and stable
account. They don't want you to

00:18:00.446 --> 00:18:04.917
touch the switch. they dont
want you to touch that. There is

00:18:04.917 --> 00:18:09.388
no password on that. So how
likely are you to change that

00:18:09.388 --> 00:18:14.226
password? All the hidden stable
does is to log you in. Once you

00:18:14.226 --> 00:18:18.097
have shell you can go ahead and
switch over with your password

00:18:18.097 --> 00:18:21.734
then you are of course
immediately right there. So I'm

00:18:21.734 --> 00:18:24.704
thinking to myself. I wonder if
I can do that on switch light.

00:18:24.704 --> 00:18:30.710
So I log in as admin do a little
extra word there. Type enable

00:18:33.212 --> 00:18:39.418
first. Give a bash and I came it
as what I was a bit surprise. So

00:18:39.418 --> 00:18:44.423
check my new ID and it turns out
that UID 0. So I like that. And

00:18:44.423 --> 00:18:51.464
where he have where he so we
have access there as well. I

00:18:51.464 --> 00:18:57.937
think I start looking around for
flash devices. And there is one

00:18:57.937 --> 00:19:04.977
nice and named. ONEE. So we see
with the privileges we need to

00:19:04.977 --> 00:19:11.984
write to it. So that's good we
got that. Cumulous I want sudo

00:19:11.984 --> 00:19:19.025
it up. I can just go ahead FC
shadow change the pass and

00:19:19.025 --> 00:19:24.430
switch do whatever you want.
Sudo everything. And then mill

00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:28.267
knocks, I will open the back
door I will tell you what that

00:19:28.267 --> 00:19:34.273
is soon. At the end there. Net
cad very useful, connect it to

00:19:46.118 --> 00:19:50.556
the back door. Admin obviously
and I cad I see password. Admin

00:19:50.556 --> 00:19:55.695
at UID 0. And the then an extra
account. Good to know other ways

00:19:55.695 --> 00:20:00.466
to get in. Extra account there
at UID 0. And I mention with

00:20:00.466 --> 00:20:03.536
cummulous there are ways to
restrict informations. Since you

00:20:03.536 --> 00:20:07.706
are dealing directly with linux.
You can add new users. there are

00:20:07.706 --> 00:20:15.181
some management problems though.
And in the tool that [inaudible]

00:20:15.181 --> 00:20:20.219
gives you for low privilege or
less privilege users. And source

00:20:20.219 --> 00:20:24.824
and limitations. So sorry
QXlenux what do you know about

00:20:24.824 --> 00:20:30.830
this. Now I necessary don't come
out with a lot 0 days and sort

00:20:37.803 --> 00:20:41.707
of brand new vulnerability of a
product. I dont celebrate. Is

00:20:41.707 --> 00:20:45.578
show off. Yes, across the top
there. QX Linux several command

00:20:45.578 --> 00:20:49.482
land tools. That they have set
aside for less privilege users.

00:20:49.482 --> 00:20:54.086
I won't name them cause they are
tongue ties. They are meant to

00:20:54.086 --> 00:20:58.324
be used by low privilege admin
account just taken care of the

00:20:58.324 --> 00:21:02.228
switch you go ahead and enter
your arguments some commands and

00:21:02.228 --> 00:21:05.397
perimeters. Though some command
and parameters get pass to

00:21:05.397 --> 00:21:09.635
server. I can say that pretty
well. And that goes to the

00:21:09.635 --> 00:21:12.204
comparison with rosette. Rosette
basically this is what's

00:21:12.204 --> 00:21:15.641
acceptable. And its acceptable
it lets it through. Problem is

00:21:15.641 --> 00:21:17.643
there is command injection there
is filter basically. There is a

00:21:17.643 --> 00:21:21.714
command injection that allows
you by pass with filter. So

00:21:21.714 --> 00:21:27.386
basically have to have sudo
server to do whatever you want.

00:21:27.386 --> 00:21:33.559
Rosetta or not. And run is
ready. Sort of limitation to put

00:21:33.559 --> 00:21:40.766
on you. And you can go ahead and
side step those. I'm running out

00:21:40.766 --> 00:21:47.973
of switch again so here we go
that is a switch with a license

00:21:47.973 --> 00:21:54.146
and [inaudible] Im hoping. so
there it is running on a switch

00:21:54.146 --> 00:21:59.852
there CMB server I'm going to go
and demonstrate this. I'm not as

00:21:59.852 --> 00:22:05.024
resourceful as the guy that
brought a whole safe here. I

00:22:05.024 --> 00:22:11.564
dont want to carry or ship a
top of the line switch onto a

00:22:11.564 --> 00:22:16.936
plane. Right. So we are going to
go head and make sure I get my

00:22:16.936 --> 00:22:22.942
address for this. I already have
it. I'm a low per it user. I got

00:22:31.817 --> 00:22:37.823
a lots of VM running here. Take
just a second here. Okay. Is off

00:22:40.492 --> 00:22:46.498
the screen again. All right.
Here we go. I have a touch pad

00:22:52.504 --> 00:22:58.510
up here. Im greedy. And of
course I have limitations Im a

00:23:03.616 --> 00:23:09.622
low privilege user. Let say I
forgot the command injection.

00:23:12.858 --> 00:23:18.063
They have patched this for
already. I don't feel so bad.

00:23:18.063 --> 00:23:23.035
But were going through this
with complete detail. So I that

00:23:23.035 --> 00:23:28.340
one tool that I have sudo
privileges for. And there is my

00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:33.912
arguments. What I have done I
have injected so that my second

00:23:33.912 --> 00:23:38.550
command my injected command
looks like part of the label.

00:23:38.550 --> 00:23:43.889
You have to do that. You have to
otherwise it looks at that label

00:23:43.889 --> 00:23:48.127
that first piece command tries
to process it. And of course

00:23:48.127 --> 00:23:51.897
there rosette and it fails. I
need to shove it all together so

00:23:51.897 --> 00:23:58.537
it sees all the label and it
ignores it. There is no VM there

00:23:58.537 --> 00:24:02.608
is no guts right there. But it
does stand on command. But

00:24:02.608 --> 00:24:06.612
inject nonetheless. Now you
notice there no spaces there and

00:24:06.612 --> 00:24:12.184
to get around that. You go ahead
and make a script. Put a script

00:24:12.184 --> 00:24:16.188
here. You have your own low
privilege home directory. And

00:24:16.188 --> 00:24:20.592
put any command that you want
out there. Just adds another

00:24:20.592 --> 00:24:27.833
user with no sudo limitations.
You dont see anything. A little

00:24:27.833 --> 00:24:33.839
bit of a clichÈ. Here we go.
Then I have everything there. No

00:24:42.214 --> 00:24:48.220
claps? [ APPLAUSE ] >> Thank
you. We worked all year for

00:24:51.056 --> 00:24:56.228
clap, come on. All right. I
dont feel satisfied. I feel

00:24:56.228 --> 00:25:02.835
fulfilled. So this will by pass
any sort of sudo limitation, for

00:25:02.835 --> 00:25:07.806
password change and use your
account but obviously you don't

00:25:07.806 --> 00:25:14.913
want nobody to know that are you
around. So I'm going to go head

00:25:14.913 --> 00:25:20.919
exit and pause my VMs. So I can
use resources. All right am I

00:25:28.594 --> 00:25:34.800
back on this screen all the way?
So once you of course have your

00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:38.637
privileges this live switch you
can go ahead and you can look

00:25:38.637 --> 00:25:44.543
for the entity devices and find
onee dump from the block device.

00:25:44.543 --> 00:25:49.648
You have your privileges right
there to modify and put it back.

00:25:49.648 --> 00:25:55.454
A big part of this implication
there is been talk about this of

00:25:55.454 --> 00:26:01.226
course. That this is the kind of
problem. We have grown up with

00:26:01.226 --> 00:26:05.230
other issues with different
types of devices. Is important

00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:09.234
to know that personal
implications are greater. If you

00:26:09.234 --> 00:26:13.672
have a former [inaudible] single
server. Yeah is important data

00:26:13.672 --> 00:26:19.011
but it is a single server. But
if you have a firmware

00:26:19.011 --> 00:26:23.482
compromise kernel not possible
on your switch. You have the

00:26:23.482 --> 00:26:27.486
network on. One server, whole
network. Bigger implication. And

00:26:27.486 --> 00:26:32.825
an important to talk about how
this is done because they assume

00:26:32.825 --> 00:26:37.696
is done firewall is safe. We
want to talk about scenarios

00:26:37.696 --> 00:26:41.400
that are very possible. That
makes it not as safe as they

00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:44.503
think it is. So I'm going to
play the go tee. The admin

00:26:44.503 --> 00:26:47.606
administrator. And just going to
have a number of difference

00:26:47.606 --> 00:26:51.043
ways. You can browse the
internet. You need to drive by

00:26:51.043 --> 00:26:54.813
and download. You can open a bad
attachment that's what I'm going

00:26:54.813 --> 00:26:58.550
to do. I'm going to be infected
a piece of malware [inaudible]

00:26:58.550 --> 00:27:01.720
that i put together named big
malware. Now big brother is

00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:08.293
going to do is a uno binary that
will infect the window system

00:27:08.293 --> 00:27:13.131
and is going to key log off the
ones that you are stuck with.

00:27:13.131 --> 00:27:17.302
For simplicity sake. Very easy
can get key log in with the

00:27:17.302 --> 00:27:21.340
connection of the switch. Once
big brother sees one of these

00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:24.877
accounts in use, key logs a
password. As a network

00:27:24.877 --> 00:27:28.814
administrator you going to touch
the switch at some point in

00:27:28.814 --> 00:27:33.785
time. You are going to log in
and it will wait for you for

00:27:33.785 --> 00:27:38.423
days. When you do this your done
usually you're done well he logs

00:27:38.423 --> 00:27:41.960
in. And he writes a Linux
compatible binary to the

00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:45.163
switches file system. Nothing is
downloaded from the internet.

00:27:45.163 --> 00:27:48.367
Carrying himself his payload it
self [inaudible] a little

00:27:48.367 --> 00:27:52.271
brother. Writes it out. Unpacks
the little brother from the back

00:27:52.271 --> 00:27:55.541
door. He unpacks the firmware
shoves a little brother in

00:27:55.541 --> 00:28:00.746
there. And you know what are big
brothers are for right? Reps his

00:28:00.746 --> 00:28:05.417
only back up put onee back.
Before he does this he modifies

00:28:05.417 --> 00:28:10.722
onee so that any time onee
installs in a conference system

00:28:10.722 --> 00:28:16.728
onee also puts little brother
back. And thats persistence

00:28:20.832 --> 00:28:23.168
over and over again. So overtime
you install in the conference

00:28:23.168 --> 00:28:25.304
system little brother comes
back. But it doesnt stop there.

00:28:25.304 --> 00:28:27.739
Hes a big brother. He helps
out. He pivots. He connects

00:28:27.739 --> 00:28:31.009
little brother in the back door.
And he is also connected to a C2

00:28:31.009 --> 00:28:34.813
server. And the C2 server can
come anywhere. This helps it

00:28:34.813 --> 00:28:41.653
pass Dlans, ACL, firewalls, what
he does he browses. It is a

00:28:41.653 --> 00:28:47.059
reverse HTTP shell. Uses header
and cable abusive using a proxy.

00:28:47.059 --> 00:28:53.365
Likes to blend in. Relay command
between little brother and NC 2.

00:28:53.365 --> 00:28:58.737
Out in the great wild world. So
with are going to demonstrate

00:28:58.737 --> 00:29:04.743
this. Got that attachment here.
Im not a malware writer. Is a

00:29:10.649 --> 00:29:16.188
little [inaudible] not really?
It does hide a little bit but

00:29:16.188 --> 00:29:21.560
not hard to find. Make sure he
is running there. Then as

00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:27.599
network administrator. You know
I've got [inaudible] I move on

00:29:27.599 --> 00:29:33.372
with the rest of my day. At some
point in time I'm going to touch

00:29:33.372 --> 00:29:39.378
that switch. It works. This and
a wrapper is like switch light.

00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:47.586
All command to get to the shell.
This is actually what big

00:29:51.123 --> 00:29:57.129
brother would be escaping him.
Now I'm going to double check

00:29:59.765 --> 00:30:06.705
just because the demo gods and
all. There. All right. What Ive

00:30:06.705 --> 00:30:12.711
done to this thing. We're going
to go to C2. A little bit of a

00:30:27.225 --> 00:30:33.598
delay there. So is going to fire
up. So its works like a little

00:30:33.598 --> 00:30:37.336
bit web server. Of course right.
Something browsing. Just going

00:30:37.336 --> 00:30:40.839
to go head and listen and as
soon as the connection is made

00:30:40.839 --> 00:30:45.711
we'll is a prompt a little bit
slow in starting up. Hopefully

00:30:45.711 --> 00:30:52.851
it will come up soon. There we
go. Can we get that on the

00:30:52.851 --> 00:30:55.787
screen? So little brother has
been started the connection has

00:30:55.787 --> 00:31:00.659
been made. And the big brother
has started C2. There is though

00:31:00.659 --> 00:31:06.465
relay on anything. Its gonna
load x to Little brother behind

00:31:06.465 --> 00:31:12.270
whatever firewall that's there.
Then move around a bit and look

00:31:12.270 --> 00:31:18.110
at that switch real quick. So
theres some timing. Wait Just

00:31:18.110 --> 00:31:24.950
need to be patient. There you
go. So we found a file systems

00:31:24.950 --> 00:31:29.421
error. But things are not
forever. Entirely, some point in

00:31:29.421 --> 00:31:33.625
time to be notice what this
mysterious connection. As an

00:31:33.625 --> 00:31:39.097
administrative you may see this
sort of thing. You might see a

00:31:39.097 --> 00:31:43.668
strange connection. You might
freak out. You go, who installed

00:31:43.668 --> 00:31:48.206
that operating system. We really
fix things so much. Especially

00:31:48.206 --> 00:31:52.778
with device like this. The
desktop. We re-image right. So

00:31:52.778 --> 00:31:58.250
we go head and we re-image. Its
an infection. Right, thats what

00:31:58.250 --> 00:32:04.189
we do. I'm going to go head and
bring up onee and install

00:32:04.189 --> 00:32:07.559
another file system network
operating system. This one

00:32:07.559 --> 00:32:13.565
happens to demo operating
system. That's going to do it.

00:32:17.536 --> 00:32:25.410
When it comes up and well go
ahead. Im going to stop this

00:32:25.410 --> 00:32:31.183
because its obnoxious. I'm going
to get my command and get my

00:32:31.183 --> 00:32:37.189
operating system. I did this
because I did not have access to

00:32:44.496 --> 00:32:50.602
the operating system at the
time. I did this but I made sure

00:32:50.602 --> 00:32:54.472
it operated just like switch
light. I wanted to be realistic.

00:32:54.472 --> 00:33:02.113
So Im going to do a thing.
Were gonna move onto fixing

00:33:02.113 --> 00:33:06.852
this short of stuff and we'll
come back and see little brother

00:33:06.852 --> 00:33:11.923
resurrected. I have been
characterizing as poor choices.

00:33:11.923 --> 00:33:17.929
And that is what we have seen
with the vendors. This is about

00:33:21.700 --> 00:33:27.505
fixing it. The solution in
addressing primarily vendor and

00:33:27.505 --> 00:33:30.242
what they're going to have to
do. Have hardware. Install

00:33:30.242 --> 00:33:33.879
environment, inter conference
systems agents inter-mediation

00:33:33.879 --> 00:33:39.618
stuff. The vendor stuff is in
mediation. And for network

00:33:39.618 --> 00:33:41.920
administrators themselves
architects right it changes

00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:44.723
enterprise architecture from
mitigation. things that you have

00:33:44.723 --> 00:33:50.428
to do in the meantime. Hardware
obviously. Trusted platform

00:33:50.428 --> 00:33:55.867
module. Im sure big network has
put in for bay switches. You

00:33:55.867 --> 00:34:02.674
know there are not any new power
PC designs I have not heard of

00:34:02.674 --> 00:34:08.046
any come up so that maybe
difficult to do for them to add

00:34:08.046 --> 00:34:14.052
them in the power pc switches
and if we can that will be great

00:34:51.723 --> 00:34:53.725
we want to start using TPM. We
want platform security. To make

00:34:53.725 --> 00:34:55.727
sure any short of amount of
modification onee. Onee will not

00:34:55.727 --> 00:34:57.729
fire when the boot fails. And we
know something is wrong. They

00:34:57.729 --> 00:34:59.731
also working on, we get them on
the hardware the next time of

00:34:59.731 --> 00:35:01.733
course to get them in use and
they also working in getting in

00:35:01.733 --> 00:35:03.735
standard as a partnership of
course through the vendor and

00:35:03.735 --> 00:35:05.737
the people that making a
standard is making a slow

00:35:05.737 --> 00:35:07.739
progress but they're working on
it. That is keyless networks.

00:35:07.739 --> 00:35:09.741
The ones that develop onee and
got it adopted they're working

00:35:09.741 --> 00:35:11.743
on that. Install environment.
the root telnet. Is secure we

00:35:11.743 --> 00:35:13.745
can use SSH it is okay. And with
SSH we can increase key entropy.

00:35:13.745 --> 00:35:15.747
Enforce a password change. If we
a capable of remembering a

00:35:15.747 --> 00:35:17.749
password or using a password or
we choose not to. Factory reset.

00:35:17.749 --> 00:35:19.751
You here has not done a factory
reset. We forget these things we

00:35:19.751 --> 00:35:23.121
screw up. Factory reset we can
do that. Remove IPv6 and

00:35:23.121 --> 00:35:27.058
waterfall. There is nothing
wrong in having DHCP provider

00:35:27.058 --> 00:35:30.595
administration URL. We can
protect the DHCP server. We can

00:35:30.595 --> 00:35:34.866
make sure we are only one
running but the half ways of

00:35:34.866 --> 00:35:39.204
doing this. No reason that we
can't use a DHCP server. And of

00:35:39.204 --> 00:35:42.474
course a good one will be
[inaudible] installations best

00:35:42.474 --> 00:35:45.377
one but there is always problems
with keys and signing and that

00:35:45.377 --> 00:35:48.980
sort of thing. Understanding
this problem, ultimately that

00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:55.253
would be the best solution.
Operating system before we hit

00:35:55.253 --> 00:36:00.892
that. Let's check out little
brother. Operating system has

00:36:00.892 --> 00:36:06.498
been installed again. Lets
check out C2. C2 is able to

00:36:06.498 --> 00:36:10.335
issuing a reconnect command. If
you enter a command and you

00:36:10.335 --> 00:36:14.239
don't get anything back you know
there is been a disconnect.

00:36:14.239 --> 00:36:17.442
Likely the network conference
systems needs to be reinstalled

00:36:17.442 --> 00:36:20.712
again. I did that myself so I
know there is disruption there.

00:36:20.712 --> 00:36:24.683
So I'm going to reconnect. Big
brother will close his end of

00:36:24.683 --> 00:36:28.753
the socket. Reestablishes
connection with little brother.

00:36:28.753 --> 00:36:34.759
So there we go. Survive. [
APPLAUSE ] >> Thank you. Thank

00:36:36.861 --> 00:36:43.501
you so much. You have no idea.
Thank you. We still have our

00:36:43.501 --> 00:36:49.207
we're persistent. Ans even after
the installation. All right. As

00:36:49.207 --> 00:36:55.213
operating system. Now we
obviously can't do everything.

00:37:00.218 --> 00:37:06.224
These are ways to harden the
environment. Make this platform

00:37:11.563 --> 00:37:15.200
a lot more than other forms
because theres a lot of writing

00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:18.870
in this firmware. A lot more
than the firmware that we have

00:37:18.870 --> 00:37:21.606
seen. Bigger amply indication
more is being compromise. First

00:37:21.606 --> 00:37:24.743
one changeable names. New ID
accounts. Change new ID 0

00:37:24.743 --> 00:37:27.479
account names. They give us to
do that. These are privilege

00:37:27.479 --> 00:37:31.850
accounts. It will be also be
great if we could add a user.

00:37:31.850 --> 00:37:36.921
But you cannot add users. Now if
you can add user but you have

00:37:36.921 --> 00:37:41.893
two types. Admin and monitor.
Which one you think you will use

00:37:41.893 --> 00:37:45.230
to find, configure to take care
of the switch. Admin right?

00:37:45.230 --> 00:37:48.500
Admin has the able to change the
password. Change the password of

00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:54.506
the original admin. Get your UID
0 back. Force password change.

00:37:56.708 --> 00:37:59.511
Dont awe allow [inaudible] I
dont I have mentioned this in

00:37:59.511 --> 00:38:02.614
Black hat but one thing Ive
seen in network ops is the

00:38:02.614 --> 00:38:05.016
password that they have used,
the shared passwords. First of

00:38:05.016 --> 00:38:07.318
all they usually have a shared
password. And the password

00:38:07.318 --> 00:38:10.088
sticks around for a long time.
They have al to of equipment

00:38:10.088 --> 00:38:12.690
they have a big team. I have
seen those passwords go for

00:38:12.690 --> 00:38:16.361
years and not be changed. So
enforce the password change. And

00:38:16.361 --> 00:38:24.202
of course move UID to 0 for the
admins. And tighten shell

00:38:24.202 --> 00:38:27.772
access. Switch like. I would
like to see a one time password.

00:38:27.772 --> 00:38:30.875
They have self service portals
for support. Why can't they

00:38:30.875 --> 00:38:34.846
self-service them shell the
support to get a one time

00:38:34.846 --> 00:38:39.918
access. Who's going to give it?
Make it more difficult. More

00:38:39.918 --> 00:38:44.689
resilient. How ability the
wrapper? And also with a one

00:38:44.689 --> 00:38:49.794
time password. And now it does a
pretty good job of protecting

00:38:49.794 --> 00:38:55.166
that wrapper, there is a way to
get shell access from the

00:38:55.166 --> 00:38:58.369
wrapper but taking way too long
for me to reverse engineer the

00:38:58.369 --> 00:39:05.877
code. So I took a shortcut.
[inaudible] If you unpack the

00:39:05.877 --> 00:39:09.247
firmware you can get access
there. you can plug that into

00:39:09.247 --> 00:39:15.386
bashing and you're in. If you
have thinking maybe modifying or

00:39:15.386 --> 00:39:19.390
modify puppet modify password or
shadow add user. No, I thought

00:39:19.390 --> 00:39:25.396
of that. Agents. This is common.
STM platform. They're not using

00:39:31.803 --> 00:39:37.041
TLS. So they need to use TLS.
They need to not only use for

00:39:37.041 --> 00:39:41.379
encryption you can also use it
for ops mutual ops. And of

00:39:41.379 --> 00:39:44.616
course there is a concern with
certificates in key

00:39:44.616 --> 00:39:48.953
distribution. But you also have
good ops there. And the DNS to

00:39:48.953 --> 00:39:52.924
do the heavy lifting. Have them
also lift these certificates and

00:39:52.924 --> 00:39:55.960
the keys. And of course
architecture. I see the man in

00:39:55.960 --> 00:40:00.164
the plane. We need more than the
dlamp. We need to get as close

00:40:00.164 --> 00:40:03.234
as you can. I understand it is
difficult physical separation.

00:40:03.234 --> 00:40:07.238
It is already done. Thats why I
say try to get there right. Get

00:40:07.238 --> 00:40:10.575
as close as you can. If you have
been in network ops they have 20

00:40:10.575 --> 00:40:14.279
monitor in that dame wall.
Network admins has two monitor

00:40:14.279 --> 00:40:18.683
and a desktop. Why can you
remote to a jump box. Maximize

00:40:18.683 --> 00:40:22.854
that in one of the monitor and
use it just like you would in

00:40:22.854 --> 00:40:26.791
the workstation. It will take a
little longer to get used to but

00:40:26.791 --> 00:40:29.827
it will up your security
significantly. And then we have

00:40:29.827 --> 00:40:33.765
audit switches. I said the A
word. I have to learn to love

00:40:33.765 --> 00:40:37.802
audit. Its a painful process
but you know. Audit has good

00:40:37.802 --> 00:40:41.572
uses. They are your friends.
Make sure your password changes

00:40:41.572 --> 00:40:49.147
and then it wouldn't hurt to
have only partition to make sure

00:40:49.147 --> 00:40:53.117
it has not change. I have a
couple minutes left and I wanted

00:40:53.117 --> 00:40:58.756
to get to these last slides i
ran out of time for questions

00:40:58.756 --> 00:41:02.694
but we can talk afterwards.
You're seeing something here

00:41:02.694 --> 00:41:05.897
that's familiar, right? Seeing
that just raise your hand? We

00:41:05.897 --> 00:41:09.567
want to talk about once again
about impact and security. And

00:41:09.567 --> 00:41:12.870
keeping pressure on the
developers. And that is why we

00:41:12.870 --> 00:41:17.208
are here right? We are here to
freak them out. And talk about

00:41:17.208 --> 00:41:20.678
the difference that we are
trying to make. Getting product

00:41:20.678 --> 00:41:24.682
speeches to market is important.
They're out to make money and

00:41:24.682 --> 00:41:29.320
they have to be out there first.
But desktop operating system

00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:33.558
have been through this before.
They have something they called

00:41:33.558 --> 00:41:36.961
best practices. I dont think
you're reading them. I think you

00:41:36.961 --> 00:41:39.964
should. I think you should
develop your own best practices.

00:41:39.964 --> 00:41:44.202
Start using them. Cause you are
not. We start this

00:41:44.202 --> 00:41:46.904
merry-go-around again. Every
year at these conference we hack

00:41:46.904 --> 00:41:52.744
it, you fix it. And turn or do
clean up. Hire some for

00:41:52.744 --> 00:41:57.482
security. Your stash or your
small business units or a large

00:41:57.482 --> 00:42:02.253
business with limited amount of
people. One guy for security. We

00:42:02.253 --> 00:42:07.425
have that one guy in the
security that is there all the

00:42:07.425 --> 00:42:11.429
way. So mid way though
development life cycle maybe an

00:42:11.429 --> 00:42:14.699
assessment at the end before you
release the key is the before

00:42:14.699 --> 00:42:20.905
you release. Honestly settle
this thing one in the end and

00:42:20.905 --> 00:42:25.476
when you go try to sell it.
Security can be a feature too.

00:42:25.476 --> 00:42:30.748
All right so we want to make a
difference here. We want to

00:42:30.748 --> 00:42:34.719
learn from desktop and serve the
operating systems. We want you

00:42:34.719 --> 00:42:39.690
to begin to harness these new
platforms dev ops and SDN. For

00:42:39.690 --> 00:42:43.961
most part they are taking over
taking responsible for is

00:42:43.961 --> 00:42:45.963
defining the switch and
configuring the network. They

00:42:45.963 --> 00:42:50.001
need to take care of the
entirety go the platform. They

00:42:50.001 --> 00:42:54.172
need to be responsible for the
whole thing. Whether is checking

00:42:54.172 --> 00:42:56.441
permissions? Release
coordination. Audit. Are they

00:42:56.441 --> 00:43:00.611
checking the audit. Or check the
audit of events or following

00:43:00.611 --> 00:43:05.183
making a part of the rest of the
entire platform. Switch light

00:43:05.183 --> 00:43:10.121
can do that. To follow up to big
cyber maybe a separate platform

00:43:10.121 --> 00:43:14.292
to consolidate all go that. How
about logging. Checking logs in

00:43:14.292 --> 00:43:18.729
the individual flat form. Or you
are consolidating log in. So you

00:43:18.729 --> 00:43:21.566
have visible there. So you are
now taking responsibility for

00:43:21.566 --> 00:43:27.105
the entire platform and not just
part of it. And logic terms. And

00:43:27.105 --> 00:43:29.774
that is my general term here.
And then I have some

00:43:29.774 --> 00:43:33.611
electronics. And that what come
up. You can check things. You

00:43:33.611 --> 00:43:37.849
can check states. You can make
sure that the platform is in a

00:43:37.849 --> 00:43:42.420
state that you expect it to be.
You can a good one. Hash the

00:43:42.420 --> 00:43:45.523
only partition. Is a nice thing
to do. Make sure everything is

00:43:45.523 --> 00:43:52.063
intact. So final thoughts here,
we are good on our time, the

00:43:52.063 --> 00:43:55.800
security in network ops is
critical. The security that you

00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:59.504
have seen has been neglected.
And because they think the

00:43:59.504 --> 00:44:02.874
security is safe. They're
assuming that you are falling

00:44:02.874 --> 00:44:06.611
all the best practices. They're
assuming is an idea situation

00:44:06.611 --> 00:44:09.947
the solutions you purchase and
the different layers are

00:44:09.947 --> 00:44:13.317
operating perfectly. That is a
perfect world and they're

00:44:13.317 --> 00:44:17.355
catching everything and this is
not the case. A single piece of

00:44:17.355 --> 00:44:20.525
malware can make the call from
windows to linux and I did it

00:44:20.525 --> 00:44:25.029
right here. I'm not the first
obviously. And when that happens

00:44:25.029 --> 00:44:28.533
of course that pivots. The
network administrators makes a

00:44:28.533 --> 00:44:33.004
great pivot. You then are able
to compromise those switches and

00:44:33.004 --> 00:44:37.074
you are able to turn [inaudible]
that immeasurable. Because you

00:44:37.074 --> 00:44:41.946
have visible now and entirely of
network. And we are here today

00:44:41.946 --> 00:44:46.017
trying avoid that. That's all.
Hopefully we can work together

00:44:46.017 --> 00:44:50.888
so we can avoid that. Links. If
you are wondering about all

00:44:50.888 --> 00:44:54.158
these stuff. The different
products. They're pretty cool

00:44:54.158 --> 00:45:01.599
products. And that is the end.
Thank you for coming. [ APPLAUSE

right?
