00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.404
So, awhile back, a friend of
mine (inaudible) started DEF CON

00:00:04.404 --> 00:00:08.275
101, he wanted to let people
know that, you know, if you

00:00:08.275 --> 00:00:10.677
haven't been here before, this
is what you can expect. There

00:00:10.677 --> 00:00:14.147
was a lot -- a lot of it was
fun, some of it was, you know,

00:00:14.147 --> 00:00:17.150
serious, but either way
ultimately what it did, was it

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.953
set the ground rules so that you
understand what you're doing

00:00:19.953 --> 00:00:24.157
when you're at DEF CON. Who here
has never been to DEF CON

00:00:24.157 --> 00:00:27.895
before? That's awesome. 	>>
That's amazing. 	(Applause). 	>>

00:00:27.895 --> 00:00:33.500
You guys have no idea how
awesome that is 	>> That is

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:39.339
awesome. 	>> This is DEF CON.
I'm a newb, everybody was a newb

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:44.244
at something at sometime, as
they said on adventure time,

00:00:44.244 --> 00:00:49.950
sucking at something is the
first step to being good at it.

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.688
So, with that, I just want
everybody to know, you are in a

00:00:54.688 --> 00:00:58.926
community. Everybody at some
point didn't know how to do

00:00:58.926 --> 00:01:02.195
something at sometime. The
awesome thing about DEF CON is

00:01:02.195 --> 00:01:05.165
there are a lot of volunteers
here. These are people who want

00:01:05.165 --> 00:01:08.368
to help you. Now, some of them
are going to want to help you

00:01:08.368 --> 00:01:11.438
get from room to room, some are
going to want to help you

00:01:11.438 --> 00:01:13.607
actually understand stuff.
	We're going to go over all

00:01:13.607 --> 00:01:20.213
kinds of cool stuff about DEF
CON. And we're going to go over

00:01:20.213 --> 00:01:25.886
a few rules, too. First, welcome
to Las Vegas. Pace yourself,

00:01:25.886 --> 00:01:29.623
you've got a few days, so you
don't want to end up like this

00:01:29.623 --> 00:01:33.126
guy. It's actually pretty
important. Stay hydrated. You

00:01:33.126 --> 00:01:37.898
are in the desert. Try to keep a
good balance. You know, I'm not

00:01:37.898 --> 00:01:40.434
saying don't have a good time,
because you truly, honestly want

00:01:40.434 --> 00:01:44.071
to have a good time. And having
a few beers, having some drinks,

00:01:44.071 --> 00:01:47.741
that's good. But don't go
overboard, because, first of all

00:01:47.741 --> 00:01:50.744
you don't want to miss awesome
talks, and second of all, you

00:01:50.744 --> 00:01:55.148
certainly don't want to be hung
over in the desert. That sucks

00:01:55.148 --> 00:01:57.851
(Laughter). 	>> All right.
There's important things need to

00:01:57.851 --> 00:02:03.256
know. The countdown, we're going
to countdown to three. Three.

00:02:03.256 --> 00:02:07.260
You're going to get three hours
of sleep a night at least.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.730
Without this sleep you are not
going to be able to function,

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:13.500
trust me. The first year that I
was here, I was on Capture the

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.337
Flag, we operated in 12-hour
shifts. The second year that I

00:02:17.337 --> 00:02:20.574
came to DEF CON, we did Capture
the Flag, and it was 36 hours

00:02:20.574 --> 00:02:25.979
straight. Yeah. And then I slept
through the rest of DEF CON, it

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:28.548
was awesome. 	>> He's never
actually recovered either.

00:02:28.548 --> 00:02:31.385
	(Laughter). 	>> So get at least
three hours sleep a night.

00:02:31.385 --> 00:02:34.921
You've got to be able to
function. You need at least two

00:02:34.921 --> 00:02:38.959
meals a day. You definitely want
to make sure that you have your

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:43.196
energy up. Because there's a lot
of walking. I did 20 --> 000 steps

00:02:43.196 --> 00:02:47.634
yesterday. By 11 o'clock I had
done 10 --> 000 of those steps. So,

00:02:47.634 --> 00:02:51.171
you know, this is one of those
things. You need to keep your

00:02:51.171 --> 00:02:55.642
energy up. One, everybody needs
to bathe at least once a day --

00:02:55.642 --> 00:03:02.783
please. 	(Applause). 	>> Brush
you're teeth. This is something

00:03:02.783 --> 00:03:08.789
that some people sometimes
forget. You are in the desert,

00:03:10.957 --> 00:03:15.695
you are going to get stinky. So,
even if you don't recognize that

00:03:15.695 --> 00:03:19.332
you're stinky, recognize that
your fellow human may recognize

00:03:19.332 --> 00:03:24.871
that you're stinky, so, please,
take that bath. DEF CON crud.

00:03:24.871 --> 00:03:28.275
How many of you have left a
conference and then you were

00:03:28.275 --> 00:03:30.877
sick on the way home -- and you
were like I must have got

00:03:30.877 --> 00:03:32.879
something at the hotel. Must
have got something on the

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:38.385
airplane. Uh-uh, you got
something at the conference.

00:03:38.385 --> 00:03:46.226
Fist your friends. Feel free.
Fist every single one of them,

00:03:46.226 --> 00:03:50.030
it's going to be good for you.
	>> It feels so good, too. 	>>

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:55.669
Trust me, you know, I had to pee
really bad, so I was running

00:03:55.669 --> 00:04:00.574
around trying to get here on
time and I watched three guys

00:04:00.574 --> 00:04:06.947
leave the bathroom without
washing their hands. I know.

00:04:06.947 --> 00:04:12.953
Come on dude. 	>> Are they on
the Stage? 	>> No. So, help me

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:19.993
out here, don't be a Dick. We're
going to say this after a few of

00:04:19.993 --> 00:04:23.396
these slides. This is Dick, as
you can see Dick is an evil

00:04:23.396 --> 00:04:26.800
hacker, evil hackers are always
depicted as either having

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:32.806
hoodies or a ski mask and -- or
a black hat. 	>> Hey. 	>> Here

00:04:37.744 --> 00:04:43.750
is some of the basics. Hold the
door. You're not the only person

00:04:46.086 --> 00:04:48.088
in this conference. I don't know
if you've noticed, there's a lot

00:04:48.088 --> 00:04:50.290
of people around, there's a lot
of people in the hallway, so

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:55.061
hold the door. Try and keep your
head up. Please. You know, it's

00:04:55.061 --> 00:04:58.198
fun when I'm standing on the
side and watching people walk

00:04:58.198 --> 00:05:01.134
into other people because
they're buried in their phone,

00:05:01.134 --> 00:05:04.671
or their buried in their tablet,
or buried in the program, but

00:05:04.671 --> 00:05:08.475
try and keep your head up and
pay attention. And for God's

00:05:08.475 --> 00:05:11.378
sake, don't hold a family
reunion in the middle of the

00:05:11.378 --> 00:05:14.247
hall. There isn't enough room
for everybody to be able to do

00:05:14.247 --> 00:05:17.417
that. So, if you get an
opportunity and you recognize,

00:05:17.417 --> 00:05:21.955
oh, there's more than two of us,
let's step to the side. So don't

00:05:21.955 --> 00:05:27.961
be a Dick. Do not be an ass hat.
Do not ruin everybody's time.

00:05:33.433 --> 00:05:35.936
You know, everybody is here to
have a good time, we're here --

00:05:35.936 --> 00:05:38.438
you know, we're here to learn,
we're here to meet friends,

00:05:38.438 --> 00:05:42.542
we're here to keep up with
friends, but the object here is

00:05:42.542 --> 00:05:45.845
to have a good time. And there
are a few people -- a few

00:05:45.845 --> 00:05:48.148
people, few bad seeds, that are
going to try and ruin

00:05:48.148 --> 00:05:53.320
everybody's good time. Don't be
one of them. Because, you know,

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:57.524
we're okay, we're cool, this
room is cool. There are people

00:05:57.524 --> 00:06:00.026
that aren't cool, and if you're
an ass hat to them, they're

00:06:00.026 --> 00:06:04.564
going to be an ass hat to you
back. And you just don't want

00:06:04.564 --> 00:06:08.568
that karma coming around.
Please, do have hackle. You're

00:06:08.568 --> 00:06:11.705
welcome to hackle me, this is an
interactive talk, if anybody has

00:06:11.705 --> 00:06:15.308
anything they want to say at any
point, there should be two

00:06:15.308 --> 00:06:19.246
microphones. You know, feel
free, get up. If you don't want

00:06:19.246 --> 00:06:22.482
to get to the microphone, stand
up, hold your hand up, let me

00:06:22.482 --> 00:06:28.488
know and shout it out. 	>> Can I
have a hug? 	>> After the talk.

00:06:31.291 --> 00:06:37.764
(Laughter) -- after the talk.
(Laughter) --remember, see the

00:06:37.764 --> 00:06:45.639
previous slide. 	>> That was an
ass hat (Laughter). 	>> All

00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:50.744
right, this is one that
everybody, you know, my shirt,

00:06:50.744 --> 00:06:54.848
free hugs here, awkward hugs,
because not everybody wants you

00:06:54.848 --> 00:06:59.452
to hug them. I -- my boss is
here, he probably does not want

00:06:59.452 --> 00:07:03.290
a hug from me, you know, you
know, and I just met his nephew,

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:06.092
he probably does not want a hug
from me. If I offered them a hug

00:07:06.092 --> 00:07:12.299
they may actually take it, and
then it's an offered hug -- and

00:07:12.299 --> 00:07:17.671
you know that will -- ask
permission. Phones. Who has an

00:07:17.671 --> 00:07:23.677
android phone? (Laughter). Don't
hold it up. (Laughter). This has

00:07:29.883 --> 00:07:35.088
been a bad week for android.
Dude, my iPhone friends are

00:07:35.088 --> 00:07:41.094
trying to send me messages, and
I'm not downloading them. There

00:07:43.396 --> 00:07:45.765
are a lot of people here; there
are a lot the phones here; there

00:07:45.765 --> 00:07:48.401
are a lot of cameras here.
Expect to be in a picture. Not

00:07:48.401 --> 00:07:51.104
everybody wants to have their
picture taken, but we understand

00:07:51.104 --> 00:07:53.606
that. But, you know, there are
going to be times where you're

00:07:53.606 --> 00:07:56.076
in a crowd, you're in a public
place, somebody may take your

00:07:56.076 --> 00:08:00.180
picture. If they do, kindly go
up and ask them to delete it if

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:04.150
you don't want them to have it.
Otherwise, expect there, you

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:06.286
know, your face may show up
somewhere. There's a lot of

00:08:06.286 --> 00:08:09.723
press here, I think there's a
record number of press here this

00:08:09.723 --> 00:08:12.926
year, there are film crews and
all kinds of other things. You

00:08:12.926 --> 00:08:18.798
may end up on TV, you may end up
in a movie, you could end up on

00:08:18.798 --> 00:08:22.369
this guy's camera. 	>> Which all
goes back to the, don't be an

00:08:22.369 --> 00:08:26.606
ass hat, too. 	>> You know, if
you do end up on any of these

00:08:26.606 --> 00:08:33.413
and you don't want to, just let
the guy know. Here is one -- not

00:08:33.413 --> 00:08:37.384
everything is free. Notice I put
this one in fine print. Just

00:08:37.384 --> 00:08:40.286
because you see something laying
out doesn't mean it's free.

00:08:40.286 --> 00:08:42.389
Especially, you know, you're
going to go into the vendor

00:08:42.389 --> 00:08:44.924
area, you're going to go into
some of the contest and

00:08:44.924 --> 00:08:47.260
villages, they've got stuff
laying out. It doesn't mean that

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:50.597
it's yours to take or touch. You
know, so make sure that it's

00:08:50.597 --> 00:08:55.835
appropriate if you're doing
something, yes, stand up. 	>> If

00:08:55.835 --> 00:09:01.775
you find an USB stick on the
ground? 	(Laughter) 	 	>> You

00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:14.354
didn't happen to be a black hat
did you? 		>> Those of you,

00:09:14.354 --> 00:09:18.658
didn't hear over the laughter,
he said, if you find an USB

00:09:18.658 --> 00:09:22.595
stick on the ground, please, by
all means, pick it up and then

00:09:22.595 --> 00:09:30.236
put it in your personal computer
to read and see what it is.

00:09:30.236 --> 00:09:35.742
(Laughter) if you have a work
computer and you do government

00:09:35.742 --> 00:09:40.880
work on it -- by all means
(Laughter) because my social

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:45.118
security number information
isn't out there enough, I think

00:09:45.118 --> 00:09:48.788
5 billion Chinese people, I
think most of them have it now.

00:09:48.788 --> 00:09:54.794
So, (Inaudible) -- there's a lot
of stuff going on here, you have

00:09:58.364 --> 00:10:01.234
a black program in your bag and
it's got all the talks. And

00:10:01.234 --> 00:10:04.437
you'll notice, this room filled
up, there are people that didn't

00:10:04.437 --> 00:10:08.141
make it in. There are people
that standing, and boy is it

00:10:08.141 --> 00:10:11.845
going to suck because you guys
got another 80 minutes to stand.

00:10:11.845 --> 00:10:16.182
But, you know, so try to have a
plan, make sure that you know

00:10:16.182 --> 00:10:19.652
what you're going to do. Feel
free. Don't be afraid to camp

00:10:19.652 --> 00:10:24.457
out. If you see a talk and it's
not necessarily a talk that --

00:10:24.457 --> 00:10:27.560
it's okay -- it may or may not
be a good talk -- and we're

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:31.231
going to get to that in a
second, but, you know say it's a

00:10:31.231 --> 00:10:33.366
talk that you don't want to
tend, but the one afterwards you

00:10:33.366 --> 00:10:35.635
do, and you know that there's
going to be a line around the

00:10:35.635 --> 00:10:39.339
corner, consider camping out.
	>> You're killing me Smalls,

00:10:39.339 --> 00:10:42.942
you know that. 	>> What's that?
	>> You're screwing with my

00:10:42.942 --> 00:10:49.415
system (Laughter). 	>> Now, the
talks. There is no such thing as

00:10:49.415 --> 00:10:53.786
a bad talk. I can tell you from
the Call From Papers Review

00:10:53.786 --> 00:10:58.958
Board, there is such a thing as
a bad talk. But the approved

00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:02.829
talks, there's no such thing as
a bad talk. Just because you

00:11:02.829 --> 00:11:05.698
don't like it, doesn't mean it's
bad. Just because you think you

00:11:05.698 --> 00:11:08.935
know, doesn't mean that
everybody knows. In fact, that

00:11:08.935 --> 00:11:11.938
is probably the two most common
things that I hear in the

00:11:11.938 --> 00:11:17.243
hallways. Oh, that talk is going
to suck, or everybody knows that

00:11:17.243 --> 00:11:20.813
shit. It's not the case. Not
everybody knows it, and not

00:11:20.813 --> 00:11:24.918
everybody is thinking that this
is going to suck, so, you know,

00:11:24.918 --> 00:11:27.487
if you don't like it, that's
awesome, you're entitled to that

00:11:27.487 --> 00:11:32.625
privilege and opinion, but don't
try and, you know, mess it up

00:11:32.625 --> 00:11:37.096
for anybody else. See the assets
line. There are a lot of

00:11:37.096 --> 00:11:40.466
villages this year. Villages are
awesome, because villages are

00:11:40.466 --> 00:11:43.536
where you can go and get
hands-on. Notice the villages

00:11:43.536 --> 00:11:48.274
come after the talks. A lot of
the talks are going to play into

00:11:48.274 --> 00:11:51.144
the villages. You're going to
see a lot of different things.

00:11:51.144 --> 00:11:54.781
Whether there's a biohacking
talk or a car hawking talk, or

00:11:54.781 --> 00:11:59.452
let's go down to Internet of
Things talk. There's all kind of

00:11:59.452 --> 00:12:03.623
IOT talks, and now you can go to
these villages, you can hear

00:12:03.623 --> 00:12:06.359
additional talks at those
villages and you get some hand's

00:12:06.359 --> 00:12:09.395
on experience, too. Especially
help Hardware Hacking Village,

00:12:09.395 --> 00:12:12.899
Crypto & Privacy Village,
Lockpick Village, Social

00:12:12.899 --> 00:12:15.835
Engineering Village, if you
haven't stopped there, you have

00:12:15.835 --> 00:12:21.975
to there at least once, leave
your wallet in your pocket. 	>>

00:12:21.975 --> 00:12:24.644
Just so you know the SE village
actually does have stuff going

00:12:24.644 --> 00:12:28.047
on today. So, you can go over to
Bally's and get in there and

00:12:28.047 --> 00:12:31.017
they do have activities and
talks and that kind of stuff

00:12:31.017 --> 00:12:36.656
happening today. 	>> Thank you,
sir. And, of course the Wireless

00:12:36.656 --> 00:12:40.927
Village. There's a Wireless
Capture the Flag -- please, sir,

00:12:40.927 --> 00:12:48.568
you just came, in come up front.
He looks lost. (Laughter) Is

00:12:48.568 --> 00:12:56.576
that the monopoly man? Now,
contests and events. There are

00:12:56.576 --> 00:12:59.445
way too many contests and events
to list, I'm not going to -- you

00:12:59.445 --> 00:13:01.648
know, I'd like to hear some
highlights -- here's the

00:13:01.648 --> 00:13:06.352
highlight -- Lost Challenge.
Lost Challenge is one of the

00:13:06.352 --> 00:13:10.523
hardest challenges there is. It
will take all of your time.

00:13:10.523 --> 00:13:15.094
Anything that you have access to
at DEF CON probably contributes

00:13:15.094 --> 00:13:18.965
to Lost Challenge. Anything that
somebody else has probably

00:13:18.965 --> 00:13:23.503
contributes. I've got a goon
badge, this helps, makes noise,

00:13:23.503 --> 00:13:28.207
too. I've got a vendor badge,
vendor badge helps. I've got a

00:13:28.207 --> 00:13:33.046
speaker badge. It all
contributes. So, you know, get

00:13:33.046 --> 00:13:36.516
out and meet people, ask them,
if you're going to participate

00:13:36.516 --> 00:13:40.687
in this, I highly encourage you
to try and meet somebody. What

00:13:40.687 --> 00:13:45.725
are you guys drawing? 	>> What?
Dude you didn't even tell a

00:13:45.725 --> 00:13:50.697
joke. You can't drop the mic.
Swag is opened today, Vendors

00:13:50.697 --> 00:13:54.334
opens tomorrow, this is a
awesome, DEF CON is unique.

00:13:54.334 --> 00:13:58.538
Obviously, we've got DEF CON
branded stuff, but for a

00:13:58.538 --> 00:14:02.408
conference, computer security
conference, hacker conference,

00:14:02.408 --> 00:14:06.379
we have a vendor area. It's
actual vendors. This isn't like

00:14:06.379 --> 00:14:10.149
DEF CON -- it's not RSA, it's
not any place like that. When

00:14:10.149 --> 00:14:15.088
you go in, you can buy stuff. We
don't intend to have it be an

00:14:15.088 --> 00:14:20.626
area where, you know, you're
overwhelmed by bright lights and

00:14:20.626 --> 00:14:24.330
lots of stuff that you're never
going to be able to afford, you

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:28.000
may never even use. Now, we've
got guys that, everybody in

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.337
there contributes something to
the community and so, you know,

00:14:31.337 --> 00:14:33.339
it opens tomorrow, and I think
that you guys will like it.

00:14:33.339 --> 00:14:39.345
Prepare to separate yourself
from your money. Demo labs in

00:14:42.648 --> 00:14:47.787
the workshops are new to DEF CON
this year. Demo labs, they're a

00:14:47.787 --> 00:14:52.925
brief introduction into, you
know, different tools and

00:14:52.925 --> 00:14:57.497
projects, and workshops are
training opportunities. The

00:14:57.497 --> 00:15:02.902
workshops are actual hands-on,
48 hours of training

00:15:02.902 --> 00:15:06.305
opportunities that you just
can't get. If you were a black

00:15:06.305 --> 00:15:10.676
hat, any of you that wear a
black hat, you know, $4 --> 000 for

00:15:10.676 --> 00:15:16.883
a class, it might not be -- $50,
it could be free for the for the

00:15:16.883 --> 00:15:22.054
workshops. So if you didn't sign
up, consider signing up. 	>>

00:15:22.054 --> 00:15:24.957
They're full now though. 	>>
They're full now? (Laughter) --

00:15:24.957 --> 00:15:28.427
if you didn't sign up, consider
signing up next year. 	>> Or

00:15:28.427 --> 00:15:31.497
camp out. That's what I heard
was good, too. Just camp out.

00:15:31.497 --> 00:15:37.503
	>> So, I have a group of people
that are sitting up here. And

00:15:42.542 --> 00:15:45.545
the reason that I asked them to
come up is because, as much as I

00:15:45.545 --> 00:15:50.283
love to hear myself talk, I want
you guys to get some more

00:15:50.283 --> 00:15:54.320
feeling of and understanding of,
you know, what's involved with

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:57.256
being at DEF CON, how do you get
involved, how do you

00:15:57.256 --> 00:16:00.927
participate, what can do you to
participate, so these guy are

00:16:00.927 --> 00:16:03.763
going to give you some
experiences. Some are going to

00:16:03.763 --> 00:16:07.466
be experiences, some are going
to be -- this is what I do in my

00:16:07.466 --> 00:16:11.470
department, some are going to be
-- I have one -- this is brand

00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:14.874
new on the panel, we actually
have an attendee, one of you

00:16:14.874 --> 00:16:18.578
guys that we asked to
participate. Yup. Down at the

00:16:18.578 --> 00:16:21.280
end. And he's going to give you
a story about, about you know,

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:23.716
how he got into DEF CON, and
it's actually pretty

00:16:23.716 --> 00:16:29.322
inspirational story. So, we're
going to start it off, not in

00:16:29.322 --> 00:16:31.490
this order. I'm going to start
with Russ because he's sitting

00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:36.395
next to me and Russ is going to
give you whatever he wants to

00:16:36.395 --> 00:16:42.401
give you. 	>> RUSS ROGERS: Who
wants a fist? There you go. 	>>

00:16:45.304 --> 00:16:50.509
That's not where I want it. 	>>
RUSS ROGERS: My name is Russ,

00:16:50.509 --> 00:16:54.046
I'm the Chief of Operations for
the conference. I scared Nikita

00:16:54.046 --> 00:17:00.887
off. I have been here, this is
my 17th DEF CON in a row. I'm

00:17:00.887 --> 00:17:08.127
not a newb any more. Basically,
it excites me to see all the new

00:17:08.127 --> 00:17:10.963
attendees come every year,
because I think it adds a lot

00:17:10.963 --> 00:17:14.800
intellectually, creativity, your
experiences, your inputs, your

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:19.171
insights, your research -- I'm
going to go tell you the same

00:17:19.171 --> 00:17:21.641
thing that everybody up here is
going to tell you, and you're

00:17:21.641 --> 00:17:24.310
going to get tired of hearing it
before this talk is over, and

00:17:24.310 --> 00:17:29.215
you will get out of DEF CON what
you put into it. And I helped,

00:17:29.215 --> 00:17:32.084
over the years, get a lot of
these activities, the villages,

00:17:32.084 --> 00:17:37.356
contests, started. And the
people that have the best fun,

00:17:37.356 --> 00:17:42.628
the people that are out there
really writing cool blogs or

00:17:42.628 --> 00:17:45.498
doing cool research, or people
that actually got involved, met

00:17:45.498 --> 00:17:50.403
people, made new friends and did
cool stuff. You don't have to be

00:17:50.403 --> 00:17:54.240
a jerk to learn a lot of cool
stuff, so I want you to go out,

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:58.210
do a lot of things, learn a lot
of things, I brought my kids for

00:17:58.210 --> 00:18:02.114
the first time this year. After
17 year that's should tell you

00:18:02.114 --> 00:18:05.685
something. I haven't been really
comfortable with it in the past.

00:18:05.685 --> 00:18:10.289
You know, DEF CON of old was
different. It was a bunch of us

00:18:10.289 --> 00:18:13.759
that got together, you know, I
started DEF CON 6, it was at the

00:18:13.759 --> 00:18:18.798
Plaza, I think we had about
three or 400 people there. And

00:18:18.798 --> 00:18:21.133
if you think about it, that's
about the population of this

00:18:21.133 --> 00:18:25.271
room, maybe. And that was the
entirety of DEF CON 6, and

00:18:25.271 --> 00:18:29.075
everybody sat around, and we did
a lot of hacking, and we learned

00:18:29.075 --> 00:18:32.044
a lot of things. I mean, there
were people sitting down showing

00:18:32.044 --> 00:18:35.581
other folks how to make a
network cable. Because at the

00:18:35.581 --> 00:18:38.217
time, that was still a fairly
new thing unless you were in the

00:18:38.217 --> 00:18:41.887
field. There was, you know,
switching and routing, and all

00:18:41.887 --> 00:18:45.624
of this interesting stuff, and
they were still writing Window's

00:18:45.624 --> 00:18:48.227
exploits that you could do
across the Internet and break

00:18:48.227 --> 00:18:51.630
boxes. And people sat around and
had conversations. So if you

00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:54.900
want to have the most fun you
can possibly have here, aside

00:18:54.900 --> 00:19:00.573
from the (Inaudible) thing --
seriously, get involved and do

00:19:00.573 --> 00:19:07.013
stuff. And the red shirts, if
you have a question, ask them.

00:19:07.013 --> 00:19:09.415
You know, I've directed more
people this morning to where

00:19:09.415 --> 00:19:12.451
things are or to answer
questions, I love doing it.

00:19:12.451 --> 00:19:16.322
Because if you'll get involved
and you'll go do things, that's

00:19:16.322 --> 00:19:23.462
why I do this. 	>> Thank you,
Russ. So, you know, Russ is

00:19:23.462 --> 00:19:28.234
right, ask. Meet people. I just
got a business card today, it's

00:19:28.234 --> 00:19:32.672
actually kind of fun, for an
International DEF CON meet up.

00:19:32.672 --> 00:19:37.543
One of cool things, is DEF CON
is international, there are a

00:19:37.543 --> 00:19:40.146
lot of people here, but you may
not recognize that there's

00:19:40.146 --> 00:19:43.082
somebody that's here that speaks
your language, that, you know,

00:19:43.082 --> 00:19:45.084
and we all have something in
common and that's the

00:19:45.084 --> 00:19:50.456
technology, but there's also the
fact that we can find that other

00:19:50.456 --> 00:19:54.994
people speak the same language
so that we're more comfortable.

00:19:54.994 --> 00:20:01.667
So feel free, ask around. Nakita
is awesome. 	>> Shit. 	>> She's

00:20:01.667 --> 00:20:03.936
not going to tell you that she's
awesome. But she is. 	>> She's

00:20:03.936 --> 00:20:08.007
amazing. 	>> Nakita runs the
back of the house. And you know,

00:20:08.007 --> 00:20:13.813
she (Inaudible) of people and,
you know, to have Nakita be able

00:20:13.813 --> 00:20:17.683
to organize this stuff, for
those of you that don't know, we

00:20:17.683 --> 00:20:21.620
start planning this in
September. 	>> (Laughter). 	>>

00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:28.427
So we will be -- (Laughter). 	>>
That's awesome. 	>> It's

00:20:28.427 --> 00:20:35.201
N-I-K-I-T-A. 	>> No, it's not.
	>> That's exactly what I have

00:20:35.201 --> 00:20:42.775
in my phone. 	>> Yes, that is
now perfect. 	>> Back door crew

00:20:42.775 --> 00:20:48.781
member (Laughter). Give us a
little idea of -- 	>> (Laughter)

00:20:54.620 --> 00:21:00.559
(Laughter). 	>> IKEA.
	(Applause). 	>> I love you big

00:21:04.864 --> 00:21:09.969
sis. (Laughter). 	>> I'm just
going to take that with grace

00:21:09.969 --> 00:21:14.206
and move on. (Laughter) What did
you ask me? (Laughter). 	>> Give

00:21:14.206 --> 00:21:18.911
me a -- you know, yesterday we
were talking a little bit about

00:21:18.911 --> 00:21:21.080
the things that you do, the
things that people don't

00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:25.618
recognize, that don't understand
what it takes to make this

00:21:25.618 --> 00:21:31.423
happen. 	>> Just do a list. In
binary. 	>> It takes patience

00:21:31.423 --> 00:21:37.429
and, a love for all of you
fuckers, because, if I didn't

00:21:43.469 --> 00:21:49.475
have that feeling of belonging,
I would not work, you know,

00:21:52.311 --> 00:21:58.651
16-20 hour days sometimes, or
you know, answer guys at major

00:21:58.651 --> 00:22:01.921
browsers at three in the morning
to register them for a workshop

00:22:01.921 --> 00:22:05.758
on a Sunday. Because I'm doing
it manually by e-mail

00:22:05.758 --> 00:22:09.261
(Laughter). I do the CFP review
board, I manage when you submit

00:22:09.261 --> 00:22:15.267
a talk to speak here, I am the
one who gets it, and then passes

00:22:19.572 --> 00:22:25.277
it to the board, and handles all
your questions for speaker

00:22:25.277 --> 00:22:31.283
(Inaudible) -- I help plan
pretty much every aspect of

00:22:34.687 --> 00:22:37.690
scheduling, floor plan,
workshops. I've started numerous

00:22:37.690 --> 00:22:43.696
contests and events, but here is
the thing that I do, I don't

00:22:50.603 --> 00:22:53.472
have time to do them, I just
want to give you a really good

00:22:53.472 --> 00:22:56.742
idea and you will run it. I'm
relatively good at that. I don't

00:22:56.742 --> 00:23:02.214
know. I don't know, I do a lot
of prep, stuff, and things. 	>>

00:23:02.214 --> 00:23:06.185
She does stuff and things.
Nakita sells herself short. You

00:23:06.185 --> 00:23:10.456
know, call for review, call for
papers is ridiculous. Because

00:23:10.456 --> 00:23:15.694
the number of people that submit
talks is enormous, and the fact

00:23:15.694 --> 00:23:20.332
that she has to wrangle every
bit of that. I just said we

00:23:20.332 --> 00:23:23.269
start planning in September, and
the reality of it is we do.

00:23:23.269 --> 00:23:25.838
Actually, Nikita has already
started planning for next year.

00:23:25.838 --> 00:23:31.343
So these are things that -- I
just wanted you to get -- you

00:23:31.343 --> 00:23:35.447
guys to understand that, yeah,
DEF CON is what it is. You guys

00:23:35.447 --> 00:23:41.553
play $230 and you get to enjoy
what you put into it like, Russ

00:23:41.553 --> 00:23:45.190
said, but there are a lot of
people that put a lot of stuff

00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:48.494
into it. There's a lot that goes
into it. There are volunteers

00:23:48.494 --> 00:23:53.365
that, you know, for some people
it's a part time job. You know,

00:23:53.365 --> 00:23:57.002
doing the vendor area, it's a
part time job just trying to

00:23:57.002 --> 00:24:02.508
wrangle that, and that starts in
September as well. 	So, Alley

00:24:02.508 --> 00:24:07.780
John actually talked last year
for a panel and he gave a little

00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:11.317
bit of an experience. Alley John
is a good example of what

00:24:11.317 --> 00:24:16.088
happens when you meet people,
you know, through common

00:24:16.088 --> 00:24:22.194
experiences, but really what we
tried it do is bring Alley John

00:24:22.194 --> 00:24:27.232
into the fold, out of his shell.
(Laughter) 	>> ALLEY JOHN: All

00:24:27.232 --> 00:24:33.539
right. So I've been attending
DEF CON for six years now. The

00:24:33.539 --> 00:24:37.843
first three, I was doing Lost
Mystery Challenge, and that was

00:24:37.843 --> 00:24:42.014
one of the best things ever. You
have to interact with so many

00:24:42.014 --> 00:24:47.086
different people at so many
different skill levels, CRYPTO,

00:24:47.086 --> 00:24:51.523
different languages, Korean,
Chinese, Lock Picking,

00:24:51.523 --> 00:24:55.594
everything under the sun. So
having that connection with a

00:24:55.594 --> 00:24:59.198
whole bunch of people, amazing.
I still stay in touch with all

00:24:59.198 --> 00:25:01.633
of them. They're in different
companies across the country,

00:25:01.633 --> 00:25:04.837
across different industries, so
if you need something a few

00:25:04.837 --> 00:25:06.839
years down the road, you can
call them up them up and be

00:25:06.839 --> 00:25:14.813
like, hey, how's it going? I
need X. But -- 	>> Not X. 	>>

00:25:14.813 --> 00:25:20.819
ALLEY JOHN: No, no, no, not what
I meant. 	>> Pool party. 	>>

00:25:23.555 --> 00:25:31.263
Thank you IO active (Laughter).
	>> ALLEY JOHN: But the only

00:25:31.263 --> 00:25:33.899
other thing I have to say is I
would not be where I am today if

00:25:33.899 --> 00:25:36.902
it wasn't for everybody in this
room. Probably not you guys

00:25:36.902 --> 00:25:39.938
specifically, but, you know,
Mike and Russ, and a whole bunch

00:25:39.938 --> 00:25:41.940
of others. So, thank you guys.
No, nothing, but I still love

00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:47.946
you. 	>> You know, going to take
a second, you see the sharp

00:25:52.184 --> 00:25:57.656
(Inaudible) -- it says, Hi, I'm
new. I actually have a whole

00:25:57.656 --> 00:26:00.526
bunch of these shirts, and I
want to hand a few out before we

00:26:00.526 --> 00:26:03.529
get them to the, some of these
other guys, Jeremy, can you help

00:26:03.529 --> 00:26:06.331
me? 	>> Of course. 	>> Okay,
awesome. I will show you where

00:26:06.331 --> 00:26:11.537
to throw them. 	>> Okay. First
of all I want to say these two

00:26:11.537 --> 00:26:14.039
guys right here up front, first
group of anyone -- are you first

00:26:14.039 --> 00:26:20.512
year? Second year. They tried to
pass out, the information, they

00:26:20.512 --> 00:26:23.615
were like yeah, we're going to
help line up, can I get a goon

00:26:23.615 --> 00:26:27.152
bag -- I was like wow, really?
They're starting them that

00:26:27.152 --> 00:26:33.158
young. And then other than that,
toss that way. 	>> That way?

00:26:38.063 --> 00:26:44.069
(Shouting, yelling, applause
while passing pass throwing

00:27:06.124 --> 00:27:12.130
shirts.) 	>> All right. You
know, Jeremy and I said his name

00:27:24.810 --> 00:27:27.679
out loud a couple times. Jeremy
and I are friends, been friends

00:27:27.679 --> 00:27:34.486
for a long time. 	>> Who's
Jeremy? Crypt Bitch. 	>> Name is

00:27:34.486 --> 00:27:42.094
Crypt Bitch. 	>> Don't pee and
ask that (Laughter). 	>> Jeremy

00:27:42.094 --> 00:27:45.631
just has always been involved,
but not in an official capacity.

00:27:45.631 --> 00:27:49.868
	>> We really can get rid of
him. We've been trying every

00:27:49.868 --> 00:27:52.604
year. 	>> So now, Jeremy is
actually involved, and I want

00:27:52.604 --> 00:27:55.674
him to give you guys an
understanding of, from his

00:27:55.674 --> 00:27:59.211
standpoint, he just involved
himself. 	>> Big time. 	>> Which

00:27:59.211 --> 00:28:02.481
is also, if you're an awesome
person. 	>> I'm a good fister.

00:28:02.481 --> 00:28:07.219
	>> I think a little
over-involved. 	>> Take a long

00:28:07.219 --> 00:28:13.358
as you would like to speak. 	>>
You don't want to tell me that.

00:28:13.358 --> 00:28:15.561
	>> Can I hold this little
penis? 	>> No? 	>> JEREMY: My

00:28:15.561 --> 00:28:21.567
name is Jeremy crypt. Most
people know me as crypt tier.

00:28:24.803 --> 00:28:30.809
No, not crypt ear, just crypt. I
don't even, I don't count number

00:28:34.646 --> 00:28:39.217
of times I've come, definitely
not as much as these guys, but -

00:28:39.217 --> 00:28:45.223
wow, that was brazen -- nobody
got me on that. I will say that

00:28:47.292 --> 00:28:52.931
my experience at DEF CON has
been all about people. I've

00:28:52.931 --> 00:28:57.769
wanted to do the contests. I've
wanted to do everything. I get

00:28:57.769 --> 00:29:03.442
to hang out with Ryan a lot, get
lost and he always starts off

00:29:03.442 --> 00:29:06.478
talking about the contest and
then I'm like now I can't do it.

00:29:06.478 --> 00:29:09.314
So it's all about the people
around me, the people I've met,

00:29:09.314 --> 00:29:15.020
there are a lot of people, like
these two I'll probably see them

00:29:15.020 --> 00:29:21.293
throughout the entire CON. I met
some people on registration, in

00:29:21.293 --> 00:29:23.795
the registration line, talked
for about 20 minutes, I think

00:29:23.795 --> 00:29:28.533
Jay and I did. 	>> Hi, I'm Jay.
	>> I will say from my

00:29:28.533 --> 00:29:31.870
experience and for yours, it's
been said a lot, but cannot be

00:29:31.870 --> 00:29:35.207
said enough is talk to the
people around you and find

00:29:35.207 --> 00:29:39.378
things to do. I've seen people
sit down in the hallways,

00:29:39.378 --> 00:29:42.481
especially when back when it was
at Rio, when you had the pads,

00:29:42.481 --> 00:29:44.683
they would sit right in the
middle of the floor because they

00:29:44.683 --> 00:29:49.054
had the stickers on the ground
and just sit and talk. And I

00:29:49.054 --> 00:29:52.057
just walk right up to them and
sit down and start talking. It's

00:29:52.057 --> 00:29:56.261
one of the only places I've ever
been where that's okay. And it's

00:29:56.261 --> 00:30:01.566
actually kind of cool. I don't
have any friends outside of CON

00:30:01.566 --> 00:30:06.238
basically, and so I come here to
meet people. Yeah, I don't have

00:30:06.238 --> 00:30:12.277
any friends. But, yeah, so I
came a couple years ago, I think

00:30:12.277 --> 00:30:16.481
DEF CON 20, first time I was
working to help one of the

00:30:16.481 --> 00:30:21.820
artist's here, Eddie Mize, who
is an amazing artist. He's set

00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:23.922
up in vendor right now? Right?
	>> Yeah. 	>> Yeah, so he'll be

00:30:23.922 --> 00:30:29.494
setup in vendor. I had worked
with him, we made the drive from

00:30:29.494 --> 00:30:35.434
Colorado to Vegas, and I just
got to meet a lot of people as

00:30:35.434 --> 00:30:42.774
they came and bought the art.
Yes. He's awesome. And so, with

00:30:42.774 --> 00:30:45.677
that, I then started just
meeting more and more people. I

00:30:45.677 --> 00:30:51.483
mean I worked with Russ as well,
and then, I think the next year,

00:30:51.483 --> 00:30:56.888
what, 21 is actually when my
grandmother died, that's a sad

00:30:56.888 --> 00:30:59.391
story, I'm sorry, I just
remembered as I'm going through.

00:30:59.391 --> 00:31:07.199
	>> Then 22. 	>> Not passed
that. No, I guess the big part

00:31:07.199 --> 00:31:12.471
is we all here want to --
apparently can't hug any more --

00:31:12.471 --> 00:31:14.806
or how is the hugging, are we
allowing that. 	>> It just says

00:31:14.806 --> 00:31:19.611
ask first. 	>> Okay, asking for
hugs. (Laughter) Sorry, just

00:31:19.611 --> 00:31:25.183
remembered my grandmother, I'm
sorry you guys. Let's see hugs,

00:31:25.183 --> 00:31:31.189
appreciate that. Yeah. Let's --
I need a second. 	>> Let's move

00:31:36.061 --> 00:31:39.598
on. 	>> Yeah. 	>> Jeremy is
actually a really good example,

00:31:39.598 --> 00:31:42.567
because, you know, he's like
about half (Inaudible). He's the

00:31:42.567 --> 00:31:46.605
opposite of me. My first two
years at DEF CON, I went in, I

00:31:46.605 --> 00:31:52.010
did CTF, I went back to my room,
that was it. I interacted with

00:31:52.010 --> 00:31:56.681
the people on my team, and that
was it. I'm scared to death to

00:31:56.681 --> 00:31:59.217
meet people. This is something
that most people don't know

00:31:59.217 --> 00:32:03.121
about me. But it is true. I
really have a hard time. And

00:32:03.121 --> 00:32:06.725
it's awesome to be in an area of
community where you, even if I

00:32:06.725 --> 00:32:10.896
don't know you, that's fine, you
can come up and chat with me and

00:32:10.896 --> 00:32:13.865
we'll talk. But I didn't used to
be like that. Jeremy is the

00:32:13.865 --> 00:32:17.002
opposite of that. Jeremy is the
kind of guy who will go up and

00:32:17.002 --> 00:32:22.174
talk to you. Alley John, he'd do
the same thing. So, you know,

00:32:22.174 --> 00:32:26.812
it's a good example of being
able to be involved. There's a

00:32:26.812 --> 00:32:28.947
common theme here --
involvement. Now, Jay, actually

00:32:28.947 --> 00:32:30.949
-- 	>> I'm Jay -- 	>> Hi Jay.
	>> Also much like Jeremy, but

00:32:30.949 --> 00:32:32.951
without the sad story (Laughter)
-- sorry. 	>> I'll get in

00:32:32.951 --> 00:32:34.953
trouble for that later. He's the
same way, Jay is also, Jay is

00:32:34.953 --> 00:32:36.955
the kind of guy that you're
going to meet and you're going

00:32:36.955 --> 00:32:38.957
to feel like you've known him
forever. I'd actually like Jay

00:32:38.957 --> 00:32:44.963
to talk to you and actually tell
you about himself, because you

00:33:01.613 --> 00:33:05.584
will feel like you've known him
forever. 	>> Can he have a mic?

00:33:05.584 --> 00:33:11.590
	>> Blue or red? 	>> Yellow. 	>>
This is my second one. 	>> Okay.

00:33:15.393 --> 00:33:22.801
Hi, so I'm Jay, nice to meet you
everybody. We can go around the

00:33:22.801 --> 00:33:25.537
room and introduce ourselves?
(Laughter) -- no? Okay. All

00:33:25.537 --> 00:33:28.440
right. So, this is actually my
second DEF CON, my first one was

00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:34.312
last year, and I came with this
guy here, Jeremy. He told me

00:33:34.312 --> 00:33:40.485
that -- or crypt -- I apologize,
crypt ear, not crypt ear any

00:33:40.485 --> 00:33:44.256
more. 	>> I hate you. 	>> So he
told me to come out to DEF CON,

00:33:44.256 --> 00:33:48.260
I was like, what the heck is a
DEF CON. So, he told me kind of

00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:51.129
what was involved and how
exciting it was. Does it say

00:33:51.129 --> 00:33:58.637
crypt ear? Yes. (Laughter) --
nice. That's legit. So, came out

00:33:58.637 --> 00:34:02.240
here and I got to meet a whole
bunch of new people and to be

00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:09.180
honest it's kind of the hacker
industry. Legislate? 	>> You

00:34:09.180 --> 00:34:14.185
know who gets to fix those typos
later? 	>> IKEA 	>> Me. 	>> Oh,

00:34:14.185 --> 00:34:19.457
do you? You fix those? 	>> I
edit those, yes. 	>> um,

00:34:19.457 --> 00:34:22.994
(speaking foreign language)
(Laughter). 	>> I don't know

00:34:22.994 --> 00:34:28.733
what that even means, see what
comes up, this is fun, this is

00:34:28.733 --> 00:34:35.607
fun. We can do this all day, oh,
... 	>> I love you transcriber.

00:34:35.607 --> 00:34:41.613
	>> All right. So anyway, again,
the whole computer crypto world,

00:34:44.649 --> 00:34:47.986
is really new to me. This is
amazing, I can't believe it

00:34:47.986 --> 00:34:52.357
takes what I'm saying and puts
it up there. But, so I'm more of

00:34:52.357 --> 00:34:55.627
a talker, I enjoy speaking to
people and getting out there and

00:34:55.627 --> 00:34:59.998
meeting people, and I'm very
social and very easily, very

00:34:59.998 --> 00:35:02.968
easy to approach, I guess would
be best. 	>> Approachable, yes.

00:35:02.968 --> 00:35:05.804
	>> Approachable. There's a
world for that, there you go.

00:35:05.804 --> 00:35:09.307
I'm very approachable. Easy
going, if you ask me a question,

00:35:09.307 --> 00:35:12.744
I'll give you an answer, but I
promise whatever you're asking

00:35:12.744 --> 00:35:16.181
me, whatever information I give
you, I'll get twice as much

00:35:16.181 --> 00:35:18.650
information from you. So,
please, please, be ready and be

00:35:18.650 --> 00:35:22.420
aware of that. So I did meet one
of guys here last night, he's

00:35:22.420 --> 00:35:25.123
actually sitting over there,
Sid, right? All right. I'm

00:35:25.123 --> 00:35:27.392
pretty good with names, Billy
and -- we do, anyway, so I was

00:35:27.392 --> 00:35:34.099
talking with Sid and he's asking
a few question and giving him

00:35:34.099 --> 00:35:37.469
some pointers, and kind of
letting him know, as everybody

00:35:37.469 --> 00:35:39.871
else here said, just get
involved and go met people and

00:35:39.871 --> 00:35:43.008
talk to people, and one of
things he came up with, I

00:35:43.008 --> 00:35:47.112
thought was pretty cool was, be
curious. So, you know, curiosity

00:35:47.112 --> 00:35:49.814
is a good thing. So ask people
what's going on. Say, hey,

00:35:49.814 --> 00:35:52.984
where's this, how can I do that,
how does this happen, and how

00:35:52.984 --> 00:35:56.755
does this work. And be humble.
Don't be the guy who says, you

00:35:56.755 --> 00:36:00.625
know, as Mike said, I know that
already it's no big deal. Kind

00:36:00.625 --> 00:36:04.262
of be humble and say hey that's
cool, I'm glad you're teaching

00:36:04.262 --> 00:36:07.966
me something new and then, so
it's curiosity, humility, and

00:36:07.966 --> 00:36:11.202
respect. So be respectful to
people. So, that's the thing

00:36:11.202 --> 00:36:14.372
that I've learned here, if you
have those three things, I think

00:36:14.372 --> 00:36:17.976
you'll get pretty far here.
That's my little credo, and

00:36:17.976 --> 00:36:20.845
welcome to Sid, come on Sid,
stand up and take credit -- take

00:36:20.845 --> 00:36:26.851
credit -- 	(Applause) 	>> Like I
said whatever I learned from you

00:36:29.921 --> 00:36:32.323
is going to be two fold of what
you learn learned from me. So,

00:36:32.323 --> 00:36:35.660
please, come around, run up to
me, ask me what's going on and

00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:37.662
we'll figure it out. If you want
to know more about me later,

00:36:37.662 --> 00:36:42.600
I'll be up here all day. 	>>
Awesome. The last person on this

00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:49.307
panel is Carlos, Carlos is one
of you, and I asked Carlos to do

00:36:49.307 --> 00:36:53.711
this -- I met him last year,
after a panel talk, and he told

00:36:53.711 --> 00:36:57.082
me his story, and his story is
actually inspirational. To me,

00:36:57.082 --> 00:37:02.320
maybe not to you guys, but I
also, will get on my soapbox and

00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:04.322
talk about how awesome DEF CON
is, and I will talk about how

00:37:04.322 --> 00:37:10.328
awesome this talk is to those
people that are leaving. But I

00:37:12.464 --> 00:37:15.467
want Carlos to kind of tell you
a little bit about himself, tell

00:37:15.467 --> 00:37:19.971
you a little bit about his
story, and then, how he came to

00:37:19.971 --> 00:37:25.977
be involved, also. So, thanks.
	>> Hi, everyone. I'm Blood. My

00:37:25.977 --> 00:37:29.881
name is Carlos actually. I've
been coming to DEF CON for a lot

00:37:29.881 --> 00:37:37.122
of years. And unlike the panel
here, I really never, never

00:37:37.122 --> 00:37:43.128
became involved. I came to this
place when I was 18, in order to

00:37:47.098 --> 00:37:54.105
learn English I figured out that
I could (Inaudible). Now, some

00:37:54.105 --> 00:38:00.044
of the goons and people that are
in LA have been working DEF CON

00:38:11.890 --> 00:38:14.659
for a very long time, so I was
privileged enough to meet some

00:38:14.659 --> 00:38:16.661
of them. Unfortunately my
English voice was pretty limited

00:38:16.661 --> 00:38:19.597
at the time. So, it was tough,
you know, to be there, I didn't

00:38:19.597 --> 00:38:21.933
get my legal status was
(Inaudible) so I was in legal

00:38:21.933 --> 00:38:24.335
precedent, and it was tough.
But, you know, I scored

00:38:24.335 --> 00:38:28.139
computers, and I really liked
them, and so, somehow we figured

00:38:28.139 --> 00:38:31.442
out that there was this
conference, DEF CON, and what I

00:38:31.442 --> 00:38:36.214
did is I took a bus and I end up
here. My first DEF CON was

00:38:36.214 --> 00:38:41.186
pretty short, like maybe three
hours, four. I walked in DEF CON

00:38:41.186 --> 00:38:45.623
and I was so happy, they had
these like paper thing, and so

00:38:45.623 --> 00:38:49.727
what I did is, I walked around
and I probably looked the

00:38:49.727 --> 00:38:54.165
cleaning crew at the (Inaudible)
so I was with the guys, and it

00:38:54.165 --> 00:38:58.269
was kind of cool. And so I
walked around I just heard

00:38:58.269 --> 00:39:02.674
people, and then first thing I
heard is that there was going to

00:39:02.674 --> 00:39:07.445
be some cult, and I didn't know
what the cult was, and it was

00:39:07.445 --> 00:39:11.549
The Cult of the Dead Cow. But
for me, it was something

00:39:11.549 --> 00:39:15.653
different. I didn't know, for me
cult was/is evil and I cannot

00:39:15.653 --> 00:39:19.757
get rid of (Inaudible) in there,
but then I heard people talking

00:39:19.757 --> 00:39:23.861
about FEDS, and so apparently
there were going to be FEDS on

00:39:23.861 --> 00:39:28.266
the CON, some of them from the
FBI and some of them from the

00:39:28.266 --> 00:39:31.102
CIA. And so I put the two
together and I realized, boy if

00:39:31.102 --> 00:39:34.372
the FEDS are here, and we've got
the FBI, and the CIA, well,

00:39:34.372 --> 00:39:39.244
Immigration is here. So I
bounced. (Laughter) So it was

00:39:39.244 --> 00:39:46.050
pretty short and so I ended up
going back to the meetings for a

00:39:46.050 --> 00:39:53.524
short time. I didn't have a car,
so I had to take the bus and

00:39:53.524 --> 00:39:55.526
make it to the meetings. But
then I stopped, I really got

00:39:55.526 --> 00:40:00.164
afraid. I thought maybe the FEDS
were there and I could risk

00:40:00.164 --> 00:40:03.401
everything. Eventually I managed
to meet some people in there and

00:40:03.401 --> 00:40:08.306
they led me to, it's cool, and
they inspired me to purchase

00:40:08.306 --> 00:40:13.177
computer, and so I did, I got
involved and into college

00:40:13.177 --> 00:40:16.848
somehow -- that's another story,
because finally people like

00:40:16.848 --> 00:40:22.987
them, they helped me to figure
out ways to legally (Inaudible)

00:40:22.987 --> 00:40:26.457
stuff. I managed to get my
license in a lot of stuff. I

00:40:26.457 --> 00:40:29.861
tried not to cheat the system,
because I know I couldn't do it

00:40:29.861 --> 00:40:33.631
any other way, and I try to do
it that way. So, I you really

00:40:33.631 --> 00:40:39.137
owe a lot of the 2,600 people,
the inspiration to try to do it

00:40:39.137 --> 00:40:43.775
the right way and it helped a
lot. Anyway, so my second time I

00:40:43.775 --> 00:40:47.812
was here now legally, so I
managed to get my papers and I

00:40:47.812 --> 00:40:50.782
was now a legal resident. And so
I came back, it was probably

00:40:50.782 --> 00:40:57.689
2003, when I did my second run
of DEF CON. On the way here, I

00:40:57.689 --> 00:41:01.959
was driving with someone, he's
really cool hacker, he's handle

00:41:01.959 --> 00:41:05.396
is (Inaudible) and we were
driving in the car and somehow

00:41:05.396 --> 00:41:09.834
he was speeding on. We got
pulled over by the police, as he

00:41:09.834 --> 00:41:15.573
was getting a ticket I panic and
I was sweating. I really thought

00:41:15.573 --> 00:41:20.111
that something was going to
happen to me. The idea that you

00:41:20.111 --> 00:41:23.548
are automatically legal and
recommended is not physical to

00:41:23.548 --> 00:41:28.619
digest. And so for me, it was a
little tense, really, you know

00:41:28.619 --> 00:41:31.823
being in the car and thinking
oh, my God I'm going to get

00:41:31.823 --> 00:41:34.859
screwed up. But, you know, I
survived and that was one of my

00:41:34.859 --> 00:41:39.263
fun times at DEF CON. It was
trying to really digest a lot of

00:41:39.263 --> 00:41:44.235
stuff. I was still pretty shy,
but -- I continue to do it for

00:41:44.235 --> 00:41:50.875
some time. Then I stopped, just
like Jeremy -- 	>> I'm Crypt

00:41:50.875 --> 00:41:56.881
Bitch 	>> Sorry. 	>> Yeah. Yeah.
So, you know, things happen in

00:41:59.851 --> 00:42:06.290
your life, I had my sister pass,
too -- (Laughter) -- it really

00:42:06.290 --> 00:42:12.864
happened. 	>> What are you
doing? 	>> I'm Crypt Ear. 	>>

00:42:12.864 --> 00:42:18.836
Anyway's, third time I came
here, established citizen. So I

00:42:18.836 --> 00:42:24.208
experienced DEF CON as I
transitioned through my legal

00:42:24.208 --> 00:42:28.780
status. But I (Inaudible) I was
fortunate enough to meet a lot

00:42:28.780 --> 00:42:33.885
of cool people. I know some of
those people by face, but I

00:42:33.885 --> 00:42:38.289
never engaged. And I know many
people that are not here, and I

00:42:38.289 --> 00:42:42.393
know some of them by faces from
many years that I came in, I was

00:42:42.393 --> 00:42:47.231
hiding, I was really shy and
afraid and I didn't want to

00:42:47.231 --> 00:42:50.868
speak out because I was afraid
of my immigration, and when it

00:42:50.868 --> 00:42:54.672
came to technical stuff it was
difficult to engage. But, at

00:42:54.672 --> 00:42:58.443
some point I realized that was
not really helping, and so, what

00:42:58.443 --> 00:43:02.480
I decided to do is, you know,
come out of closet if you want

00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:06.050
to call it that, and then really
start talking to people and meet

00:43:06.050 --> 00:43:08.886
people and engage with people.
And just say, hey, I'm PlugIn,

00:43:08.886 --> 00:43:14.258
what are you into. And that
really has changed a lot. If you

00:43:14.258 --> 00:43:17.328
look around, you're surrounded
by a lot of people that share

00:43:17.328 --> 00:43:20.665
your passion. This is about
security, technology, you're not

00:43:20.665 --> 00:43:24.836
going to find that anywhere
else. This is your opportunity

00:43:24.836 --> 00:43:29.674
to meet people that share your
thinking that you like. You

00:43:29.674 --> 00:43:32.844
might meet someone who
(Inaudible) people in here, and

00:43:32.844 --> 00:43:36.013
if you don't take advantage of
that, you're really losing out.

00:43:36.013 --> 00:43:39.517
That's one of things I learned,
you're really losing out on some

00:43:39.517 --> 00:43:42.854
of the things that I could have
done better. Now, some of the

00:43:42.854 --> 00:43:46.791
people here, actually helped me
in my career. I got into

00:43:46.791 --> 00:43:51.028
security because of them. 	>> I
think we're having that

00:43:51.028 --> 00:43:54.832
conversation -- shhh. 	>>
(Laughter). 	>> Anyways, I don't

00:43:54.832 --> 00:43:59.904
want to really bore you, but,
(Laughter) you know the point is

00:43:59.904 --> 00:44:04.642
that I understand what it's like
to be here for the first time. I

00:44:04.642 --> 00:44:08.813
got some misfortunes and I find
a way to overcome them, and I

00:44:08.813 --> 00:44:12.450
met interesting people like Mike
and now I'm meeting more of

00:44:12.450 --> 00:44:16.654
them. And so it's fun actually
when you get to meet people and

00:44:16.654 --> 00:44:20.024
have fun, if you go out there
and meet people at the bar, have

00:44:20.024 --> 00:44:25.730
a drink and what not. So, you
know, have fun, engage with

00:44:25.730 --> 00:44:30.168
people, go to places. If you
don't want to do something, just

00:44:30.168 --> 00:44:34.238
find something to do. I'll be
here volunteering, if you want

00:44:34.238 --> 00:44:39.377
to come by and say hi, please,
do. I don't know if I'm talking

00:44:39.377 --> 00:44:43.447
too long. 	>> You're good
(Laughter). 	>> I don't want to

00:44:43.447 --> 00:44:47.852
grab the mic, but I will tell
you some other story because

00:44:47.852 --> 00:44:52.657
this is how I got my handle. And
I think handles are something

00:44:52.657 --> 00:44:57.161
that kind of got lost along I
way. When I did the first DEF

00:44:57.161 --> 00:45:01.599
CON, someone asked me, well -- I
could not even pronounce it to

00:45:01.599 --> 00:45:06.504
be honest. I had to sell it --
so -- anyway's. There was

00:45:06.504 --> 00:45:11.008
another the (Inaudible) from LA.
Not to do with the one from

00:45:11.008 --> 00:45:15.513
here, he was Mexican American I
believe, and he's the one that

00:45:15.513 --> 00:45:20.418
kind of schooled me on what to
handle, because I said, hey, I'm

00:45:20.418 --> 00:45:24.555
Carlos, and he said dude
(Inaudible) so I came up with

00:45:24.555 --> 00:45:29.060
again something else -- and it
was really good. So, it just

00:45:29.060 --> 00:45:33.230
kind of went like that. but,
there was some other guy, he's

00:45:33.230 --> 00:45:38.035
handle name was Ghent,
G-H-E-N-T, probably some of the

00:45:38.035 --> 00:45:45.576
goons here -- he was, really
awesome person, and the way that

00:45:45.576 --> 00:45:50.881
I got my handle is one day, he
was say, hi, I'm Ghent, -- I

00:45:50.881 --> 00:45:54.352
didn't know what to say. So I
looked down and there was a

00:45:54.352 --> 00:45:59.090
bunch of power cables, and the
first thing that came to my mine

00:45:59.090 --> 00:46:04.428
is hey, I'm Plug. It was easy
thing for me to say. I didn't

00:46:04.428 --> 00:46:08.599
really like that, and then it
stuck. And so I want to tell you

00:46:08.599 --> 00:46:13.137
that story because nicknames or
handles are important. When I

00:46:13.137 --> 00:46:17.041
came here, it was difficult to
pretend myself, but to handle

00:46:17.041 --> 00:46:22.580
is, one that goes with you, it's
your alter ego, and in my case

00:46:22.580 --> 00:46:26.550
as an immigrant that was
perfect. (Inaudible) in all of

00:46:26.550 --> 00:46:30.488
year that's I've come here, I've
never, never, ever encountered

00:46:30.488 --> 00:46:34.892
someone asking me where I'm
from. 	>> Oh, really. 	>> This

00:46:34.892 --> 00:46:38.429
is one of the best things, it's
like, no one comes to say, hey

00:46:38.429 --> 00:46:42.900
are you from this place or that
place. So -- 	>> People from

00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:45.369
like Microsoft(r) or
(Inaudible). 	>> Maybe the

00:46:45.369 --> 00:46:48.239
vendors, they do want to know
where you're from, but if you're

00:46:48.239 --> 00:46:51.442
here at the CON, it doesn't
matter, you're here and you're

00:46:51.442 --> 00:46:55.613
here. You're a geek, tech geek,
or tech, whatever you want to

00:46:55.613 --> 00:46:59.083
call yourself. We're here
because we love security. Or --

00:46:59.083 --> 00:47:03.154
something. 	>> We're going to go
ahead into the handles. 	>> All

00:47:03.154 --> 00:47:06.357
right. So, we're going to go
into handles. I think I spoke

00:47:06.357 --> 00:47:11.896
too much. Like you, I understand
and so, please, do engage. You

00:47:11.896 --> 00:47:15.032
know, talk to these people. And
before I leave the mic I really

00:47:15.032 --> 00:47:18.703
want to say, thank you very
much. Because these people,

00:47:18.703 --> 00:47:24.108
spent a lot of time putting
together this for you guys. So I

00:47:24.108 --> 00:47:30.981
think we should give them a
round of applause. What do you

00:47:30.981 --> 00:47:37.288
think? 	(Applause). 	>> So Plug
actually did bring up a pretty

00:47:37.288 --> 00:47:40.958
important point. I have been
calling everybody by their name,

00:47:40.958 --> 00:47:46.964
except for Crypt Ear. 	>> Crypt
Ear? (Laughter). 	>> Nothing. So

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:54.305
your handle is kind of, this is
a story about you, this is your

00:47:54.305 --> 00:48:00.845
badge of honor. Some people try
to make up their own handle. And

00:48:00.845 --> 00:48:06.450
that rarely works. Now, if you
say I am, as an example -- 	>>

00:48:06.450 --> 00:48:08.619
Death Lord slasher band. 	>>
(Inaudible) 	>> It doesn't work.

00:48:08.619 --> 00:48:15.926
	>> How many morph's are out
there right now. 	>> I found

00:48:15.926 --> 00:48:23.267
one. 	>> Or anything else, you
want to be something unique.

00:48:23.267 --> 00:48:29.707
Russ's handle is Vertigo. It's a
fun story, he'll tell you if he

00:48:29.707 --> 00:48:36.347
wants to. 	>> It's great fun.
	>> The story as Plug, my handle

00:48:36.347 --> 00:48:41.419
is Wise Acre and it actually
came from when I used to work at

00:48:41.419 --> 00:48:48.425
SCIC -- and, they were trying to
get into computer security, and

00:48:48.425 --> 00:48:50.961
they put out a brochure, that
said, Black Acre Where Security

00:48:50.961 --> 00:48:52.963
Lives and it was ridiculous, it
was absolutely the worst thing

00:48:52.963 --> 00:48:56.500
that I had ever seen. So I put
together one that said Wise Acre

00:48:56.500 --> 00:49:02.907
Where the Smart Ass Lives, and
published it. And eventually

00:49:02.907 --> 00:49:09.046
that became my handle. Alley
John though, Alley John tried

00:49:09.046 --> 00:49:16.821
really hard to be Revolver. But
he can't be Revolver, because

00:49:16.821 --> 00:49:21.158
when we met him, he was hanging
out over at black hat, first

00:49:21.158 --> 00:49:24.995
time that I met him and he was
wearing a lab coat, and he

00:49:24.995 --> 00:49:27.965
looked like a miniature version
of Joe (Inaudible) (Laughter)

00:49:27.965 --> 00:49:35.673
King Pin. So we tried to figure
out how do get Alley John a

00:49:35.673 --> 00:49:38.976
nickname that reflects a
miniature King Pin. We tried

00:49:38.976 --> 00:49:45.549
Baby Pin, Diaper Pin, your name
needs to be fast, you need to be

00:49:45.549 --> 00:49:52.456
able to say it fast. Push Pin.
Alley John is now Push Pin. So

00:49:52.456 --> 00:49:56.293
what we're going do, is I'm
going to take ten volunteers

00:49:56.293 --> 00:50:03.167
from the audience, before you
volunteer, sir, understand that

00:50:03.167 --> 00:50:07.338
there's a good possibility that
we're going to pick on you.

00:50:07.338 --> 00:50:09.340
Because what you're going to do
is, you're going to go up to the

00:50:09.340 --> 00:50:13.110
mic and you're going to tell
everybody in this room five

00:50:13.110 --> 00:50:16.780
things about you, that people
may or may not know. And I don't

00:50:16.780 --> 00:50:18.782
want to know what language you
do program in; I don't want to

00:50:18.782 --> 00:50:25.823
know how awesome you are at
Destiny; what I want to know is

00:50:25.823 --> 00:50:29.593
some things about you as a
person, Jeremy might want to

00:50:29.593 --> 00:50:34.198
know about Destiny, that way you
guys can play each other -- so

00:50:34.198 --> 00:50:39.536
Jeremy is going to help me out.
And, I would like to get five

00:50:39.536 --> 00:50:43.941
volunteers who can tell a story.
And I'm going to give an

00:50:43.941 --> 00:50:46.477
example. 	>> I thought you said
ten. 	>> Ten people, five

00:50:46.477 --> 00:50:50.748
things, okay. Here is one thing
about me. I am a cancer

00:50:50.748 --> 00:50:55.753
survivor, anybody here that has
ever heard of the phrase "cancer

00:50:55.753 --> 00:51:00.758
brain," it is true. It is a real
thing. And you can feel free to

00:51:00.758 --> 00:51:04.061
laugh. This is one of those
things where -- 	>> Happened to

00:51:04.061 --> 00:51:10.067
my grandmother-- 	>> I
(Laughter) -- I love you clutch

00:51:12.569 --> 00:51:17.808
-- don't be an ass hat. 	>>
They're all trying to follow the

00:51:17.808 --> 00:51:25.049
rules, you're not helping. 	>> I
also had a heart attack a few

00:51:25.049 --> 00:51:29.753
years ago. And as a result --
	(Someone hackling) 	>>

00:51:29.753 --> 00:51:33.557
(Laughter) (Laughter)
(Laughter). 	>> As a result --

00:51:33.557 --> 00:51:37.795
these are funny things. Thank
you. Nobody else is

00:51:37.795 --> 00:51:42.766
participating. I had my heart
attack in the doctor's office,

00:51:42.766 --> 00:51:47.605
which was actually kind of fun.
I was in line at the pharmacy to

00:51:47.605 --> 00:51:50.874
pick up some drugs, and I had a
heart attack, and actually on

00:51:50.874 --> 00:51:56.880
the way to the hospital, my
phone goes off it, buzzes and I

00:51:56.880 --> 00:52:00.951
actually check it, because it
was a 30 minute ride to

00:52:00.951 --> 00:52:05.356
hospital, you know, they had me
on life support and it was my

00:52:05.356 --> 00:52:10.094
friend (Inaudible) texting me
because I had not picked the

00:52:10.094 --> 00:52:16.433
name of my dental team, he went
ahead and named it code blue.

00:52:16.433 --> 00:52:21.538
	(Laughter) 	(Applause) 	>> So
when I come out of surgery,

00:52:21.538 --> 00:52:28.712
because they put a stint in, I
come out of surgery and my wife

00:52:28.712 --> 00:52:31.815
says, do you want to let the
people know that you're doing

00:52:31.815 --> 00:52:35.719
okay? Here is your phone. First
person I called was Jeff. She

00:52:35.719 --> 00:52:37.721
says are you sure you don't want
to call your family? I was like,

00:52:37.721 --> 00:52:43.894
no this is too good. So, you
know, you already know that I'm

00:52:43.894 --> 00:52:48.465
scared to death, but you heard I
have a lemon for a body, my

00:52:48.465 --> 00:52:53.570
friends often tell me it's rule
number two, for me, it's going

00:52:53.570 --> 00:52:58.642
to take a (Inaudible) to kill
me. Anybody want to venture what

00:52:58.642 --> 00:53:02.746
a good nickname would be for me
besides Wise Acre. 	>> Third

00:53:02.746 --> 00:53:09.153
times a charm 	(Laughter) 	>>
Throw her a shirt. 	>> You're

00:53:09.153 --> 00:53:16.160
going to have to come up for
your shirt. 	>> Seriously, one

00:53:16.160 --> 00:53:22.166
of things you want to do with a
handle is just be able to right

00:53:24.902 --> 00:53:28.605
off the top. Third time's a
charm might be a little bit too

00:53:28.605 --> 00:53:33.977
long, when you call me on the
phone. 	>> ( shouts from the

00:53:33.977 --> 00:53:37.414
crowd). 	>> There you go, see.
Now everybody understands how

00:53:37.414 --> 00:53:40.784
this game is played. So we're
going to have them go ahead and

00:53:40.784 --> 00:53:42.953
we're going to take our ten
volunteers. Each of the

00:53:42.953 --> 00:53:45.789
volunteers are going to say five
things about them themselves and

00:53:45.789 --> 00:53:50.227
then we're all going to, the
panel is going to try and bestow

00:53:50.227 --> 00:53:54.298
a nickname. We are happy to take
volunteers from the audience to

00:53:54.298 --> 00:53:58.902
also bestow nicknames, please,
do not just simply say something

00:53:58.902 --> 00:54:04.575
and then put Kitty at the end.
You want it volunteer? All

00:54:04.575 --> 00:54:08.979
right. I'll let you be the first
one. Can you guys help wrangle

00:54:08.979 --> 00:54:15.853
the volunteers, Jeremy. 	>> Yes.
	>> All right, so, raise your

00:54:15.853 --> 00:54:21.859
hands. Let's see. You in here,
because we want to have a little

00:54:23.994 --> 00:54:31.401
diversity. I like the guy back
here with the beard. 	>> Do we

00:54:31.401 --> 00:54:37.307
all just go pick someone? 	>>
Yeah. 	>> Hey Jeremy. 	>> How

00:54:37.307 --> 00:54:43.247
about that guy right there.
Yeah, you. That guy. I pick him.

00:54:43.247 --> 00:54:49.253
	>> That's going to be fun. 	>>
We got ten? All right. So let's

00:55:05.068 --> 00:55:10.841
go ahead and start. Please,
introduce yourself. 	>> I'm from

00:55:10.841 --> 00:55:13.911
the Pacific Northwest; I've been
to the Antarctica; I'm an

00:55:13.911 --> 00:55:17.414
autodidact; I've been playing
with computers longer than I can

00:55:17.414 --> 00:55:23.420
count, but I know squat. 	>>
Diddly. 	>> She said she plays

00:55:30.661 --> 00:55:36.667
with computers. 	>> Squat. 	>>
Actually, if you could come up,

00:55:40.504 --> 00:55:47.511
I would like to give you a
shirt. 	>> Diddly. Give her a

00:55:47.511 --> 00:55:53.450
hand. 	(Applause). 	>> Diddly
parenthetical squat. 	>> If you

00:55:53.450 --> 00:56:00.624
could come up. Everybody give
diddly a round -- 	(Applause).

00:56:00.624 --> 00:56:04.528
	>> If you want, diddly is
available after the show, you

00:56:04.528 --> 00:56:10.534
can talk. You can tell her how
to use computers. All right.

00:56:13.770 --> 00:56:19.076
Next. 	>> Okay. I'm from New
York; I going to run the New

00:56:19.076 --> 00:56:23.780
York City marathon for the first
time this year; I have four

00:56:23.780 --> 00:56:27.084
kids; I would never usually be
up here, but since you all said

00:56:27.084 --> 00:56:29.286
to participate, I'm
participating. So it's

00:56:29.286 --> 00:56:33.223
completely out the character,
completely, completely, and I

00:56:33.223 --> 00:56:36.460
have a twin sister that would be
up here -- she would choose --

00:56:36.460 --> 00:56:42.466
completely outgoing. So -- 	>>
Interesting. Yeah. 	>> We need a

00:56:45.869 --> 00:56:51.875
little bit more information. 	>>
Sure. I started off kind of

00:56:53.977 --> 00:56:57.614
hacking when I was a kid, and
then got married, had kids, and

00:56:57.614 --> 00:57:01.051
just got back to it within a
year or so ago, I was doing like

00:57:01.051 --> 00:57:07.057
math teaching, college math. 	>>
Chaser. I like that. 	>> That

00:57:10.527 --> 00:57:16.533
sounds good. I like that.
	(Applause). 	>> Come on up,

00:57:20.771 --> 00:57:26.777
I've got a shirt for you, too.
Thank you very much. Let's all

00:57:35.085 --> 00:57:41.091
-- 	(Applause) -- 	>> Hi, so,
let's see. I just moved to the

00:57:47.364 --> 00:57:53.837
Seattle area from Baltimore,
Maryland; I was an army brat

00:57:53.837 --> 00:58:00.744
growing up, so I got to live all
over the world. New development

00:58:00.744 --> 00:58:04.581
in my life, so when I was
younger I was actually studying

00:58:04.581 --> 00:58:07.818
classical music, and I dropped
out to take care of my mother

00:58:07.818 --> 00:58:11.021
who is also a cancer survivor,
moved back to the farm, took

00:58:11.021 --> 00:58:14.358
care of her for a while, moved
to Baltimore, got back to

00:58:14.358 --> 00:58:17.461
school, and I just finished as
Master's Degree in computer

00:58:17.461 --> 00:58:20.063
forensics, and it's the first
Master's Degree in my family,

00:58:20.063 --> 00:58:24.334
it's kind of a big deal. 	>>
That's kind of awesome. What do

00:58:24.334 --> 00:58:29.172
you do for fun? 	>> I like
hiking; I like yoga; oh, and I'm

00:58:29.172 --> 00:58:32.242
actually, my mentor actually
called me paddle one, but it's

00:58:32.242 --> 00:58:38.248
hilarious to me because I'm a
total trekkie. (Laughter). 	>> B

00:58:44.254 --> 00:58:50.260
& E. That's awesome story. You
are B & E for fun. 	>> Awesome.

00:59:04.107 --> 00:59:10.113
	(Applause). 	>> One more? Try
again she says. Yeah. So -- I

00:59:14.317 --> 00:59:19.523
gave a shirt to a friend and he
looked at it and he's like --

00:59:19.523 --> 00:59:25.529
are these in European sizes?
(Laughter) 	>> Hi, first

00:59:32.235 --> 00:59:38.074
security conference for me. So
kind of nervous. I'm allergic to

00:59:38.074 --> 00:59:40.076
a lot of things. I'm the reason
you guys can't eight peanuts on

00:59:40.076 --> 00:59:45.215
the airplane, lettuce, which is
strange, and people usually

00:59:45.215 --> 00:59:49.786
don't believe me. But, see I was
really resentful when my parents

00:59:49.786 --> 00:59:52.989
made me eat my veggies as a kid,
until we figured out what was

00:59:52.989 --> 00:59:56.393
going on there. I really like
snow boarding, and used to

00:59:56.393 --> 01:00:02.399
college race boats. 	>> Epi. 	>>
If you hear epi, just no

01:00:06.937 --> 01:00:12.943
peanuts. 	>> Are you allergic to
cotton? 	>> (Laughter). 	>>

01:00:17.414 --> 01:00:24.488
There you go. Again, thank you,
epi. 	(Applause). 	>> All right.

01:00:24.488 --> 01:00:30.494
I'm sure that you've got a good
story for us, sir. 	>> I got

01:00:32.662 --> 01:00:36.666
involved in hacking, because my
things were always breaking. And

01:00:36.666 --> 01:00:41.104
that just wasn't okay. I like to
people watch. I'm curiosity

01:00:41.104 --> 01:00:45.575
driven. I'm in front of a mic,
and wow this is interesting. 	>>

01:00:45.575 --> 01:00:49.546
Okay, tell us, what do you do
for fun? 	>> Computers,

01:00:49.546 --> 01:00:55.552
primarily. 	>> That means you at
least get out a little bit. What

01:01:01.424 --> 01:01:09.065
else do you do? 	>> One track,
there you go. I'm liking this,

01:01:09.065 --> 01:01:15.071
we're going to shelf that one
for a second. You know, tell us

01:01:17.073 --> 01:01:21.912
a little bit more about
yourself. How did you get here,

01:01:21.912 --> 01:01:26.850
and who are you here with. 	>> I
actually managed to sell my

01:01:26.850 --> 01:01:32.289
employer that this was good
professional development.

01:01:32.289 --> 01:01:38.295
	(Applause). 	>> Are you here by
yourself. 	>> No, I actually got

01:01:42.899 --> 01:01:46.036
one of my co-workers here with
me. It's not his first time

01:01:46.036 --> 01:01:49.673
though. 	>> Okay. Well,
fantastic. I actually do like

01:01:49.673 --> 01:01:53.376
one track. Because, you know, it
does kind of, you are focused,

01:01:53.376 --> 01:02:00.216
sir. That's going to be good.
	>> Yeah, okay. 	>> Sound good?

01:02:00.216 --> 01:02:03.687
	>> Yup -- I like it. 	>> Thank
you for all your participation.

01:02:03.687 --> 01:02:06.823
Welcome One Track. 	(Applause).
	>> Any time now. 	>> Yeah. 	>>

01:02:06.823 --> 01:02:10.560
There's a lot of space between
you and that mic, sir. 	>> Yeah,

01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:14.030
you may need to step up. 	>>
Thank you, closer, closer, open

01:02:14.030 --> 01:02:16.933
your mouth, closer (Laughter).
	>> All right. Okay. So I'm

01:02:16.933 --> 01:02:22.939
relatively new to the security
field. I just started this past

01:02:39.189 --> 01:02:42.659
year; it was my junior year in
college; I got in involved in

01:02:42.659 --> 01:02:46.696
U-Dub Tacoma Security Group and
then got involved up in U-Dub

01:02:46.696 --> 01:02:49.933
Seattle, and I'm actually coming
from U-Dub Seattle with a bunch

01:02:49.933 --> 01:02:53.436
of U-Dub guys. I'm majoring in
computer science, -- shout out

01:02:53.436 --> 01:02:57.040
to the guy before me, I'm very
into (inaudible) and play a lot

01:02:57.040 --> 01:03:02.979
of commander -- so, yeah. 	>> We
need to come up with a couple

01:03:09.185 --> 01:03:15.191
questions. Let's see. 	(Audience
- inaudible) 	>> Do you have

01:03:23.166 --> 01:03:29.172
your cards? 	>> I do not have my
cards, but the one commander

01:03:35.412 --> 01:03:38.581
deck that I play is based off of
(Inaudible) it's green/white

01:03:38.581 --> 01:03:41.751
creatures deck. 	>> What's the
complicated name you gave your

01:03:41.751 --> 01:03:47.757
deck? 	>> Car Metra's Creatures
Crew. 	>> (Laughter). 	>> I like

01:03:52.729 --> 01:03:58.234
it, CQ. I'm assuming they're all
C's? You're no longer Magic Mic,

01:03:58.234 --> 01:04:04.174
apparently, you're CQ, welcome
CQ to the community. (Laughter).

01:04:23.693 --> 01:04:29.699
	(Applause). 	>> All right. You,
sir, have to have a new story.

01:04:38.174 --> 01:04:41.211
	>> Hopefully I do, this is my
first time with the conference.

01:04:41.211 --> 01:04:43.680
I'm originally from Jamaica; I
love motorcycles, actually have

01:04:43.680 --> 01:04:47.350
four. I actually, funny you
know, I got into security by

01:04:47.350 --> 01:04:50.220
accident, when I got my first
computer when he was ten years

01:04:50.220 --> 01:04:52.889
old, I vowed never to learn
hacking because I didn't want to

01:04:52.889 --> 01:04:57.427
go to jail. Coincidentally, I
started learning it at a

01:04:57.427 --> 01:05:02.532
(Inaudible) agency, so now I do
it for a living. Fun stuff, I

01:05:02.532 --> 01:05:04.534
mean, like I said, I love my
motorcycle riding; I love

01:05:04.534 --> 01:05:09.072
sports; I've played soccer;
always get asked why don't I

01:05:09.072 --> 01:05:13.977
play basketball; I don't really
like basketball. But that's the

01:05:13.977 --> 01:05:18.281
bulk of it. 	>> What position do
you play? 	>> Normally I'm in

01:05:18.281 --> 01:05:22.218
midfield to the fence when I
play soccer, but I can switch

01:05:22.218 --> 01:05:29.692
around depending -- 	>> This one
is going to be a little special

01:05:29.692 --> 01:05:35.865
to us. It is, and I'll explain
in a second. It's going to be

01:05:35.865 --> 01:05:39.369
epitome -- and it's because we
have a lot people that we love

01:05:39.369 --> 01:05:45.208
in this CON and some, one of
artists especially, who is her

01:05:45.208 --> 01:05:48.044
husband, and we have Mare who
actually did all the art work

01:05:48.044 --> 01:05:51.481
for this, and you look like the
epitome of what they draw when

01:05:51.481 --> 01:05:57.487
they draw a hacker. 	(Applause).
	>> Thank you very much. I

01:06:14.370 --> 01:06:18.474
appreciate it. 	>> Hello,
everyone. I'm from Miami, I

01:06:18.474 --> 01:06:21.444
guess it goes without saying
that I was a little nervous

01:06:21.444 --> 01:06:27.450
walking up here until I heard
that a lot of you guys are into

01:06:29.719 --> 01:06:36.159
fisting so, so -- 	>> Kids,
cover your eyes. 	>> I guess a

01:06:36.159 --> 01:06:39.963
few things; I like hats; I
definitely like dancing, so I

01:06:39.963 --> 01:06:44.801
might be that guy that you see
in the hallways, and I'm not

01:06:44.801 --> 01:06:48.872
twitching or anything like that
-- just like. 	>> Let's see

01:06:48.872 --> 01:06:54.878
something. 	>> Put on some music
-- I don't do it for free --

01:06:57.947 --> 01:07:03.887
	(Music Playing) -- dancing.
	(Applause). 	>> Pretty good, I

01:07:09.692 --> 01:07:15.698
like that. 	>> Wiggles? 	>> No.
	>> That's a nickname that you

01:07:25.408 --> 01:07:31.414
could wear with pride. Are you
good with that one? 	>> Yes. 	>>

01:07:35.752 --> 01:07:41.758
I would own the crap out of
that. Mr. Wiggles. Mr. Wiggles.

01:07:47.130 --> 01:07:51.200
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha. 	>>
We're fisting. I forgot that,

01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:58.608
sir. 	>> Mr. Wiggles. 	>> I love
it. 	>> First thing about me --

01:07:58.608 --> 01:08:05.181
my memory is so bad I wrote down
things about myself in case I

01:08:05.181 --> 01:08:08.451
forgot them by the time I got up
here. But I'm not nervous

01:08:08.451 --> 01:08:11.854
because public speaking doesn't
bother me. I've seen 106

01:08:11.854 --> 01:08:15.358
Metallic shows in 13 countries.
I had long hair longer than I've

01:08:15.358 --> 01:08:20.763
had short hair. I didn't meet by
brothers until I was eight. I

01:08:20.763 --> 01:08:27.937
nearly went into singing instead
of computers. Oh, and I ride a

01:08:27.937 --> 01:08:33.943
Harley. 	>> We're good. 	>> Push
Pin and I said it the same time.

01:08:41.417 --> 01:08:47.423
OP, over prepared. 	(Applause).
	>> Hi, this is my first DEF

01:08:51.995 --> 01:08:58.001
CON, I don't actually work in
computers, I write for video

01:09:00.003 --> 01:09:05.441
games, that's pretty great. I
first learned about DEF CON in,

01:09:05.441 --> 01:09:07.443
-- 	>> Are you telling us that
it's pretty great? 	>> I am

01:09:07.443 --> 01:09:12.248
telling you, it's really great.
	>> I accept. 	>> Transaction

01:09:12.248 --> 01:09:17.053
complete. I learned about DEF
CON when I was reading an OK

01:09:17.053 --> 01:09:20.056
sci-fi book, I think in like
1999. It was called Wyrm. I

01:09:20.056 --> 01:09:23.292
don't know if you ever read
that. 	>> You got mumbled at the

01:09:23.292 --> 01:09:27.897
end. 	>> I learned about DEF CON
in a sci-fi book that first came

01:09:27.897 --> 01:09:31.834
out in 1999. It's called the
Wyrm by Mark Fabi. 	>> One more

01:09:31.834 --> 01:09:36.072
time. 	>> Wyrm. 	>> Wyrm, WYRM.
	>> From the beginning now. 	>>

01:09:36.072 --> 01:09:41.811
Stop it. 	>> Nevermind. It
doesn't matter. Doesn't matter.

01:09:41.811 --> 01:09:48.818
It's okay. Simon does? He's
older than Mike. He took it

01:09:48.818 --> 01:09:53.756
right out. 	>> I used to be a
high school English teacher, and

01:09:53.756 --> 01:09:56.959
decided I would much rather make
video games. 	>> One of my

01:09:56.959 --> 01:10:00.229
favorite people is a high school
English teacher. 	>> More power

01:10:00.229 --> 01:10:02.932
to him, I could not do it. 	>>
Should we just call him Melani?

01:10:02.932 --> 01:10:08.938
(Laughter). 	>> What about only
dude. 	>> Only dude. 	>> Are

01:10:13.142 --> 01:10:20.950
good with that? 	>> No. 	>> Keep
going. 	>> Okay, anyway, I moved

01:10:20.950 --> 01:10:24.654
something like 2,300 miles to
make games instead of teach

01:10:24.654 --> 01:10:30.660
kids. And, when I got to
California, I went to buy a car,

01:10:34.731 --> 01:10:37.333
and, instead of buying a car I
decided I was going to bright

01:10:37.333 --> 01:10:40.903
green suit of armor instead, and
I have been very happy with it.

01:10:44.707 --> 01:10:46.943
	>> So you quit teaching, and
started video games and you

01:10:46.943 --> 01:10:50.980
bought a suit of armor. 	>> That
is exactly what happened. 	>>

01:10:50.980 --> 01:10:57.286
I'm so perplexed by you. 	>> I
want to hang out with him. 	>> I

01:10:57.286 --> 01:10:59.956
know. Do you have a picture of
you in a suit of armor. 	>> I

01:10:59.956 --> 01:11:03.893
will show you later, yes. It's
my dating profile picture.

01:11:03.893 --> 01:11:11.367
(Laughter). 	(Applause). 	>> I
thought -- I've seen the all.

01:11:11.367 --> 01:11:17.373
POF, please, tell me it's Plenty
Of Fish. 	>> I will show you

01:11:21.077 --> 01:11:27.083
later. 	>> I will find you. I'm
not going to kill you though.

01:11:31.554 --> 01:11:39.228
	>> Match? 	>> POF? 	>> I still
don't like it. I almost want to

01:11:39.228 --> 01:11:45.968
say perplexed. Who has a
thesaurus. 	>> Convolute. 	>>

01:11:45.968 --> 01:11:53.309
Green suit? 	>> I don't know
what that means. 	>> One at a

01:11:53.309 --> 01:11:59.315
time? 	>> Armor Greivs. 	>> That
was just a small part of his

01:12:09.325 --> 01:12:15.331
story. Whoever dates him is
going to do it because of that.

01:12:24.207 --> 01:12:30.213
So it's got to be dating. 	>>
I'm perplexed. 	>> No you're

01:12:35.518 --> 01:12:42.692
crypt. 	>> Oh, thank you. 	>>
Oh, now he gets it right. 	>> I

01:12:42.692 --> 01:12:48.698
don't know -- I'm out of this
one. I'm washing my hands. I

01:12:51.067 --> 01:12:58.841
want to see that picture, but
I'm washing my hands of this

01:12:58.841 --> 01:13:06.515
one. 	>> Bring the picture up.
	>> Jolly Green Giant. Bring the

01:13:06.515 --> 01:13:14.257
picture you want to see the
picture now. 	>> Yeah, bring the

01:13:14.257 --> 01:13:20.096
picture. 	>> Green Knight.
	(Applause). 	>> He's going to

01:13:20.096 --> 01:13:26.102
take a minute and bring up his
profile picture. Can we get that

01:13:28.504 --> 01:13:35.711
picture on the projector? 	>>
Who's got a thumb drive? We'll

01:13:35.711 --> 01:13:39.749
figure out a way to get that up
there. 	>> This is amazing guys.

01:13:39.749 --> 01:13:45.054
This is awesome. It says hell,
yes. This is amazing. Mel,

01:13:45.054 --> 01:13:51.060
you're an English teacher,
right? Describe this to us. 	>>

01:13:53.896 --> 01:14:01.370
It looks like he's wearing like
yellow knee pads and spiky

01:14:01.370 --> 01:14:07.576
shoulders. 	>> Not on your life,
sir. Thank you. 	>> It's pretty

01:14:07.576 --> 01:14:13.149
great. Yeah, it's great. 	>>
It's so legit, right? I can't

01:14:13.149 --> 01:14:19.155
believe that. 	>> Green Knight.
	(Applause). 	>> Totally double

01:14:24.860 --> 01:14:30.866
dog dare everybody here. Reach
out, find somebody with

01:14:37.540 --> 01:14:41.544
something in common that you
don't already know. And make a

01:14:41.544 --> 01:14:46.349
friend, you know. Do something,
get yourself involved, because

01:14:46.349 --> 01:14:52.188
that's what makes this
conference fun, and you know,

01:14:52.188 --> 01:14:57.026
please, whoever, if you
participated today, thank you,

01:14:57.026 --> 01:15:00.930
because it's absolutely awesome.
Because it's not, that's not the

01:15:00.930 --> 01:15:04.533
kind of thing that most people
do and to be able to get up and

01:15:04.533 --> 01:15:07.403
tell the story and have us
address you and give you your

01:15:07.403 --> 01:15:10.806
nickname, please, wear it with
pride. 	>> Can I say something

01:15:10.806 --> 01:15:16.412
real quick. 	>> Yup. 	>> Okay. A
lot of people ask, how can I get

01:15:16.412 --> 01:15:22.284
involved. How can I be a goon.
And the answer is, you know,

01:15:22.284 --> 01:15:27.223
officially, well we like to
promote people we trust. So the

01:15:27.223 --> 01:15:31.394
only way to gain that trust is
experience. If you want to help,

01:15:31.394 --> 01:15:33.996
if you want to be involved in
something, you have to take the

01:15:33.996 --> 01:15:37.066
leap and interact with other
people. Especially those in

01:15:37.066 --> 01:15:42.171
charge and say -- what do you
need. And not always, I know a

01:15:42.171 --> 01:15:45.141
lot of people would be like,
what the fuck -- why is she

01:15:45.141 --> 01:15:49.278
saying this. Don't wait to be
told what to do, the best way to

01:15:49.278 --> 01:15:54.250
help is to step in and say I can
help you with that, or I can go

01:15:54.250 --> 01:15:58.387
get that for you, and once you
do that, you help somebody else,

01:15:58.387 --> 01:16:01.857
you break the ice, you make
friends. I can't tell you how

01:16:01.857 --> 01:16:05.961
many newbs I've met, and my
husband has met, and my friends

01:16:05.961 --> 01:16:09.865
have met that are now gooning.
They showed up, they got

01:16:09.865 --> 01:16:13.436
involved, they interacted,
they're gooning. Here is one

01:16:13.436 --> 01:16:18.307
here right behind you, it's his
second year. 	>> Number two. 	>>

01:16:18.307 --> 01:16:23.679
And once, he's a goon -- because
-- 	>> That's his handle. 	>>

01:16:23.679 --> 01:16:28.250
Because if you have the
motivation and the drive and the

01:16:28.250 --> 01:16:33.656
spirit to make this CON what you
want it to be, because it's what

01:16:33.656 --> 01:16:39.028
you make it. If you don't like
something, do something about

01:16:39.028 --> 01:16:43.766
it. Don't just complain, do
something about it. Join. Say,

01:16:43.766 --> 01:16:46.702
hey, have you ever thought of
doing it this way, or have you

01:16:46.702 --> 01:16:49.305
ever thought about having a
village for this, or a contest

01:16:49.305 --> 01:16:52.741
for this, or an event for that.
Just step up and if you're, you

01:16:52.741 --> 01:16:55.344
know, a cool person, then you
end up like this asshole behind

01:16:55.344 --> 01:17:01.283
me. Oh, I'm sorry, I'm not
suppose to be cursing. 	>> All

01:17:05.121 --> 01:17:10.259
right, we're going to go ahead,
we've got a few minutes briefly

01:17:10.259 --> 01:17:16.732
for questions. Stand up, please.
	>> There's an international

01:17:16.732 --> 01:17:22.738
meet up tomorrow (Inaudible).
	>> What's the question -- it's

01:17:24.974 --> 01:17:30.980
Jeopardy, frame it in the form
of a question, please. 	>>

01:17:34.049 --> 01:17:39.955
(Inaudible). 	>> I will talk
about that. 	>> Hey, if you have

01:17:39.955 --> 01:17:43.259
a question. 	>> International
Meet up tomorrow, 6 p.m., in the

01:17:43.259 --> 01:17:46.595
chill out space. It says on the
back of the card, it's dangerous

01:17:46.595 --> 01:17:52.034
to go alone, meet up. 	>> Hey,
if you have a question, use the

01:17:52.034 --> 01:17:55.337
mic so everyone can hear you.
	>> Thank you, Jeremy. 	>>

01:17:55.337 --> 01:17:59.975
That's why we put them here, and
they're all over the CON now,

01:17:59.975 --> 01:18:05.915
you now have a voice, too.
	(Applause). 	>> Feel so

01:18:11.453 --> 01:18:17.459
motivated. 	>> (Inaudible). 	>>
Thank you. If got given a

01:18:27.970 --> 01:18:33.609
handle, please, come see me
before you leave. Did everybody

01:18:33.609 --> 01:18:37.880
get that? If got given a handle,
please, see me before you leave.

01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:43.252
Any other questions? You sir,
stand up. 	>> There's a whole

01:18:43.252 --> 01:18:48.357
bunch of junk -- 	>> It's
canceled tomorrow, every year

01:18:48.357 --> 01:18:54.997
that happens, and this year they
actually put a lot of effort

01:18:54.997 --> 01:18:56.999
into it, I like the whole
webpage with the facts, that

01:18:56.999 --> 01:19:00.836
actually was kind of fun. But
no, DEF CON is not canceled. You

01:19:00.836 --> 01:19:06.842
sir? 	>> (Inaudible). 	>> Yeah,
get there early, that's really

01:19:11.747 --> 01:19:13.949
the only advice that we can give
you. If you see that something

01:19:13.949 --> 01:19:21.757
is good, try to get there early.
Attend the previous talk, attend

01:19:21.757 --> 01:19:25.160
that talk and see what it's
like, you know, you might find

01:19:25.160 --> 01:19:29.565
that the talk in advance is
something interesting. 	>> So,

01:19:29.565 --> 01:19:33.502
I'm going to jump in here for a
second, while that decent

01:19:33.502 --> 01:19:38.907
advice, as an operations guy, I
will tell you, last year we had

01:19:38.907 --> 01:19:46.482
165 --> 000 square feet. We have
320 --> 000 square feet this year.

01:19:46.482 --> 01:19:51.220
We also have a (Inaudible) a lot
more desks, everything is

01:19:51.220 --> 01:19:55.024
pre-bagged thanks to Jay and
Crypt Ear, I'm never letting

01:19:55.024 --> 01:20:01.997
that go. So, those lines that
you're having issues with are

01:20:01.997 --> 01:20:05.334
going to go very, very quickly.
If you guys fill those rooms, I

01:20:05.334 --> 01:20:12.474
will be shocked, incredibly
shocked. 	>> (Inaudible). 	>>

01:20:12.474 --> 01:20:18.480
All right. One more question --
	>> That is a good question.

01:20:29.525 --> 01:20:35.531
Russ? Ten. Honestly, 	>> What
time does villages open

01:20:42.271 --> 01:20:48.277
tomorrow? 	>> Thank you, Jay.
	>> I didn't even see your lips

01:20:59.321 --> 01:21:05.260
move. 	>> Oh, my goodness. 	>>
The answer is 10. 	>> Thanks

01:21:15.771 --> 01:21:21.777
guys, I appreciate it,
everybody, if you have

01:21:26.982 --> 01:21:28.984
additional questions, some see
me. I'll see you all at opening

01:21:28.984 --> 01:21:30.986
ceremonies tomorrow.
