00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.837
I didn't come here to fuck
spiders. Let's get started. This

00:00:03.837 --> 00:00:11.478
is switches get stitches this is
the third episode. And is --

00:00:11.478 --> 00:00:17.484
then I took it to Kyos
communication and I wanted these

00:00:24.124 --> 00:00:28.729
guy to join me to bring some
different elms to a talk and a

00:00:28.729 --> 00:00:31.999
talk focus on ether -- multilink
and over there the open so

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:38.005
that's what this is band that's
the previous episodes. So who

00:00:45.212 --> 00:00:51.218
are we? I'll. >> So I'm Colin
Cassidy I have been a senior

00:00:54.221 --> 00:00:57.925
engineer for 15 year and I gave
that up -- >> Rob lee, I was one

00:00:57.925 --> 00:01:00.260
of the guys you probably hate I
was in the government recently.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:06.266
So I'm alive and civilian. And
I'm a re -- >> I used to be a

00:01:19.813 --> 00:01:25.686
senior risk research until I
started telling jokes at DEFCON.

00:01:25.686 --> 00:01:32.526
>> So we expect you to be a
DEFCON audio yen, to have a lot

00:01:32.526 --> 00:01:39.433
of fun. One is private keys.
When you see them on the screen

00:01:39.433 --> 00:01:42.336
when we talk ability them and
the other one is when you here

00:01:42.336 --> 00:01:49.409
vendor patch time story that you
like. I expect you to make some

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:55.415
noise. Switches get stitches. So
the -- X 2 hundred switches.

00:01:59.453 --> 00:02:04.391
Basically this the one I worked
on. They have session ID in

00:02:04.391 --> 00:02:08.195
their web interface and we know
session ID is a good place to

00:02:08.195 --> 00:02:14.334
get started. Management plain so
when you go to web site of this

00:02:14.334 --> 00:02:17.671
switch to management you get
these session IDs. Is anybody

00:02:17.671 --> 00:02:23.677
here reverse engineering? I'm
glad there is a few people --

00:02:28.382 --> 00:02:30.517
these should be pretty
obviously. You see the CO, AA

00:02:30.517 --> 00:02:36.523
and you think that looks like a
local I P address. But you

00:02:41.495 --> 00:02:47.501
notice they're increasing.
They're increasing only. Can you

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:56.176
see the rights on the left
happened side? It will give you

00:03:03.116 --> 00:03:09.122
in -- up time in and hacked. And
then I got confuse because I

00:03:13.126 --> 00:03:18.131
check the IP address and it was
not the IP address of the

00:03:18.131 --> 00:03:22.202
switch. Right? So I kind of
thought of it for a little while

00:03:22.202 --> 00:03:26.907
and then surely lay didn't and
of course it was my machine that

00:03:26.907 --> 00:03:30.510
was connected. Client up time.
Based on time was one of the

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:36.516
first -- week session ID and you
can sort of see in the mind of

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.389
the develop here. I know I'll
create all of the IP space and

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:48.395
all of time and that would be
impossible to estimate but

00:03:51.698 --> 00:03:59.473
barely weak session ID. I'll say
one other thing. The better the

00:03:59.473 --> 00:04:04.478
talk is how the passwords were
wired. So obviously the user,

00:04:04.478 --> 00:04:10.484
password is the computer text of
the password -- now the is pass

00:04:17.023 --> 00:04:20.527
back and forth and the ID you
cannot replay a hatch from

00:04:20.527 --> 00:04:22.863
previously. So there it is in
the end but you'll realize -- is

00:04:22.863 --> 00:04:26.032
not a very large space so you
can snatch one over these ID. I

00:04:26.032 --> 00:04:32.038
think 16 characters maybe 15
minutes. Something like -- here.

00:04:39.412 --> 00:04:45.418
>> Also has a weak session ID. 8
character low. We didn't really

00:04:48.989 --> 00:04:50.991
look into much further but there
was a nice configuration item if

00:04:50.991 --> 00:04:52.993
-- these highlight some of the
problems with these switches but

00:04:52.993 --> 00:04:54.995
they're not always deploys the
most default. If there is one

00:04:54.995 --> 00:04:56.997
less thing they can test and do
a quick swap that makes life so

00:04:56.997 --> 00:04:58.999
much easier. All right. So. >>
After finding these issue with

00:04:58.999 --> 00:05:00.934
the session ID. Can you do some
side hacking. If you work

00:05:00.934 --> 00:05:02.936
regular to do pen testing. You
realize from an operation -- how

00:05:02.936 --> 00:05:04.938
often so I have to wait for that
to occur. As best. So we didn't

00:05:04.938 --> 00:05:06.940
like those -- in terms -- and
particular on firmware. If you

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:08.942
go over to get hub you can pull
down this script and basically

00:05:08.942 --> 00:05:10.944
this is a CSRF. Is it makes
possible for you to down load a

00:05:10.944 --> 00:05:16.850
configuration file or down loud
the file or if you do a put, you

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:23.990
can put the soft wire. I find
this amazing because you can

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:31.097
change the log file before you
break into it and this creates

00:05:31.097 --> 00:05:37.003
an authentication by bass I can
have known good configuration

00:05:37.003 --> 00:05:44.711
and the password is hatched in
those file and I take that known

00:05:44.711 --> 00:05:52.118
good one, well before I use the
known good one so I have the

00:05:52.118 --> 00:05:57.157
bass words that used to be
there. I log in with my password

00:05:57.157 --> 00:06:01.695
which might be -- -- reload and
no one -- authentication and is

00:06:01.695 --> 00:06:05.932
also brilliant that you can post
a firmware imagine to device. So

00:06:05.932 --> 00:06:10.537
fix this in newer version but if
you do pen test in this

00:06:10.537 --> 00:06:14.407
environment or have access to
these -- prof to yourself that

00:06:14.407 --> 00:06:19.379
those -- >> So I got involved in
this project about a month after

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:23.250
joining my firm. I have been
breaking these switches if you

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:27.520
want to take a look. Fair
enough. Down load, so the tool

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:31.625
of choice more often is been --
basically looks like -- for sort

00:06:31.625 --> 00:06:34.461
of header of particular type in
this case we can see there is a

00:06:34.461 --> 00:06:36.663
large compress file. So taken
the last compress file we can

00:06:36.663 --> 00:06:39.499
see that the first items there
-- better? >> Yeah. >> So we can

00:06:39.499 --> 00:06:42.102
see the first 4 items there
relate to -- semen -- and there

00:06:42.102 --> 00:06:44.938
it is. So report this to vendor
as you do and vendor came back

00:06:44.938 --> 00:06:47.374
and you can change into the web
interface. That's fine. Where in

00:06:47.374 --> 00:06:49.376
documentation you have this key
that needs changing otherwise

00:06:49.376 --> 00:06:51.378
that's like an undocumenation.
Okay, we'll change it. So

00:06:51.378 --> 00:06:53.380
self-science it can be change in
the web interface. So guess

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:55.815
what? Bowl in a -- in the same
style same pattern. Default key

00:06:55.815 --> 00:06:58.251
and important because we like to
do it bigger and better. Trying

00:06:58.251 --> 00:07:00.587
to build parts signatures and
stuff. We wanted to this talk to

00:07:00.587 --> 00:07:02.622
say if you do web American
people pin testing every

00:07:02.622 --> 00:07:04.824
embedded device has an embedded
web server and they are enough

00:07:04.824 --> 00:07:07.460
to get you control over the
device so we can use your help.

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:10.063
But that's really good for you
they tell some of the best -- I

00:07:10.063 --> 00:07:12.399
carved out a firm way of --
someone sent me a peek app. A

00:07:12.399 --> 00:07:14.768
one of them send me a peek app
of this device and said, here's

00:07:14.768 --> 00:07:16.970
this HD traffic but once we do
the firmware upgrade and use the

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:19.472
same -- I carve up all the
files. It was over FDF so now I

00:07:19.472 --> 00:07:21.675
have a copy of the firmware
imagine from the peek app and I

00:07:21.675 --> 00:07:23.710
look through it and been --
didn't recognize a lot of it.

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:26.546
And other stuff and then wrote a
little script and manage to

00:07:26.546 --> 00:07:28.548
decompress it and found a raw
imagine and inside there is

00:07:28.548 --> 00:07:30.550
these private keys and I know
you guys like these private key

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:32.552
collection. Yeah. So these
private key it is first one is

00:07:32.552 --> 00:07:37.023
for the H -- seen the --
firmware upgrade and uninstall

00:07:37.023 --> 00:07:41.528
wire shark so you get those as
well. But I think this is a reel

00:07:41.528 --> 00:07:45.565
key issue in the sense that once
if you only have -- I wanted

00:07:45.565 --> 00:07:49.002
interface in device and someone
breaks out you know don't have a

00:07:49.002 --> 00:07:52.172
secure channel in where to up
load keys. The second key

00:07:52.172 --> 00:07:55.041
belongs to SSH and another
researcher has then force the

00:07:55.041 --> 00:07:59.045
key so the password on that is
magnum 6 K. We'll talk about in

00:07:59.045 --> 00:08:02.716
a minute. I guess we're talking
ability it now -- about. So it

00:08:02.716 --> 00:08:08.922
turns out this switch is sold by
GE but is manufacture by garo --

00:08:08.922 --> 00:08:15.028
magnum 6 K so you basically take
a different firmware. The key

00:08:15.028 --> 00:08:20.033
has change but it is the same
unless you clarify that these

00:08:20.033 --> 00:08:24.704
particular keys affect 7 out of
9. This stuff doesn't apply. So

00:08:24.704 --> 00:08:26.706
you know just what an hour or
two of ben walk and you pull

00:08:26.706 --> 00:08:28.708
these keys and you get a bypass
for a thousand -- switch of the

00:08:28.708 --> 00:08:30.710
switch family. >> Just
continuing. We found these keys

00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:32.846
in GE switch. Is and so when you
see the report itch -- that is

00:08:32.846 --> 00:08:39.386
affected and how does that get
out of the way of the public.

00:08:39.386 --> 00:08:44.424
That makes it hard to do
incident response and control.

00:08:44.424 --> 00:08:50.463
So pulling keys of see men
switches we moved onto GED we

00:08:50.463 --> 00:08:55.001
don't actually have this switch
this investigation highlight not

00:08:55.001 --> 00:09:00.974
having the switch, what we found
was not really problem, we went

00:09:00.974 --> 00:09:06.513
to Ga about it and because
interesting if we nothing else.

00:09:06.513 --> 00:09:12.519
So being our friend pull it down
is a -- it happens to be a --

00:09:14.587 --> 00:09:21.127
and in deed it contain it is
password and hatches. So you

00:09:21.127 --> 00:09:23.296
know it has off code which is
used if you forget the password

00:09:23.296 --> 00:09:25.298
you need the reset. It has a
factory password so if anyone

00:09:25.298 --> 00:09:27.300
has a faster password cracking
rate than me. Take a note of it

00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:29.302
and -- we did report this to GE
and the guys rang me back. I

00:09:29.302 --> 00:09:31.304
think I had one of their head
product people and their

00:09:31.304 --> 00:09:33.306
enticement develops, we don't
believe it was a thing. Now I

00:09:33.306 --> 00:09:35.308
don't have this device to test
that so if anybody has one and I

00:09:35.308 --> 00:09:37.310
can borrow that would be ideal.
But the other slightly thing is

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:39.312
this is an industrial network --
why is there a games user and

00:09:39.312 --> 00:09:41.314
they got private keys too. So
yeah king manages and network --

00:09:41.314 --> 00:09:46.186
you are going to find key -- if
they're unchangeable that is

00:09:46.186 --> 00:09:50.890
bad. We have not found
unchangeable keys. Self-sign --

00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:56.663
keys if you are isolated network
that's fine because you should

00:09:56.663 --> 00:10:02.402
not be connected your -- right
certificate a -- no. This

00:10:02.402 --> 00:10:09.209
switches ten to lack sort of
processing power and any sort of

00:10:09.209 --> 00:10:13.279
-- but if you are going to set
these things up you'll plug them

00:10:13.279 --> 00:10:15.715
into a lab top and it has sort
of capability so the vendors out

00:10:15.715 --> 00:10:17.717
there maybe they need to
consider a sort of initial step

00:10:17.717 --> 00:10:19.719
process that helps lock these
things down from the start while

00:10:19.719 --> 00:10:21.721
they have one thing that will --
every switch that's not helpful.

00:10:21.721 --> 00:10:23.723
Essentially the problem with key
management have you to manage

00:10:23.723 --> 00:10:25.725
your keys don't leave it to the
vendors or whatever. All right

00:10:25.725 --> 00:10:27.727
so you know let's get back to
web back phones instead of

00:10:27.727 --> 00:10:29.729
prepping keys out. There is a
good story. Bad ass -- I spent a

00:10:29.729 --> 00:10:31.731
little bit of time with him and
he does code review. How do find

00:10:31.731 --> 00:10:33.733
so many -- I just grab for them.
And I thought you know what. His

00:10:33.733 --> 00:10:35.735
write. If I'm going to write one
script that -- would be like

00:10:35.735 --> 00:10:37.737
grab for private keys and hacks
and it works. So this switch

00:10:37.737 --> 00:10:42.876
also I'm using the flash
interface if anybody is really

00:10:42.876 --> 00:10:49.082
into flash. I didn't explore
that I just went looking for

00:10:49.082 --> 00:10:56.389
cross sigh scrapping and I'm --
I was listening to DJ Kuber and

00:10:56.389 --> 00:11:03.096
that was a sample at the moment.
So it just seemed appropriate.

00:11:03.096 --> 00:11:09.302
So there are 8 pipe types of
cross site scriptioning. You

00:11:09.302 --> 00:11:14.908
don't have to put them in
specific parameter because you

00:11:14.908 --> 00:11:22.248
can make for the web server. >>
Hello gentlemen. How are you? So

00:11:22.248 --> 00:11:29.556
we have thing we do for people
who have never spoke ever at

00:11:29.556 --> 00:11:35.762
DEFCON before. It is called
shoot the noob. Don't worry. --

00:11:35.762 --> 00:11:41.968
Don't -- how many of are not
familiar? So I'm talking

00:11:41.968 --> 00:11:48.708
directly to you. [ APPLAUSE ] >>
Sir, were you born yesterday?

00:11:48.708 --> 00:11:53.947
Have you been to DEFCON before?
Okay. >> Yes it is. Wait what's

00:11:53.947 --> 00:11:57.083
your name? >> Ryan. >> Is that
you're real? >> Yes it is. >> We

00:11:57.083 --> 00:11:59.352
don't use real name at DEFCON.
[LAUGHTER] >> All right. So

00:11:59.352 --> 00:12:05.291
we're going to explain to --
that was fun. To get into this

00:12:11.898 --> 00:12:17.904
stage you really have to be
really smart or really stupid.

00:12:47.634 --> 00:12:53.640
>> He was not talking about
uh-uh are the smart guy. >> Any

00:13:09.956 --> 00:13:15.962
way just a quick toast for our
new speakers are they doing a

00:13:22.602 --> 00:13:28.608
good job? And Ryan is up there
representing the new attendees,

00:13:33.312 --> 00:13:39.318
so thank you. >> Thank you. >>
So then we'll have to make that

00:13:46.926 --> 00:13:52.932
pretty quick. So we promise -- I
come here to drink and dance.

00:13:59.605 --> 00:14:05.545
And this is an excuse to do that
so let's go to the next slide.

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:20.126
Remember earlier I did not want
to reinforce that password.

00:14:23.863 --> 00:14:29.869
Brute force. Because I can patch
in my key and run a CRC alert

00:14:37.477 --> 00:14:43.483
and try to reverse at the bottom
so basically 2 checks. And if

00:14:50.156 --> 00:14:56.162
you patch your own key with your
own password it turns out that

00:15:03.970 --> 00:15:07.240
just works so top tip there. So
this is one of my favorite --

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:10.243
why do you hack switches. That's
where the packets are.

00:15:10.243 --> 00:15:16.249
Paraphrasing. A little bit of
crypt toe but for the most part

00:15:21.087 --> 00:15:27.093
they don't. Can you tell it to
do something? Oh -- and you can

00:15:36.469 --> 00:15:42.475
evener form like recording
traffic and replaying it. So

00:15:46.379 --> 00:15:52.385
once you have control over the
switch. Now that will work on

00:15:59.559 --> 00:16:05.498
many environments. Let say
electrical. Have you like -- in

00:16:10.503 --> 00:16:16.509
tax so if you rout your traffic
half way around the word to

00:16:24.784 --> 00:16:30.790
another country are you going to
fail to reach your timing in

00:16:37.964 --> 00:16:43.970
that system. So you need to be
able to alter the firmware. In

00:16:52.278 --> 00:16:58.284
the style of Jason or something.
So I'm playing around with this

00:17:05.625 --> 00:17:08.327
switch and before authentication
I found this -- there is a

00:17:08.327 --> 00:17:14.333
conflict file before you log in
that you fetch and I create add

00:18:00.212 --> 00:18:06.218
no catch -- rebooted it, just
initial fuzzing. And I thought

00:18:34.714 --> 00:18:40.720
that's a DOS they don't matter.
So this is the fix the current

00:20:23.656 --> 00:20:29.662
fix from GE they are to go --
now they're change their mind

00:22:12.531 --> 00:22:18.537
and patching it but I want you
to read that very carefully.

00:22:51.403 --> 00:22:53.606
Their me -- is turn off the
server. I don't like that I

00:22:53.606 --> 00:22:56.275
think we can do better. Where we
skid -- amazing stuff they did

00:22:56.275 --> 00:22:58.510
really deep into the -- but
basically they showed in this

00:22:58.510 --> 00:23:00.479
paper that having a DOS in
certain types of chemical

00:23:00.479 --> 00:23:02.514
process control is enough to
give you almost complete process

00:23:02.514 --> 00:23:05.150
control. All right so I'll do
the first one there is an old

00:23:05.150 --> 00:23:08.187
day, SSH user name if any of you
remember. I found it -- is worth

00:23:08.187 --> 00:23:10.456
saying. It gave me this switch.
You research switches like we'll

00:23:10.456 --> 00:23:12.892
give you one. We'll get free
testing and you'll get -- but

00:23:12.892 --> 00:23:15.728
still GE took 8 months -- see
men took 3 months to fix the

00:23:15.728 --> 00:23:18.163
CSRF so one week I think
deserves a round of applause. >>

00:23:18.163 --> 00:23:21.267
Yes I spend most of time looking
at the switches; out of the 3 is

00:23:21.267 --> 00:23:24.803
probably the most secure taste.
You had to be locked onto the

00:23:24.803 --> 00:23:30.809
switch to do anything. So it
makes a lot of the post impact

00:23:33.545 --> 00:23:39.551
maybe my for some of these
issues. So the impact is much,

00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:47.826
much lower and our conversation
they were up front and told us

00:23:50.062 --> 00:23:57.670
when these switches were plan
they did help. But we'll carry

00:23:57.670 --> 00:24:02.374
on. So that is open switch.
Looks like that on the web site.

00:24:02.374 --> 00:24:05.577
You can down load. They also
have an open development kit so

00:24:05.577 --> 00:24:07.713
you -- so that's pretty cool.
First issue they have on their

00:24:07.713 --> 00:24:14.787
web page this nice support, is
probably really tiny. But they

00:24:14.787 --> 00:24:20.793
have link at the top. Allows to
down load the support details

00:24:26.965 --> 00:24:32.971
and of line viewing. But in this
page is normally accessible but

00:24:39.144 --> 00:24:45.150
the root -- user. However you
can directly navigate to page as

00:24:51.323 --> 00:24:57.329
any user and pull down all the
information. Like the chrome

00:25:02.434 --> 00:25:08.440
tab, log, sport text file and
that contains the IP table

00:25:13.612 --> 00:25:20.619
configuration. The location of
tall SSH keys. Things all the

00:25:20.619 --> 00:25:25.724
user names but no passwords so
numeration so pull -- everybody

00:25:25.724 --> 00:25:31.730
else. Next which I shall they
have we found was get file and

00:25:43.642 --> 00:25:49.648
this allows to get any of the
files on the device. Useful if

00:26:01.527 --> 00:26:07.533
you don't have SHH or -- but you
can still pull them -- you got

00:26:22.214 --> 00:26:28.220
them so you can pull password
file. GE password file and it

00:26:38.797 --> 00:26:44.803
doesn't have password however
you can also down load their

00:26:52.578 --> 00:26:58.584
private key. Yeah. Again sit
default key can change it is

00:27:07.693 --> 00:27:13.699
documented. And then try the
traditional. No validation

00:27:18.737 --> 00:27:24.743
denied. I'm as shocked as you R.
however we decided what about

00:27:31.216 --> 00:27:34.887
output validation. So you can
log on and change the and

00:27:34.887 --> 00:27:37.689
basically just input your own
looks like HT -- executes. But

00:27:37.689 --> 00:27:41.126
again you know, cross site
scripting on these devices but

00:27:41.126 --> 00:27:44.029
you have to have sort of
permission to do this thing. Yes

00:27:44.029 --> 00:27:47.599
is nice and cork -- but is not
the most brilliants of attacks.

00:27:47.599 --> 00:27:50.602
Of the sort of creating a new
user so this got perimeter so we

00:27:50.602 --> 00:27:52.771
-- small web page that contains
those codes. We deliverer --

00:27:52.771 --> 00:27:55.774
locked in device and -- you too
can create your own log in. Onto

00:27:55.774 --> 00:27:58.544
the -- and we can probably demo
that. Can you make that look

00:27:58.544 --> 00:28:01.079
easy? We'll find out. So at this
point in the presentation you're

00:28:01.079 --> 00:28:03.882
probably wondering what the hell
is this guy on stage for. So why

00:28:03.882 --> 00:28:06.652
don't we give him a little time
to explain that while Colin sets

00:28:06.652 --> 00:28:09.655
up the demo. >> Thank you. --
and at that point if you are

00:28:09.655 --> 00:28:11.657
industrial person. I'm the
kumbaya. Talk about how attacker

00:28:11.657 --> 00:28:14.393
can take advantage. So the --
are you ready for the demo? Do

00:28:14.393 --> 00:28:17.196
that first. >> You see at bottom
the route is default one, the

00:28:17.196 --> 00:28:19.765
tested I just created so test
script. Which is exactly what we

00:28:19.765 --> 00:28:22.568
had in first place and so we're
logged in and another tab. We

00:28:22.568 --> 00:28:25.137
can navigate to our evil page.
The things -- anybody? And we

00:28:25.137 --> 00:28:28.140
can go back to our user group
and there is a new user. Yay.

00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:30.742
But again the ability to get
that sort of timing attack is

00:28:30.742 --> 00:28:33.312
probably really low. You can get
them to navigate. You can have

00:28:33.312 --> 00:28:35.681
low control or network or con
figure their own device that

00:28:35.681 --> 00:28:37.683
probably wrong. So recently high
impact but likelihood down

00:28:37.683 --> 00:28:39.685
there. So summarizing. The
issues have been thought about.

00:28:39.685 --> 00:28:43.155
The session ID is just something
you can -- input validation. Is

00:28:43.155 --> 00:28:46.124
all post authentication. None of
this was -- these people have if

00:28:46.124 --> 00:28:52.130
I canned these issues and what I
like developed sprint time. 2 to

00:28:59.304 --> 00:29:05.243
3 weeks, and think that deserves
a round of applause because

00:29:13.652 --> 00:29:19.658
theses guy are on. >> Back to
fence doable. As I was working

00:29:30.702 --> 00:29:36.708
with these gentlemen. And what
can we do. There is an

00:29:45.117 --> 00:29:51.123
interesting -- maid into the
presentation because that's how

00:29:56.895 --> 00:30:02.901
many -- so if we see GE or semen
that's not the only ones that

00:30:14.279 --> 00:30:22.187
are bad is a cross the industry.
We want vendor -- where add I

00:30:22.187 --> 00:30:26.992
have -- so we as community --
that's what I want to talk about

00:30:26.992 --> 00:30:30.696
a little bit. So one interesting
aspect of industrial control

00:30:30.696 --> 00:30:36.702
system network is that they're
fairly static if you think of

00:30:39.071 --> 00:30:46.712
your enterprise -- ICS network
that shouldn't exist. You should

00:30:46.712 --> 00:30:53.552
have multiple places that
capture data on environment so

00:30:53.552 --> 00:30:59.558
the screen up here idea network
as you have your processes

00:31:01.893 --> 00:31:08.734
separated out with multiple
location that capture data. But

00:31:08.734 --> 00:31:16.374
they're static. OPC whatever ICS
protocol calls. They should be

00:31:16.374 --> 00:31:22.380
relatively static now we usually
don't do a good job. When you

00:31:25.517 --> 00:31:31.523
walk into -- is all flat network
and nobody has any idea who's

00:31:35.427 --> 00:31:41.433
going on. So the downside with
that is add I have -- without

00:31:45.337 --> 00:31:51.343
ever being notice because on the
network is really to spot. We're

00:31:54.479 --> 00:32:02.053
talking about industrial
network. Add I have -- use those

00:32:02.053 --> 00:32:08.059
things D. that doesn't matter if
you're just on the network can

00:32:11.196 --> 00:32:17.202
you do anything you want. All
the proto call, give you the

00:32:20.338 --> 00:32:26.344
firmware. Do whatever you want
just by having access to the

00:32:28.713 --> 00:32:34.719
network. So the idea set --
anybody in government that would

00:32:37.122 --> 00:32:43.128
want to get to these fatalities
is to get the network but we as

00:32:47.799 --> 00:32:55.407
defenders can see that. How
amazing adversary are and funny

00:32:55.407 --> 00:33:02.214
because those are usually
government kind of position and

00:33:02.214 --> 00:33:08.220
as former government guy I think
is interesting folks things --

00:33:10.589 --> 00:33:16.595
realistically we can do a good
job so when you look at the -- I

00:33:19.231 --> 00:33:22.434
want to know excuses about
legacy equipment and who knows

00:33:22.434 --> 00:33:25.270
info structure but they have to
do a good job. So the first one

00:33:25.270 --> 00:33:28.139
I want to talk -- on stage I
feel like we have earned the

00:33:28.139 --> 00:33:31.009
right to talk about. So when you
look at an ICS network is really

00:33:31.009 --> 00:33:34.145
easy to map it up so second
piece of malware, when you look

00:33:34.145 --> 00:33:40.151
at what it does on a -- should
know your network traffic.

00:33:51.696 --> 00:33:57.702
Aspect my ICS -- and go safely
capture. One of the things that

00:34:05.577 --> 00:34:09.114
I dislike is one at most fear in
the culture if is not broke

00:34:09.114 --> 00:34:12.550
please don't touch the network.
Can you safely go acquire

00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:16.321
information and see if things
that are going on. Like I

00:34:16.321 --> 00:34:19.758
mention -- there is high
confidence, but there is --

00:34:19.758 --> 00:34:23.895
tuning in we want you to make
this is not about shaming

00:34:23.895 --> 00:34:27.999
vendors this is about saying we
have a problem in the community

00:34:27.999 --> 00:34:33.138
and we can if I can it. So there
is some tools, ewe tube, DEFCON

00:34:33.138 --> 00:34:37.275
and everybody -- -- help. As an
example pre -- position it

00:34:37.275 --> 00:34:41.046
doesn't look that simple in
terms of malware on the network.

00:34:41.046 --> 00:34:44.816
Yes that little heart beat but
in tactic environment it is

00:34:44.816 --> 00:34:49.621
really easy to see. Is a giant
spike net workday at a. You do

00:34:49.621 --> 00:34:53.758
not have to be a train security
professional to do this. The

00:34:53.758 --> 00:34:57.529
interesting part is process and
thought and mind set is very

00:34:57.529 --> 00:35:00.899
similar to a control system
architect guy. When Aron and

00:35:00.899 --> 00:35:04.669
Colin made this comment before.
The same skill set they have

00:35:04.669 --> 00:35:08.807
like that inside environment is
the skill set that it taxi cabs

00:35:08.807 --> 00:35:12.711
to look for abnormalities so
today you're ICS engineers and

00:35:12.711 --> 00:35:18.249
architects can look for threats
without relying on the vendor.

00:35:18.249 --> 00:35:26.191
Right. So. >> The point here
being we're talking about doing

00:35:26.191 --> 00:35:33.431
change control. Using wire
sharp. But you should know if

00:35:33.431 --> 00:35:39.437
anyone tried to change it. Not
just -- not change the firm wire

00:35:42.841 --> 00:35:48.847
unless they go and speak to Ted
or whoever it is. But actually

00:35:52.217 --> 00:35:58.223
check the wire to see if these
upgrades are happening at times

00:36:00.825 --> 00:36:06.831
and I think there is something
to be set at merging the idea of

00:36:10.935 --> 00:36:15.006
security monitoring. >> So we
are not going go through and

00:36:15.006 --> 00:36:18.076
here is how to defend ever
aspect so there is going to be

00:36:18.076 --> 00:36:20.712
continuing interest. How to go
through and med gait and

00:36:20.712 --> 00:36:23.581
abnormality. Kind of as a joke.
We were looking at security

00:36:23.581 --> 00:36:27.218
inside of ICF it takes a whole
lot of resources for -- think of

00:36:27.218 --> 00:36:30.889
that power plant they're all --
a lot of resources to go and do

00:36:30.889 --> 00:36:33.992
anything interesting. So if we
just do our job inside those wet

00:36:33.992 --> 00:36:37.128
works -- net work. Defensible
networks that we have. Yes I T

00:36:37.128 --> 00:36:39.998
and OT are operation technology.
We need to have ownership and

00:36:39.998 --> 00:36:42.634
brake down those barriers that
require to bring those things.

00:36:42.634 --> 00:36:46.271
We want to bring that legacy and
I think that's where we want to

00:36:46.271 --> 00:36:49.841
focus. I'm ashamed really when
we look at this info structure

00:36:49.841 --> 00:36:55.847
that is we are not doing a
better job of security. Human

00:37:07.258 --> 00:37:13.264
life, trains, power plants, ect.
That needs to be a priority. >>

00:38:32.544 --> 00:38:38.550
We are ashamed. We know how much
money to invest on banking

00:39:38.943 --> 00:39:43.948
security. We don't think about
the long term cost of when we

00:39:43.948 --> 00:39:50.388
need them to be some time so we
are ashamed and we would like

00:39:50.388 --> 00:39:55.893
you to be ashamed as well. We
can help contribute to this.

00:39:55.893 --> 00:40:00.932
Whether you coming from the web
-- stronger engineer, this is

00:40:00.932 --> 00:40:07.372
spy ware, all the rest of it. We
can contribute to help the --

00:40:07.372 --> 00:40:12.877
good things we are enjoying. >>
We don't mean of like DEFCON

00:40:12.877 --> 00:40:17.916
like you should be ashamed. We
mean think ability the info

00:40:17.916 --> 00:40:23.888
structure that was left to you.
That enable all of was to come

00:40:23.888 --> 00:40:28.626
into this room and talk about
hack and security. When we talk

00:40:28.626 --> 00:40:34.632
about legacy we say, is legacy.
Meaning is -- and we're

00:40:56.020 --> 00:41:01.959
screaming. Reclaim the word
legacy: treat industrial as info

00:41:22.647 --> 00:41:28.653
structure. Leave your children a
legacy of secure functional info

00:41:43.968 --> 00:41:47.972
structure.
