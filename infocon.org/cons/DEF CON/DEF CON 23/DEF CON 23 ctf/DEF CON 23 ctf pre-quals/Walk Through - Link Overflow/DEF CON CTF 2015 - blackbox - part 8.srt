1
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:03,439
okay so grandfather little bit

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:07,009
and is quite interesting the car

3
00:00:07,009 --> 00:00:10,110
you see here with the same values

4
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:13,130
111 for with same thing

5
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:17,130
the intended password and change

6
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:22,590
so he

7
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:25,599
might the pre the to force that

8
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:28,689
also

9
00:00:28,689 --> 00:00:32,399
a me and I see they said

10
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,140
with for forcing stuff acquired a few
request for them

11
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:41,090
picking you up for trying by

12
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:46,250
I mean it's all for the greater good
right but

13
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:53,550
even if its and might be able to analyze
this

14
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:58,440
properly tool because if you look here

15
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:03,539
the second characters 357 and with one
shift further

16
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:06,960
5 them in it becomes

17
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,930
57 so it's just like ships in 1 ahead
and three hits the 7th so

18
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:17,030
it seems like pretty it seems

19
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:20,900
possible to to put forth that

20
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:25,180
also like

21
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:30,820
it seems like could predict that usually
take effect in a1

22
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:36,600
so but let's try this the ferry

23
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,229
net me make figure 1

24
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:44,289
here then I know that it be you would be
a to

25
00:01:44,289 --> 00:01:47,520
and if he would be a three so if someone
to you

26
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,549
a twenty the

27
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:56,869
so I would send much but this and

28
00:01:56,869 --> 00:02:00,609
of and then with send PA guess

29
00:02:00,609 --> 00:02:07,140
so I am it seems so you could

30
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:11,890
you could free nicely brought forth

31
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:16,500
so let me traders thats commit to the a

32
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:32,819
here so if it's a

33
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:42,430
I'm gonna

34
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:43,120
well should

35
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:54,870
to year

36
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,990
well I can not the other one

37
00:02:56,990 --> 00:03:00,340
other stuff here okay so him

38
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:04,520
if the X

39
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:07,840
the first expected one sequel to

40
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,850
a I continue if it's not

41
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:13,990
then I'm close the connection

42
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:19,120
and Twitter if it's in

43
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,300
so I can make this also

44
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:28,440
ace that's what want in then

45
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:34,430
I have to

46
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:40,690
act america current of said

47
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:45,720
ritter said the star 0 and

48
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:49,920
current key which starts with this

49
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:56,470
so different

50
00:03:56,470 --> 00:04:07,260
eighty I'm picking the current key

51
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:07,560
pretty

52
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:13,540
the current key her no

53
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:25,770
wat let me first of it

54
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:30,160
and check the expected one the expected
it

55
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:37,660
of said NP

56
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:42,020
cause BR in the first line the off

57
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:45,370
said seemed to be anyway

58
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:48,960
so years all with one difference he is
always

59
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,069
to different and here

60
00:04:52,069 --> 00:04:57,870
is it seems to be

61
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:05,169
he the 5.3

62
00:05:05,169 --> 00:05:10,160
to them 5 to 31

63
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,930
minus 23 a safely minus

64
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:17,560
15 also so we got

65
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:21,210
to we've been one

66
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:26,159
one to paid then

67
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:29,270
15 minutes 11 which is

68
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:32,310
problem the ninety

69
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:36,030
5

70
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:46,710
them doesn't make sense

71
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:51,149
well

72
00:05:51,149 --> 00:06:02,880
home

73
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,620
well a became a seven in them

74
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:09,750
7 for in

75

in and we see

78
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:24,360
should test

79
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:27,690
longer strings

80
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:35,069
how long this that one

81
00:06:35,069 --> 00:06:38,539
460 have to test

82
00:06:38,539 --> 00:06:49,280
for six characters

83
00:06:49,280 --> 00:07:03,459
of in that's just me

see 66 okay

137
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:06,149
so a test and key

138
00:14:06,149 --> 00:14:14,589
in there

139
00:14:14,589 --> 00:14:21,649
bullet with a from me

140
00:14:21,649 --> 00:14:29,199
26

141
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:33,120
mine

142
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:38,930
and of he I'm

143
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:43,079
this one

144
00:14:43,079 --> 00:15:00,430
yes key

145
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:00,959
and

146
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:04,160
and yes

147
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,470
so

148
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:10,690
so I get the

149
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:14,790
character of two current of wage

150
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:17,980
for example would be one

151
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:22,410
so I the

152
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:39,620
their minus shit

153
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:41,830
alright awesome to remember the

154
00:15:41,830 --> 00:16:28,890
he's are No

155
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:31,650
because it's always these on the be

156
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:38,530
A's 23

157
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:49,570
I think I suspect something way it
wouldn't work

158
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:53,029
that see so know that must be

159
00:16:53,029 --> 00:16:56,779
from so

160
00:16:56,779 --> 00:17:08,650
in this case and would get the you

161
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:20,039
morning

162
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:37,879
on

163
00:17:37,879 --> 00:17:41,980
okay shit

164
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:45,690
Okies so with 0 okay euro the goal

165
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:50,539
expected

166
00:17:50,539 --> 00:17:59,150
them

167
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:02,670
from the

168
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:32,210
9 mmm

169
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:36,030
you know that the current he starts with
eighty we r

170
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:39,840
of one no

171
00:18:39,840 --> 00:21:06,520
thing

172
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:09,710
thing

173
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:11,700
to you to write approvals

174
00:21:11,700 --> 00:22:02,790
so i think im with character character
that might work

175
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:10,660
school

176
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:18,899
