1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:03,929
oh my god and just realized something no

2
00:00:03,929 --> 00:00:07,440
I'm looking at this and it it

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,990
screening soccer detectors the sockets
euro and and all those kinda weird stuff

4
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:16,260
if you look at it when did go

5
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:20,449
well

6
00:00:20,449 --> 00:00:23,890
check this here which

7
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:40,560
not input I've learnt that them

8
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:53,179
okay I lost it perhaps

9
00:00:53,179 --> 00:00:58,239
yeah ok right here suck so constant
thing yasser Amin

10
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:01,909
and do stuff with Netcare the the soccer
internet

11
00:01:01,909 --> 00:01:04,949
ago but I didn't realize that

12
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:08,320
obviously the the binary itself I

13
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,180
can execute on the month and then and
never did the Fifth Circuit's a Usenet

14
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:12,830
kit

15
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:16,390
to repre- roan the the binary so

16
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:20,119
I don't know why I didn't think about
this earlier

17
00:01:20,119 --> 00:01:23,549
but the thing is opening a socket and

18
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:28,360
a.m. I should have seen as much earlier

19
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:31,459
so fuck my life so

20
00:01:31,459 --> 00:01:34,569
for somewhere here on earth suck option

21
00:01:34,569 --> 00:01:44,270
so a.m.

22
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,110
yeah

23
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:48,930
well let's to for this is still hanging
there

24
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:52,200
and I wanted to know look at net the

25
00:01:52,200 --> 00:02:07,820
minus and home

26
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:25,409
both work again in

27
00:02:25,409 --> 00:02:29,760
well I should break on on the on the
sockets the fear

28
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,659
in an hour and I'll cloth

29
00:02:33,659 --> 00:02:37,569
connect cases connecting

30
00:02:37,569 --> 00:03:03,000
here some thing

31
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:10,340
and okay

32
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:13,900
so I i guess im the 6

33
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:22,890
else the disabled reassign

34
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:38,740
are the e6 okay

35
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:50,120
okay so that's this again

36
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,510
well I could already I'll

37
00:03:52,510 --> 00:04:00,650
them

38
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:05,049
so he we TV

39
00:04:05,049 --> 00:04:12,440
3 their own im turn on the console

40
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:17,579
okay so in

41
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:24,889
exactly when is a and I'm well

42
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:29,370
maybe a Tory setup menu said cdrom

43
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:34,820
breakpoint there the

44
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:56,120
room

45
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:08,390
okay

46
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:28,779
are you would have to be to see all

47
00:05:28,779 --> 00:06:06,150
how do I own this

48
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:35,889
okay so it's runs again

49
00:06:35,889 --> 00:06:43,840
way

50
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,540
let's

51
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:49,050
who run to be there like this again
because

52
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:54,420
I'm I want to make sure that the

53
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:59,060
suck it gets open so

54
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:03,780
free and year

55
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:13,930
we run but even already did

56
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:21,360
triggered by the to a sloth London

57
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:58,980
okay I'll some the key

58
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:03,570
stupid I'm at the good

59
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:31,860

artist yeah okay

61
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:39,000
now here's the break point in that
markers setting up the

62
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,520
suck okay

63
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:45,860

this works

66
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:18,630
man's ok okay so the first call

67
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:23,190
is to socket and that has to mean type
and protocols

68
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:28,730
or or

69
00:09:28,730 --> 00:10:18,050

to

75
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:18,680
Mon

76
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:34,399

80
00:13:05,569 --> 00:13:11,110
that is to I mean a meanie wanna hang
the

81
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:18,879
poor

82
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:22,139
or something yeah or opening

to so

84
00:13:34,199 --> 00:13:35,699
setting up soccer to

85
00:13:35,699 --> 00:13:38,720
it sets up this where the poor

86
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:51,639
it specify I said

87
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:58,949
except I think some

88
00:13:58,949 --> 00:14:12,790
create them and use its use in except
okay so

89
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:23,040
dawn and thing

90
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,390
the

91
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:41,560
in

92
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,560
this one 234

93
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:48,080
well maybe I should do mine it can
understand or

94
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:54,520
and I would have seen that him

95
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:57,890
by youth

96
00:14:57,890 --> 00:15:03,320
to easy recognizable we

97
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:06,360
31 the problem

98
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:19,190
that really and in me

99
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:22,260
with should maybe wait until everything

100
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:41,660
close the

101
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:44,569
but yeah it looks like there's one open

102
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:51,929
so let me and nothing no way

103
00:15:51,929 --> 00:15:56,379
your

104
00:15:56,379 --> 00:16:18,970
this listening

105
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:21,480
on this thing leaves those things

106
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:28,670
hanging all the time okay cool

107
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:33,700
so know if only one open in and

108
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:36,790
so

109
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:48,509
thats that this running can

110
00:16:48,509 --> 00:16:51,859
sonar sticky damn

111
00:16:51,859 --> 00:17:22,480
min

112
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,280
against me program is the she did

113
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:33,650
doing play at the

114
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:38,850
to home

115
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:46,010
anything that the problem is open can
never have enough

116
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:53,450
keys okay

117
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:56,730
so only put the same units on the neck

118
00:17:56,730 --> 00:18:13,620
see fully so let it run

119
00:18:13,620 --> 00:19:19,789
of okay

120
00:19:19,789 --> 00:19:48,990
why is it not opening 1

121
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:50,390
I could have sworn

122
00:19:50,390 --> 00:20:04,860
did work home

123
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,080
well maybe it's connecting

124
00:20:06,080 --> 00:21:25,190
picked from so maybe I should ok Litzman
that straight

125
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:26,360
I guess not okay we

126
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:30,360
their Creek this again she

127
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:35,359

128
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:36,509
very your

129
00:21:36,509 --> 00:22:11,160
them

130
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,230
ski key

131
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:15,360

great

135
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:05,850
so thats its fuck my

136
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:08,950
too slow but the way to to the break by
then

137
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:23,430
care this

138
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:39,080
right

139
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:43,250
from

140
00:23:43,250 --> 00:24:07,460
its way time

141
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:07,830
of

142
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:47,129
works

143
00:24:47,129 --> 00:24:50,330
this was such a good idea why

144
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:56,809
tartars are

145
00:24:56,809 --> 00:25:00,559

146
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:17,590
okay so was that again

147
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:17,970
only

148
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:21,280
that breakpoint to so return from here

149
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:28,210
the room

150
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:31,960

00:35:06,090 --> 00:35:12,730
heart yet I'm so looking forward to read

204
00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:16,210
it opens a circuit but it

205
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:19,500
opens you you circuit only

206
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:25,230
when local don't do

207
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:34,090
weird the K

208
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:38,260
send fake stuff to it by my picture

209
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:41,860
and that with that word

210
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:46,360
so

211
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:58,339
with so

212
00:35:58,339 --> 00:35:58,680
so it

213
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:03,700
in in

214
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:18,120
8 store

215
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:20,920
I mean if that is really opening

216
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:47,020
occurred way

217
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:48,970
if this

218
00:36:48,970 --> 00:36:56,810
how can I make the circuit 30 I mean

219
00:36:56,810 --> 00:37:04,480
word me there's already one

220
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:21,400
open but then you could

221
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:24,260
maybe I should trade with running

222
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:32,810
maybe they have that something special
there

223
00:37:32,810 --> 00:37:35,710
in them

224
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:53,609
so

225
00:37:53,609 --> 00:38:05,780
full year trade so

226
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:23,249
when one connects re-opened at another
one

227
00:38:23,249 --> 00:38:26,549
doesn't make sense connect

228
00:38:26,549 --> 00:38:48,280
there

229
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:56,270
look at that protection to me

230
00:38:56,270 --> 00:39:03,390
thing Heather connection

231
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:07,170
see thing I have no idea what they can
do with it

232
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:46,920
instilled

233
00:39:46,920 --> 00:40:03,150
them in

234
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:05,490
but it receives Cuse

235
00:40:05,490 --> 00:41:07,529
their biggest nothing else reading on
there

236
00:41:07,529 --> 00:41:10,499
okay I'm slow

237
00:41:10,499 --> 00:41:14,749
and other figures but i wanna thickens
30

238
00:41:14,749 --> 00:41:48,410
thing NC with that menu

239
00:41:48,410 --> 00:41:54,680
good

240
00:41:54,680 --> 00:43:07,010
them

241
00:43:07,010 --> 00:43:10,800
ok I think group
