are too sweet and Tony

22
00:01:49,340 --> 00:02:08,110
key come

23
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:16,950
here

24
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:20,470
there you go so no I can't see

25
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:25,420
town some feel

26
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:31,180
and for the

27
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:40,170
to go on okay a home

28
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:40,730
and no

29
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:46,170
I don't have an enduring what I can do
with that means also

30
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:50,160
I'm winnable through

31
00:02:50,160 --> 00:03:08,680
this been exploits not like I would play

32
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,480
and one earth the truth timing

33
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:17,230
and they you had to do it had to

34
00:03:17,230 --> 00:04:05,590
excessive exactly that time

35
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:11,780
k so i guess im yet in okay for

36
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:33,670
that it's not actually a true window

37
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:36,550
okay so I guess for now with liked

38
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:47,640
find no

39
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:50,650
where other things

40
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:53,790
printed where turn on console

41
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:58,550
me hardest where this is coming from

42
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:37,720
law

43
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:42,070
let's see where the other yes so they
are three

44
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:45,490
entry he's your so I guess

45
00:05:45,490 --> 00:06:03,680
this is where other history

46
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:23,030
there

47
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:36,030
offering character

48
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:42,509
for din exit in comparing

49
00:06:42,509 --> 00:06:45,750
still

50
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:50,020
here ok

51
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:54,470
if it's grader then 0

52
00:06:54,470 --> 00:07:36,900
yes

53
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:37,260
