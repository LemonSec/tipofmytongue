1
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:06,800
coding challenge captive s turn

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:26,200
you know mmm

3
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:35,940
cent solution

4
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:44,230
okay

5
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:46,100
okay well well

6
00:00:46,100 --> 00:01:25,579
is according to Jones soon

7
00:01:25,579 --> 00:01:45,000
1

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,140
need to look at the and a

9
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:54,930
thing down there and extern that is like
the same thing

10
00:01:54,930 --> 00:02:33,989
year

11
00:02:33,989 --> 00:02:37,830
cent solution the same for mint about to
send

12
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:41,230
and innocent like way this is already
standing near

13
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:49,030
the king

14
00:02:49,030 --> 00:03:05,230
3c this form

15
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:47,460
on

16
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:50,940
okay so that mmm many

17
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:55,620
by year rough

18
00:03:55,620 --> 00:04:10,890
other 76 by the question

19
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:15,580
yeah okay

20
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:21,040
but are don't quite understand

21
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,240
I know I think again it we

22
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,500
this could be arm code on

23
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:32,210
are when I'm attacking and it could be
64 bit code

24
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:35,710
invest in this company and based on the
strip

25
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:40,000
set of registers there will be a certain
result

26
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,240
and f2 send in their South the register

27
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,550
sounds about right so

28
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:59,180
i won

29
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:01,780
no one of the code changes because that
would be

30
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:09,620
difficult then okay tells me how many
bytes okay the code seems to

31
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:13,100
change on

32
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:21,050
and

33
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:50,240
for to them

34
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,410
so I have print and

35
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:57,289
print sign working

36
00:05:57,289 --> 00:06:13,830
26 okay great

37
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:14,709
many to check

38
00:06:14,709 --> 00:06:22,409
I am re certain

39
00:06:22,409 --> 00:06:51,490
Monday right

40
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:58,820
moon them it is a big 12

41
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:19,100
and then

42
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,290
okay

43
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:25,310
so I can do on

44
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:54,860
see size

45
00:07:54,860 --> 00:08:03,520
cool them

46
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,550
so hunger

47
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:13,950
boat to this to I what would be the most
intense and we should I

48
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:18,610
one way would be to look if they use the

49
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:22,660
only a few different send a common thing
it would be

50
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:27,030
Creek to implement hi the other hand if
a randomized loss

51
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:30,310
then it might be easier to

52
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:33,850
up push it into a in

53
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:37,580
a/c program knitted

54
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:42,230
run their mmm

55
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:45,660
I think that's the one with BB

56
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:48,740
not so easy to read rent

57
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:52,870
well

58
00:08:52,870 --> 00:09:44,570
and I've never done this for

59
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:45,459
still annotated

60
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:48,690
well I let me

61
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:52,500
first look that chick after SWAT

62
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,639
example program four plex together the
office

63
00:09:55,639 --> 00:10:40,510
so when Emma I'm doing this

64
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:59,750
online is Semler

65
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:02,889
you know it's just critique it in a few
example codes

66
00:11:02,889 --> 00:11:13,460
cummick abuse changed the

67
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:19,759
month

68
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:28,060
well

69
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:31,300
house determine dcx in plus

70
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:34,820
it looks like prey Iran

71
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:38,080
a lot of different we aren't Mon

72
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:42,870
I guess I have to put this into into a
c:\program

73
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:47,730
song nazi

74
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:48,490
first of all

75
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:58,230
I am on

76
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:10,930
something easy in affluent done it
before

77
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:14,399
see in line them

78
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:26,779
C

79
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:29,930
so

80
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:33,389
one thing I want to do the and gerdes

81
00:12:33,389 --> 00:13:03,360
our interest though values

82
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:30,250
okay so

83
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:46,860
okay so minutes trying to say yes my

84
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,180
so

85
00:13:48,180 --> 00:14:07,690
for example register army in

86
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:09,780
I said contra on a value

87
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:19,660
and then

88
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:32,100
I print aa that counter

89
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,889
see that's working and to compile and

90
00:14:34,889 --> 00:14:42,779
where sixty thanks so

91
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:54,069
the pic and C

92
00:14:54,069 --> 00:14:54,829
that's on

93
00:14:54,829 --> 00:15:04,920
fine look at this and the I

94
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:08,550
so it's moving into E X then

95
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:11,870
writing the again

96
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:17,970
will this mean for the print okay so
that is very cool

97
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:18,589
let's do this
