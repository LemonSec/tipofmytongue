1
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:03,139
okay %uh hey

2
00:00:03,139 --> 00:00:06,440
I'm back there

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:09,660
14 minutes left roughly forty mister

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:13,570
and the down City it closes

5
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:16,760
I still haven't gotten the flag but it
looks pretty good

6
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:21,539
the flag is grade probably job or
something the problems I had to change

7
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:23,640
strategy in between because

8
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,849
assists you seen before I was able to

9
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:30,849
always have like two characters and the

10
00:00:30,849 --> 00:00:34,399
let 01 manipulated the previous one and
then

11
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:39,879
but one if I K one of them pics one
topic over with they'll be fixed but

12
00:00:39,879 --> 00:00:40,780
then suddenly

13
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:44,530
in the middle it seemed to have changed
I am

14
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:48,300
and not really fucked things up

15
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:51,340
so I just had to prove was no really

16
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:54,760
completely proof of two characters at a
time at least

17
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:58,180
this next step were was a space and J

18
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:04,860
I mean a could have guessed that but so

19
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:08,490
currently and doing it like that because
I can make too many

20
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:12,820
connections concurrently that's why I
have six runs

21
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:16,400
a and then take the alphabet divided
into six

22
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,560
pieces so say take the first few letters

23
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,040
and I A start

24
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:28,200
that correct for each one of these
alphabet letters

25
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,950
and each threat then go through all the
alphabet in test those to

26
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:36,329
characters sore

27
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:40,420
this one ghost for for all characters in
this one said

28
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:43,790
for the test said it compares the

29
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:46,869
to how many values are correct and

30
00:01:46,869 --> 00:01:50,149
in this case but I'm

31
00:01:50,149 --> 00:01:53,950
22 acting at 21

32
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:58,640
correct

33
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,030
no two-prong

34
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:04,360
correct then yeah it will report back so

35
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:13,650
this worked for the last letter here
granger

36
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:17,150
but the flexor knock-on effect next to
letters

37
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:20,700
I really hope I can can make it for BN

38
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:49,300
so

39
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:52,500
by its getting intense I I really
everyone assault this

40
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:56,239
for recall the deadline that would be

41
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,870
then at least sooo then one two-point

42
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:07,190
challenge but check the ranking

43
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:11,120
the the schools complete score book
right now

44
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,280
where Am I wanna Sony well if equipped

45
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,680
get this correct with move up to one

46
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,860
38 still at the top 100

47
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:27,410
but a plane alone

48
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:40,659
so a ankle that counts

49
00:03:40,659 --> 00:03:47,010
they're still fighter mu characters I
have to

50
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:51,260
get compare this to word what is
expected

51
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:54,599
am

52
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:59,030
halfway there brute force the movie
takes a while

53
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:02,530
I think I should

54
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:14,550
check on a copy of that

55
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:17,790
room just want to

56
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:21,579
get am and intact

57
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:27,660
here

58
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:47,420
wanna

59
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:53,220
sauna test if I have met many characters

60
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,910
a but

61
00:04:54,910 --> 00:05:00,120
he the

62
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:03,990
okay teams like this character's again
fix

63
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:09,890
day

64
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:12,890

that's early irritates me Mark Miller

133
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:48,470
dement

134
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:52,810
okay at least I got the great job

136
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:59,209
thats

137
00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:12,960
sheet myself here when I what user

138
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,660
the haha

139
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:27,150
condemning with green

140
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:37,910

144
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:50,290
headed are

145
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:53,580
okay so quick to wrap up before I
finished this

146
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:57,280
I a hand sold

147
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:01,230
the very common challenge away I i mix
up and make

148
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:01,700
then
