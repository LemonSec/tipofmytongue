00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:25,440
following ok

22
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:32,260
but it goes in there and how it would
call

23
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:49,330
invalid but

24
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:55,919

29
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:39,500
if re Indian

30
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:51,240
its check then this one specific values
checked again

31
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:56,639
through that is

32
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:06,289
