1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:04,049
okay headed break let's have a look at
this

2
00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:21,050
again

3
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:27,529
solid C

4
00:00:27,529 --> 00:00:35,000
the is 76

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,399
so

6
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:41,320
76 SEM say word be

7
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,800
57

8
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:51,050
but it's a be so

9
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:54,210
in

10
00:00:54,210 --> 00:01:00,510
76 23 and 76 B-nine

11
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:03,519
T so

12
00:01:03,519 --> 00:01:08,220
7 76 77

13
00:01:08,220 --> 00:02:14,610
with the be

14
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:36,820
so on alert for nine

15
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:39,910
okay so let C be current number

16
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:45,900
76 your

17
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:49,660
them minus by what is that

18
00:02:49,660 --> 00:03:05,939
its 18

19
00:03:05,939 --> 00:03:09,090
and I must be must do something with the
addition

20
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:12,659
because his same seven-c_

21
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:16,879
76

22
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:21,409
seventh them so

23
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:25,769
basically eighty-plus be shows

24
00:03:25,769 --> 00:03:31,930
hear that it's be and

25
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:44,379
so

26
00:03:44,379 --> 00:03:48,510
so hard to read get to the see them
wealthy would be seven

27
00:03:48,510 --> 00:04:09,950
me

28
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:38,050
I wonder how many levels they are

29
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:41,060
soul with between the ace up there

30
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:56,889
in

31
00:04:56,889 --> 00:05:02,600
worth 33 with them

32
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:08,790
that was approved right okay let's make
some

33
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:13,120
me meet someone being a for have

34
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:19,639
only he's think that the

35
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:22,830
think that look at these

36
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:25,960
there are some green eyes because

37
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:29,300
30 moment the on

38
00:05:29,300 --> 00:06:11,900
yet rump

39
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:17,150
ok so we I have to start from the
beginning for

40
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:20,710
that is the and of its 3 for

41
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:25,440
aid he and

42
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,490
40

43
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:32,310
for the 5

44
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:35,830
is the one okay so

45
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:39,470
at: and take this as a diss in this way

46
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:42,910
I try what can a

47
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:46,280
head to the previous one that it becomes

48
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:52,870
one so so for eight so it must be

49
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:56,290
and in a as well then

50
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:59,790
would care to their in

51
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:03,460
wrong so

52
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:10,360
maybe it's times so

53
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:36,539
times for aid

54
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:40,069
well pretty the first one

55
00:07:40,069 --> 00:07:43,259
this one-time the second one

56
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:49,979
then

57
00:07:49,979 --> 00:07:53,939
to takes itself to time

58
00:07:53,939 --> 00:07:57,050
the third one takes so

59
00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:00,469
four-time maybe it means

60
00:08:00,469 --> 00:08:13,849
know it it's something to previous three

61
00:08:13,849 --> 00:08:20,760
so say the

62
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:24,470
16 the the 32

63
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:32,520
16

64
00:08:32,520 --> 00:09:10,860
in 32

65
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:13,809
so them so

66
00:09:13,809 --> 00:09:29,499
in the last so that would be 32mm what
do I do with the last

67
00:09:29,499 --> 00:09:33,379
so 32

68
00:09:33,379 --> 00:09:39,120
so so this one this one time great

69
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,680
second one is 84

70
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:54,980
worth 84

71
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:58,670
with them so it's the room

72
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:02,500
1 so now comes two times so

73
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,720
flowers for be times through

74
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:09,029
true afterwards come for

75
00:10:09,029 --> 00:10:12,630
paid times for c4

76
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:16,010
for paid times

77
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:19,220
days is aid

78
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:22,779
first 4p time 16

79
00:10:22,779 --> 00:10:26,160
16 in then

80
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,620
for a time 32 see

81
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:33,860
32 no

82
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:38,050
its no and a because I want 33

83
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:43,450
Norwood will

84
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:49,130
maybe it's the offset from it so so

85
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:52,570
I terribly

86
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:56,700
this minus when I expect a wood

87
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:00,180
been and that is what I have that mean
cry this

88
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:11,130
let interest rate as a function so mmm

89
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:13,480
period for

90
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:17,540
this

91
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:39,200
start well you so

92
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,960
so I'm generating

93
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:44,620
and the the first ring based on the
thought value

94
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:52,110
so that would be their

95
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:59,100
from no

96
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:03,710
you start mmm number

97
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:12,600
pretty alphabet are the start value

98
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:21,270
would

99
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:26,470
one start

100
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:32,459
you times

101
00:12:32,459 --> 00:12:34,850
to to the power all

102
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:39,879
I am for

103
00:12:39,879 --> 00:12:43,310
I in range

104
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:46,790
your opponent I'm encouraged

105
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:50,060
mumble for them

106
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:56,290
it's me aids here and the test kids so

107
00:12:56,290 --> 00:13:01,459
in this case as would be forty home

108
00:13:01,459 --> 00:13:04,769
the

109
00:13:04,769 --> 00:13:16,930
moo moo 95

110
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:19,380
okay cool so that would be for a so

111
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:27,950
now I am but now I got this

112
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:32,620
other string they see this year and

113
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:36,380
so I'm going foresee

114
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:39,700
in X sector on its to this

115
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:46,919
in the expected

116
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:47,720
cosby's

117
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:50,799
a

118
00:13:50,799 --> 00:14:00,870
base

119
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:02,270
in an account Kool Aid

120
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:05,800
F

121
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:11,310
from the minor no

122
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:17,640
F wrong expected inmates F from the
current base

123
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:22,160
letter miners the expected one

124
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:26,360
know it the expected one

125
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:29,510
minus me peace

126
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:33,270
and that would

127
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:36,280
the the letter so pollard

128
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:39,450
month on

129
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:42,770
empty string return

130
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:46,080
string so try this

131
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:57,390
predict for

132
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:58,590
and the offset is

133
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:11,380
for need 0

134
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:34,310
shouldn't this and numbers

135
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:52,610
dement print days

136
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:54,890
ok this is wrong and one

137
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:58,390
alphabet I to on the number

138
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:03,540
well i cant I think the alphabet

139
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:09,660
and then non

140
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:17,900
that thank you think the think

141
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:27,410
think the number

142
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:51,170
10 him

143
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:54,819
him

144
00:16:54,819 --> 00:17:02,720
the

145
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,190
so that's awesome

146
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:12,500
overturn okay okay that's not

147
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:19,369
take the one with yet the N a

148
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:24,660
even be okay great and now it's just
been murdered I think

149
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:29,400
okie let's try this with the more
complex

150
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:44,630
public string

151
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:45,020
so

152
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:51,049
Nazi predict ocean okay

153
00:17:51,049 --> 00:17:54,270
again first I need obviously to check
what as:

154
00:17:54,270 --> 00:18:03,550
and then it's me

155
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:12,030
them tests

156
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:13,490
so the

157
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:18,020
hour so which one

158
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:22,240
isn't think it's the last one right

159
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,790
should be should be be be so

160
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:29,440
its in

161
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:36,440
47

162
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:40,090
United that the right or 7th

163
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:50,920
47 I know

164
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:51,460
and I'm

165
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:55,500
who okay

166
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:59,040
though it is the front okay so I'm thats
your

167
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:02,700
getting predict for from

168
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:22,310
on No

169
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:22,780
with

170
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:27,110
89 no way is with

171
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:32,060
first 19 to so that is a

172
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:37,240
cool take the new law no more complex
warm

173
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:40,430
it looks good

174
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:41,980
I'll be
