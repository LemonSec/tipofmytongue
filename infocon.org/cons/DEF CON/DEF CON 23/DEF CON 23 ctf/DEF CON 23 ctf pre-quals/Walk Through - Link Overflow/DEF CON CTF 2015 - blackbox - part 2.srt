1
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:05,089
okay so this time with Cam

2
00:00:05,089 --> 00:00:11,320
so I i sat down and made them know
here's what I thought when it did

3
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:16,980
with an alphabetic and number and they
created something them

4
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:20,000
you can see here your own

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,369
good

6
00:00:24,369 --> 00:00:28,820
and in a few more and

7
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:32,469
then at some point with these tests

8
00:00:32,469 --> 00:00:36,480
over here I realize

9
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,309
that seems to follow the following

10
00:00:40,309 --> 00:00:45,440
petr so that's your

11
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,920
1 -0 1 -0 is

12
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,449
one 3 -1 to 7

13
00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:59,010
-3 -2 713 -1

14
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:02,370
3 15 -7 3 -1

15
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:06,500
for same on year -1

16
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:11,220
one for -2 -1 one eight minutes palma's
to -1

17
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:14,540
one so this is what I think

18
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:15,299
the patroness
