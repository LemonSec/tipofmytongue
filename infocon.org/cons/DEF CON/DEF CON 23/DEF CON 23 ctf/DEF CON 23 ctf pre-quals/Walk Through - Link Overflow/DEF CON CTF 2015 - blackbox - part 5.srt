1
00:00:00,659 --> 00:00:04,630
okay let's get pic with black box our
earlier I didn't have much time but I

2
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:07,879
in the free minutes ahead a always tried

3
00:00:07,879 --> 00:00:12,960
the inputs and when I ate just try to
figure out like

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,660
what the offsets are so I picked certain
values from the alphabet

5
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:20,260
and try to see what they were and here's
what I

6
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:23,689
observed very quickly so I typed in the
one

7
00:00:23,689 --> 00:00:26,830
and you don't you see id but

8
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:30,699
I am gonna go further up was the first
time I used

9
00:00:30,699 --> 00:00:36,450
I think here no

10
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:43,120
Laura I think from

11
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:49,309
earlier your so I A

12
00:00:49,309 --> 00:00:57,420
with

13
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:01,039
to hear it just let me show it again
okay so you connecting that kid and I

14
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:01,809
hate this

15
00:01:01,809 --> 00:01:06,830
and I of a bit okay or threatened easy
for

16
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:11,750
0 no office okay come down

17
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:16,399
it again so now we're there and now I
input take this

18
00:01:16,399 --> 00:01:19,720
this need alphabet and if you don't
notice

19
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:23,180
like I wanna dement we thought this is
with out

20
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:26,210
and this without spaces in the end
initially the

21
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:29,670
origin ahead toothpaste their protecting
that

22
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:33,110
realized that they were in the beginning
song

23
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:37,350
this probably an actor first pretty much
closer for Seth

24
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:40,789
but its reversed so the pic once

25
00:01:40,789 --> 00:01:46,959
appear in the front so that's what I
notice and now I am one act quickly

26
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:47,789
analyze

27
00:01:47,789 --> 00:01:51,929
this is looking take this

28
00:01:51,929 --> 00:01:54,990
I guess we're here in Patna ready

29
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:58,899
so its unique one string

30
00:01:58,899 --> 00:02:03,380
this year and the

31
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:07,320
the stream mine

32
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:11,530
test strong here tool to

33
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:15,829
and space-based so

34
00:02:15,829 --> 00:02:18,850
when I'm gonna do is first the phone I
wanna obviously

35
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:22,340
and going through for a for

36
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:26,290
the in

37
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:29,810
the these together which is a burden
burst

38
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:33,150
because the the dots belong in the end

39
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:37,840
and BU and

40
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:43,129
took these aren't I today have from

41
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:46,819
and from the and then also

42
00:02:46,819 --> 00:02:50,870
from I minus from today

43
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:55,040
sectors on okay so

44
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,230
this is seems like to be like the first
one and just

45
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:03,819
in were so

46
00:03:03,819 --> 00:03:07,370
home its take the

47
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:10,819
do this to ship turkey

48
00:03:10,819 --> 00:03:18,359
let's take c'mon year in expected but
the expected

49
00:03:18,359 --> 00:03:23,410
are and worst shifting

50
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:27,079
by that so

51
00:03:27,079 --> 00:03:30,879
send and then hopefully

52
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:38,450
that's working see alright

53
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:42,040
effort but have to sit the shift the
moment obviously

54
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:47,239
so I do have to send mmm

55
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:50,970

57
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:59,150
sent yeah okay so can same

58
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:03,200
shift year

59
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:24,920
mmm

60
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,820

63
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,190
okay so through away and just stand
right now is because I

64
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:48,700
did and from the whole string

yes from there

68
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,860
OK paper ballot catching on

69
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:22,090
cool so

70
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:25,110
next step should me the

71
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:29,870
friend Ron to mmm

72
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:37,349
3

73
00:05:37,349 --> 00:05:40,710
now wrong

74
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:45,340
for we

75
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:51,610
reading and on

76
00:05:51,610 --> 00:06:08,749
K

77
00:06:08,749 --> 00:06:42,640
that yet

78
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,050
ok

79
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:44,860
so

80
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:47,820
next one mitzi a

81
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:51,830
he hollers the

82
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:55,560
K

83
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,960
you know so that's lower let's see if
that is

84
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,100
some it's like inverted

85
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:09,790
to who

86
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:13,630
throws the

87
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:20,100
the from he

88
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:23,420
the no okay so

89
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:30,820
seems to be added at the end in a

90
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:34,570
cell was also something

91
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:47,670
its compare the use team

92
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:48,020
okay

93
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:51,210
I think I have to write this down again

94
00:07:51,210 --> 00:08:15,890
home

95
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:29,080
the output home

96
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,150
me thing

97
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:35,360
to and CE in for

98
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:41,180
the in ring

99
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:50,520
and

100
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:57,750
then called

101
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:01,390
on in

102
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:21,120
slumped down

103
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,720
key an from for example

104
00:09:23,720 --> 00:10:02,000
BB dement

105
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,690
now for the X great

106
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:11,740
from X

107
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:15,190
so let's compare use

108
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:20,550
values

109
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:31,410
with escalating quickly

110
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:34,320
with look for something that is not that
big

111
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,740
away is it every

112
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:42,400
10 the same that something check the

113
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:46,950
be

114
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:54,520
from more be

115
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,820
okay so it's not every said every time

116
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:01,680
different it's important to know maybe
it's always the same

117
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,320
after between them home

118
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:09,520
and look for something

119
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:12,770
it's quite far XO

120
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:28,279
something maybe s monitor on number

121
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:29,070
okay so

122
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:32,860
here we've got a small letter so mmm

123
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:37,209

is people to the first expected one in
an

166
00:16:07,889 --> 00:16:11,220
foresee in the other expected

167
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:15,019
characters and do

168
00:16:15,019 --> 00:16:18,720
I have a

169

have to set pollard

174
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:42,649
empty string and then I Howard

175
00:16:42,649 --> 00:16:46,459
is people to from

176
00:16:46,459 --> 00:16:55,670
pics

177
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:58,769
people to see

178
00:16:58,769 --> 00:17:02,899
for the current character F

179
00:17:02,899 --> 00:17:09,809
seem last on this case my nerves

180
00:17:09,809 --> 00:17:13,409
and then have to

181
00:17:13,409 --> 00:17:16,569
and the shift minus

182
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:20,370
shipped times the of sent and

183
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:27,020
we increased the offset by one them

184
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:35,290
out so

185
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:38,410
so predict 3 with 10 be

186
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:44,570
for example miss from with 36

187
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:49,730
no and then obviously you have to take
the all

188
00:17:49,730 --> 00:18:07,450
then from

189
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:20,899
should

190
00:18:20,899 --> 00:18:23,759
basking in the extra frame and then

191
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:26,820
obviously mmm before thing

192
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:29,940

241
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:57,450
song mmm

242
00:22:57,450 --> 00:23:02,740
I'm me doing to this backwards properly

243
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:07,480
through

244
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:12,150
they saw always different right he was
dv4 in with him

245
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:15,720
so for a can do anything first me

246
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:18,970
to get the correct of said

247
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:38,240
so grown send you again

248
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:46,779
and no I take the and

249
00:23:46,779 --> 00:23:50,110
the 0 so

250
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:54,639
0 way I also need to test

251
00:23:54,639 --> 00:23:59,299
for him a

252
00:23:59,299 --> 00:24:40,850
a is prone different

253
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:45,309
and from

254
00:24:45,309 --> 00:24:54,830
so we can tumbled here

255
00:24:54,830 --> 00:25:08,340
doubled here doubled here

256
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,630
all week because we're dance with if

257
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:28,019
in gene with from have

258
00:25:28,019 --> 00:25:30,440
for him them to look at this month so

259
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:34,279
a 3 A's this

260
00:25:34,279 --> 00:25:41,289
ABB day

261
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:50,650
the

262
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:52,570
in in through

263
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:57,960
right entry ok

264
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:04,550
a the okay

265
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:08,030
so

266
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:11,550
mostly don't change but if I have both
eighties

267
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:16,750
in them the the end it does change a lot

268
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:20,940
mine

269
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:29,310
it see what the difference between am

270
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:35,230
from and

271
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:49,779
from

272
00:26:49,779 --> 00:27:17,240
okay so I know that he is 80

273
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:20,140
so the im

274
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:23,380
when 9

275
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:29,419
would be

276
00:27:29,419 --> 00:27:35,750
6 them 66 so maybe it's Anna

277
00:27:35,750 --> 00:28:11,760
in the world going backwards with that
them

278
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:15,450
again and now I wanna know so

279
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:20,250
hand be be

280
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:23,850
no the

281
00:28:23,850 --> 00:29:07,379
the be

282
00:29:07,379 --> 00:29:13,029
who

283
00:29:13,029 --> 00:29:24,540
from maybe murder

284
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:27,150
see he

285
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:35,410
be for in

286
00:29:35,410 --> 00:29:55,450
the

287
00:29:55,450 --> 00:30:01,019
yes it looks that way so at least
portion

288
00:30:01,019 --> 00:30:05,190
so if this is a word that starts with
the

289
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:08,279
with this the influences on the other
he's

290
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:30,580
okay look at this them

291
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:34,679
okay so yeah on

292
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:45,870
cope with the room

293
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:49,290
so the one with the the is one higher at
the end

294
00:30:49,290 --> 00:30:53,700
so

295
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:58,500
first thing I do is

296
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:02,090
in word miss ago from

297
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:05,160
back sold I know that or nine

298
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:11,800
in in eighty so

299
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:19,010
and know that the lower that's my
problem

300
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:24,970
so those on my values

301
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:27,990
and I know that it's in bird so it would
be for

302
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:31,600
he'd to for well 6

303
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:35,790
3 49 and no

304
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:40,280
backwards and all that it there from
nine

305
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:43,700
a contest that then the next character

306
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:47,530
is 49

307
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:50,700
plus so

308
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:56,890
time to them

309
00:31:56,890 --> 00:31:58,730
mortal mine

310
00:31:58,730 --> 00:32:02,740
fire it's a3 okay so

311
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:06,919
so

312
00:32:06,919 --> 00:32:09,919
what ever this so okay

313
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:13,410
so ice is to me 9/4 a soul

314
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:18,250
at this point it has to be times too so
that must be in pay as well

315
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:21,890
because that gives me

316
00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:25,440
3

317
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,760
so what character what number

318
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:33,429
with forgets me 6

319
00:32:33,429 --> 00:32:36,870
its often any what number gives me well

320
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:40,020
but it's ok we go further aids a

321
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:43,650
well 16 sorry for

322
00:32:43,650 --> 00:32:47,890
and 24

323
00:32:47,890 --> 00:32:51,340
16 32

324
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:54,650
other for aid so no I'm wondering

325
00:32:54,650 --> 00:32:58,360
no there is a there

326
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:01,770
there is not

327
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:06,770
for ate at the end by the 49 so what
this from

328
00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:12,179
19 it should then be I'm

329
00:33:12,179 --> 00:33:17,309
50 anything no

330
00:33:17,309 --> 00:33:58,060
key with how it works

331
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:59,730
let's go with the first-string

332
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:03,250
so net for be 6

333
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:08,490
for 32

334
00:34:08,490 --> 00:34:12,530
16 need for 50
