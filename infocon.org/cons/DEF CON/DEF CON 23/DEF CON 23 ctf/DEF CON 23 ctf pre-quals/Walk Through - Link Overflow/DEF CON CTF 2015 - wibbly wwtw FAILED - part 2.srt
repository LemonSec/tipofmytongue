71
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:35,720
beam over and over again time we

72
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:43,749
the

73
00:11:43,749 --> 00:12:19,950
No

74
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:21,210

with your own

82
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:11,089
let's wait for the time

83
00:14:11,089 --> 00:14:14,820
don't return continue so the first one
is the

84
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:22,830
you you think north

85
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:29,200

00:15:47,420 --> 00:16:10,780
with people

92
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:13,610
okay so

93
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:18,000
from this it seems to get the stuff from
this

94
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:31,579
interest your through

95
00:16:31,579 --> 00:16:33,139
and the 89

in

97
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:44,540
okay

98
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:52,910
song

99
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:57,699
the key where you go

100
00:16:57,699 --> 00:17:04,199
fine

101
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:09,049

9 the time

103
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:18,110
right really in

104
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:21,240
takes for example

105
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:31,109
1

106

number

138
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:31,690
minutes reading and need

139
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:35,160
takes one one character

140
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:38,500
heat-driven character

141
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:41,700
men

142
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,780
moving characters would you

143
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:53,830
annex Houston Uvex from

144
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:59,980
next moves

145
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:04,280
the fine 9

146
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:09,070
month 6 5 know it's comparing

147
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:13,290
6 by which is the

148
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:19,200
so and the

149
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,580
6

150
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:25,570
fine

151
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:31,680
mmm thing

152
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:35,210
compare from

153
00:22:35,210 --> 00:23:15,950
is correct

154
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:25,210
we think it was

155
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:28,280
getting 6 with come from again

156
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:31,740
in from the

157
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:43,510
minus well

158
00:23:43,510 --> 00:24:04,000
to check with it said

159
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:16,120
no testing from fire three

160
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:28,660
so it's you

161
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:32,600
its you see

162
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:36,090
you see

163
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:39,559
and I did said

164
00:24:39,559 --> 00:24:42,559
to 63 previously in

165
00:24:42,559 --> 00:25:00,280
which was see no way

166
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,800
have no idea what's happening it looks
so weird

167
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:19,180
put in it the

168
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:22,310
d turned our

169
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:25,390
will be correct so it's you see

170
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:30,930
min after seems to be

171
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:35,100
capital with said the who

172
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:38,520
53

173
00:25:38,520 --> 00:26:16,810
team

174
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:22,360
okay since reading the your see if we
can predict

175
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:44,009
them

176
00:26:44,009 --> 00:26:49,720
so right now United rem

177
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:54,480
and no

178
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,529
we in is miss and

179
00:26:57,529 --> 00:27:06,510
yeah

180
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:09,630
3 move isn't

181
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:15,490

many characters

285
00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:41,499
were correct so if you would happen
solver

286
00:45:41,499 --> 00:45:45,049
or the on this game such as brute force
a key

287
00:45:45,049 --> 00:45:50,410
I think next step before I continue
after this year

288

I wuv right up

290
00:45:57,650 --> 00:46:32,660
right to solve on earth running

291
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:35,010
no he but

292
00:46:35,010 --> 00:46:40,950
with time the the worst wrong now

293
00:46:40,950 --> 00:46:44,140
why

294
00:46:44,140 --> 00:47:01,500
wrong

295
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:03,900
okay a row so because then we can

296
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:13,780
the camp foster case

297
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:21,480
so home so

298
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:25,500
a

299
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:28,680
I see I would like to put in

300
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:32,470
a

301
00:47:32,470 --> 00:47:44,180
the the game field and it will

302
00:47:44,180 --> 00:47:53,990
be there awnings these home

303
00:47:53,990 --> 00:47:55,920
kid say this is the game for you

304
00:47:55,920 --> 00:48:02,260
and I wanted to give

305
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:05,960
next step based on the field so

306
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:09,240
well that's a to print because this

307
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:32,660
key

308
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:36,470
okay and I call next step

309
00:48:36,470 --> 00:48:40,340
field ago there okay so for stuff along

310
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:44,070
I guess should split the line these

311
00:48:44,070 --> 00:48:49,180
on the mmm in

312
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:59,730
