1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:04,100
after giving up on movie

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:07,149
lovely Miami but I really do

3
00:00:07,149 --> 00:00:11,780
do want to solve two points charla so I
don't have too much time left today but

4
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:15,320
many M a good luck you black box

5
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:20,340
so have a look at that one very

6
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:23,850
demoralizing very hard

7
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:55,020
very beginner friendly sepia in

8
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:55,450
see

9
00:00:55,450 --> 00:01:03,100
K a.m. yes it's the same

10
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:12,340
so

11
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:18,540
heaven

12
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:19,460
I have my dear

13
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:25,220
but those subsea that way first thing
first check if the other thing that the

14
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:27,030
mean they look pretty much the same
length

15
00:01:27,030 --> 00:02:07,369
just to be sure

16
00:02:07,369 --> 00:02:10,739
if they do you have three triumph that's
interesting

17
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:17,060
but insolvable so

18
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:24,840
that was expected week that's it again

19
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,480
at see what happens if I and the same
characters

20
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:35,440
okay so

21
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,760
same characters get new place thing in
the next

22
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:42,069
it's a different character

23
00:02:42,069 --> 00:02:45,200
okay so

24
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:50,579
to press this a certain rule to open the
curtain

25
00:02:50,579 --> 00:02:55,099
to find this and you only have three
tries better

26
00:02:55,099 --> 00:03:21,860
and i guess its randomized every time so

27
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:36,909
so let's collect a few samples with
another test

28
00:03:36,909 --> 00:03:44,110
some at sea and they also

29
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:53,859
of troops other that with the Chris

30
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:58,120
mark okay so they also after each other
akin to that seem simple

31
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:03,319
that means sorry rectum

32
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:08,319
patent program miss

33
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:18,709
1

34
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:31,670
me

35
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:33,900
so I'm just received its fine

36
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:41,670
then

37
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:46,410
II send a test string and

38
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:50,310
I guess what I can do here's

39
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:53,420
the it seemed calm

40
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:56,680
the small

41
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:00,960
and then

42
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,650
them the last initial characters

43
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:08,780
which are and

44
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:11,990
held okay and then

45
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:27,789
we read again and are

46
00:05:27,789 --> 00:05:30,949
wrong on

47
00:05:30,949 --> 00:05:53,319
challenge

48
00:05:53,319 --> 00:06:10,090

and then receive and

57
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:36,390

58
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:36,830
okay

59

there

66
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:26,790
article

67
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:34,279
so

68
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:42,050
some

69
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:57,199
we can remove the records around and
then

70
00:09:57,199 --> 00:10:14,820
or E

71
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:15,180
yes

72
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:20,210
and 10 and

73
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:24,820
the the or the or

74
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:35,640
the

75
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:39,310
okay cool so when the

76
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:50,040
yeah

77
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:56,459
so that from there that the fear

78
00:10:56,459 --> 00:11:00,360
all the same them no

79
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:04,180
okay well the special character set then

80
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:10,040
it's me first

81
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:17,020
need to check some

82
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:20,310
in the

83
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:27,120
same they don't

84
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,980
okay out

85
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:37,690
well the best let's check the capital
letters so capital letters should

86
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:50,430
I would expect them all the same
distance

87
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:53,590
that only from with them

88
00:11:53,590 --> 00:12:03,840
not

89
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:07,580
what

90
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:36,029
she my them

91
00:12:36,029 --> 00:12:39,139
intimate with an expected to be the same
but OK

92
00:12:39,139 --> 00:12:45,440
well

93
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:51,430
shimon able so

94
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:55,000
s became he in

95
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:11,440
yes okay that on

96
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:20,970
maybe I have who thats highnesses

97
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:31,490
basis for okay so let's take this as
well that

98
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:33,470
then not take the

99
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:36,820
or the the

100
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:40,750
L that find fine

101
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:49,709
that letter so

102
00:13:49,709 --> 00:13:57,380
okay so it's from the often well yeah
this is tripping over

103
00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:02,029
that's fine unequal

104
00:14:02,029 --> 00:14:16,180
so it's based on them

105
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:25,220
so I'm gonna

106
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:29,110

yeah for of bit on

181
00:22:37,909 --> 00:22:42,650
0 is a so

182
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:45,980
from

183
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:49,500
from 1-10 are which is your

184
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:52,809
now find are

185
00:22:52,809 --> 00:22:58,260
I get for 3 so

186
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:02,580
if I do of fine minus 43

187
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:13,650
okay so

188
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:16,200
a becomes key so

189
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:19,630
alphabet fine key

190
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:22,680
is it 10

191
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:26,390
so if a plus one

192
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:31,120
minor the ship 0

193
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,190
ok so it's plus one minus

194
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:42,840
ship and that the character on

195
00:23:42,840 --> 00:24:01,150
work except when it was a big ship

196
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:06,770
the market so in from the whole

197
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:11,100

if

243
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:48,659
character always

244
00:29:48,659 --> 00:29:55,910
in the first characters all with the
same

245
00:29:55,910 --> 00:29:59,300
second character way on the A's

246
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:04,370
well I guess euros a.m.

247
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:08,540
you yes at sea

248
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:12,310
multiple youth with home people

249
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:26,850
on see them

250
00:30:26,850 --> 00:31:01,120
all

251
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:06,120
key so

252
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,040
at d

253
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:10,070
which is 3 gonna

254
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:13,880
with also always time to

255
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:17,300
okay so

256
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:21,310
I C

257
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:24,690
so it's always at the offsets

258
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:27,880
tends to so leads basically

259
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:32,210
take saying on

260
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:36,580
so his homework its times

261
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:42,430
to time

262
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:46,220
and 0 not him one

263
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:50,060
time who for paid

264
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:59,170
so obviously and then so

265
00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:14,970
its get the

266
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:18,330
so after that Sen the con

267
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:22,130
the and

268
00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:25,960
and there the

269
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:31,710
are print this

270
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:35,320
well and then we stand

271
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:39,610
then we make a test he said and

272
00:32:39,610 --> 00:32:42,690
and

273
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:47,160
sent something to it minor the

274
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:51,760
and then we

275
00:32:51,760 --> 00:33:05,590
we see phantom passer expect

276
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:08,990
trend around

277
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:22,430
who

278
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:44,660
that go school

279
00:33:44,660 --> 00:34:02,410
fourth him vector

280
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:10,789
0 and then

281
00:34:10,789 --> 00:34:15,450
mmm

282
00:34:15,450 --> 00:34:23,700
with who

283
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:28,580
I know with always them

284
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:32,230
no to to the power

285
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:36,780
%uh no its to the top I heard

286
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:40,129
we had the

287
00:34:40,129 --> 00:34:44,340
current character we've

288
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:51,220
find it and see no

289
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:56,050
we find the character number see we race

290
00:34:56,050 --> 00:35:00,040
that value to the power of current of

291
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:06,060
said and take that

292
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:19,930
character so

293
00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:22,280
who so

294
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:26,820

I have to and

297
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:41,450
plus 12 that so would be so

298
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:44,920
the character eighty

299
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:48,440
is then these

300
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:53,650
eighty these a state's a in

301
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:59,400
offered like that

302
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:02,920
oh yeah and I have who one

303
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:06,320
from the all again so

304
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:09,470
that states a no

305
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:17,030
be will the the

306
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:32,829
the now

310
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:05,400
am so no but it starts with

311
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:09,290
1 okay so I think I got it and we

312
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:13,500
of them of and then we

313
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:17,400
analysts and own

314
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:20,640
that it's working

315
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:27,230
them from index out of range and then I
have is

316
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:31,900
the mmm

317
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:40,430
the land of all from Louis

cool on

320
00:37:51,690 --> 00:37:54,010
well if you have a good time with
predicting

321
00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:57,250
its

322
00:37:57,250 --> 00:38:00,510
make a method called their free that

323
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:04,690
who and given the expected one

324
00:38:04,690 --> 00:38:35,099
and you the the hour

325
00:38:35,099 --> 00:38:43,350
mmm

326
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:46,910
im

327
00:38:46,910 --> 00:39:04,450
the okay so that's doing the same thing

328
00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:11,060
up I'll with you have to rebirth see

329
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:22,750
big stuff like

330
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:31,230
run

331
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:49,479
no I don't

332
00:39:49,479 --> 00:40:25,200
and the expected all good the

333
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,339
okay so thats

334
00:40:27,339 --> 00:40:35,750
Michael police year so I'll

335
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:39,390

current of that

338
00:41:26,290 --> 00:41:27,490
don't annoying

339
00:41:27,490 --> 00:42:02,499
the problem

340
00:42:02,499 --> 00:42:05,469
okay so this is obviously getting too
high

341
00:42:05,469 --> 00:42:09,880
and I expect this to be a the will

342
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:14,130
more than what is

343
00:42:14,130 --> 00:42:22,699
the he would the 29 this

344
00:42:22,699 --> 00:42:26,329
lamb the alphabet

345
00:42:26,329 --> 00:43:01,960
for for

346
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:04,110

00:43:33,770 --> 00:43:45,569
thing

350
00:43:45,569 --> 00:43:48,720
so on

351
00:43:48,720 --> 00:44:04,039
the

352
00:44:04,039 --> 00:44:07,950
well that's obviously wrong Okies with

353
00:44:07,950 --> 00:44:21,190
Wong

354
00:44:21,190 --> 00:44:29,730
so

355
00:44:29,730 --> 00:44:32,720
sees it who Ethan

356
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:40,340
1

357
00:44:40,340 --> 00:45:00,740
thinking so easy

358
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:03,850

and the 64

363
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:27,200
and then wrap around 33 so

364
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:30,520
obviously 64 that should been

365
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:34,760
one when a so comment

for it

414
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:01,340
so many it starts with

415
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:03,349
1

416
00:51:03,349 --> 00:52:05,350
me

417
00:52:05,350 --> 00:52:10,290
absolutely wrong so it's easy

418
00:52:10,290 --> 00:52:14,830
the is 3 G

419
00:52:14,830 --> 00:52:32,650
see am well

420
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:36,610
so 3

421
00:52:36,610 --> 00:52:40,600
to 9 3

422
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:46,420
them times this whole thing

423
00:52:46,420 --> 00:52:49,500
time who to the power of

424
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:52,660
something see

425
00:52:52,660 --> 00:52:55,050
well

426
00:52:55,050 --> 00:53:01,250
20 or down well

427
00:53:01,250 --> 00:53:04,380
obviously also don't wanna for I want it
back so

428
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:09,900
forgetting that had the I know that its

429
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:13,310
something times

430
00:53:13,310 --> 00:53:29,609
to to the power of 0

431
00:53:29,609 --> 00:53:30,450
yeah

432
00:53:30,450 --> 00:53:38,350
to Italy power 0 its 3 so I can ask my
fellow

433
00:53:38,350 --> 00:53:41,920
I get the three

434
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:45,770
very three so it's be

435
00:53:45,770 --> 00:53:51,740
been extended

436
00:53:51,740 --> 00:53:55,480
she and she is a6

437
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:58,730
so war times were to come 6

438
00:53:58,730 --> 00:54:01,940
do sixty by by

439
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:05,630
to hollow 1 it's awesome 3

440
00:54:05,630 --> 00:54:08,690
okay saw I do be

441
00:54:08,690 --> 00:54:13,050
find on this on the current on the
character

442
00:54:13,050 --> 00:54:17,870
divided by through to the power

443
00:54:17,870 --> 00:54:22,030
of of 3rd and

444
00:54:22,030 --> 00:54:25,850
that whole thing is taken from

445
00:54:25,850 --> 00:54:36,830
up

446
00:54:36,830 --> 00:54:58,050
them

447
00:54:58,050 --> 00:55:02,650
should maybe and d

448
00:55:02,650 --> 00:55:05,790
expected

449
00:55:05,790 --> 00:55:38,290
again

450
00:55:38,290 --> 00:55:39,650
so predicted

451
00:55:39,650 --> 00:55:48,560
the

452
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:52,390
okay the campus is correct in next let

453
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:58,650
is wrong so

454
00:55:58,650 --> 00:56:02,980
the

455
00:56:02,980 --> 00:56:25,550
you is 6 team

456
00:56:25,550 --> 00:56:27,280
no way expected one this is

457
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:31,050
more see and I did to

458
00:56:31,050 --> 00:56:34,360
poll one neighbor for

459
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:44,569
him

460
00:56:44,569 --> 00:56:46,810
it the the

461
00:56:46,810 --> 00:57:16,600
0 became you

462
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:22,820
again so have character

463
00:57:22,820 --> 00:57:30,860
me

464
00:57:30,860 --> 00:57:33,100
E

465
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:38,020
this for to

466
00:57:38,020 --> 00:57:42,860
own mural these for in

467
00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:46,210
this is to which obviously

468
00:57:46,210 --> 00:57:57,189
wrong

469
00:57:57,189 --> 00:58:03,460
it became

470
00:58:03,460 --> 00:58:09,070
and hi which isn't a

471
00:58:09,070 --> 00:58:43,589
so

472
00:58:43,589 --> 00:58:46,970
so a good the to

473
00:58:46,970 --> 00:58:50,029
or one became for

474
00:58:50,029 --> 00:58:53,200
certain yet so that's correct in

475
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:58,630
to or the next character

476
00:58:58,630 --> 00:59:05,069
I want in yeah and

477
00:59:05,069 --> 01:00:06,039
try to the victim

478
01:00:06,039 --> 01:00:13,489
so

479
01:00:13,489 --> 01:00:54,060
them

480
01:00:54,060 --> 01:00:57,720
so I think the letter see

481
01:00:57,720 --> 01:01:00,780
which is

482
01:01:00,780 --> 01:01:03,800
to and ignited

483
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:06,980
by the through polo

484
01:01:06,980 --> 01:01:17,860
one 1

485
01:01:17,860 --> 01:01:27,890
the wrong yes who

486
01:01:27,890 --> 01:01:30,370
call on it's right there why is

487
01:01:30,370 --> 01:01:33,620
I'm brain not

488
01:01:33,620 --> 01:01:47,780
grasping this

489
01:01:47,780 --> 01:01:59,200
no okay

490
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:04,220
and the so

491
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:08,160
I got it she GC

492
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:11,610
6 United to power one

493
01:02:11,610 --> 01:02:18,430

494
01:02:18,430 --> 01:02:19,249
e3 okay

495
01:02:19,249 --> 01:02:30,880
so feared works its trade with the

496
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:34,039
United to

497
01:02:34,039 --> 01:02:37,999

I N which

499
01:02:41,499 --> 01:02:44,589
also the that's cool

500
01:02:44,589 --> 01:02:49,769
if I do crude

501
01:02:49,769 --> 01:02:53,670
through room

502
01:02:53,670 --> 01:03:03,099
should the ok

503
01:03:03,099 --> 01:03:16,029

from off the field

511
01:04:11,849 --> 01:04:16,170
okay so maybe it's because the for the
enters

512
01:04:16,170 --> 01:04:20,000
on so that the expected now

513
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:25,180
wide so here

514
01:04:25,180 --> 01:04:29,380
