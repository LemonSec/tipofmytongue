1
00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:03,610
a KVM is installing but it takes a while

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:07,040
though and wrong

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,750
so Irene entered for some chick so

4
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:14,809
at sea takes the first

5
00:00:14,809 --> 00:00:20,189
by from if

6
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:25,560
param you know that we're given checks
if its euro

7
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,010
if it's not zero sec checks if it's a
space

8
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:32,480
if it's not us if it's this

9
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:44,399
or if it's a space

10
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:56,410
youth second sure

11
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:59,269
okay tests different

12
00:00:59,269 --> 00:01:05,009
character thats

13
00:01:05,009 --> 00:01:11,110
the artists online

14
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:14,490
no there in there so

15
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:18,000
seventh

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,050
the oh that's the pipes and more

17
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:25,470
who a year star

18
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:29,479
21 mission

19
00:01:29,479 --> 00:01:38,229
are okay so if

20
00:01:38,229 --> 00:01:41,780
if it's one of these some people then it
will return

21
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:50,710
you're okay so you're not allowed to use
these

22
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:58,180
on also this earth with this is a loop

23
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:03,530
with if it's not

24
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:06,800
equal are okay so after some checking

25
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,869
each character I am your

26
00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:14,670
ending one getting the next byte okay so
it's taking its character

27
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:18,519
and it checks if it's if it's not a
space

28
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:21,930
will then make these other checks if
it's a pipe or

29
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:25,810
star exclamation mark in stock what is
this

30
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:29,640
it serves

31
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:33,030
3 he and checks week what

32
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:36,950

3 a in chicks if it's one

34
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:49,410
so okay so it's checking

35
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:52,610
for semicolon guess

36
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:56,730
where earlier

37
00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:01,180
okay awaited its EC exits not

38
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:10,750
156 loaded with our okay

39
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:14,080
EA X is stored easy accessible okay

40
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:19,610
okay thanks I guess this is checking for
a

41
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:22,799
sham

42
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:33,830
be low equal oh wait compare

43
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:37,209
oh okay so if II use a.m.

44
00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:42,629
character that are blog I am

45
00:03:42,629 --> 00:03:47,700
3 a no

46
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:56,769
be low 38 can use them yeah

47
00:03:56,769 --> 00:04:01,430
jump below equal so if thats the vids

48
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:05,160
its cynical on or I am

49
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,209
smaller

50
00:04:08,209 --> 00:04:11,380
it will go here and return

51
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:19,169
and Lord 1 okay okay so

52
00:04:19,169 --> 00:04:22,630
basically we are not allowed

53
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:27,030
who use pipe

54
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:31,650
everything a thing

55
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:35,400
greater people to them a call on Thor is
a lot

56

57
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:49,680
so let's euro in the

58
00:04:49,680 --> 00:05:08,290
now I more important

59
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:08,740
to work

60
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:12,970
kinda characters 30 I C

61
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:21,660
okay so we are only allowed to use
number

62
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:29,690
and some special characters being

63
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:44,979
including new line

64
00:05:44,979 --> 00:05:52,550
for your sis

65
00:05:52,550 --> 00:06:05,979
okay

66
00:06:05,979 --> 00:06:08,300
cool so checking

67
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:16,210
for

68
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:19,220
this is checking followed Sox cool maybe
ever

69
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:22,420
also done installing

70
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:34,910
hey let's have a look at the ping
command again so

71
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:39,530
we check if we have the a lot characters

72
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:43,120
Sony numbers and stuff and then we do

73
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,050
see how this is exactly be

74
00:06:47,050 --> 00:07:05,619
find

75
00:07:05,619 --> 00:07:13,490
your an integer

76
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:16,949
your fine with this in return

77
00:07:16,949 --> 00:07:40,990
wrong them

78
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:44,110
okay so I'm not sure if you could

79
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:47,360
bypasses in any way that seems

80
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:58,590
to thrown or every time

81
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:01,240
will look good you become one with the

82
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:09,790
agree one ride and I so here's burt
decided

83
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:13,860
achieve their some secret secret months
or something

84
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:24,310
or string

85
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:27,740
case comp with to this case center for
the

86
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:32,290
compare 3 ignoring case cool so

87
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:38,240
yeah that means if you do

88
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:43,630
paying workers well

89
00:08:43,630 --> 00:09:10,360

here

92
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,050
against this is your

93
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:28,950
it that's probably the

94
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:34,310
re to 100

95
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:37,330
when just him yeah

96
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:41,450

oh my god never seen span the

98
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,450
com the complement of screen

99
00:09:55,450 --> 00:10:14,580
then

100
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:18,560
was a characters

101
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:22,920

knowing me

108
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:57,420
the keys com your should check what for
example

109
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:02,990
these other things the

110
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:06,309
3 he was t3 to get that

111
00:11:06,309 --> 00:11:09,439
this is presumably the post come and

112
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:16,830
key

113
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:21,420
are better

114
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:22,110
showing

115
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:31,529
help

116
00:11:31,529 --> 00:11:36,319
its group pic your I'm

117
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:42,939
paying common the so

118
00:11:42,939 --> 00:11:48,410
host RP percent appear that is for the
host come on

119
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:52,699
you know this is looking awesome okay so
this is

120
00:11:52,699 --> 00:11:56,359
using in quotes worse

121
00:11:56,359 --> 00:11:59,720
were quotes included here yes they were

122
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:04,449
food okay so that see is that the only
check HERE

123
00:12:04,449 --> 00:12:33,970
text followed care is also the these

124
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:42,490
with with the

125
00:12:42,490 --> 00:13:20,550
key has the function from them

126
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:23,980
persona also homes and then that would
the

127
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:27,280
I know tooth number

128
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:31,340
so it's also this

129
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:35,280
to am that feels that we don't

130
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:45,240
fire Rio your

131
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:48,350
in it in

132
00:13:48,350 --> 00:14:06,410
to day

133
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:11,620
I'm curious no a solid returns

134
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:17,620
thing nation it on earth

135
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:23,990
and like okay though if this fails then

136
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:27,190
white it takes the into tryn

137
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:30,360
crates and ASCII string from that

138
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:40,710
implementation oh wait wait wait if it
fails it's going over there

139
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:44,380
if it was true then it then its
converting it back

140
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:47,960
to in IP point notation and then that
this

141
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:51,380
men use in the P open call okay so if
it's not

142
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:54,770
this their bull to sup

143
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:58,650
these CC whatever that is

144
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:05,330
doing

145
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:19,950
on

146
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:24,310
okay if that succeeding

147
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:28,250
awesome to

148
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:37,030
I guess I have to check what's up with

149
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:40,850
ago okay so

150
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:50,440
