1
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:03,199
okay so as a rep

2
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:06,950
of the DEFCON qualification CTF it's
quite hard

3
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:10,160
I played a lot I A head to I

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,450
couldn't play the the whole two days

5
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:16,970
but I think I spent spent

6
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:20,590
around no 24-hour

7
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:23,990
sauna only lol with

8
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:28,080
yeah are a that have made 20 oz I've so

9
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,780
the baby come on shown the cat
investment challenge

10
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:37,170
and I was a box with of the black box
challenge

11
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:41,540
but time ran out just three minutes
after

12
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:44,620
deadline and I achieve

13
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:48,870
to get a partial leg also I mean my
method

14
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:53,420
lester bed should have I could have

15
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:56,770
gotten it if I didn't help made a break
earlier

16
00:00:56,770 --> 00:01:00,190
I was getting sick

17
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:06,060
so besides those three challenges ahead
a look at baby a hero I'm

18
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:11,210
I know it's about to get it out that's
about comments from

19
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:15,430
by but per person and was not possible

20
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:20,430
and I got stuck with that and continue I
really want to have a look at math with

21
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:24,520
and rough baby especially math for the
hurt that it's super easy but a

22
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:27,840
then look at it and Rob Pavey

23
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,280
seems like yeah I'm its Rob so and its

24
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,400
baby charge a I think with time acquit
himself the but it didn't look good

25
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,579
I spent some time with us

26
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:41,880
the server sent box when it was released
in the beginning

27
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,939
the said it

28
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:50,250
didn't really figure out anything with
that I spent a lot of time

29
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:53,860
for Wembley will be time you why me I
ahead

30
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:56,690
then in the end descriptive David solve
it

31
00:01:56,690 --> 00:02:00,340
and I figured out the key to get ex
harness

32
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:04,850
and then I got stuck to a bit I figured
out the

33
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:09,630
opening a soccer but this is also where
I then stop they couldn't and just

34
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:10,680
confront the world

35
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:14,430
ability for that but I'm very
disappointed because I really

36
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:20,770
everyone it's the fourth on I have never
look at any of the river

37
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:24,140
charges the Raptors came live

38
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:29,000
way related look at that either and
obviously I spent a lot of time on

39
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,360
black box swelled happen

40
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:36,350
I i solve

41
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:40,010
let for that way the and enter a chief

42
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:43,380
to basically get four points I

43
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:48,030
at the end user before and

44
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:52,240
are okay it paid off well on the
scoreboard I was not

45
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:56,140
not a top 100 I was like top 150 or
something

46
00:02:56,140 --> 00:03:02,040
