1
00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:04,000
okay and Nick maybe it's because they
have

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,980
to turn in a row them in

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:31,240
us

4
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:53,690
okay well

5
00:00:53,690 --> 00:01:01,760
pretty

6
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,710
let's make this that I can has a

7
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:07,229
character yes yes

8
00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:13,909
have of yes your

9
00:01:13,909 --> 00:01:22,159
that for

10
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:25,210
so net one

11
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:29,359
when X 0

12
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:34,250
wrong office to the from here

13
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:38,829
net is

14
00:01:38,829 --> 00:02:00,630
not quite correct

15
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:03,780
or I to have to try and on don't

16
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:08,670
coming

17
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:55,900
from no themselves should be sorry I'm
getting sick

18
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:56,230
okay

19
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:59,950
let's analyze again and this time with
these instead of gays

20
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:03,150
is always special so

21
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:07,560
and those be me

22
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:14,690
some sees

23
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:39,480
0 fun

24
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:46,980
so and are

25
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:50,010
so the first one

26
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:53,090
is a

27
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:58,420
three

28
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:00,980
words is it be so

29
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:04,030
a to

30
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:07,770
is into isn't

31
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:11,420
a and 83 the BU so the first character

32
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:22,100
is obviously

33
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:27,110
the two-minus them happy

34
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:30,510
20 so next so

35
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:35,190
if I assume 82 is the a and

36
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:51,160
time

37
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,590
neck soreness 93

38
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:56,910
and so does

39
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:04,810
71 which is who and then from there

40
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:07,890
one all I go one other

41
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:11,620
and 47

42
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:15,310
with some for also maybe just have to

43
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:21,280
also for what to expect expect be so
expect ones

44
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,420
sort by: but to divided by four

45
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:29,569
well it's continuing that so next Mon
the three

46
00:05:29,569 --> 00:05:50,150
and mural

47
00:05:50,150 --> 00:06:01,020
its turnover 82 with one minus

48
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:22,319
one true

49
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:34,380
know that seems nice

50
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:38,450
maybe its semi form

51
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:45,970
times to power or with the same

52
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:51,110
to both time with this anyone

53
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:54,140
71 times mine

54
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:57,320
the when I

55
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:01,340
assumes the eighty time to

56
00:07:01,340 --> 00:08:11,889
people who

57
00:08:11,889 --> 00:08:12,470
but couldn't

58
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:15,600
to assembly different way Creek to it
and

59
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:19,419
and thinking right now that it could

60
00:08:19,419 --> 00:08:27,289
kept for ditsy

61
00:08:27,289 --> 00:08:31,259
if a he the that

62
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:38,520
similar to a the

63
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:41,530
yes and no modifies

64
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:50,910
1

65
00:08:50,910 --> 00:09:25,900
the

66
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:28,860
no medicine

67
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:32,920
K and to did with another way

68
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:36,630
so this

69
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:47,140
still handed true

70
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:48,649
so

71
00:09:48,649 --> 00:09:53,630
30 on

72
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:56,790
times to mmm

73
00:09:56,790 --> 00:10:01,120
next one

74
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:16,240
then me

75
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,870
well Okies do with

76
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:27,310
this with the peace that

77
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:29,260
0 skip

78
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:34,510
so like this an hour I cryptic

79
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:40,120
for where

80
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:46,029
in

81
00:10:46,029 --> 00:11:04,550
system

82
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:06,840
when this gets it on this correct
accepted

83
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:10,880
and afterwards so cute so there this
happening more

84
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,000
at sea other one this to L

85
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:32,870
them ghettos secret

86
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:35,660
so maybe has to do with the fun so

87
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:39,079
first one is

88
00:11:39,079 --> 00:11:45,480
the previous one was

89
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:50,600
13 13

90
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,970
I'm to is 26 incomes

91
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:57,470
2610 to 52

92
00:11:57,470 --> 00:12:15,110
cool

93
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:18,110
or shit to remember your

94
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:21,180
so menace obviously

95
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:26,290
and I can do

96
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:30,190
50 two-minus that three minutes 52

97
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:34,270
see it's the be so nixon with be a

98
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:37,730
and so effect in T the

99
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:50,509
current one I'm to which is 11 II

100
00:12:50,509 --> 00:12:52,329
do it pic with BP would be

101
00:12:52,329 --> 00:12:57,540
no through

102
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:00,989
attic number from

103
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:04,850
young minds through south from here this
one which the be

104
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:08,319
Sonex character expect to be

105
00:13:08,319 --> 00:13:12,879
and AA can to the committee

106
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:17,029
5 in Edison

107
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:28,380
thing 11 them

108
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:30,970
will bahir works again sorry for have

109
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:34,570
10 so if I'm here then I think the
previous one

110
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:38,880
well maybe

111
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:44,210
well

112
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:48,010
its co-workers minutes 11

113
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:52,520
well okay so it's always fun with

114
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:57,140
or for many years to subtract

115
00:13:57,140 --> 00:14:01,620
the you solve the previous month so CF

116
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:04,820
5310

117
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:09,100
through so 53 minus

118
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:13,720
50 -50

119
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:17,550
to is one so in the next step

120
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:20,650
take the 53 tens

121
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:24,470
to minus the previous ones one is a 10

122
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:27,670
intelligence euro

123
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:31,700
that seemed to work it's rated with this
year society

124
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:34,920
54

125
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:40,820
time through 9

126
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:45,690
30 and

127
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:49,310
before -50 to

128
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:52,570
is through so I have specific to

129
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:55,290
from that

130
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:58,649
okay I think its that's right this in
algorithm

131
00:14:58,649 --> 00:15:04,350
so I he the be

132
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:20,950
victim are you

133
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:29,550
well system from so starts with I

134
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:34,130
culturally

135
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:38,630
the eBay's from

136
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:42,110
which is 13 exactly so I

137
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:45,410
accompanied F minus the and thats the

138
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:53,530
so

139
00:15:53,530 --> 00:16:01,140
that's a subsection part ok and next
step

140
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:12,150
its take the

141
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:18,040
a piece I have to remember that so that
is from the

142
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:22,060
previous step so I take the the

143
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:26,980
at current value which is F

144
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:31,170
from the expected one minus

145
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:41,390
be be and then

146
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:45,300
the same thing sabir

147
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:48,640
from previous one

148
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:52,170
and then I T

149
00:16:52,170 --> 00:17:07,100
this is the value that should p

150
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:21,110
okay so your the last one feels quite as
it you

151
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:24,730
should print ephraim

152
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:28,549
and be have

153
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:34,410
minus and love maybe with

154
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:40,260
minus year and minus

155
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:54,910
your cool

156
00:17:54,910 --> 00:18:08,710
Sam home

157
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:11,799
he said in no isn't

158
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:14,909
our them wrong

159
00:18:14,909 --> 00:18:24,590
10 its a yet and

160
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:25,749
so

161
00:18:25,749 --> 00:18:28,850
not hard is 10 have to

162
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:34,619
bullet did wrong

163
00:18:34,619 --> 00:18:40,480
ride have to take the previous value
which

164
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:48,919
was 55 time who

165
00:18:48,919 --> 00:19:09,489
yeah this is not good

166
00:19:09,489 --> 00:19:10,990
way

167
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:14,799
talk about so

168
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:25,380
no hero is 13 26

169
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:27,020
10/26/10 to

170
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:49,029
and fifty three times to

171
00:19:49,029 --> 00:19:51,190
was moderate again I take

172
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:55,940
the at current value I am

173
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:59,860
minus the base now

174
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:03,010
-1 a with B that would be 30

175
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:07,860
than 80 me times

176
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:11,330
to -26 so it's in

177
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:26,400
awesome p then

178
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:31,630
and then take 52

179
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:35,860
0 I have two suspected from from

180
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:39,100
so and isn't 1 so it's a be

181
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:43,830
and

182
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:52,299
then and he he

183
00:20:52,299 --> 00:20:58,559
so

184
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:01,169
I think the current value minus

185
00:21:01,169 --> 00:21:04,320
when I would be expected to be in a good
one

186
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:09,470
but I substrate

187
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:17,690
the previous value which was the one

188
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:24,419
okay so

189
00:21:24,419 --> 00:21:26,299
so that is correct so I

190
00:21:26,299 --> 00:21:29,710
take the the minus the

191
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:33,080
minus the previous one

192
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:54,289
so

193
00:21:54,289 --> 00:21:57,419
through

194
00:21:57,419 --> 00:21:59,639
one in

195
00:21:59,639 --> 00:22:08,590
weiss's mines this the 10

196
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:12,379
the 0 0

197
00:22:12,379 --> 00:22:18,889
and this should not be -1 should then be
the result of the previous one

198
00:22:18,889 --> 00:22:22,649
so should the

199
00:22:22,649 --> 00:22:41,530
this year David

200
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:47,760
next one then

201
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,620
or always times who from

202
00:22:50,620 --> 00:23:00,120
the years okay

203
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:03,210
different I'm script this again so

204
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:07,960
I create this list this is a

205
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:32,000
no hey to

206
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,370
no I take

207
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:41,850
I think the expected values encompass

208
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:44,920
in a different script and

209
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:57,479
your test around

210
00:23:57,479 --> 00:24:02,159
5

211
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:20,400
for pretty for

212
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:42,110
the

213
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:45,259
so I in the other functions

214
00:24:45,259 --> 00:25:04,620
year

215
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:59,350
okay so

216
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:08,430
okay

217
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:13,620
and the babies is s so I said

218
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:16,790
I take the its

219
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:21,740
figures

220
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:25,070
so we take foresee in EU

221
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:33,210
to take the first one C-minus

222
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:49,930
the s well you

223
00:26:49,930 --> 00:27:02,800
so

224
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:15,850
the month yes

225
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:25,720
and death people were from

226
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:50,940
them in

227
00:27:50,940 --> 00:28:11,549
ok no

228
00:28:11,549 --> 00:28:11,830
%uh

229
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:15,330
dement X okay so know where the country

230
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:21,350
so thirteen years thirteeners a fight I
think I have to write

231
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:25,740
remember the current of the Siro

232
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:31,320
so in the next round I have to T the

233
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:35,970
see time to

234
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:40,159
to the poll of the offset so

235
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:48,460
or like that

236
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:53,700
and I increase the by one

237
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:57,490
and obviously

238
00:28:57,490 --> 00:29:06,070
I have to take mortal or 95 okay this
works great

239
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:12,059
for the aids now comes a the which i
recognize nicely

240
00:29:12,059 --> 00:29:15,279
so

241
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:21,100
I have to remember this

242
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:30,970
number it's called it and

243
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:39,140
know that cause old old an

244
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:42,480
and old and is star

245
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:51,710
0

246
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:59,290
and I'm actually in a taking

247
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:02,400
well yeah

248
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:06,630
she noticed taking I'm a kiss

249
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:10,390
script is again I so I start with Howard

250
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:13,929
and that is the I take the

251
00:30:13,929 --> 00:30:18,559
for the

252
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:21,970
first word minus s so

253
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:26,220
and old and lost

254
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:29,799
with the expected value from on the
first character

255
00:30:29,799 --> 00:30:33,350
no I go for a fee in the

256
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:36,549
skipping the first character and then

257
00:30:36,549 --> 00:30:42,039
I A actually cock allayed at:

258
00:30:42,039 --> 00:30:45,200
the old an time

259
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:50,700
to and

260
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:54,970
abstract d current

261
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:59,030
the

262
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:09,720
currency from that

263
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:15,030
so that would be 0

264
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:18,250
for the first one great and

265
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:21,300
and I said old

266
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:51,549
an is equal to what worth crimes

267
00:31:51,549 --> 00:31:53,880
none of this year to mmm

268
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:59,100
print current so with other a

269
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:03,919
the a be that's correct consider minus
number

270
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:12,630
which is a bit shitty well couple it
again

271
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:18,400
I and and then read

272
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:22,909
53 which tends to

273
00:32:22,909 --> 00:32:27,600
and 5

274
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:32,149
11 so

275
00:32:32,149 --> 00:32:41,920
actually its this way around

276
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:44,880
with a the the

277
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:52,899
he a the me

278
00:32:52,899 --> 00:32:55,049
occurred so 53

279
00:32:55,049 --> 00:32:59,059
time minus the current see

280
00:32:59,059 --> 00:33:06,049
wages 10 no

281
00:33:06,049 --> 00:33:17,240
53 miners way

282
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:22,320
it. 26 45

283
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,440
name to the currency

284
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,750
minus that so return

285
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:33,910
into so then pretty

286
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:42,110
mmm I guess then

287
00:33:42,110 --> 00:34:05,450
T the next 1

288
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:07,240
I do the

289
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:28,429
expected

290
00:34:28,429 --> 00:34:33,050
it's a a take the kern that put the

291
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:36,409
11 and I would have made 10 minus

292
00:34:36,409 --> 00:34:39,409
1 and then maybe I a

293
00:34:39,409 --> 00:34:43,490
the previous thing on it which is first
one

294
00:34:43,490 --> 00:34:46,890
and then next step with take

295
00:34:46,890 --> 00:34:52,890
ten times to and 20 and -0

296
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:57,220
okay so me that works so eighty

297
00:34:57,220 --> 00:35:01,790
C-minus the old one class

298
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:25,550
the

299
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:31,710
old C

300
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:45,050
old the Ocho collision is this here

301
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:48,970
mines more

302
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:57,650
9 fine of

303
00:35:57,650 --> 00:36:01,830
fine have to

304
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:05,270
and this whole thing old see

305
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:10,550
which starts

306
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:14,340
he new

307
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:34,579
minus yes

308
00:36:34,579 --> 00:36:38,990
okay no

309
00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:46,180
crap

310
00:36:46,180 --> 00:37:18,400
so

311
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,690
p

312
00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:23,140
let's let's make this

313
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:26,680
more prettier so the first character

314
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:29,710
then 26 so I T

315
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:34,020
the old and value multiplied by

316
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:37,060
to so

317
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:50,779
friend

318
00:37:50,779 --> 00:37:59,600
so T old and know you

319
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:02,560
but serbs but is subject to current

320
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:06,260
see value from so see

321
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:10,760
comma old by name

322
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:16,050
but a

323
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:22,020
from the modal this okay

324
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:23,600
into the salt of this

325
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:27,460
see

326
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:41,360
minors

327
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:44,340
your okay for the next one is

328
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:47,340
1 so that's

329
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:59,170
the be so

330
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:01,680
old cell this

331
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:07,740
equaled who this one here said

332
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:12,210
this and

333
00:39:12,210 --> 00:39:16,250
whole truth old four-star

334
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:23,460
first 10

335
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:24,750
okay

336
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:28,589
in then but I also class

337
00:39:28,589 --> 00:39:45,940
the so

338
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:49,480
some personal

339
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:53,290

old ok no

341
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:02,510
that looks I wanted to be so

342
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:08,740
with came things can go away

343
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:15,770
and powered first people the

344
00:40:15,770 --> 00:40:21,100
the of salt be

345
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:24,150
of friend our

346

second with one of the more young one

348
00:40:34,450 --> 00:40:40,580
long

349
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:46,700
p

350
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:55,720
epsilon

351
00:40:55,720 --> 00:41:16,830
home be

352
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:36,359
no for

353
00:41:36,359 --> 00:41:38,210
away old crew salsa

354
00:41:38,210 --> 00:41:58,840
he said tool

355
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:12,579
in fact he Epsom

356
00:42:12,579 --> 00:42:36,539
home in

357
00:42:36,539 --> 00:42:43,020
shifted again

358
00:42:43,020 --> 00:43:01,460
no

359
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:07,410
in

360
00:43:07,410 --> 00:43:12,240
key in the

361
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:36,839
the

362
00:43:36,839 --> 00:44:03,780
ok

363
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:06,599
let's make one ninth

364
00:44:06,599 --> 00:44:11,660
was them so it seems like

365
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:14,780
with a start so it seems like that he is
on

366
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:19,040
with it looks

367
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:25,910
the who them

368
00:44:25,910 --> 00:44:33,690
and then

369
00:44:33,690 --> 00:44:36,970
I'll

370
00:44:36,970 --> 00:44:42,240
Mar no

371
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:51,670
crazy said

372
00:44:51,670 --> 00:45:07,060
so that would the and

373
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:14,850
makes thick this you

374
00:45:14,850 --> 00:45:19,420
it seems to work

375
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:28,140
so it just has to be turnaround awesome

376
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:36,640
so let's try this so this intact

377
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:41,859
when arm I sent

378
00:45:41,859 --> 00:45:48,000
the take the first one

379
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,310
and then

380
00:45:51,310 --> 00:45:55,730
me predicts

381
00:45:55,730 --> 00:46:08,970
of yes

382
00:46:08,970 --> 00:46:11,150
were be

383
00:46:11,150 --> 00:46:18,480
effect

384
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:21,910
and then on and our

385
00:46:21,910 --> 00:46:26,200
okay

386
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:29,900
cross your fingers through

387
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:35,900
Mike Dement

388
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:39,420

389
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:56,529
be fine

390
00:46:56,529 --> 00:47:07,290
it seems to have worked

391
00:47:07,290 --> 00:47:10,130
one this on

392
00:47:10,130 --> 00:47:13,260
turn

393
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:16,390
script the sperm

394
00:47:16,390 --> 00:47:24,200
this and last one

395
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:27,650
amazing yes so happy

396
00:47:27,650 --> 00:47:31,000
k still the same

397
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,650
tennis and the yen

398
00:47:34,650 --> 00:47:38,930
seems a bit more mixed

399
00:47:38,930 --> 00:47:42,210
betsy is it still

400
00:47:42,210 --> 00:47:45,810
eighty okay so

401
00:47:45,810 --> 00:48:04,040
different now

402
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:30,300
its also good

403
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:33,920
okay so some notice from UPS

404
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:37,120
that the UN the after right

405
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:40,800
but the p.m. are other apart

406
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:45,210
I actually won

407
00:48:45,210 --> 00:48:49,440
further apart and that chick the in

408
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:57,710
of time you're quite a bit so the UN wey

409
00:48:57,710 --> 00:49:01,450
day your each other p

410
00:49:01,450 --> 00:49:11,480
to are

411
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:28,979
okay NP sorry aid apart

412
00:49:28,979 --> 00:49:30,660
of that let's notice

413
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:34,119
let's truth at first like the order
stuff

414
00:49:34,119 --> 00:49:37,599
lead want to fix what because it seems
like if I

415
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:41,410
have a long string with European

416
00:49:41,410 --> 00:49:45,209
change one

417
00:49:45,209 --> 00:49:48,249
before it never have the

418
00:49:48,249 --> 00:49:54,959
the be in kindness gruza

419
00:49:54,959 --> 00:49:59,069
everything okay so it's not reverse
anything

420
00:49:59,069 --> 00:50:06,779
netzarim in

421
00:50:06,779 --> 00:50:13,809
the you its

422
00:50:13,809 --> 00:50:31,240
for

423
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:46,610
them

424
00:50:46,610 --> 00:50:50,860
okay

425
00:50:50,860 --> 00:51:22,060
that's a weird

426
00:51:22,060 --> 00:51:23,820
mmm

427
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:27,690
maybe we think because a company source
for work these things anymore

428
00:51:27,690 --> 00:51:33,210
maybe we could also brute force it
because the seams no no its not

429
00:51:33,210 --> 00:51:34,270
sequentially

430
00:51:34,270 --> 00:51:41,000
no ok it them a try some analysis person

431
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:41,540
so

432
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:46,370
events in

433
00:51:46,370 --> 00:51:53,200
a and

434
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:56,250
the and just becomes one longer

435
00:51:56,250 --> 00:52:01,150
nice with headed

436
00:52:01,150 --> 00:52:04,790
in

437
00:52:04,790 --> 00:52:21,420
with just a coincidence

438
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:25,160
know it seems sequentially except named

439
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:29,779
and its again

440
00:52:29,779 --> 00:52:33,229
some A's quite differently

441
00:52:33,229 --> 00:52:36,489
in the be yes occurred

442
00:52:36,489 --> 00:52:43,709
and fine place

443
00:52:43,709 --> 00:52:47,609
the one it is previous

444
00:52:47,609 --> 00:52:51,900
one good so

445
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:55,769
said

446
00:52:55,769 --> 00:53:01,069
its for

447
00:53:01,069 --> 00:53:10,060
one yen

448
00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:13,390
k maybe it's it's always pairs of

449
00:53:13,390 --> 00:53:16,850
to that that do stuff so that the a

450
00:53:16,850 --> 00:53:33,580
K a be the K

451
00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:39,700
interesting

452
00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:41,890
the the

453
00:53:41,890 --> 00:53:50,630
the it's quite interesting

454
00:53:50,630 --> 00:53:54,049
so be in the fun

455
00:53:54,049 --> 00:53:59,369
they share the be are

456
00:53:59,369 --> 00:54:08,470
No

457
00:54:08,470 --> 00:54:14,640
that

458
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:14,890
so

459
00:54:14,890 --> 00:54:19,049
what i'm looking at here interesting

460
00:54:19,049 --> 00:54:22,219
okay sure be become so one

461
00:54:22,219 --> 00:54:31,230
he is this year obviously

462
00:54:31,230 --> 00:54:34,279

00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:43,380
okay it's that's interesting me five
billion

470
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:47,630
them

471
00:55:47,630 --> 00:55:53,540
so the influence and

472
00:55:53,540 --> 00:55:58,320
your was the 1 and the state

473
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:01,860
since it seems like its tool but always

474
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:05,090
in 12 pairs in worth maybe

475
00:56:05,090 --> 00:56:09,560
in person impassive to inverse

476
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:15,830
so gonna

477
00:56:15,830 --> 00:56:22,470
no this down

478
00:56:22,470 --> 00:56:23,040
so

479
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:48,210
this pounds

480
00:56:48,210 --> 00:56:49,700
the

481
00:56:49,700 --> 00:57:11,700

so the pair be a for example

499
00:58:59,089 --> 00:59:02,119
and I want to change now this here

500
00:59:02,119 --> 00:59:08,310
well

501
00:59:08,310 --> 00:59:27,470
else have to look in pairs so

502
00:59:27,470 --> 00:59:30,170
so be

503
00:59:30,170 --> 00:59:40,720

have to look a ribbon okay so

508
01:00:12,529 --> 01:00:17,440
and 10 write some code to generate me
some

509
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:20,940
some test cases and I thought puttin'
stuff because interest

510
01:00:20,940 --> 01:00:27,670
to lead Spain no long

511

crew

551
01:08:06,539 --> 01:08:10,169
test cases what do you wanna test

552
01:08:10,169 --> 01:08:13,339
yes the

553
01:08:13,339 --> 01:08:20,380

me

557
01:09:06,050 --> 01:09:24,080
in I'm 1

558
01:09:24,080 --> 01:10:40,350
one more

559
01:10:40,350 --> 01:10:42,790
no

560
01:10:42,790 --> 01:10:49,680
print

561
01:10:49,680 --> 01:11:54,820
are

song TCAs

563
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:09,200
cream and

564
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:20,280
from are

565
01:12:20,280 --> 01:12:29,890
RI him

566
01:12:29,890 --> 01:12:31,670
the other I wanna make

567
01:12:31,670 --> 01:13:05,900
the C

568
01:13:05,900 --> 01:13:17,479
and one your

569
01:13:17,479 --> 01:13:19,169
in things seeing

570
01:13:19,169 --> 01:13:29,030
of between

571
01:13:29,030 --> 01:13:58,770
yeah

572
01:13:58,770 --> 01:14:25,120
click them

573
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:32,170
K

574
01:14:32,170 --> 01:14:37,870
C

575
01:14:37,870 --> 01:14:38,330
30

576
01:14:38,330 --> 01:14:43,480
32 was the I'm

577
01:14:43,480 --> 01:14:47,750
to 64 okay so

578
01:14:47,750 --> 01:14:53,230
current position minus

579
01:14:53,230 --> 01:14:56,250
-1

580
01:14:56,250 --> 01:15:03,450
there was still work with

581
01:15:03,450 --> 01:15:11,460
ABC

582
01:15:11,460 --> 01:15:13,290
39 homes to

583
01:15:13,290 --> 01:15:29,920
70

584
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:34,060
first one okay so to them

585
01:15:34,060 --> 01:15:38,910
to 5 okay so that seems to be

586
01:15:38,910 --> 01:15:41,930
you

587
01:15:41,930 --> 01:15:45,120
similar thing and then

588
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:50,180
I he for the

589
01:15:50,180 --> 01:15:53,360
eatn them its T the

590
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:58,170
them 9 but that

591
01:15:58,170 --> 01:16:25,010
EMU more loose from it is 64

592
01:16:25,010 --> 01:16:27,820
point then yeah

593
01:16:27,820 --> 01:16:32,180
okay and its dignity 79

594
01:16:32,180 --> 01:16:35,970
take the 39 times

595
01:16:35,970 --> 01:16:39,040
for would be 26

596
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:42,170
first who

597
01:16:42,170 --> 01:16:46,270
okay so

598
01:16:46,270 --> 01:16:50,400
one algorithm with be and take the base

599
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:57,050
thing

600
01:16:57,050 --> 01:16:58,559
and such strict my current

601
01:16:58,559 --> 01:17:02,420
Mike make and district the base from
that

602
01:17:02,420 --> 01:17:06,139
so tonight next step would

603
01:17:06,139 --> 01:17:18,030
the the to mmm

604
01:17:18,030 --> 01:17:22,980
with the times to minus

605
01:17:22,980 --> 01:17:25,980
oh well okay

606
01:17:25,980 --> 01:17:30,850
at aware on so first that would be first
one would be

607
01:17:30,850 --> 01:17:34,380
the current value minus my beast times

608
01:17:34,380 --> 01:17:38,140
one yeah

609
01:17:38,140 --> 01:17:41,200
class plus the 0 position

610
01:17:41,200 --> 01:17:45,400
so next position would be 79

611
01:17:45,400 --> 01:17:48,630
minus the base Thames

612
01:17:48,630 --> 01:17:53,230
to plus one minus

613
01:17:53,230 --> 01:17:56,910
a topic it's minus 0 the next one would

614
01:17:56,910 --> 01:18:03,440
the 64

615
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:06,650
minus 39 Thames

616
01:18:06,650 --> 01:18:11,770
for much new position -2

617
01:18:11,770 --> 01:18:15,450
okay so that seems to work let's try
this with

618
01:18:15,450 --> 01:18:21,320
another one let's remember these

619
01:18:21,320 --> 01:18:28,800
tips its

620
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:32,070
mines one minus

621
01:18:32,070 --> 01:18:38,880
who its if that still works with
something else

622
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:42,890
so be basis 25 so it's

623
01:18:42,890 --> 01:18:48,220
to five times something 2025

624
01:18:48,220 --> 01:18:52,060
-9 minus the current position 0
obviously works

625
01:18:52,060 --> 01:18:55,400
next step is 5 one

626
01:18:55,400 --> 01:18:58,450
with through -1 is 0

627
01:18:58,450 --> 01:19:05,080
next one

628
01:19:05,080 --> 01:19:05,560
welcome

629
01:19:05,560 --> 01:19:09,470
trip so next month 7

630
01:19:09,470 --> 01:19:12,780
he minus

631
01:19:12,780 --> 01:19:17,720
3 move 95 minus

632
01:19:17,720 --> 01:19:22,260
to own

633
01:19:22,260 --> 01:19:41,940
minus for

634
01:19:41,940 --> 01:19:49,110
24 mom okay

635
01:19:49,110 --> 01:19:52,500
that this incident

636
01:19:52,500 --> 01:20:15,620
work

637
01:20:15,620 --> 01:20:20,210
such a good year thread with

638
01:20:20,210 --> 01:20:24,920
these here these are so a nice with it
so

639
01:20:24,920 --> 01:20:28,790
seven if the base semana 7

640
01:20:28,790 --> 01:20:32,840
0 great 7

641
01:20:32,840 --> 01:20:36,210
times true is 14

642
01:20:36,210 --> 01:20:39,260
the current one is

643
01:20:39,260 --> 01:20:43,510
15 song subtracting that

644
01:20:43,510 --> 01:20:49,690
-1 with the zeros well next step

645
01:20:49,690 --> 01:20:53,370
would the then times

646
01:20:53,370 --> 01:20:56,490
for with 63

647
01:20:56,490 --> 01:20:59,810
minus to which is

648
01:20:59,810 --> 01:21:04,930
wrong

649
01:21:04,930 --> 01:21:10,460
7 mines

650
01:21:10,460 --> 01:21:16,490
want to get 263 somehow

651
01:21:16,490 --> 01:21:37,390
well maybe it's 13 times

652
01:21:37,390 --> 01:21:39,880
160 I'm 13

653
01:21:39,880 --> 01:22:08,070
15

654
01:22:08,070 --> 01:22:16,179
six

655
01:22:16,179 --> 01:22:18,800
three minutes 3

656
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:34,520
three

657
01:22:34,520 --> 01:22:41,050
should not try these with thing

658
01:22:41,050 --> 01:22:48,160
somewhat test cases

659
01:22:48,160 --> 01:22:55,720
and I 12 AZT the

660
01:22:55,720 --> 01:23:51,920
be the the the

661
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:53,250
I M

662
01:23:53,250 --> 01:24:08,560
train left mind

663
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:18,070
miners miners before the number

664
01:24:18,070 --> 01:24:58,239
help

665
01:24:58,239 --> 01:24:58,590
okay

666
01:24:58,590 --> 01:25:02,210
so this is just switched

667
01:25:02,210 --> 01:25:05,900
6027 in reality

668
01:25:05,900 --> 01:25:18,630
so I have to take this into account need
one

669
01:25:18,630 --> 01:25:22,380
yes with the AP

670
01:25:22,380 --> 01:25:32,480
be could just make for tests four tries

671
01:25:32,480 --> 01:26:08,560
for attempt

672
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:09,330
okay so

673
01:26:09,330 --> 01:26:12,670
with turning around

674
01:26:12,670 --> 01:26:22,770
this is weird behavior to me some

675
01:26:22,770 --> 01:27:19,790
and

676
01:27:19,790 --> 01:27:26,420
and another for

677
01:27:26,420 --> 01:27:27,909
got if

678
01:27:27,909 --> 01:27:31,650
its something if changes in the front
chains

679
01:27:31,650 --> 01:27:37,520
staff at the end

680
01:27:37,520 --> 01:29:29,090
and one in the

681
01:29:29,090 --> 01:29:32,730
this is super weird so is confusing me

682
01:29:32,730 --> 01:29:36,660
look at this example for this ABA

683
01:29:36,660 --> 01:29:40,550
if we assume the BS like this 46

684
01:29:40,550 --> 01:29:44,680
in the eighties 223 and if you go in the
next room

685
01:29:44,680 --> 01:29:48,440
its AB turnaround in I would

686
01:29:48,440 --> 01:29:51,670
expected 10

687
01:29:51,670 --> 01:29:55,430
maybe it's not weird

688
01:29:55,430 --> 01:30:01,310
known

689
01:30:01,310 --> 01:30:05,280
of only one apart so maybe just

690
01:30:05,280 --> 01:30:29,880
don't notice

691
01:30:29,880 --> 01:30:33,410
ok im I made this for a reason because
they want to check something

692
01:30:33,410 --> 01:30:36,780
so I am

693
01:30:36,780 --> 01:30:40,410
and generate more

694
01:30:40,410 --> 01:30:46,060
these

695
01:30:46,060 --> 01:30:50,080
and want to see like how much of their
an imitation

696
01:30:50,080 --> 01:30:57,480
changes it up so maybe it's always like
to see is always the same of that or

697
01:30:57,480 --> 01:30:58,150
something

698
01:30:58,150 --> 01:31:02,600
in a can a Tekkit

699
01:31:02,600 --> 01:31:21,889
the that way

700
01:31:21,889 --> 01:31:25,159
oh maybe it's awesome idea to put forth
until it hits

701
01:31:25,159 --> 01:31:28,809
0 mean that takes roughly 12:55

702
01:31:28,809 --> 01:31:32,000
tries but on not even that many

703
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:36,760
on the hollowness of a bit ninety

704
01:31:36,760 --> 01:31:39,889
5 thing no meaning that long

705
01:31:39,889 --> 01:31:43,889
so these up quite close together

706
01:31:43,889 --> 01:31:47,940
so that's what I want to look so the
third to apart

707
01:31:47,940 --> 01:31:51,239
but the 11-month 5 six apart

708
01:31:51,239 --> 01:31:56,239
p it safe

709
01:31:56,239 --> 01:32:00,520
this and I wanna brute force until I
have

710
01:32:00,520 --> 01:32:08,090
there is 0

711
01:32:08,090 --> 01:32:21,940
mmm

712
01:32:21,940 --> 01:32:59,410
I'm true

713
01:32:59,410 --> 01:33:06,710
so do if from the

714
01:33:06,710 --> 01:33:12,110
first are the

715
01:33:12,110 --> 01:33:15,560
first character

716
01:33:15,560 --> 01:33:19,840
in

717
01:33:19,840 --> 01:33:23,190
so if that is you there ABC the

718
01:33:23,190 --> 01:33:26,720
E

719
01:33:26,720 --> 01:33:33,650
a very low character then

720
01:33:33,650 --> 01:34:00,820
sprint

721
01:34:00,820 --> 01:34:09,220
up

722
01:34:09,220 --> 01:34:12,490
the people to that and my

723
01:34:12,490 --> 01:34:22,820
on to I would like to

724
01:34:22,820 --> 01:35:03,180
test 3 will that's why this from now

725
01:35:03,180 --> 01:35:06,390
on the other hand I can equip who

726
01:35:06,390 --> 01:35:10,310
thing no

727
01:35:10,310 --> 01:35:18,269
way

728
01:35:18,269 --> 01:35:21,519
but always wait until same expected
thing

729
01:35:21,519 --> 01:35:29,690
there

730
01:35:29,690 --> 01:35:35,480
one from work all look good

731
01:35:35,480 --> 01:35:56,800
there's one with 0 preagreed

732
01:35:56,800 --> 01:36:00,429
the cool thing is there are some with
the same baby thats

733
01:36:00,429 --> 01:36:03,600
couldn't it this way maybe should

734
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:10,070
wheat

735
01:36:10,070 --> 01:36:24,060
in the expected well

736
01:36:24,060 --> 01:36:28,960
in the

737
01:36:28,960 --> 01:36:46,750
in in from the

738
01:36:46,750 --> 01:36:50,860

three-hour I really want to have a look
at the

743
01:37:14,850 --> 01:37:18,670
T text me so long and so

and get novel elsa didn't have a look at
the river since

750
01:37:41,209 --> 01:37:46,340
one a set thing it's like you had can
never succeed alone

751
01:37:46,340 --> 01:37:49,800
just those channels take so much time
itself

752
01:37:49,800 --> 01:38:18,630
that and didn't even have the time to
look at the other ones

753
01:38:18,630 --> 01:38:20,820
with her no

754
01:38:20,820 --> 01:38:23,970
this will provide were the forcing

755
01:38:23,970 --> 01:38:27,400
cause

756
01:38:27,400 --> 01:38:32,840
do think it takes age isn't it even gets
one of these

757
01:38:32,840 --> 01:38:39,370
lower ones s into a few other things and
