I wanna

50
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:35,400
maker breakpoint in

51
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:40,000
okay

52
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,490
away me to tell you something so ever
looked around again

53
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:48,540
and and

54
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:51,810
remember from yesterday that insists
certain

55
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:55,590
admin or something we can get this third
menu option

56
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:58,690
and its checked if that it said

57
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:02,760
and if it said it causes when whatever's
it that's been fashioned us but I don't

58
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,120
know

59
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,560
but have let their own witnesses said

60
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,639
and notice that this is actually

61
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:14,899
said here

62
00:07:14,899 --> 00:07:19,259
and so if I can get into this one

63
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:22,459
I can't edit the promise just that

64
00:07:22,459 --> 00:07:27,379
there is this check X-ers thing and that

65
00:07:27,379 --> 00:07:31,059
checks the time the current time

66
00:07:31,059 --> 00:07:38,129
if it's between a certain

67
00:07:38,129 --> 00:07:41,819
time in there will

68
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:49,049
feel but it got

69
00:07:49,049 --> 00:07:53,559
if you look where time is used you see
that

70
00:07:53,559 --> 00:07:57,289
the time it said

71
00:07:57,289 --> 00:08:00,289
in a certain place in the time

72
00:08:00,289 --> 00:08:03,729
said to the up to a to a buffer

73
00:08:03,729 --> 00:08:09,779
in the spot for is red and this happens

74
00:08:09,779 --> 00:08:13,079
in the a.m. paymer thing

75
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:18,139
and I'm not sure if it's at that time I
think like did

76
00:08:18,139 --> 00:08:21,779
day signal handler or something a.m.

77
00:08:21,779 --> 00:08:24,929
so if

78
00:08:24,929 --> 00:08:28,399
if you wait too long if the steak if you
look

79
00:08:28,399 --> 00:09:06,240
year there this wait where's the
increment 1

80
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,209
at their it will

81
00:09:09,209 --> 00:09:12,690
incremented by one and

82
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:16,300
name who compares the lolol

83
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:20,139
5 below five will continue here for tire
the five to get this error that

84
00:09:20,139 --> 00:09:25,209
another assortment detected good I think
this is of what we have here

85
00:09:25,209 --> 00:09:32,560
continue now this is what you should get

86
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:36,180
and

87
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:39,279
have but the if that's not true it will

88
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:43,350
chick the input not true just exactly
where the simple to set

89
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:46,670
but if it's like ever

90
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:50,500
F time or text not responding so

91
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:57,759
you his word so I'm gonna try to

92
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:00,870
send no the for

93
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:04,810
F and see if I can get the time worker
not responding

94
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:22,210
so

95
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:37,070
I'm gonna sand

96
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:43,030

and I think capital a own

135
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:51,950
dead the game field other spaces and

136
00:15:51,950 --> 00:16:02,390
days the angels

140
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:20,520
lead said

141
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:24,460
yea X who that value on

142
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:30,500
with what will happen so

143
00:16:30,500 --> 00:17:08,660
now consist of with this one value is
said

144
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:08,990
in

145
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:12,230
