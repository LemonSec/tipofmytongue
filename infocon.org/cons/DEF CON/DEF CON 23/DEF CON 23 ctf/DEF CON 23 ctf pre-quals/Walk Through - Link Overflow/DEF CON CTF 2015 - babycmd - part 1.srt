6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,789
available yet

7
00:00:18,789 --> 00:00:22,330
ISO let's get started with the first one

8
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:26,119
so called baby command

9
00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:29,250
K

10
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:34,630

11
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:39,280
looks like this server all

12
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:44,760
or 21 for for now one yeah

13
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:49,120
that looks like did also lets check out

that is

15
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:55,789
64-bit Linux thing okay

16
00:00:55,789 --> 00:01:01,620
so let's see what with Kaman up there

17
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:09,750
their help with something no paying

18
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,410
so I pursue miss will be

19
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:14,420
for them this will be like I am

20
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:20,560
the

21
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:26,510
this will be like a limited shell some

22
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:31,790
shower to escalate 11 shelter for show
or something

23
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:41,150
so holes okay

24
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:45,009
okay so I'll thats throw the

25
00:01:45,009 --> 00:01:48,670
binary and upper let's have a look at it

26
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:52,540
and have a Linux p.m. Pacific a bit
right now

27
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:55,759
I my have to install that

28
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:08,580
really quick

29
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:11,700
okay that's very nice with a 15

30
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:23,010
with the words and more it seems
chocolates that's

31
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:31,970
to them and all that stuff maybe know
that this up

32
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:36,410
Lee okay

33
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:43,820
want us to you should also do a string

34
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:47,390
just you know not that wheel with

35
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:51,490
see something to a close pewter

36
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:54,920
thing create this is how the increment
looks like

37
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:58,170
that's what the complex wonder can you
do

38
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:22,489
or less

39
00:03:22,489 --> 00:03:26,060
0 a good too long closing is this just
time were so

40
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:29,650
for 20 belet bronco

41
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:46,010
this the closing this is too long time
are sore

42
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:49,940
okay so

43
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:52,100
let's have a look on these commands are
executed

44
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:59,819
right so

45
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:09,230
was with leave

46
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:20,209
ok

47
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:22,830
and 10 I sometimes but there are
references

48
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:26,000
why appeal

49
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,669
buying way

50
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:33,639
copperfield displaying them also this
also

51
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:44,820
like

52
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:54,530
no

53
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:57,060
okay so the field looks like our

54
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:01,819
shell input so to look at this

55
00:05:01,819 --> 00:05:13,040
first

56
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:17,190
ok

57
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:29,789
called looks a bit your yes and one

58
00:05:29,789 --> 00:05:33,659
who would be nice to be back this

59
00:05:33,659 --> 00:05:36,830
also what's up theater sys thats

60
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:53,170
very small

61
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:53,530
okay

62
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:57,370
so let's have a look where the comment
executed so that's

63
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:00,690
find Exchequer pro

64
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:16,600
no only system

65
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:22,020
want to be at PO I think ok so

66
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:27,860
three different calls for all three
different monster pursuing

67
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:48,790
good year except everything is a little
bit weird

68
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:51,480
okay so know if the specified

69
00:06:51,480 --> 00:07:01,890
pose takes so I assume this

70
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:05,240
then being

71
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,680
this who

72
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:38,540
the pain

73
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:41,540
okay we're idea was

74
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:52,889
ordered for

75
00:07:52,889 --> 00:08:23,530
way this is also send to d

76
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:28,940
okay let's the 20p open because that is
we have to backtrack from that so

77
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:34,240
let's go to I'm pursuing this is then

78
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:59,870
holes

79
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:02,920
I was host calling dick Adam

80
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:06,480
them okay anyway let's

81
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,960
go to the king and its work from there
ok

82
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:13,870
so chief of alexis by the three pretty

83
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:17,220
I am okay songwriter specified

84
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:21,180
fine wish have to check on what this is
doing

85
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:26,260
its taking an cool

86
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:32,630
okay so

87
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:36,750
guys probably testing if it's a valid IP
address

88
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:44,300
okay then

89
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:49,470
its at testing it again this time with
the

90
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:52,990
real at the function

91
00:09:52,990 --> 00:10:05,460
unit at risk to number

92
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:08,470
then sprint into the on and

93
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:13,160
able open that and execution

94
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:17,510
re input okay that's that's cool

95
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:21,690
and the question would be: to select
difficult

96
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:24,950
bypass these two things for now the TIF
for

97
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:34,990
all the if this is the same for all
three

98
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:39,510
okay this looks a bit different

99
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:51,720
so

100
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:57,550
K

101
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:01,459
exactly

102
00:11:01,459 --> 00:11:06,800
okay so

103
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,069
was the same as before sup

104
00:11:09,069 --> 00:11:18,730
the six 5

105
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:22,029
okay that's a check out this function
first cartha

106
00:11:22,029 --> 00:11:32,780
and in for

107
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:41,760
hopper where you make me so angry

108
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,120
okay so a my sis

109
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:50,710
it gets the for

110
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:57,430
first so quite expect into true I
thought it would put in the

111
00:11:57,430 --> 00:12:00,510
would get the

112
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:06,180
well Rd Mon

113
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:14,040
paying 00 it's probably the address
where the the location where the

114
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:17,200
IP address of those store in okay

115
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:28,770
and are with us closer

116
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:38,940
key home

117
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:49,300
cocaine interesting

118
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:54,010
own with checking ticking elem then

119
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:57,820
from them okay

120
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:02,100
well what that's what happens if

121
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:08,600
input lot of character I don't really
know what lecter the correct approach

122
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,370
here

123
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:15,460
for now if I am if you should reverse in

124
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:18,470
the social should just play around
because something simple

125
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:22,360
okay the seems to crash okay maybe it's
a simple powerful I think any

126
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:26,080
I wanna quickly a set up the VMN test
this out
