1
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:04,299
okay so accounting

2
00:00:04,299 --> 00:00:08,950
I'm continuing with the baby's first

3
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:13,090
command challenge

4
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:17,020
so and that there aren't a little bit
more

5
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:21,570
in 90 and hopper with it and

6
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:24,609
I decided to so

7
00:00:24,609 --> 00:00:27,910
mean it seems like I want to inject the
common right

8
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:32,200
breakout Oct of the thing am 25 EP open
so

9
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:37,000
if here if if it's copied into the
string

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,040
arm here I wanna it like colon and
something else

11
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:46,620
the problem is to get there in the first
place I have to bypass

12
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:50,610
certain certain

13
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:53,770
checks for example no the

14
00:00:53,770 --> 00:01:03,550
than one well in this case that's paying
their

15
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:07,430
no

16
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:11,310
the ping for example has to follow the s

17
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:15,270
has to be a valid IP address while

18
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:18,400
a.m. the other months here

19
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,450
for example in

20
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:24,770
in host yes as

21
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:28,119
the different because you also can put
in

22
00:01:28,119 --> 00:01:31,430
domain name into and their

23
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:34,670
nearest this one check

24
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:39,220
take that that stops you from doing
something so

25
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:44,610
I wanna analyzed the

26
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:49,890
these the another check function well
I've called it an honor

27
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:53,799
track and what I detest a loaded in

28
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:59,270
in anti-tb

29
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:03,450
and it s is are so I disabled

30
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:07,590
Acer are and now to find the correct
address

31
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:11,019
a.m. I A I a.m.

32
00:02:11,019 --> 00:02:14,050
make the ping command and

33
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:17,989
with cum control CDI

34
00:02:17,989 --> 00:02:21,660
I but

35
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:25,180
control back and then I can

36
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:28,220
go victory agency where it was coming
from

37
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:31,690
and so if you look at the code and
compare it

38
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:36,590
you will see that this is the
babysitters he basically here

39
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:40,560
and pick their can go wherever I want
son this case is

40
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,480
DCCC so me verify this week

41
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,620
3 the CC ima

42
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:51,820
gets

43
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:54,959
the your that that's probably

44
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,000
yeah -1 okay so that's the thing for

45
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,310
it's a check so I will break your no for
the breakpoint

46
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:06,780
I we start the program i'd

47
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:17,379
cannot answer

48
00:03:17,379 --> 00:03:17,970
kate del

49
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:24,730
5

50
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:26,590
through their damn

51
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:52,960
way I thought I disabled are here this
is

52
00:03:52,960 --> 00:04:14,230
mmm

53
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:24,540
or this ably as of hoops

54
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:29,850
so I guess I wanna set this to on team

55
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:45,180
free

56
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:57,650
3 he's the

57
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:59,070
more in

58
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:05,260
and then at sea

59
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:11,970
so there's this

60
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:16,210
think pair

61
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:20,380
nested in multiple places office you
something to do with

62
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:53,140
pain but okay so here's an example 13

63
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:58,400
okay so this is one of the com- so if
this

64
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:06,450
and we run the same at least okay look
later okay then

65
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:10,790
minutes go from here so unit at 2n

66
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:14,290
into ASO the also one of the come on

67
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:17,700
so which one

68
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:22,380
is 8

69
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:27,910
and and two so this the I'll

70
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:31,480
the other same 82 and in Tokyo well

71
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:45,710
on

72
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:48,500
okay so that's for example that the
common okay so

73
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:52,840
if thats dig then after that

74
00:06:52,840 --> 00:07:00,170
somewhere come so that should be here

75
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:09,420
the so that its host okay cool

76
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:16,480
so lead re

77
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:19,790
starred

78
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:24,050
and

79
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:30,030
its take notes coleman

80
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:37,280
d is the San no

81
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:45,240
host host muscles

82
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,780
okay so I got a break point there

83
00:07:46,780 --> 00:08:08,530
nice

84
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:19,430
them

85
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:22,310
mitzi with the call today

86
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:28,669
wanna scheck loop

87
00:08:28,669 --> 00:08:32,430
law were free

88
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:40,149
far away K and sick because

89
00:08:40,149 --> 00:08:43,669
ports puts is the first own

90
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:49,360
unit and I think it was after that to
and stuff and

91
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,209
into print shape and then after that

92
00:08:53,209 --> 00:08:56,579
and okay so

93
00:08:56,579 --> 00:09:00,519
at DCC okay cool that is actually the
okay so

94
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:04,010
no 9 base address to at st. okay

95
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:16,249
great so it's 3 there

96
00:09:16,249 --> 00:09:22,269
continue

97
00:09:22,269 --> 00:09:27,509
dams alarm okay

98
00:09:27,509 --> 00:09:34,490
let's that's makes them think so.
characters be

99
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:39,259
should be fine number should be fine

100
00:09:39,259 --> 00:09:42,430
and its see how how it is behaving with

101
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:46,079
certain special characters okay

102
00:09:46,079 --> 00:09:55,480
so I'm breakpoint and 3.6 they want to
go to brew princess okay so it

103
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:59,360
field already earlier probably with the
previous

104
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,550
check so mission a break point the
previous check

105
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:06,610
yes well words

106
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:22,440

well

110
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:49,530
no thats expect today

111

65 for whenever indifference

116
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:15,710
went off by one we're analytic note 6

117
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:18,980
the 60 okay cool break point there well

118
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:21,990
continuing to

119
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:28,070
alarm we have to to save the on

120
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:33,140
the voters from me a picture that way

121
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:36,980
okay so no we r

122
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:40,790
in no further yeah so

123
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:44,560
the weekend no data well we don't

124
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:53,360
what's wrong

125
00:11:53,360 --> 00:12:00,639
right my get the

126
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:39,080
this isn't the in here well

127
00:12:39,080 --> 00:13:01,839
so 16

128
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:02,850
yet met ok

129
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:13,190
them

130
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:16,620
will look nicer to some

131
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:19,750
the chrome and free and

132
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:23,400
run free for

133
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:26,600
at break point there

134
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:30,740
continue mmm to

135
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:40,290
great okay

136
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:48,400
so sing-off single stepping 0

137
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:52,750
that to be in it seems to be on or
32-bit

138
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:59,560
in well anyway okay so

139
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:02,860
let's have TV nice fuel

140
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:13,060
year

141
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,889
the nine me

142
00:14:15,889 --> 00:14:29,809
well that we start this again and

143
00:14:29,809 --> 00:14:31,910
so important characters from

144
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:35,430
with be hi

145
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:38,790
I

146
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:43,730
colon and mmm

147
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:47,329
possibly are

148
00:14:47,329 --> 00:14:50,899
and braces so that see

149
00:14:50,899 --> 00:14:56,029
key

150
00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:58,680
test

151
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:02,440
6 he we are continuing so we are
comparing

152
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,870
if it's species its not us

153
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:11,029
be so we will discontinue in

154
00:15:11,029 --> 00:15:14,820
the when you know

155
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:18,470
always the salon good again

156
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:24,550
busty tranny yet too long closing

157
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:38,690
okay I'm gonna

158
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:46,890
mmm

159
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:51,630
cases sixty-year com

160
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:54,860
T so compare if it's these

161
00:15:54,860 --> 00:16:02,160
okay so

162
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,420
tum also lost space

163
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:09,230
up maybe every common sense in space
okay by good

164
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:16,090
goes down there and this is just d9

165
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:21,840
when

166
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:25,160
the 9 the so this is just

167
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:28,550
and I'm ninety yeah okay this is

168
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:32,000
hitting one testing again

169
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,060
jumping opinion okay so

170
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:41,740
next character is the personal a can
continue their nothing

171
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:46,200
excited about that and know a few more

172
00:16:46,200 --> 00:17:03,630
a now comes the one

173
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:06,750
harry wants to know okie

174
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:14,560
3e two or three you can

175
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:17,100
and that's the path to market so let's
see that that

176
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:20,560
that's going to be more interesting so
we are in

177
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:25,750
the 83 look at the Wii up

178
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:29,300
up there again to be notice

179
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:34,210
the so

180
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:37,610
put it then EC excess well

181
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:41,120
know we'll some

182
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:58,260
from value there

183
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,210
ok we understand

184
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:03,990
and then we compared the you know one

185
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:12,250
minus twain's

186
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:15,950
thanks no

187
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:26,500
from okay so X is

188
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,650
okay so we obstruct 26 from 3

189
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:42,250
year

190
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:44,669
schisms bison 18

191
00:18:44,669 --> 00:18:47,799
business-like lewd had I without

192
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:52,570
the okay so that's I see okie so we
subtract when

193
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:56,190
26 once the 38

194
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:59,919
and then we compare

195
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:03,309
its one

196
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:08,690
some below equal I'll

197
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:12,740
wanna stick character its

198
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:27,390
and

199
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:40,480
make a quick mine

200
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,960
so it includes

201
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:47,429
the new

202
00:19:47,429 --> 00:19:52,630
and some Louis okay so including

203
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:55,929
linsell

204
00:19:55,929 --> 00:20:05,149
so

205
00:20:05,149 --> 00:20:08,750
it's comparing two one so if Rafti

206
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:17,590
character backsplash and I

207
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:26,399
substrate 26 from it

208
00:20:26,399 --> 00:20:29,350
oh no into texas its them

209
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:35,139
this okay that's one so that

210
00:20:35,139 --> 00:20:42,649
also failed okay so knees are basically
not

211
00:20:42,649 --> 00:20:46,950
allowed a guest so that is not what we
hid

212
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:50,259
jump below it was so we would just
continue

213
00:20:50,259 --> 00:20:53,950
in seventy in seventy

214
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:57,809
now would compare hell 27

215
00:20:57,809 --> 00:21:04,549
C

216
00:21:04,549 --> 00:21:06,950
so we take if it's a hi it's also not a

217
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:14,679
hi keno

218
00:21:14,679 --> 00:21:21,980
tested a star also known as

219
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:28,919
star then

220
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:31,940
move young the

221
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:36,330
thanks we and this with

222
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:40,350
if the and we comb

223
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:43,480
hair its

224
00:21:43,480 --> 00:22:04,470
21

225
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:04,919
I

226
00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:11,380
with mascara have the so

227
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:15,870
ft with my last the second on me

228
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:20,950
raising second did way probably

229
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:24,659
has some sense with I don't know

230
00:22:24,659 --> 00:22:27,909
no I don't know what the census okay

231
00:22:27,909 --> 00:22:33,990
me

232
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:39,730

yes well

234
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:59,700
okay so

235
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:02,390
wat 21 doesn't have it set

236
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:05,580
so 21 and 23

237
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:10,480
would be the same somewhat characters on
those 21

238
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:15,260
okay %ah hash

239
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:19,340
being has learned a lot okie also meant
that

240
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:22,860
so we continue

241
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:40,230
now we're subjecting 3 a from it

242
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:48,690
home aid only txt it so that's

243
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:53,240
for and we

244
00:23:53,240 --> 00:24:06,850
come okay so

245
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:07,180
so

246
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:10,960
basically 31 I'll

247
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:15,780
its three 3 p.m. 3

okay so its

251
00:24:34,529 --> 00:24:37,740
so from beginning from there if it would

252
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:52,750
the lower than that

253
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:56,290
lower than 3 he okay so

254

can we can this awesome

255
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,580
that anything for year including

256
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:07,320
three it's not known

257
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:10,620
know when sense have their numbers nurse
well

258
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:18,660
them these would not be alone

259
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:33,620
number should be in the election him

feel okay at work I will check that
again with

265
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:57,980
with a number in a second like below

266
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:01,960
equal I'll the sub full over low for

267
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:07,210
know it and okay continue we'll check
with that one of these law

268
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:12,500
well use in a second for example could
be interesting

269
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:17,639
against the and it's very important for
us hmm

270
00:26:17,639 --> 00:26:20,760
okay so we compare that

271
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:24,230
its not be low so it will not some out
there

272
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:27,690
now

273
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:44,070
we

274
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:47,540
case that this our destination thing so
it will not copy

275
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:50,950
our character in there

276
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:54,030
so this character the

277
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:57,640

now it's a

304
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:30,410
we have subjected 3 a from

305
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:33,910
EC X and now its negative yeah on its
fine

306
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:39,960
know we compare I'm past the hour

307
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:43,120
one and all its the jump

this not taken gym

309
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:50,499
you know equal

310
00:29:50,499 --> 00:29:55,600
so is it because of the overflow that
its your afflict okay

311
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,409
well because they don't understand the
temblor too well

312
00:29:59,409 --> 00:30:02,570
I would have expected just feel by
doesn't okay

313

00:30:05,649 --> 00:30:10,360
test but see if our and passes that
would be interesting

382
00:36:56,430 --> 00:37:01,640
so what is happening here that's the

383
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:05,730
I am Rs

so he's I'll strength and

387
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:27,730
knowing FF

388
00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:38,140
timer TD for a bit so we execute that we
have no -1

389
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:41,900
in in RCX and no we do this

390
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:45,980
gain things probably is haunting

391
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:49,400
as konting backwards

392
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:55,920
no knowing

393
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:59,190
F the

394
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:05,030
is 1

395
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:07,440
I okay so it's cutting backwards

396
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:14,780
and and 57

397
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:17,950
aid and a young one

398
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:22,319
me many characters wasn't

399
00:38:22,319 --> 00:38:26,530
to for 567 in seara made aid

400
00:38:26,530 --> 00:38:30,980
okay great so that counted no the amount
of characters

401
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:34,079
and RC X and they are

402
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:37,730
not a pizza we have eight characters

403
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:41,000
great so then we

404
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,960
have strict one because that is because
it is your affiant

405
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,980
from

406
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:58,420
finance apps correct more

407
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:02,470
yeah X the wrong and then compare

408
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:13,680
if it's threes C

409
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:16,720
no sixty okay 64 okayed checks if

410
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:24,880
our thing is smaller than 64 it's not so
we continue

411
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:28,520
know we get the first character in here

412
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:31,700
X we awesome put it in

413
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:37,260
dcx sorry

414
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:40,290
then we

415
00:39:40,290 --> 00:39:46,060
mask it again

416
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:51,880
it didn't change anything

417
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:56,590
with abstract for one know it's your own

418
00:39:56,590 --> 00:39:59,860
we compare who 19

419
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:07,830
team so okay so

420
00:40:07,830 --> 00:40:11,060
it basic checks for capital letters I
see

421
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:14,460
I see it okay so fire for example

422
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:20,120
act have a capital

423
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:23,360
Amy in a mass kids

424
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:26,460
I mean

425
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:29,710

00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:46,049
a.m. a small

429
00:40:46,049 --> 00:40:50,309
a it's also for one kind of the mosque
in the neck and subject for one

430
00:40:50,309 --> 00:40:54,880
and check if it so it checks if it's a
character so

431
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:58,140
you dead is the lower that value so

432
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:01,640
if it is a character and then

433
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:07,079
temple

434
00:41:07,079 --> 00:41:15,869
jumps over the checks are mmm

435
00:41:15,869 --> 00:41:20,240
in ED excellent with me X

436
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:24,059
is that the next character when

437
00:41:24,059 --> 00:41:47,720
1

438
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:52,360
okay then it's minus

439
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:56,590
who what I I'm expecting but okay let's
continue

440
00:41:56,590 --> 00:42:00,420
we are in 15

441
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:06,850
removed the thanks into EC

442
00:42:06,850 --> 00:42:10,340
thanks we must do it again

443
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:16,000
we suspect for one we

444
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:32,430
money banks and now we come an hour

445
00:42:32,430 --> 00:42:35,310
%uh okay Tempe low equal

446
00:42:35,310 --> 00:42:50,010
its it's not be low so it will continue
but it doesn't matter because you

447
00:42:50,010 --> 00:42:53,290
compare

448
00:42:53,290 --> 00:43:02,780
wuz oh wait this is

449
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:13,090
only checking first return

450
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:16,109
so am to the

451
00:43:16,109 --> 00:43:19,340
said be yet okie

452
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:23,270
recent that in them

453
00:43:23,270 --> 00:43:26,470
return and I think it will run properly

454
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:30,390
so I didn't to this

455
00:43:30,390 --> 00:43:37,000
you from so it seems like it's only
checking the first character

456
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:55,610
minutes with me

457
00:43:55,610 --> 00:43:56,600
61

458
00:43:56,600 --> 00:44:00,730
I know it could in Minto steinway

459
00:44:00,730 --> 00:44:04,650
on has to be one document check and he
would turn

460
00:44:04,650 --> 00:44:08,369
how the return value is checked some

461
00:44:08,369 --> 00:44:13,860
not equal hours so

462
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:17,940
if it 0 damn okay don't want this to be
said

463
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:22,790
so okay

464
00:44:22,790 --> 00:44:27,760
that's run this again and this time we
on the print and the special character

465
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:32,990
with bennett dust check on the

466
00:44:32,990 --> 00:44:46,720
first on writing

467
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:51,329
I hate this before than any three
character they don't exactly know why

468
00:44:51,329 --> 00:44:51,799
but

469
00:44:51,799 --> 00:44:55,490
okie the federal d he and then ID

470
00:44:55,490 --> 00:45:02,089
and okay

471
00:45:02,089 --> 00:45:05,950
so so let's just tried recruitment only
big-name

472
00:45:05,950 --> 00:45:17,320
we are in CC

473
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:19,030
parent

474
00:45:19,030 --> 00:45:23,900
UK and 6

475
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:28,520
a continue so

476
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:33,330
see air from minus one week on

477
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:38,150
we have four characters recessing I okay
the check if we have four characters

478
00:45:38,150 --> 00:45:38,570
that is

479
00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:43,120
so F one does not taken

480
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:49,750
you note the first character which 6 one
and reduced

481
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:55,220
to mmm you do the math

482
00:45:55,220 --> 00:46:00,810
and checking again who to

483
00:46:00,810 --> 00:46:04,050
to become

484
00:46:04,050 --> 00:46:07,090
pair its

485
00:46:07,090 --> 00:46:11,930
lou 19 with CL

486
00:46:11,930 --> 00:46:19,020
which is true the

487
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:22,240
time again

488
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:25,320
so jump you know no we

489
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:30,270
what him only hospital so

490
00:46:30,270 --> 00:46:34,260
Wade twice

491
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:36,090
feisty in on

492
00:46:36,090 --> 00:46:42,530
oil

493
00:46:42,530 --> 00:46:46,170
wanna know it was allotted return 1
didn't run into this year

494
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:50,390
okay great so if I do think

495
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:53,950
any with ID

496
00:46:53,950 --> 00:47:01,609
like them UNCC

497
00:47:01,609 --> 00:47:09,780
TCS so we have countered

498
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:14,510
the characters 9 so that passed the test

499
00:47:14,510 --> 00:47:18,880
one f3 latif is characterised 61

500
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:23,270
and no it should also pass on the test
shouldn't

501
00:47:23,270 --> 00:47:27,000
and

502
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,700
to true 27

503
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:34,030
know why why what would happen what

504
00:47:34,030 --> 00:47:50,930
why did not pass it now

505
00:47:50,930 --> 00:47:51,340
mister

506
00:47:51,340 --> 00:48:00,460
again any

507
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:05,570
why is this happening so it goes into
