1
00:00:01,189 --> 00:00:03,600
okay so by almost all of that

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:09,410
I am so parents Rick here that it's
because of the non excludable

3
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:13,490
a flag couldn't find any

4
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:16,590
compile option for that so I have to
research that another time

5
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:22,119
but as always just look at charcoal a
test of people wrote

6
00:00:22,119 --> 00:00:25,180
and is an example of how from

7
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:30,740
the

8
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:34,020
here a example shower corner shelf some

9
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:39,010
and medicine memory make paying a
section

10
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:42,710
so that is executed well

11
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:46,789
quickly check I think I have to use a
different

12
00:00:46,789 --> 00:00:50,010
I S is that the size okay that's the
size shape so

13
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:56,780
have to make that quite bigger mmm

14
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:59,800
and pic let's make this s

15
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:04,799
big as the previous with is that

16
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,710
the address mm address the key cool
let's

17
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:12,250
use actually address where it was

18
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:15,830
before maybe that's working that would
be pretty cool

19
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:18,930
I a suspect that some that bone will not
work but

20
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:29,040
okay and

21
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:29,509
size

22
00:01:29,509 --> 00:01:35,740
code

23
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:38,869
key

24
00:01:38,869 --> 00:02:06,219
see what what that's doing mmm

25
00:02:06,219 --> 00:02:10,629
poet what does it mean

26
00:02:10,629 --> 00:02:13,900
wonderful at and one white pointer

27
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:23,990
an example

28
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:43,099
mmm

29
00:02:43,099 --> 00:02:45,239
well okay that's a definite thats

30
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:48,560
from make this just

31
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,829
that the sand you i mean it's

32
00:02:51,829 --> 00:02:55,599
its a relative offset and the relative
of said

33
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:59,209
should the 0 ones

34
00:02:59,209 --> 00:03:02,620
c0 so let's just make this

35
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:05,900
bigger than that so let's make this

36
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:09,060
Anna 20 that's fun

37
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:12,769
and then we just have to

38
00:03:12,769 --> 00:03:16,849
make this quite long

39
00:03:16,849 --> 00:03:34,830
not mmm

40
00:03:34,830 --> 00:04:10,720
with effort to generate mmm

41
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,879
K

42
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:17,870
and then mm size of Coldwell

43
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:41,869
we want to make some money could be that
much so TV

44
00:04:41,869 --> 00:04:47,559
some russians

45
00:04:47,559 --> 00:04:50,740
run it receive segment reason for

46
00:04:50,740 --> 00:05:01,379
so

47
00:05:01,379 --> 00:05:05,389
menace pointing somewhere see

48
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:12,699
what we get from this position here are

49
00:05:12,699 --> 00:05:16,059
I one

50
00:05:16,059 --> 00:05:20,139
be he the rust

51
00:05:20,139 --> 00:05:23,959
to see rose I guess it's much

52
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:31,430
there

53
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:35,160
so they stop here and where did point to
8.2

54
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:39,000
through 7

55
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,580
true twin to to well we almost reached
its

56
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:48,180
who we'd

57
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:57,270
for

58
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:59,470
it stopped there well stop there

59
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:03,090
01 F our thats the two small

60
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:38,409
me three

61
00:06:38,409 --> 00:06:38,839
the

62
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:42,330
okay but I'm how convenient for this
control with

63
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:50,490
arnd that's cool well this one actually
pretty logical

64
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:57,129
to because earlier this more but anyway
okay I can place you may register

65
00:06:57,129 --> 00:07:02,919
and then they should

66
00:07:02,919 --> 00:07:06,159
it said continuing it exits normally

67
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:09,399
okay great so let me at prin no

68
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:20,880
and this

69
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,780
what was the output than wanna

70
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:26,169
this pope

71
00:07:26,169 --> 00:07:36,870
somewhere

72
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:39,150
are X equals mmm

73
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:44,310
okay and know that would be a

74
00:07:44,310 --> 00:08:39,820
hine mmm

75
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:49,360
131 point earned their

76
00:08:49,360 --> 00:09:17,959
it's working

77
00:09:17,959 --> 00:09:18,980
dement on my

78
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:26,590
like that

79
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:35,470
knowing the reference then

80
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:52,679
then it in happened to magic

81
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:55,519
I guess it should the pointer to their

82
00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:00,709
in this on

83
00:10:00,709 --> 00:10:45,579
type void and i wanna past long

84
00:10:45,579 --> 00:10:56,570
manager get this value on the back

85
00:10:56,570 --> 00:11:02,560
yes okay

86
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:12,799
I think you should remove here

87
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:21,880
in random

88
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,389
well that seems like the address a kid
that's random

89
00:11:24,389 --> 00:12:13,640
fine again

90
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:20,089
okay so

91
00:12:20,089 --> 00:12:23,369
now I want the reference that with

92
00:12:23,369 --> 00:12:33,800
the working in

93
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:53,550
minded by thing

94
00:12:53,550 --> 00:13:02,220
come on and just want to ha my gosh I'm

95
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:10,050
am desert so intense

96
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:18,420
paid again

97
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:19,370
RBX

98
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:27,060
RCA Rd

99
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:30,780

14 are 15 and

105
00:13:48,540 --> 00:14:14,600
times

106
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,410
that looks great

107
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:19,400
I am with

00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:27,130
said you know okay

109
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:37,230
I'm anxious so let me

110
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:40,339
so if I have make a test

111
00:14:40,339 --> 00:14:43,660
with with the example he said

112
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:48,240
here want this string

113
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:54,580
year

114
00:14:54,580 --> 00:15:00,850
probably the other way around 6 6 3

115
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:06,730
with me the

116
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:13,850
6 said

117
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:18,600
39

118

33

119
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:27,080
and 99 and thats one

120
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:30,270
to the for 5 67

121
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:34,660
eight long and then 15

122
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:39,800
89 10 11 12 13 14 for

123

mmm

124
00:15:55,770 --> 00:16:13,959
rain

125
00:16:13,959 --> 00:16:30,100
hidden

126
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:36,100
okay dement

127
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:41,199
in it make this 1

128
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:44,250
89 tenement 13-14

129

okay okay them

130
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:57,860
in the middle

131
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:01,670
have to and for

132
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:12,789
column

133
00:17:12,789 --> 00:17:17,329
mines 99

134
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:20,659
3 awesome okay so that was test

135
00:17:20,659 --> 00:17:24,720
1 and now I also need to copy this in
between

136
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,809
so 16

137
00:17:28,809 --> 00:18:10,379
that nine

138
00:18:10,379 --> 00:18:15,600
ninth so from

139
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,610
fire lines

140
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:19,710
way tool for

141
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:25,250
fine for

142
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:28,750
one their

143
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:33,510
its ok mathematician

144
00:18:33,510 --> 00:19:13,220
okay GB

145
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:22,750
home

146
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:58,789
that were the code looks like that would
be

147
00:19:58,789 --> 00:20:12,830
well shit

148
00:20:12,830 --> 00:21:08,390
that would be pretty shabby

149
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:11,890
old should that any

150
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:41,740
obvious the 26 them

151
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:45,820
park

152
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:48,919
oh wait no no then these

153
00:21:48,919 --> 00:21:52,120
space and new line that is from the

154
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:55,549
are and select happen okay

155
00:21:55,549 --> 00:22:11,620

stuff crazy cool I am

158
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:36,390
then it's book The together so

159
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:41,260
Nazi fakin ended this binary in

160
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:46,870
executed mmm mind

161
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:50,970
in

162
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:56,090
make this is the

163
00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:59,450
again and in

164
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:05,560
trees okay cool

165
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:11,330
so I am see %uh them

166
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:44,460
multiple the season yes

167
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:50,720
okay

168
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,880
so what I'm doing now I

169
00:23:53,880 --> 00:24:01,409
open the assembler I'll read it

170
00:24:01,409 --> 00:24:07,750
complete mmm arm

171
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:08,450
mind

172
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:40,580
in

173
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:50,010
cool so

174
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:54,000
so there's an mine

175
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,299
now I said correct 1 yes

176
00:24:57,299 --> 00:25:01,640
great okay so that is assembler code

177
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:08,029
binary not

178
00:25:08,029 --> 00:25:13,309
I at this location so new binary

179
00:25:13,309 --> 00:25:17,159
is said binary until

180
00:25:17,159 --> 00:25:21,289
me Knox starred then comes

181
00:25:21,289 --> 00:25:25,750
us am and then binary

182
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:28,760
knobs class

183
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:33,620
Len of ass and code and we

184
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:38,360
0

185
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:43,760
mmm and hour

186
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:48,040
right right you

187
00:25:48,040 --> 00:26:10,190
binary okay test

188
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:11,400
meh on of

189
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:17,140
dement hoops

190
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:26,820
that is obviously there

191
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:33,730
call that seems to work in tho that code

192
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:38,660
didn't seem to done

193
00:26:38,660 --> 00:28:32,059
in

194
00:28:32,059 --> 00:28:52,799
both

195
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:53,299
for

196
00:28:53,299 --> 00:29:16,360
nixon

197
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,440
our I know it's doesn't fit

198
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:25,570
because that is you would see that still
work because it's not 16th

199
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:29,140
15 India its and 21

200
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:37,919
but it still working great okay so

201
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:41,169
that's nice

202
00:29:41,169 --> 00:29:46,260
great so now I just have to be

203
00:29:46,260 --> 00:30:20,330
to king

204
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:23,640
that's them look at this

205
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:51,870
Holden Harper

206
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:57,130
code seems to be

207
00:30:57,130 --> 00:31:00,460
in there well as the return at the end

208
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:04,810
on a c3 okay so it's returning before I
could write back

209
00:31:04,810 --> 00:31:08,070
the stuff so

210
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:13,880
let's cut the last one

211
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:23,230
year

212
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:23,790
leave

213
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:32,330
hard words

214
00:31:32,330 --> 00:32:23,090
could doesn't seem to work every time

215
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:25,610
its I'm not sure away

216
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:31,030
sec fault

217
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:37,350
me something I didn't doing

218
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:40,900
this is them the over Intel

219
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:57,770
run

220
00:32:57,770 --> 00:33:19,280
know it seems in the be in the cold from
them

221
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:21,490
well

222
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:32,110
nets copy be the values in their

223
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:36,850
now so they start at 41 41 41 41

224
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:47,490
lower look for

225
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:52,240
so this is where the a

226
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,570
are and no thats who

227
00:33:55,570 --> 00:34:37,780
the ranks slow

228
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:39,540
correct for and

229
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:44,170
he for in that

230
00:34:44,170 --> 00:34:49,390
one we do right split its

231
00:34:49,390 --> 00:34:55,120
equals with T second one no

232
00:34:55,120 --> 00:35:00,760
this one are

233
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:15,060
hey you

234
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:18,110
in mmm

235
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:22,670
okay

236
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:26,000
and that's is wreck for

237
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:40,960
plus that

238
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,430
binary to

239
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:48,680
me of

240
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:51,750
for new

241
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:55,990
fine the starting at

242
00:35:55,990 --> 00:36:00,190
me then

243
00:36:00,190 --> 00:37:23,360
break for

244
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:26,290
mitzi that this on the crew values

245
00:37:26,290 --> 00:37:42,090
yes great only nothing

246
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:57,109
I would year yeah it looks right

247
00:37:57,109 --> 00:37:57,989
okay so

248
00:37:57,989 --> 00:38:02,579
that seems to work Lance

249
00:38:02,579 --> 00:38:06,279
moment this current will

250
00:38:06,279 --> 00:38:11,029
you the know it

251
00:38:11,029 --> 00:38:18,380
60

252
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:48,089
and when

253
00:38:48,089 --> 00:38:51,979
compound okay

254
00:38:51,979 --> 00:38:55,429
that seems to love re so now

255
00:38:55,429 --> 00:39:10,730
mine

256
00:39:10,730 --> 00:39:32,450
or growth

257
00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:33,140
high since

258
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:38,660
d both

259
00:39:38,660 --> 00:40:06,080
I am way

260
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:21,940
on

261
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:41,500
community yeah okay

262
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:48,660
good thing were

263
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:49,430
awesome

264
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:52,910
so cell

265
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:57,350
here and then harm and

266
00:40:57,350 --> 00:41:06,450
all the

267
00:41:06,450 --> 00:41:11,210
no

268
00:41:11,210 --> 00:41:36,750
solution the 1

269
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:37,170
okay

270
00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:44,760
so I think it should be correct i mean

271
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:53,319
if it's a wrong tempered then

272
00:41:53,319 --> 00:42:00,640
I am with get this other thing

273
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:08,369
this what's it called

274
00:42:08,369 --> 00:42:12,319
wrong no you know damaged

275
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:15,440
in a in L invalid solution

276
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:21,109
this is when cardinal red just so and
and in print

277
00:42:21,109 --> 00:42:48,109
print solved and its on

278
00:42:48,109 --> 00:42:48,579
known

279
00:42:48,579 --> 00:42:55,640
and getting those that as

280
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:58,789
fishing in solution

281
00:42:58,789 --> 00:43:50,040
and whose No

282
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:52,340
why is it not working

283
00:43:52,340 --> 00:44:15,620
themselves then

284
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:21,090
no one must

285
00:44:21,090 --> 00:44:27,960
souls say and kaelin its

286
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:57,020
have a look great if and doing this you
correctly again

287
00:44:57,020 --> 00:44:58,850
to the the improved

288
00:44:58,850 --> 00:45:06,010
really mean our kids that should

289
00:45:06,010 --> 00:45:09,680
the in with this reading nicely

290
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:12,980
I think I have to should at the back the
am

291
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:21,970
if their ancestors are properly loaded

292
00:45:21,970 --> 00:45:33,500
and right truth run

293
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:40,940
mmm

294
00:45:40,940 --> 00:46:26,130
cool

295
00:46:26,130 --> 00:46:28,250
no mmm

296
00:46:28,250 --> 00:46:48,530
in a P so this is the code

297
00:46:48,530 --> 00:46:50,810
and its of cause

298
00:46:50,810 --> 00:46:53,850
not loaded is I was hoping

299
00:46:53,850 --> 00:46:58,650
okay so have to adjust

300
00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:02,490
the correct so

301
00:47:02,490 --> 00:47:06,020
actually i'm looking for he

302
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:09,250
a he and these these

303
00:47:09,250 --> 00:47:12,830
in the

304
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:16,290
output has to be correct or so that

305
00:47:16,290 --> 00:47:23,160
is also sexy the -4 strong

306
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:33,150
has to be for no

307
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:48,039
different first national

308
00:47:48,039 --> 00:48:23,880
ok see the the

309
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:24,300
okay

310
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:48,220
that looks better great

311
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:50,570
known were still in the lead solution

312
00:48:50,570 --> 00:48:54,080
okay

313
00:48:54,080 --> 00:49:09,540
and be back in again

314
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:26,079
sorry

315
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:47,720
home rum

316
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:51,450
some but see it's moving Nick

317
00:49:51,450 --> 00:49:58,630
correctly the

318
00:49:58,630 --> 00:50:01,890
missus worth set no

319
00:50:01,890 --> 00:50:18,910
instruction for and I meant to look

320
00:50:18,910 --> 00:50:22,609
so these other registers how they should
look like this: continue

321
00:50:22,609 --> 00:50:25,880
and the are not correct so

322
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:36,200
it has the shifted I think

323
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:42,859
one 11

324
00:50:42,859 --> 00:51:12,840
animal miss workforce

325
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:18,320
I think maybe the setting

326
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:26,570
make the my

327
00:51:26,570 --> 00:51:29,740
the with have to check this okay

328
00:51:29,740 --> 00:51:32,920
that's debug it again he said

329
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:37,060
free from your

330
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:40,220
and within a break from the

331
00:51:40,220 --> 00:51:45,420
game from

332
00:51:45,420 --> 00:52:16,390
damn it

333
00:52:16,390 --> 00:52:17,880
on mister

334
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:23,280
mmm its

335
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:37,070
look at the registers okay so

336
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:40,540
reading seems to himself

337
00:52:40,540 --> 00:52:44,460
seems to the corrected 0 no

338
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:48,480
I am I'm

339
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:52,430
mmm

340
00:52:52,430 --> 00:52:52,740
no

341
00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:56,020
afterwards I want a 5 their

342
00:52:56,020 --> 00:54:11,550
them

343
00:54:11,550 --> 00:54:11,880
now

344
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:19,420
am

345
00:54:19,420 --> 00:54:23,870
yes on

346
00:54:23,870 --> 00:54:28,150
okie

347
00:54:28,150 --> 00:54:31,650
the good to

348
00:54:31,650 --> 00:54:35,340
the we or the registers

349
00:54:35,340 --> 00:54:38,860
are input okay so
