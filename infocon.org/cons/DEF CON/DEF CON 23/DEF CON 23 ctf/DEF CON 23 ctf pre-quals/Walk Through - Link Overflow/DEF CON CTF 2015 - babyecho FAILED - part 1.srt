1
00:00:01,469 --> 00:00:03,649
roughly eight hours later I am back

2
00:00:03,649 --> 00:00:08,019
and somewhat challengers good released
so I guess

3
00:00:08,019 --> 00:00:11,759
saw the everything that is higher than
on one's pro too hard for me

4
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,549
soho I think a its a I will stick with
the

5
00:00:15,549 --> 00:00:20,080
with the by challenges for now but I
really do wanna solve

6
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,689
the I

7
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:27,490
will be what the tiny when you 1 though
I suspect it has something to do with

8
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:29,320
timing and it's always pretty ugly

9
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:33,610
yup

10
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:38,850
so I am I wanna have a look at the

11
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:42,980
other baby tough it seems like something
that I can realistically Sol

12
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:46,220
so it's no not this its

13
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:53,940
checked it out what kind of file this is
on

14
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:57,989
BBS your okay also 22 bit Linux

15
00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:01,590
I S so should have a 32 Linux year

16
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:06,600
think yeah that's my Linux primary

17
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,700
should also take not support it here
before

18
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:13,990
sorry me a second I you want

19
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:21,280
who

20
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:28,070
mmm yeah anyone

21
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:37,940
to take note of this year

22
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:43,380
um deny

23
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:47,150
there but that's a different

24
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:57,180
tons per anyway okay

25
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:00,149
and thing to Kia already and there

26
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:03,740
what appears to be that Kienan seems to
be this

27
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:23,719
okay so that's then they can continue
here so

28
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:25,310
okay so that occurring

29
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:28,439
great I guess the server will behave
these

30
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:41,200
same 3232 okay great

31
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:47,049
I guess it to the obvious first

32
00:02:47,049 --> 00:02:53,159
well its 1000 GB already

33
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:59,840
and let's run this

34
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,639
in its you what happens if we import
more than 30

35
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:07,019
there well okay fine said also

36
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:11,199
30 yes

37
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:14,769
so at thirty with no bite okay

38
00:03:14,769 --> 00:03:19,689
cool I guess that's open that

39
00:03:19,689 --> 00:03:32,230
in hopper

40
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:47,050
and have a look at it heart that looks

41
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:58,780
pre being

42
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:18,859
some

43
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:30,379
all

44
00:04:30,379 --> 00:04:40,750
wait what

45
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:41,150
minute

46
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:49,070
is not feeling

47
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:52,100
6042 the for the

48
00:04:52,100 --> 00:05:07,780
to okay

49
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:09,000
it should be here

50
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:15,070
so where's way it can I jump there I'll
file offset

51
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:18,350
dement okay

52
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:31,130
so here we are

53
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:44,659
okay

54
00:05:44,659 --> 00:05:52,069
moment Cosworth horses statically
compile

55
00:05:52,069 --> 00:06:08,740
yes that's the him

56
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:19,910
I Athletico you think okay

57
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:22,310
okay sure that's fine

58
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:25,680
so this could already be like inside
over

59
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:30,060
I think it's go to the could already be
like a

60
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:33,650
the BSE functional whatever David Weiss
is said

61
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:40,729
of said never heard of that all

62
00:06:40,729 --> 00:06:44,090
mmm call

63
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:50,780
came so this is probably mean see

64
00:06:50,780 --> 00:07:13,139
says pretty code

65
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:14,319
I would if you ram

66
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:26,139
okay guess

67
00:07:26,139 --> 00:07:27,539
on the same side

68
00:07:27,539 --> 00:07:40,350
earlier okay song meet hun

69
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:42,110
and knowing it go to address

70
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:45,210
always just she are them and I'm stupid
okay

71
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:50,800
reading

72
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,880
bytes okay fine so this is the

73
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:59,430
input loop you let's have a look at this

74
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:05,660
so reading but so this is

75
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:09,509
probably only the you read

76
00:08:09,509 --> 00:08:16,870
them

77
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:20,280
on on on on this earth puts from no this
printer

78
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:26,570
for reprint

79
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:30,380
them its Heather 30

80
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:46,499
distinguishable home

81
00:08:46,499 --> 00:08:49,499
in there are three arguments for this
one

82
00:08:49,499 --> 00:08:52,800
in the recess another print have

83
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,939
which has probably chess printing 100
threat so

84
00:08:56,939 --> 00:09:00,720
I think this must be a read so something
bad

85
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:20,000
this makes sense

86
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,960
open the Saucon

87
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:24,990
I because night be there at mmm

88
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:31,280
that

89
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:35,920
I have some flirt submissive something
that made you can recognize

90
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,630
the the BSE functions I guess

91
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:43,370
a.m. in that that experiment reversing
but that both kind of what I would be

92
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:58,840
hoping for

93
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,810
but could also probably based on the
address this

94
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:05,030
determined that something from the BSE
so

95
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:08,800
probably these are pretty close together
these are all fine and then this is

96
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:13,860
actually read or something

97
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:18,140
probably betsy is the third running

98
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:24,610
Peterson protect our if you do a half
year

99
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:28,170
to conserve something Marino hard work

100
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:31,780
the cool

101
00:10:31,780 --> 00:11:05,339
okay a.m.

102
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:09,009
located doesn't seem like true Dunham

103
00:11:09,009 --> 00:11:14,189
no and

104
00:11:14,189 --> 00:11:33,770
look-see

105
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:39,170
a gift and help much okay

106
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:50,160
a.m.

107
00:11:50,160 --> 00:12:00,200
means weirdly jumping in between okay
three pounds 103 paramita

108
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:07,780
the are and

109
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:11,550
newline something like

110
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:15,880
read

111
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:19,500
so for this could maybe be a

112
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,750
know I'll miniature no

113
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:26,330
a put so I found me

114
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:36,380
put but char maybe

115
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,750
well let's see if we can do

116
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:41,800
a.m. I think it's something that I
should have tests that

117
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:46,460
first if we can do promise ring

118
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:50,700
expert oh yeah

119
00:12:50,700 --> 00:13:01,569
think guess so

120
00:13:01,569 --> 00:13:05,160
okay well I guess this is a
follow-through exploit them

121
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:09,399
good a convenient

122
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:13,119
okay so new

123
00:13:13,119 --> 00:13:19,059
what do we wanna over Bryant

124
00:13:19,059 --> 00:13:23,480
me 10

125
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:27,519
can we or

126
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:31,239
too slow they all have this timer I mean
and the standard

127
00:13:31,239 --> 00:13:35,049
when all those people sockets open third
their

128
00:13:35,049 --> 00:13:50,510
thing closes again

129
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:53,350
okay so my mum

130
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:57,700
yeah I i think we should should have a
look at this text so

131
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:02,360
from are saying that this is probably
Printemps so I should probably

132
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:12,550
free here so I'm runnin am reading

133
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:20,220
stupid sidebar

134
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:27,560
stop it

135
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:30,689
K so then scroll printer

136
00:14:30,689 --> 00:14:33,800
its follow the

137
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:37,600
calling

138
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,230
this year and it looks pretty
complicated

139
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:51,430
pro printer mmm

140
00:14:51,430 --> 00:15:17,480
too slow

141
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,640
that mean crew to try this

142
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:22,690
with a 2gb your

143
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:31,790
I'm

144
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:42,410
a donor team rider this way

145
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:59,430
through time the on you

146
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:04,110
so why is it on your by Nana can I do

147
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:07,880
all or so

148
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:15,050
it okay so this is actually

149
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:18,770
doing something was percent

150
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:33,010
percentage sign

151
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:35,339
to fire see

152
00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:39,640
I'm this year somewhere that maybe the

153
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:51,459
cleaner thing recall so I have to assume
that the Sprint

154
00:16:51,459 --> 00:17:20,049
assume this is the re and maybe it will
happen year

155
00:17:20,049 --> 00:17:23,659
so what happens if I am mean later I
would not

156
00:17:23,659 --> 00:17:27,919
just to percent such in with probably

157
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:32,260
to for an awesome

158
00:17:32,260 --> 00:18:18,040
paper that's not this notation work

159
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:21,880
K

160
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:25,280
I'm not sure when I can do with that
because

161
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,810
certain Mike two months

162
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:33,380
can always on

163
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:44,039
one by it

164
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:47,149
some me shit

165
00:18:47,149 --> 00:18:53,389
use gdb again and

166
00:18:53,389 --> 00:18:59,629
at CU

167
00:18:59,629 --> 00:19:04,709
where exactly it is make the

168
00:19:04,709 --> 00:19:20,950
after which function it's actually so

169
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:22,080
so

170
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,470
this from the printer so it's said

171
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:30,920
that's that's in a few break points so
in this the

172
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:34,410
probably the print this is

173
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:44,110
probably the stuff that is reading

174
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:46,870
this is pretty weird because and
recognized as

175
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:50,059
and sup

176
00:19:50,059 --> 00:19:53,360
thing so this is probably you when the

177
00:19:53,360 --> 00:20:04,110
printer like echoing out again and then
we have two more function in our

178
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:17,179
may be doing something interesting and
on

179
00:20:17,179 --> 00:20:20,299
okay so let's run this dement

180
00:20:20,299 --> 00:20:29,049
saw

181
00:20:29,049 --> 00:20:32,340
first break point no kitchen print the

182
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:35,409
reading 13 by fine

183
00:20:35,409 --> 00:20:38,970
so it's not confirm next call okay so
this is

184
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:44,090
the next call afterwards already doing

185
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:58,310
some reading okay

186
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:02,030
some reading let's see if we can find
all posts

187
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:05,580
ring again some of these contain
container

188
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:10,270
yet so

189
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:13,360
here's our throwing okay great so

190
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:20,220
mister this again and its thats put in
there already

191
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:24,400
a percentage an percent X

192
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:29,600
prisons the the in

193
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,660
see already the change

194
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:36,840
year so

195
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:41,230
we

196
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:49,660
okay so this is are in underscore

197
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:52,640
it the other thing days sent

198
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:57,190
I'm its is more person

199
00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:00,530
small an

200
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:03,640
and small

201
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:07,030
okay so that state but percentage and
it's not a lot

202
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:13,300
achieve I am

203
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:47,779
need to know whether through slower so I
can break out of that

204
00:22:47,779 --> 00:22:50,070
K so

205
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:53,960
I am I want to try I've

206
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:58,539
multiple if I now have some a continuing

207
00:22:58,539 --> 00:23:05,230
it got printed you know

208
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:09,230
I make them be now

209
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:13,659
the at Bowlmor know if they are okay so

210
00:23:13,659 --> 00:23:17,269
its already or the previous one but of

211
00:23:17,269 --> 00:23:24,549
obviously still no terminated let's keep
that in mind maybe

212
00:23:24,549 --> 00:23:27,710
this

213
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:29,070
use first some

214
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:35,559
thing

215
00:23:35,559 --> 00:23:43,240
if it the idea is if it another

216
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:46,690
re that you would have been

217
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:50,250
if I can read for example not with the

218
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:53,860
a.m. with

219
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:56,960
with something else then a new line of
something

220
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:01,400
maybe I it wouldn't wouldn't have been
all but at the end of them

221
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:15,320
Minister so

222
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,820
so it's to for example

223
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:21,420
some a new and then some be

224
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:28,500
done I do

225
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:41,980
continue

226
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,200
yes its financing see that

227
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:50,710
and now here on

228
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:54,150
be own

229
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:57,680
that the evidence you know

230
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:00,980
by I'm stupid market

231
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:08,400
I guess it's not working okay

232
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:12,180
sonnets check again what do you think to
the first one print

233
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:20,200
the second one this reading 3

234
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:25,690
the first one printed next one

235
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:34,909
just doing nothing our shit

236
00:25:34,909 --> 00:25:37,159
can delete the input thing

237
00:25:37,159 --> 00:26:00,590
well let's just make this empty

238
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:38,940
dement to youth

239
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:48,990
him year

240
00:26:48,990 --> 00:27:00,730
damnit run see when

241
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:01,120
okay

242
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:05,399
for and I S so

243
00:27:05,399 --> 00:27:10,269
and put in some pain after at the second
one

244
00:27:10,269 --> 00:27:18,009
doing some reading the next one after
that

245
00:27:18,009 --> 00:27:27,219
thing

246
00:27:27,219 --> 00:27:31,129
did I don't know work and that one
afterwards

247
00:27:31,129 --> 00:27:34,589
this printing so looking at a Sprint
that that's fine

248
00:27:34,589 --> 00:27:38,200
and then the the

249
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:44,219
did and North and

250
00:27:44,219 --> 00:27:52,070
I don't know

251
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:53,170
are k somethings

252
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:56,320
seems to be in the

253
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:10,630
streams

254
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:51,520
mom them

255
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:55,480
to the system some read no I would like
to know

256
00:28:55,480 --> 00:29:00,130
I think I should

257
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:13,640
to lead all breakpoints and make you one

258
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:16,730
and I wanna have a look at the stake one

259
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:20,500
see you need to know where the
information is stored

260
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:23,780
with only the characters so probably

261
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:32,330
this one is this what good moved on

262
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:35,690
maybe this the but okay that would be
cool if like

263
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:39,429
okay so

264
00:29:39,429 --> 00:29:42,750
what the dairy before with the

265
00:29:42,750 --> 00:30:00,610
it started again

266
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:00,890
why

267
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:15,070
sometimes hanging like that

268
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:15,669
am

269
00:30:15,669 --> 00:30:18,960
maybe a

270
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:19,950
head

271
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:25,679
the away run I okay so it's always
reading 13

272
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:30,759
no it's not me that

273
00:30:30,759 --> 00:30:39,690
your with him

274
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:47,789
yeah

275
00:30:47,789 --> 00:30:52,279
hangin the squall your

276
00:30:52,279 --> 00:31:11,080
and go on again

277
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:15,430
so again nets brainy here Iran

278
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:22,310
and

279
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:35,960
after the

280
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:47,650
so you know resetting running sonar can
put something

281
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:49,440
okay no

282
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:55,260
let's have a look at this

283
00:31:55,260 --> 00:32:05,550
there

284
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:24,270
son

285
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:27,900
so dread the me 0

286
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:35,520
d and

287
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:38,800
this is also conveniently pointing here
so

288
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:44,020
if I could in weight

289
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:47,390
and my Inc this is my string the name

290
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:51,450
input and then I'm on the sticks effect
could

291
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:56,040
alright death Len never probably

292
00:32:56,040 --> 00:33:00,600
a write more than 6 anchor let's read
more than 16 characters

293
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:06,250
let's try this if I reset no and look at
this

294
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:21,529
dick I'd change

295
00:33:21,529 --> 00:33:32,649
ocean this pointing there

296
00:33:32,649 --> 00:33:45,529
okay to slow moment that's fine

297
00:33:45,529 --> 00:33:48,309
so known it see if I can put more

298
00:33:48,309 --> 00:34:01,620
seem so a kid so this was probably not
the correct one

299
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:05,950
there was the other one

300
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:09,159
limited 5

301
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:21,970
54

302
00:34:21,970 --> 00:34:23,370
it

303
00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:27,440
yeah okay so this is how you could right
more

304
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:33,120
accept this month check not that this
was accidentally left then

305
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:37,350
a no king was more so miss the way we

306
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:50,960
it's not a question how cry over right
to somehow

307
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,759
keep percent an is vintage

308
00:34:53,759 --> 00:35:38,390
and and

309
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:38,880
okay

310
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:58,469
dement

311
00:35:58,469 --> 00:36:01,719
okay with the slough well this is the
problem

312
00:36:01,719 --> 00:36:06,339
I can quit this lou moment

313
00:36:06,339 --> 00:36:27,060
check if it's your own

314
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:32,700
kit

315
00:36:32,700 --> 00:37:18,550
mmm

316
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:22,630
her okay at thing I will take a break
from the chance for now

317
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:24,990
and move on to another challenge in the
meantime
