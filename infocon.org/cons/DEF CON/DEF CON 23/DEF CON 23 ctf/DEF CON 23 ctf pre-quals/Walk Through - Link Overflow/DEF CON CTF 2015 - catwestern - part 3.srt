00:00:01,310 --> 00:00:13,799
okay good redsnow I am

2
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:15,660
disassemble main

3
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,620
wanna great

4
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:22,110
and year run

5
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:30,550
no wrenches

6
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:33,329
awesome so I am

7
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:40,110
when the the call come okie

8
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:48,550
dust mess okay maybe I have to set up
messing up some of the register

9
00:00:48,550 --> 00:01:10,930
do it like that

10
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:12,880
home

11
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:24,650
I'll the this earlier and then

12
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:33,539
him

13
00:01:33,539 --> 00:01:37,960
0 I think in code

14
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:41,240
that's fine and you

15
00:01:41,240 --> 00:02:16,310
said expand with but me that was issued

16
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:18,840
okay let's remove CC year

17
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,250
and let's specify all registers

18
00:02:22,250 --> 00:03:47,340
alright victory

19
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,530
me

20
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:51,790
work will complain

21
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:57,580
too many I'll

22
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:57,890
no

23
00:03:57,890 --> 00:05:12,340
1

24
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:25,400
my system

25
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:25,800
for

26
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,169
all in

27
00:05:29,169 --> 00:05:33,680
any to office the

28
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,720
on I'm

29
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,800
problem

30
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:52,219
long

31
00:05:52,219 --> 00:06:06,120
one 1

32
00:06:06,120 --> 00:07:10,429
probably too many interest

33
00:07:10,429 --> 00:07:25,309
Hannah sex

34
00:07:25,309 --> 00:07:38,319
away fix the X

35
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:59,810
demands

36
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:03,110
I am Rick andric news I guess this is

37
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:07,150
okay this is not how I can make it work
thinking

38
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:12,070
this in line assembly tough

39
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:17,320
no

40
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:35,779
not minus and either

41
00:08:35,779 --> 00:08:40,279
well I mean I haven't yet I can't quite
make it seem so

42
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:45,480
hideous much work there must be a super
cool way how to do this

43
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:49,959
so when I D a half hour could do it

44
00:08:49,959 --> 00:08:53,440
is I would Ryan

45
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,529
some kind of like

46
00:08:56,529 --> 00:09:08,580
a.m.

47
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:08,900
like

48
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:13,030
philippi thing with not latest copy this
one in there

49
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:16,240
so that's fine executing in and

50
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,730
I would have a buffer I would return a
buffer

51
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:24,900
so I have a lot of space there and then
I will just

52
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:28,790
move on the registers their from from
there

53
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:32,680
to their I think that's Hong gonna do it
I think that seems the most

54
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:35,900
most reasonable

55
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:43,670
way so

56
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:56,180
home

57
00:09:56,180 --> 00:10:11,640
so I use hopper and some basically

58
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:14,500
okay next that could lead to this that's
par for this

59
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:29,339
on damn it

60
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:30,639
okay

61
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:33,730
so I E different instructions

62
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:48,000
for mmm

63
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,830
no no not true I am by Nina

64
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:57,060
buffer so okay

65
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:00,540
17 attack I need

66
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:04,750
and media me bixby so

67
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:12,620
I make just unsigned long

68
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:17,110
for in a sleigh

69
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:26,410
I'll big enough

70
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:46,709
so comparing intimate

71
00:11:46,709 --> 00:11:47,769
im

72
00:11:47,769 --> 00:11:59,110
reload them file

73
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:01,140
so he is the buffer

74
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:14,240
let's hope it stays there

75
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,490
and its in here scored so is the code
before

76
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:20,650
after for first

77
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:24,089
code and incomes buffer menace not
well-liked

78
00:12:24,089 --> 00:12:28,350
have to hope not optimizing this

79
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:32,650
also I want this to be

80
00:12:32,650 --> 00:13:15,459
lot of naps

81
00:13:15,459 --> 00:13:18,519
okay so I have offer and

82
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:22,240
to force through he Dakota still before
but it's the only pic

83
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:31,190
that's fine okay so I am the beginning
of code

84
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:34,240
i wont to Sam mmm

85
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:56,960
home

86
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:08,180
payments

87
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:17,780
the and hand

88
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:32,590
0

89
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:38,980
had some mishaps in long

90
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:42,730
maybe go from

91
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:45,810

I P

95
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:20,370
also that's not absolute I okay I

96
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:24,470
it calculated for me okay fine that
that's fine

97
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:49,450
I am or can I write it in like that

98
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:51,670
well didn't quite work

99
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:55,420
by anyway okay let's go from here appear
that cock with this really quick

100
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:58,880
so we have code here and buffer here

101
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:25,230
so offer

102
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:28,420

you know

110
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:09,540
minus 8 for okay buffer

111
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:14,350
cool and then the next one stayed

112
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:18,740

from array

118
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:09,870
X RB a RCX RDX

119
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:13,590
are

120
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:18,510

amazing C

130
00:19:09,369 --> 00:19:35,690
him then I N the

131
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:37,270
a key so I'm

132
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:41,480
to copy some on X

133
00:19:41,480 --> 00:20:00,070
on

134
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:03,540
copy extreme selected ninth on

135
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:09,260
looks like it

136
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:27,300
that's former this

137
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:44,029
okay and affect the check them

138
00:20:44,029 --> 00:20:47,059
well that's quite long already well

139
00:20:47,059 --> 00:20:50,320
have to extend the staff to retract

140
00:20:50,320 --> 00:21:05,120
everything okay let's just hope that the
that fits

141
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,000
Portsmouth

142
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,700
okay cool

143
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:14,289
that's compound this again hope for the
best

144
00:21:14,289 --> 00:21:29,690
that nothing shifts around

145
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:37,560
good

146
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,350
okay damn

147
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:43,010
its not or should a didn't delete the
same amount of

148
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:55,820
things obviously

149
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:59,970
so how long is the line your 15

150
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:12,470
I could me 16

151
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:40,070
so and my whole string

152
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:46,980
112 into

153
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:56,610
seven lines wat

154
00:22:56,610 --> 00:23:01,610
I already deleted one so that's one to

155
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:19,300
3 for 567

156
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:27,970
pizza those a six lines in them

157
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:29,610
seven more well

158
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:36,710
dislike be

159
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:40,020
to be good man

160
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:50,190
nasa so stupid I should have thought
ahead

161
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:52,009
with on this basis quite

162
00:23:52,009 --> 00:23:55,699
who little no could fit

163
00:23:55,699 --> 00:24:02,980
code

164
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:05,850
okay not playing tuba sup mazing ima

165
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:10,120
okay and now it's to the same how much

166
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:22,590
biting me for this year sixty me

167
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:28,500
for

168
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:50,440
oh I guess I can make you love it bigger
will be aligned

169
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,159
okay so

170
00:24:51,159 --> 00:25:02,950
thats abstract here six me

171
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:03,650
11

172
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:09,880
he it's quite

173
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:17,210
far

174
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:20,350
p and its yeah its that stood from

175
