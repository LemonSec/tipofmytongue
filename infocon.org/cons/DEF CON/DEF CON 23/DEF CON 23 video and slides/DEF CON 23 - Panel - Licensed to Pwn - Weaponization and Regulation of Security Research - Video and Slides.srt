00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.303
It's my pleasure. You're getting
a real stack of attorneys today.

00:00:03.303 --> 00:00:08.108
We had alley in here and he was
a attorney and then a panel of a

00:00:08.108 --> 00:00:12.112
bunch of them this is going to
be a really interesting set

00:00:12.112 --> 00:00:16.149
about the weaponization and
regulation of security research.

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:20.687
Something that is pretty
important to a lot of us here.

00:00:20.687 --> 00:00:22.823
I'm not going to introduce
everybody individually. I'll

00:00:22.823 --> 00:00:29.796
probably let Jim take care of
that. So, let's give our panel a

00:00:29.796 --> 00:00:37.170
big hand. (Applause) >> JIM
DENARO: Thank you for coming to

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.542
our panel. This is licensed to
own. The weaponization of

00:00:41.542 --> 00:00:45.412
security research. We appreciate
you taking the time to explore

00:00:45.412 --> 00:00:49.950
this important issue with us.
This is a unique time for the

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.954
entire information security
community. And shear why. The

00:00:53.954 --> 00:00:56.857
U.S. government is implementing
rules that could change the way

00:00:56.857 --> 00:01:00.260
that information security is
practiced in the United States.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.263
And more than that, it could
even affect the way that we talk

00:01:03.263 --> 00:01:06.533
about information security. The
way information is exchanged

00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:10.203
among us here. And if that
sounds like a big deal, it is.

00:01:10.203 --> 00:01:13.507
And that's not an overstatement
at all of the situation that we

00:01:13.507 --> 00:01:16.343
are currently looking at.
Specifically, some new

00:01:16.343 --> 00:01:19.713
regulations are being proposed
by the Bureau of Industry and

00:01:19.713 --> 00:01:22.849
security, also known as BIS as
what we will refer to it here.

00:01:22.849 --> 00:01:26.486
That's within the U.S.
Department of Commerce. Stated

00:01:26.486 --> 00:01:30.457
mission of BIS is to administer
and enforce dual use export

00:01:30.457 --> 00:01:35.295
controls on various
technologies. Such as body

00:01:35.295 --> 00:01:39.766
armor, bulletproof windshield
glass, encryption, most relevant

00:01:39.766 --> 00:01:44.471
to what we're doing, and those
charges are now being expanded

00:01:44.471 --> 00:01:48.141
to cover some technologies that
we are seeing more often here in

00:01:48.141 --> 00:01:52.279
this room, even. So this is an
opportunity for us to organize

00:01:52.279 --> 00:01:55.582
and to present a coherent
explanation of our concerns with

00:01:55.582 --> 00:01:59.252
respect to the regulations that
are being proposed. So, with

00:01:59.252 --> 00:02:03.023
that, let me introduce our
fantastic panel that we have

00:02:03.023 --> 00:02:06.393
here. In alphabetical order, for
the folks that are here at the

00:02:06.393 --> 00:02:12.866
table first. Dave Aitel is an
offensive security expert whose

00:02:12.866 --> 00:02:17.070
company, immunity is hired by
major companies to try to hack

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.907
their computer networks to find
and fix as a result

00:02:20.907 --> 00:02:23.977
vulnerabilities that hackers and
adversaries could use. The

00:02:23.977 --> 00:02:27.047
company is well-known for the
developing several advanced

00:02:27.047 --> 00:02:30.550
hacking tools used by the
security industry such as Swarm,

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:37.157
canvass, Accomplice, Spike and
Unmask and Innuendo. >> Matt

00:02:37.157 --> 00:02:44.164
Blaze is a Professor at the
University of Pennsylvania and

00:02:44.164 --> 00:02:47.801
his research focuses on
architecture and design of

00:02:47.801 --> 00:02:53.807
secure systems based on crypt
graphic techniques and finding

00:02:56.543 --> 00:02:59.046
new crypto graphic techniques as
you surely mist know, he

00:02:59.046 --> 00:03:02.082
discovered a serious flaw in the
U.S. government's cliprer

00:03:02.082 --> 00:03:06.319
encryption system. He is
interested in the use of

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:09.856
encryption in various security
systems and controlled an attack

00:03:09.856 --> 00:03:15.929
against virtually all mechanical
blocks. Nate Cardozo is a Staff

00:03:15.929 --> 00:03:19.533
Attorney with the Electronic
Frontier Foundation. He focuses

00:03:19.533 --> 00:03:21.735
on the intersection of
technology privacy through

00:03:21.735 --> 00:03:26.973
expression. Defended the right
to blog and sued the U.S.

00:03:26.973 --> 00:03:31.244
government and lobby Congressed
for American surveillance flaws

00:03:31.244 --> 00:03:34.147
and in addition he works on the
E if. F Coder's Rights Project

00:03:34.147 --> 00:03:37.050
counseling hackers academics and
security professionals at all

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:42.556
stages of research. Mara Tam is
a researcher and historian of

00:03:42.556 --> 00:03:45.425
policy justice, culture and
security authored and coauthored

00:03:45.425 --> 00:03:48.128
and contributed research for
technical policy papers in arms

00:03:48.128 --> 00:03:51.898
control and security. After
earning a degree in art history,

00:03:51.898 --> 00:03:55.535
she works in bilateral
negotiations between the United

00:03:55.535 --> 00:04:00.040
States and India and has been a
panelist academic conferences

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.243
and language and history
including the security

00:04:03.243 --> 00:04:07.180
initiative convened by NATO and
the European Science Foundation.

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.818
And today we have with us also
by remote presence, very special

00:04:11.818 --> 00:04:16.590
guest, Catherine Wheeler of the
Bureau of Industry and Security.

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:21.495
We are momentarily challenged
with the AV. We'll see her

00:04:21.495 --> 00:04:24.965
later. But she is with us and we
can see her and she can hear us

00:04:24.965 --> 00:04:29.035
and she will be able to hear
you. So, I can tell you about

00:04:29.035 --> 00:04:33.874
her. She has served as the
Director of The information

00:04:33.874 --> 00:04:36.376
technology control division of
the Bureau of Industry and

00:04:36.376 --> 00:04:39.045
securities Office of National
security and technology transfer

00:04:39.045 --> 00:04:42.649
control since 2006. She is in
charge of this. This is great.

00:04:42.649 --> 00:04:50.290
She was detailed to serve as
acting Chair of the Operating

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:55.829
Committee, reviews agencies. And
her experience here is

00:04:55.829 --> 00:04:59.733
incredibly relevant for this
task that we should here of

00:04:59.733 --> 00:05:06.006
trying to get to rules that our
community can live with and that

00:05:06.006 --> 00:05:13.213
also is also forward missions of
the BIS. So, we can't thank her

00:05:13.213 --> 00:05:21.188
enough for taking the time to be
with us today. And I'm Moderator

00:05:21.188 --> 00:05:24.858
for this lovely panel, I'm Jim
Denaro, data security and

00:05:24.858 --> 00:05:27.961
intellectual property attorney
and advise hackers in how to

00:05:27.961 --> 00:05:32.933
stay out of trouble or get in
less trouble. So, with that

00:05:32.933 --> 00:05:35.835
said, let's dive into the meat
of this. This is really about

00:05:35.835 --> 00:05:42.309
export control. And it's a
really kind of in the weeds

00:05:42.309 --> 00:05:47.013
subject. And to really
understand the significance of

00:05:47.013 --> 00:05:49.749
the rulings that are being
proposed and how they would

00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:54.087
affect the community in such a
fundamental way, is worth taking

00:05:54.087 --> 00:05:58.124
a moment to explore what is
export control? How does it

00:05:58.124 --> 00:06:00.360
apply to you? How could it apply
to you and why does it matter?

00:06:06.132 --> 00:06:08.935
So a few notes of background
before we get into the meat of

00:06:08.935 --> 00:06:10.937
this particular situation here.
So, the U.S. government controls

00:06:10.937 --> 00:06:12.939
the exports of sensitive
equipment, software and

00:06:12.939 --> 00:06:14.941
technology as a means of
promoting national security

00:06:14.941 --> 00:06:16.943
interests and informed policy
objectives. This controls

00:06:16.943 --> 00:06:19.446
achieved by requiring people and
companies to apply for licensing

00:06:19.446 --> 00:06:23.350
before exporting articles that
are covered by the rules. So the

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:26.386
question is, what is covered by
export control? That is really

00:06:26.386 --> 00:06:30.323
what the debate is here. So, at
a high level, we can break it

00:06:30.323 --> 00:06:33.126
into two categories. Favorite
additional defense articles that

00:06:33.126 --> 00:06:37.063
is not at issue here, but they
have their own licensing regime.

00:06:37.063 --> 00:06:41.067
Things that have no commercial
application. They are covered by

00:06:41.067 --> 00:06:44.404
the International traffic and
arms regulations. These include

00:06:44.404 --> 00:06:48.508
for example, armored combat
ground vehicles, tanks, as well

00:06:48.508 --> 00:06:51.544
as something more relevant for
us here, computers that are

00:06:51.544 --> 00:06:53.680
specifically designed or
developed for military

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:57.917
applications. Second, our space
here, we have items that are

00:06:57.917 --> 00:06:59.920
considered to have both
commercial and military

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:02.622
application. These are
considered to be dual use items

00:07:02.622 --> 00:07:05.191
and that is a term of art. And
they are controlled by the

00:07:05.191 --> 00:07:09.562
Export Administration
regulations for software and

00:07:09.562 --> 00:07:13.900
technology. Including things
such as high performance

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:18.571
computers and encryption which
many of you have probably come

00:07:18.571 --> 00:07:21.841
across already. Infarcux the
schedule of controlled goods has

00:07:21.841 --> 00:07:26.179
a schedule titled, information
security. So you already kind of

00:07:26.179 --> 00:07:30.917
in range here. But those rules
are really about photography and

00:07:30.917 --> 00:07:35.855
that's what you see the most.
So, for these dual use licenses,

00:07:35.855 --> 00:07:38.892
the U.S. Department of Commerce
receives somewhere between

00:07:38.892 --> 00:07:43.997
12 --> 000 to 14 --> 000 applications a
year for this type of export

00:07:43.997 --> 00:07:48.668
activity. And compliance
matters. For these dual use

00:07:48.668 --> 00:07:51.204
export control violations,
criminal penalties can reach a

00:07:51.204 --> 00:07:55.141
maximum of $500 --> 000 per
violation and an individual

00:07:55.141 --> 00:07:58.545
person can get up to 10 years in
prison. They can also be the

00:07:58.545 --> 00:08:02.816
subject of civil fines up to
12 --> 000 dollars per violation and

00:08:02.816 --> 00:08:05.952
denial of export privileges. And
some cases both and I have

00:08:05.952 --> 00:08:09.155
criminal cases can be brought.
So -- both and I have criminal

00:08:09.155 --> 00:08:15.562
cases -- so the steaks are
fairly high at this point. So

00:08:15.562 --> 00:08:19.666
far, in the world we live in,
nobody in the community has been

00:08:19.666 --> 00:08:24.504
concerned that exploits or zero
days or even things like the

00:08:24.504 --> 00:08:29.576
hacking team system, were the
subject of much export control

00:08:29.576 --> 00:08:33.847
if any at all. So, there was no
concern there. But, that is

00:08:33.847 --> 00:08:36.449
changing. That brings us to
today and what you may have

00:08:36.449 --> 00:08:40.653
heard of as the Wassenaar
Arrangement. The Wassenaar

00:08:40.653 --> 00:08:44.991
Arrangement is 41 countries that
agreed to control certain dual

00:08:44.991 --> 00:08:48.261
use items. The U.S. participates
in this group and the list of

00:08:48.261 --> 00:08:52.899
controlled goods is updated
every year. Here is where it

00:08:52.899 --> 00:08:55.468
gets interesting N2013, the
Wassenaar Arrangement agreed to

00:08:55.468 --> 00:09:00.573
add certain things to the list.
And this is the text of the

00:09:00.573 --> 00:09:04.811
Wassenaar Arrangement. You
wouldn't expect you to read this

00:09:04.811 --> 00:09:08.648
now and it's too small anyway,
but the key here, the language

00:09:08.648 --> 00:09:13.520
is that intrusion software will
be regulated as a dual use item

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:19.159
and as you can, I'm sure 1000
questions occur to you. What is

00:09:19.159 --> 00:09:23.430
intrusion software? And so on.
So that is really the item here

00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:30.403
that we are interested in. So,
the U.S. has committed to

00:09:30.403 --> 00:09:34.074
implementing Wassenaar
Arrangement agreement at the

00:09:34.074 --> 00:09:37.544
national level here in the U.S
so, rules will have to be

00:09:37.544 --> 00:09:42.449
written and enforced here for
all of us in the U.S. that

00:09:42.449 --> 00:09:47.821
regulate this. And on may 20,
2015, the VIS published the

00:09:47.821 --> 00:09:51.324
proposed rules for implementing
this Wassenaar Arrangement

00:09:51.324 --> 00:09:55.662
locally and most notably and of
particular concern to those in

00:09:55.662 --> 00:09:59.499
the information security and
research community, these rules

00:09:59.499 --> 00:10:02.035
seemed to go beyond the Barry
acquirements of this -- bare

00:10:02.035 --> 00:10:07.874
requirements of this simple
statement here, and that is

00:10:07.874 --> 00:10:11.044
cause of much concern that we'll
be addressing in particular

00:10:11.044 --> 00:10:16.749
here. So comments were taken on
the proposed rules and in light

00:10:16.749 --> 00:10:19.118
of those comments, some things
are happening and we'll hear

00:10:19.118 --> 00:10:22.922
about what the response to those
comments has been. So that is

00:10:22.922 --> 00:10:26.326
the broad outline what have it
is we are talking about and why

00:10:26.326 --> 00:10:30.497
we are here today and why it
matters. So, here is the plan.

00:10:30.497 --> 00:10:33.733
We are going to go forward on
the panel, each panelist here

00:10:33.733 --> 00:10:37.170
comes from a different
perspective and has some brief

00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:40.874
opening remarks. So, we are
going to hear those remarks by

00:10:40.874 --> 00:10:47.080
various panelists and then we'll
dive into some more questions

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:52.552
and hopefully things will get
pretty engaging. So with that,

00:10:52.552 --> 00:10:58.558
Mara is going to kick it off >>
MARA TAM: So this is a quick and

00:11:46.873 --> 00:11:52.879
dirty introduction to dual use
export controls. What are they

00:12:06.893 --> 00:12:09.228
for? Basically to avoid this.
They are controls designed to

00:12:09.228 --> 00:12:13.900
monitor and regulate the
ecosystems around weapons of

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:16.269
mass destruction or at least
that is where we get our modern

00:12:16.269 --> 00:12:22.108
export control regimes from.
Here is some of the stuff that

00:12:22.108 --> 00:12:25.144
export control is supposed to
regulate. Weapons of mass

00:12:25.144 --> 00:12:27.981
casualty, weapons of mass
destruction, which probably

00:12:27.981 --> 00:12:29.983
doesn't mean what you think it
means. Disruption means

00:12:29.983 --> 00:12:32.919
something a lot worse than the
Uber definition. A puppy. So,

00:12:32.919 --> 00:12:36.055
the core logic of export control
is nonproliferation. It is

00:12:36.055 --> 00:12:39.058
controlling the spread of
dangerous technologies and this

00:12:39.058 --> 00:12:43.162
is done through a couple of
mechanisms. One of them is

00:12:43.162 --> 00:12:46.899
through knowledge, which is
deemed export this is going to

00:12:46.899 --> 00:12:52.138
be of concern to a lot of people
in this room and then the

00:12:52.138 --> 00:12:55.942
transfer of stuff or required
stuff. And this is where we get

00:12:55.942 --> 00:12:59.846
into dual use. And we identify
choke point technologies for

00:12:59.846 --> 00:13:07.587
this. We want to find something
where if you control it, you can

00:13:07.587 --> 00:13:14.727
control further progress in the
development cycle. These are

00:13:14.727 --> 00:13:22.635
difficult identify. They have to
be rare and conspicuous because

00:13:22.635 --> 00:13:30.343
you need to be able to control
every iteration of it or close

00:13:30.343 --> 00:13:33.913
to it. So you can see why for
intrusion and surveillance

00:13:33.913 --> 00:13:38.117
software, that principle sort of
falls a part immediately.

00:13:38.117 --> 00:13:41.654
Command and delivery platforms
just, they are too ubiquitous

00:13:41.654 --> 00:13:47.427
they don't -- that doesn't work.
So here is a short history of

00:13:47.427 --> 00:13:52.331
the sort of dual-use we have to
work with and the International

00:13:52.331 --> 00:13:55.768
agreements for export control
that have happened sort of in

00:13:55.768 --> 00:14:01.708
the modern era. We started off
with the OEC, which this was an

00:14:01.708 --> 00:14:07.714
off shoot of marshal plan and,
they turned into the OECD. And

00:14:09.782 --> 00:14:13.152
their counterpart is the council
for mutually economic

00:14:13.152 --> 00:14:19.158
assistance, CME, because we are
adults, decided to call ComiCon.

00:14:21.594 --> 00:14:28.034
So arms exports to ComiCon
remember controlled under CoCom.

00:14:28.034 --> 00:14:31.237
These are the original CoCom
countries. So this is what he we

00:14:31.237 --> 00:14:35.575
had from about just after the
second World War until the Mid

00:14:35.575 --> 00:14:41.547
90s. And successor to CoCOm is
the Wassenaar Arrangement which

00:14:41.547 --> 00:14:47.053
mashes together Comiconn and
OECD in this lovely mix and this

00:14:47.053 --> 00:14:53.259
is what we are stuck with now.
And these are all of the U.S.

00:14:53.259 --> 00:14:57.897
task force agencies tasked with
export control reforms like all

00:14:57.897 --> 00:15:00.767
great bureaucratic disasters,
this one was inherited from the

00:15:00.767 --> 00:15:04.804
Cold War and this is one of the
issues that we have right now is

00:15:04.804 --> 00:15:07.740
that there are so many people
involved in this process that

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:12.945
getting good regulation is
really hard. So, the question I

00:15:12.945 --> 00:15:16.983
want to leave you with is, why
is a bug like a bomb? What is it

00:15:16.983 --> 00:15:21.287
about intrusion and surveillance
software and exploits that lends

00:15:21.287 --> 00:15:24.891
them or does not lend them to
regulations under a dual-use

00:15:24.891 --> 00:15:32.765
export control regime? >> With
that, we'll switch to Randy

00:15:32.765 --> 00:15:38.771
Wheeler. So let's see how we are
going to take this. >> Randy can

00:15:51.417 --> 00:15:57.423
you say something? >> RANDY
WHEELER: Yes, I can say

00:15:59.826 --> 00:16:04.730
something. Can everybody hear
me? >> She doesn't look like a

00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:11.704
dog. She is a human being. >>
RANDY WHEELER: I can hear lots

00:16:11.704 --> 00:16:17.076
of people. (Applause) What just
happened? >> MARA TAM: We

00:16:17.076 --> 00:16:22.982
finally got through to you >>
RANDY WHEELER: Me personally or

00:16:22.982 --> 00:16:28.354
both? >> MARA TAM: You,
yourself. >> RANDY WHEELER: Oh,

00:16:28.354 --> 00:16:34.260
my goodness. >> MARA TAM: I
realize you can't see everybody

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:41.801
but wave hello to DEF CON. >>
RANDY WHEELER: Hello DEF CON 23.

00:16:41.801 --> 00:16:47.173
>> Don't turn it around. Bad
idea. (Laughs) >> So, technical

00:16:47.173 --> 00:16:53.179
issues, we cannot see randy and
her slides at the same time. So

00:16:59.852 --> 00:17:05.791
now that we all had a chance to
or at least you had a chance to

00:18:42.722 --> 00:18:46.525
say hi to her, we are going to
have to switch over to her

00:18:46.525 --> 00:18:52.531
slides so you'll hear her.
You'll hear her but not see her.

00:19:00.072 --> 00:19:06.078
>> This is a two-hour meeting
for obvious reasons ( Laughs )

00:19:17.289 --> 00:19:22.762
>> RANDY WHEELER: All set? Thank
you very much for inviting me to

00:19:22.762 --> 00:19:24.830
participate in this panel. I
really appreciate the

00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:28.834
opportunity to address folks at
DEF CON. And I'm going to give a

00:19:28.834 --> 00:19:33.506
very, very brief overview of the
proposed controls on intrusion

00:19:33.506 --> 00:19:38.144
software items and IP network
systems and the Export

00:19:38.144 --> 00:19:44.150
Administration regulations that
Nate mentioned earlier. Next

00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:50.156
slide. So, my next slide isn't
working. So as Nate mention the

00:20:13.012 --> 00:20:18.150
in the Export Administration
regulations, we have national

00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:22.021
security controls on computers,
telecommunications and

00:20:22.021 --> 00:20:26.525
information security. These
listed items appear in the

00:20:26.525 --> 00:20:29.328
commerce control list, which is
part of the Export

00:20:29.328 --> 00:20:33.532
Administration regulations. And
there are other categories as

00:20:33.532 --> 00:20:39.705
well. The category 4 by part one
and two controls are a

00:20:39.705 --> 00:20:43.809
responsibility in my division,
information technology controls

00:20:43.809 --> 00:20:47.913
division. We process
approximately 2500 export

00:20:47.913 --> 00:20:53.219
license applications and also
2000 commodity classification

00:20:53.219 --> 00:20:59.225
requests per year. To date, most
of our work has been in the

00:20:59.225 --> 00:21:04.897
encryption area in the category
5 Part II. Partly because over

00:21:04.897 --> 00:21:07.867
the past several years, as
everybody knows, everything has

00:21:07.867 --> 00:21:12.505
encryption in it and so, items
that would have been in the

00:21:12.505 --> 00:21:16.408
category 4 or category 5 part
one, have moved over into the

00:21:16.408 --> 00:21:23.516
encryption control section.
Within each category, as Nate

00:21:23.516 --> 00:21:28.020
mentioned, for commodity, test
equipment and software and

00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:32.424
technology. The information
technology controls division

00:21:32.424 --> 00:21:36.529
comprises 9 licensing officers,
including myself, and we have

00:21:36.529 --> 00:21:41.333
three electronics engineers on
the staff and six export policy

00:21:41.333 --> 00:21:47.339
analysts. Next slide, please.
The new control entries, the

00:21:58.017 --> 00:22:03.489
subject of the proposed rule,
are three related list entries

00:22:03.489 --> 00:22:10.829
in category 4, Nate said system,
equipment, software, components,

00:22:10.829 --> 00:22:14.033
especially designed modified for
the generation or operation of

00:22:14.033 --> 00:22:19.538
or communication with intrusion
software. We also have a

00:22:19.538 --> 00:22:24.376
separate technology control or
technology required by the

00:22:24.376 --> 00:22:28.647
development of said intrusion
software. And then, the proposed

00:22:28.647 --> 00:22:34.820
rule also includes a definition
of intrusion software. There is

00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:39.792
also a separate entry for the
network communications

00:22:39.792 --> 00:22:44.530
surveillance system in category
5 part one, telecommunications.

00:22:47.733 --> 00:22:53.739
Next slide, please. As Nate
noted, the control list entries

00:22:58.110 --> 00:23:04.049
were proposed in the Wassenaar
Arrangement in 200013, and they

00:23:07.353 --> 00:23:11.924
were adopted by the Plenary in
December, 2013. It is worth

00:23:11.924 --> 00:23:15.594
noting that the category 4 and
category 5 proposals were

00:23:15.594 --> 00:23:19.932
submitted by two different
countries aimed at covering two

00:23:19.932 --> 00:23:27.273
different types of products. And
the interesting thing about them

00:23:27.273 --> 00:23:33.279
that was they both had an
element of human rights in the

00:23:35.848 --> 00:23:42.121
purpose of the control, the
category 4 controls were aimed

00:23:42.121 --> 00:23:46.825
at offensive systems that are
being sold not on the commercial

00:23:46.825 --> 00:23:48.961
market but directly to
governments, potentially

00:23:48.961 --> 00:23:54.967
repressive regimes to be used
against their citizens. And the

00:23:58.304 --> 00:24:04.610
same element was present in the
proposal for the category 5 part

00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:10.616
1 monitoring surveillance
systems. Once the Wassenaar

00:24:12.685 --> 00:24:18.123
Arrangement agrees to a new
Creole list entry, it's added to

00:24:18.123 --> 00:24:22.895
the multi-lateral Wassenaar
control list. And then it is up

00:24:22.895 --> 00:24:28.400
to each member country to
implement the control in its own

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:32.237
list pursuant to its own
statutory and regulatory

00:24:32.237 --> 00:24:38.410
authorities. In the United
States, the dual use list for

00:24:38.410 --> 00:24:42.514
national security product is
implemented in the commerce

00:24:42.514 --> 00:24:48.520
control list so the process is
to draft a rule and to issue the

00:24:50.823 --> 00:24:54.993
rule, usually as a final rule
usually in the may or June

00:24:54.993 --> 00:24:58.864
timeframe in a year following
the adoption on the Wassenaar

00:24:58.864 --> 00:25:06.438
list. Between December 2013 and
may 2015, there was a great deal

00:25:06.438 --> 00:25:10.709
of interagency discussion on how
to implement these new control

00:25:10.709 --> 00:25:16.815
list entrees. In the
administration regulations, we

00:25:16.815 --> 00:25:22.788
have a reason for control for
several reasons for control for

00:25:22.788 --> 00:25:27.059
the same item. We need to
determine the licensing policy,

00:25:27.059 --> 00:25:30.896
license exceptions that may
apply, and in this case, we

00:25:30.896 --> 00:25:35.267
needed to consider that there
was overlap with existing

00:25:35.267 --> 00:25:38.637
encryption controls. As I
mentioned earlier, a lot of

00:25:38.637 --> 00:25:43.175
products moved over into
category 5 Part II over the past

00:25:43.175 --> 00:25:47.212
years because they have added
encryption N this cases, we

00:25:47.212 --> 00:25:53.519
already had controls on
penetration testing products

00:25:53.519 --> 00:25:58.724
that included encryption and at
times cryptanalytic

00:25:58.724 --> 00:26:04.463
functionality, and have been
licensing them under category 5

00:26:04.463 --> 00:26:08.067
part 2. So part of the question
was, what do we do with those

00:26:08.067 --> 00:26:11.236
products? Do we change the
treatment of them? And in the

00:26:11.236 --> 00:26:18.877
proposed rule, there is a much
tighter restriction on the

00:26:18.877 --> 00:26:22.981
export of all products that
could be described under the new

00:26:22.981 --> 00:26:26.518
control list entrees, including
the penetration testing

00:26:26.518 --> 00:26:31.857
products. We published the
proposed rule in may 2015 with

00:26:31.857 --> 00:26:36.728
the request for public comments.
And boy did we receive comments.

00:26:36.728 --> 00:26:43.402
We had received almost 300
comments totaling some almost

00:26:43.402 --> 00:26:47.906
1000 pages. Many of them were
very thoughtful. Before the

00:26:47.906 --> 00:26:54.847
comment period was over, we
received many requests to meet

00:26:54.847 --> 00:27:02.488
with various groups and industry
coalitions and so forth. We were

00:27:02.488 --> 00:27:08.494
very, very grateful that there
was such interest in talking to

00:27:08.494 --> 00:27:13.298
us and explaining the issues
that the proposed rule raises.

00:27:13.298 --> 00:27:19.104
There are three areas that the
comments have greatest. The

00:27:19.104 --> 00:27:24.243
first was the implementation in
the proposed rule and as I

00:27:24.243 --> 00:27:29.414
mentioned, the restrictive
license requirements and no

00:27:29.414 --> 00:27:33.719
availability of license
exceptions which places expert

00:27:33.719 --> 00:27:39.391
license requirement on all
destinations except Canada, and

00:27:39.391 --> 00:27:43.061
all government and
non-government end users and

00:27:43.061 --> 00:27:48.267
would require an export license
for intra-company and internal

00:27:48.267 --> 00:27:55.107
use in companies for technology
and software, and it would also

00:27:55.107 --> 00:28:00.345
impose a license requirement on
deemed exports, as Nate

00:28:00.345 --> 00:28:05.050
mentioned very briefly. The
release of technology or source

00:28:05.050 --> 00:28:08.754
code, to a foreign national in
the United States is considered

00:28:08.754 --> 00:28:14.159
to be an extra to the home
country of the foreign national,

00:28:14.159 --> 00:28:18.864
and we do receive a fairly large
number of deemed expert license

00:28:18.864 --> 00:28:24.069
applications each year by
companies who want to release

00:28:24.069 --> 00:28:30.075
technology to employees who are
not U.S. nationals. And these

00:28:35.747 --> 00:28:39.751
export license requirements
would apply to the new control

00:28:39.751 --> 00:28:45.357
list entrees without any
exception. The proposed rule

00:28:45.357 --> 00:28:49.861
also is set forth a very
restrictive licensing policy

00:28:49.861 --> 00:28:56.702
with approval only to poor
countries and case-by-case to

00:28:56.702 --> 00:29:01.373
all other destinations, in
addition to the national

00:29:01.373 --> 00:29:05.844
security reason for control, it
imposed a regional stability

00:29:05.844 --> 00:29:09.881
reason for control, which is
very restrictive and it set

00:29:09.881 --> 00:29:13.051
forth a licensing policy under
the regional stability

00:29:13.051 --> 00:29:18.657
provisions of regulations.
Finally, the proposed rule set

00:29:18.657 --> 00:29:22.995
forth a denial policy for
products with zero day or route

00:29:22.995 --> 00:29:29.835
kit functionality. These terms
did not appear in the Wassenaar

00:29:29.835 --> 00:29:35.273
text. This is in addition on a
licensing policy basis in the

00:29:35.273 --> 00:29:41.279
proposed rule. Second, and we
were expecting the comments on

00:29:44.483 --> 00:29:49.454
the restrictive proposed
implementation, but we also

00:29:49.454 --> 00:29:54.993
received a very large set of
comments on the text of the

00:29:54.993 --> 00:29:58.130
Wassenaar control list entries
as well, in particular the

00:29:58.130 --> 00:30:02.267
definition of intrusion software
raises many questions and issues

00:30:02.267 --> 00:30:06.471
and the other panelists will
address some of those and their

00:30:06.471 --> 00:30:11.343
many concerns about the scope of
control on technology for the

00:30:11.343 --> 00:30:18.784
development of intrusion
software as defined. Finally,

00:30:18.784 --> 00:30:24.289
there were other issues raised
even beyond the Wassenaar text

00:30:24.289 --> 00:30:28.427
that are very important to
consider. The likelihood that

00:30:28.427 --> 00:30:32.664
the imposition of these controls
would achieve the purpose of

00:30:32.664 --> 00:30:40.038
addressing Human Rights and the
likelihood that they would even

00:30:40.038 --> 00:30:45.177
cause more harm to security
research generally. In addition,

00:30:45.177 --> 00:30:48.647
there are a number of comments
that noted that the restriction

00:30:48.647 --> 00:30:53.051
on sharing of technology on
cybersecurity research appears

00:30:53.051 --> 00:30:56.988
to be at cross purposes with
other government initiatives,

00:30:56.988 --> 00:31:00.492
including pending legislation to
encourage the sharing of such

00:31:00.492 --> 00:31:05.063
information. I forgot to tell
you to change the slide. I'm

00:31:05.063 --> 00:31:11.103
sorry. So, we are now at the
very last slide that says, next

00:31:11.103 --> 00:31:16.274
steps. The next steps in the
regulatory process, we are in

00:31:16.274 --> 00:31:20.512
the process of reviewing the
comments and again, we do

00:31:20.512 --> 00:31:26.284
appreciate all the time and
effort that all types of

00:31:26.284 --> 00:31:30.822
companies and researchers and
industry representatives and

00:31:30.822 --> 00:31:34.760
industry coalitions took to put
their thoughts down on paper. We

00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:40.732
are planning to discuss the
comments, the issues raised in

00:31:40.732 --> 00:31:46.471
the comments in a series of
technical Advisory Committee

00:31:46.471 --> 00:31:51.510
meetings in the rest of the
calendar year, and although Mara

00:31:51.510 --> 00:31:56.114
mentioned that there are so many
government agencies involved in

00:31:56.114 --> 00:31:59.785
export control, we found that in
this process, there were a

00:31:59.785 --> 00:32:02.788
number of government agencies
who are working with expertise

00:32:02.788 --> 00:32:07.259
in the cybersecurity area who
were not involved in the

00:32:07.259 --> 00:32:11.863
development of the rule. And we
hope to have them participate

00:32:11.863 --> 00:32:17.602
with us in the open discussions
with the constituencies who are

00:32:17.602 --> 00:32:20.539
interested in the issue in the
open meetings in the text call

00:32:20.539 --> 00:32:25.010
advisory committees for the rest
of the calendar year. Also,

00:32:25.010 --> 00:32:30.248
given the issues raised, we will
consult with our Wassenaar

00:32:30.248 --> 00:32:34.319
partners a number of the other
member countries have already

00:32:34.319 --> 00:32:38.323
implemented these control list
entries from their national

00:32:38.323 --> 00:32:44.696
control lists and apparently,
without some of the reaction

00:32:44.696 --> 00:32:50.535
that we have received when we
published the proposed rule. So,

00:32:50.535 --> 00:32:55.874
we would like to talk to them
about the entrees and find out

00:32:55.874 --> 00:33:00.445
how the implementation is
affecting their industries and

00:33:00.445 --> 00:33:04.316
research communities as well.
Following these three steps, we

00:33:04.316 --> 00:33:09.554
intend to draft a revised
proposed rule and again we would

00:33:09.554 --> 00:33:13.892
have opportunities for public
comments before we would publish

00:33:13.892 --> 00:33:21.032
a final rule that would go into
affect. Thank you for inviting

00:33:21.032 --> 00:33:24.202
me to participate and I look
forward to hearing the other

00:33:24.202 --> 00:33:30.208
panel member's presentations.
(Applause) >> Thank you for

00:33:34.346 --> 00:33:41.086
that. That was a helpful
explanation and thank you to the

00:33:41.086 --> 00:33:45.090
members of the audience also for
staying with us for this

00:33:45.090 --> 00:33:49.461
explanation of what if is we are
talking about and what the rules

00:33:49.461 --> 00:33:53.064
are and how this process moves
forward this is a back and forth

00:33:53.064 --> 00:33:56.101
process between research
community and many other

00:33:56.101 --> 00:34:00.472
stakeholders that are interested
in how the technologies that are

00:34:00.472 --> 00:34:05.110
used in surveillance software
may be regulated on a global

00:34:05.110 --> 00:34:09.648
scale. So this is the framework.
These are the parameters that we

00:34:09.648 --> 00:34:13.718
are working with and with that,
we can take a deeper dive into

00:34:13.718 --> 00:34:16.988
how the proposed rules are going
to potentially have some very

00:34:16.988 --> 00:34:22.994
significant impacts on the
various interests. So with that,

00:34:25.997 --> 00:34:32.003
Nate, take it away >> NATE
CARDOZO: Sure. Thank you. I'm a

00:35:01.066 --> 00:35:07.072
Staff Attorney with the
Electronic Frontier Foundation.

00:35:21.553 --> 00:35:27.559
As Jim mentioned earlier, I love
technology so I'm going pull up

00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:39.471
my notes a phone and do the
slides from the computer.

00:35:39.471 --> 00:35:45.543
Because we can't do both. John
Gilmore in 1993 or there about,

00:35:45.543 --> 00:35:49.347
told us that the net interpret
censorship and damaging routes

00:35:49.347 --> 00:35:54.652
around it. That statement is as
true today as it was more than

00:35:54.652 --> 00:35:59.491
20 years ago when Gilmore told
us and it is far more true today

00:35:59.491 --> 00:36:05.430
than it was then. Back in the
90s, the export of -- and this

00:36:07.866 --> 00:36:10.902
is a gross over simple
indication of the expert of

00:36:10.902 --> 00:36:14.539
cryptography was controlled
under itar, under the United

00:36:14.539 --> 00:36:21.046
States munitions list. As a
weapon. So this slide could not

00:36:21.046 --> 00:36:27.252
be exported from the United
States. Nowadays, we are left

00:36:27.252 --> 00:36:32.557
with the Wassenaar Arrangement.
EFF sued on behalf of Dan

00:36:32.557 --> 00:36:38.029
Bernstein in the 90s. We won. We
got a ruling that said, code is

00:36:38.029 --> 00:36:40.165
speech. And cryptography was
moved out of I tar and into the

00:36:40.165 --> 00:36:46.171
EAR. Export Administration
regulations. Now of course we

00:36:49.607 --> 00:36:53.545
are dealing with Wassenaar. Why?
This is the problem that

00:36:53.545 --> 00:36:57.849
Wassenaar was designed to solve.
That is enigma machine designed

00:36:57.849 --> 00:37:04.189
to protect German banking. It
was a commercial encryption

00:37:04.189 --> 00:37:09.427
device that was of course
repurposed during the war at

00:37:09.427 --> 00:37:16.067
first to great affect. This is
also the problem that Wassenaar

00:37:16.067 --> 00:37:20.905
was designed to solve. Not
really of course. The maker bot

00:37:20.905 --> 00:37:27.145
is not controlled under
Wassenaar. But guns are. Not

00:37:27.145 --> 00:37:31.683
guns, per se but nerve gas and
precursors, et cetera. But what

00:37:31.683 --> 00:37:36.221
about information? How do you
control the export of

00:37:36.221 --> 00:37:40.091
information? And I would propose
that it's not going to work any

00:37:40.091 --> 00:37:43.962
better this time than it did the
last time. Because we have

00:37:43.962 --> 00:37:49.968
things like this. I can export
information very, very easily.

00:37:52.871 --> 00:37:56.774
But what do we do? There is an
actual problem smear it's a

00:37:56.774 --> 00:38:03.481
significant one. What do woo do
about things like this? Packing

00:38:03.481 --> 00:38:07.886
team, these are pieces of
software that I really don't

00:38:07.886 --> 00:38:13.658
want in the hands of repressive
regimes around the world. What

00:38:13.658 --> 00:38:20.431
do we do about it? As Randy
said, one of the things about

00:38:20.431 --> 00:38:23.401
the way that export controls
work especially in the United

00:38:23.401 --> 00:38:26.905
States and the way the proposed
rule that we are talking about

00:38:26.905 --> 00:38:32.143
today works, is that it controls
exports period to anyone talking

00:38:32.143 --> 00:38:37.515
to your coworker who is not a
U.S. person, that is controlled

00:38:37.515 --> 00:38:42.787
it doesn't matter if you're
selling thin fisher to the

00:38:42.787 --> 00:38:47.792
government in Ethiopia or
selling medicine to a pin tester

00:38:47.792 --> 00:38:54.332
in Chile. Those are both
controlled. One of those uses

00:38:54.332 --> 00:38:59.938
I'm fine with. The other one,
I'm not so happy about. But

00:38:59.938 --> 00:39:06.411
there are already tools
available I would suggest that

00:39:06.411 --> 00:39:13.384
going to end use or end user
control is a lot better, right?

00:39:13.384 --> 00:39:18.923
This is an actual Cisco slide
talking about how Cisco is going

00:39:18.923 --> 00:39:22.060
to help the Chinese government
build a golden firewall to

00:39:22.060 --> 00:39:28.566
combat evil religion and other
hostilities. This kind of thing

00:39:28.566 --> 00:39:31.536
is what we should be worried
about. We should be worried

00:39:31.536 --> 00:39:37.742
about our technology companies
building the tools as Human

00:39:37.742 --> 00:39:41.579
Rights abuse. The Wassenaar
Arrangement is intended to

00:39:41.579 --> 00:39:47.518
control things like this but it
ends up sweeping way too much.

00:39:47.518 --> 00:39:54.993
Because it doesn't take an end
user control. Here is another

00:39:54.993 --> 00:39:59.530
thing that I'm worried about
this is a hacking team e-mail

00:39:59.530 --> 00:40:06.904
talking about sales to the
government in Ethiopia. I feel -

00:40:06.904 --> 00:40:11.142
Electronic Frontier Foundation
and representing Ethiopian suing

00:40:11.142 --> 00:40:17.382
the government for wiretapping
his Skype calls. So I would

00:40:17.382 --> 00:40:21.953
propose to you that there are
other tools besides a blanket

00:40:21.953 --> 00:40:26.724
export control regime that are
better suited to holding

00:40:26.724 --> 00:40:31.663
companies responsible for doing
things like building the great

00:40:31.663 --> 00:40:35.767
firewall of China in the
specific evil religion plug in

00:40:35.767 --> 00:40:40.705
that Cisco built or thin fisher
selling to the government of

00:40:40.705 --> 00:40:44.175
Ethiopia with full knowledge
that it was being used against

00:40:44.175 --> 00:40:51.182
journalists activists,
dissidents and -- so that is

00:40:51.182 --> 00:40:55.520
where I come from. And I'll turn
it over to -- who goes next?

00:40:55.520 --> 00:41:01.459
Matt? David? (Applause) >>
DAVID: I'm going to start off

00:41:07.498 --> 00:41:14.238
real quick with, I guess, a bio,
in case you forgot who I am and

00:41:14.238 --> 00:41:17.875
why I'm here talking to you
guys. And the reason for that is

00:41:17.875 --> 00:41:24.248
that my first employer out of --
well, during college, was the

00:41:24.248 --> 00:41:28.686
National Security Agency. And I
since started immunity, which is

00:41:28.686 --> 00:41:32.190
a company many of you know of
because we have a free debugger,

00:41:32.190 --> 00:41:35.526
which is surprising to me but
that shows how awesome my

00:41:35.526 --> 00:41:39.564
marketing skills are. I also
have a mailing list called daily

00:41:39.564 --> 00:41:43.468
Dave, which is discussing a lot
of this Wassenaar. I can't

00:41:43.468 --> 00:41:47.739
pronounce it properly. Activity.
And we became very concerned

00:41:47.739 --> 00:41:51.642
when we first saw it coming down
the pike. In particular, because

00:41:51.642 --> 00:41:57.949
we sell to the general public 3
or 4 major tools. We have

00:41:57.949 --> 00:42:02.387
canvass, which competes with --
and core impact and I assume

00:42:02.387 --> 00:42:06.190
many of you have used one of
these tools to do operational

00:42:06.190 --> 00:42:09.794
penetration testing, which is
something that is required by

00:42:09.794 --> 00:42:14.232
PCI or required by HIPPA or
almost everything that is

00:42:14.232 --> 00:42:18.369
security related. Of course we
also sell Silica, which does

00:42:18.369 --> 00:42:21.672
wireless penetration testing
which qualifies as a crypto

00:42:21.672 --> 00:42:26.010
analytic tool under the BIS
regulations. We also have a

00:42:26.010 --> 00:42:29.680
conference called infiltrate
which focuses on offensive and

00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:34.052
attack technologies and offers
people a way to be very honest

00:42:34.052 --> 00:42:39.223
about what it is we do. And so,
my whole life has been spent

00:42:39.223 --> 00:42:43.227
building command and delivery
platforms essentially and that

00:42:43.227 --> 00:42:49.300
is the exact sort of behavior
that these people, some people

00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:53.905
find uncomfortable which is a
necessary part of our existence

00:42:53.905 --> 00:42:56.641
in order to understand and
secure ourselves. It's been said

00:42:56.641 --> 00:43:01.479
that pressie won't come up on
his laptop but also been said

00:43:01.479 --> 00:43:07.151
that defense is the child of
offense and so, for those of us

00:43:07.151 --> 00:43:10.321
in this room who work on
offensive things, I think we can

00:43:10.321 --> 00:43:16.627
all spend one hour of our time
to reply to the simple to use

00:43:16.627 --> 00:43:20.364
website and it surprised me more
than anybody, that BIS has an

00:43:20.364 --> 00:43:24.802
amazingly easy to use website
for submitting comments. You can

00:43:24.802 --> 00:43:27.705
read the regulation about 15
minutes. You'll never understand

00:43:27.705 --> 00:43:31.175
it so don't even try. But you
can read it and then you can

00:43:31.175 --> 00:43:34.412
write comments on it that say
what or how it would affect your

00:43:34.412 --> 00:43:37.615
daily life and it will take but
an hour. You can do it during

00:43:37.615 --> 00:43:41.352
Simpons reruns or something. So
make it funny. Just don't

00:43:41.352 --> 00:43:45.022
include curse words or anything
crazy. And I think the next

00:43:45.022 --> 00:43:48.459
round for comments should not be
1000 pages. I think it should be

00:43:48.459 --> 00:43:52.130
100 --> 000 pages. I think that
Randy would very much enjoy

00:43:52.130 --> 00:43:55.166
having everyone at this
conference, everyone here is

00:43:55.166 --> 00:43:58.135
impacted by this rule in a major
way. The only reason I'm

00:43:58.135 --> 00:44:03.508
involved is because we pay our
lawyers a lot of money to keep

00:44:03.508 --> 00:44:06.944
us out of trouble. But no one in
this room wants to pay these

00:44:06.944 --> 00:44:09.313
lawyers all that mon-- they do.
The lawyers do. I'm not a

00:44:09.313 --> 00:44:14.652
lawyer. But the lawyers would
enjoy that. And I don't think

00:44:14.652 --> 00:44:19.590
you should have to. And I think
it's a uniquely-unAmerican thing

00:44:19.590 --> 00:44:24.295
to control the export of
information, which in a sense,

00:44:24.295 --> 00:44:28.466
the human voice is the original
export technology for

00:44:28.466 --> 00:44:31.002
information, and I think we
should try to keep that voice

00:44:31.002 --> 00:44:34.005
free from any kind of
overbearing regulation as a

00:44:34.005 --> 00:44:39.410
matter of course. We almost have
pressie. It's amazing. I can go

00:44:39.410 --> 00:44:45.416
on for hours. So here is my per
suspect. And it's your

00:45:08.706 --> 00:45:13.377
perspective at the end of my 5
minutes. Which is that export

00:45:13.377 --> 00:45:17.915
control is a bad idea for
anything in this area and we are

00:45:17.915 --> 00:45:21.118
talking a lot about the
intrusion software part of it.

00:45:21.118 --> 00:45:27.224
Let me say it is already trying
to frame the discussion because

00:45:27.224 --> 00:45:29.994
when they say intrusion
software, they mean anything

00:45:29.994 --> 00:45:33.698
that does anything useful in
security. When they say

00:45:33.698 --> 00:45:36.934
surveillance software, they also
link in anything that does

00:45:36.934 --> 00:45:41.138
intrusion detection and
anticrime wear on any scale. And

00:45:41.138 --> 00:45:44.442
I'm going to talk more about
that. But this, I believe, it

00:45:44.442 --> 00:45:49.614
should be and is difficulty --
Randy can't see it. I'm sorry.

00:45:49.614 --> 00:45:54.619
It says here, you can see it?
No? She seen it already. Okay.

00:45:54.619 --> 00:45:58.889
So Thomas Jefferson, among many
things should be our guiding

00:45:58.889 --> 00:46:02.493
light when it comes to
protecting ourselves against

00:46:02.493 --> 00:46:06.297
attorney and we should avoid
ourselves becoming the form of

00:46:06.297 --> 00:46:09.734
tyranny. And that is what they
are doing us to do. And if you

00:46:09.734 --> 00:46:13.971
read the definitions in the
thing, it should scare you not

00:46:13.971 --> 00:46:17.475
that the definitions are there,
but that they were ever allowed

00:46:17.475 --> 00:46:21.646
to be put into the regulation at
all. Something went horribly

00:46:21.646 --> 00:46:24.181
wrong with the whole process.
And I'm going give you an

00:46:24.181 --> 00:46:27.218
example that no one talked about
yet, which is carrier grade.

00:46:27.218 --> 00:46:29.987
Forever those who have ever
worked in telecommunications,

00:46:29.987 --> 00:46:34.191
which is a lot of you, carrier
grade by definition means

00:46:34.191 --> 00:46:37.828
reliable. It's a marketing term.
And how I think it got in the

00:46:37.828 --> 00:46:40.998
regulations is that I think
privacy International used it in

00:46:40.998 --> 00:46:43.334
a random report. They are like,
we are scared of anything

00:46:43.334 --> 00:46:50.007
carrier grade. But carrier grade
is not a metric for speed, yet

00:46:50.007 --> 00:46:54.378
if you -- if I made you zoom in
on this thing, in the actual

00:46:54.378 --> 00:47:01.852
defense of the regulation that
BIS had, they said, well, we

00:47:01.852 --> 00:47:05.823
think it's anything fast enough
for a city or a country but we

00:47:05.823 --> 00:47:09.727
won't put an actual number on
it. And the reason for that is

00:47:09.727 --> 00:47:12.563
because there is no number. And
if you did put a number on it,

00:47:12.563 --> 00:47:15.733
it would have to go up
exponentially over time. I love

00:47:15.733 --> 00:47:18.703
in south beach. Not that I'm
recruiting because my company

00:47:18.703 --> 00:47:23.207
awesome. But you shouldn't move
to it for south beach. But south

00:47:23.207 --> 00:47:28.779
beach has like every apartment
can get 500 megabytes your door

00:47:28.779 --> 00:47:31.649
via a mesh network someone set
up. You can do the same thing in

00:47:31.649 --> 00:47:38.322
New York and San Francisco. And
at what speed is carrier class?

00:47:38.322 --> 00:47:43.327
We are a small city. So, I don't
understand what the bar is.

00:47:43.327 --> 00:47:46.897
There is no bar what they mean
is, we mean what we mean when we

00:47:46.897 --> 00:47:50.134
say what we mean. Right? And
that is, this should scare you

00:47:50.134 --> 00:47:54.939
because the penalties are so
high for all of us, for breaking

00:47:54.939 --> 00:47:58.542
these regulations, that you're
guaranteed to break them and

00:47:58.542 --> 00:48:02.012
you're guaranteed to be under
that own us. What is a route

00:48:02.012 --> 00:48:06.217
kit? The it's not in there. This
was a program -- if this was a

00:48:06.217 --> 00:48:12.323
program, this document would
have never compiled. Support

00:48:12.323 --> 00:48:16.660
zero to exploitation. First of
all, zero day is not a term you

00:48:16.660 --> 00:48:20.965
can define because it means
something you don't know. And

00:48:20.965 --> 00:48:23.934
everyone has different amounts
of knowledge so things that one

00:48:23.934 --> 00:48:28.205
of you knows may not be a zero
day to me. They may be something

00:48:28.205 --> 00:48:31.609
I have sitting around that I
don't think is important. And so

00:48:31.609 --> 00:48:35.446
to support zero day, simply
means you can run a program. So

00:48:35.446 --> 00:48:38.949
everything that qualifies as a
command and delivery platform

00:48:38.949 --> 00:48:43.154
can in fact be modular and run
programs this is an extremely

00:48:43.154 --> 00:48:46.791
low bar and yet it is under the
default denial section of the

00:48:46.791 --> 00:48:49.794
regulation, which means that at
some point, they thought this

00:48:49.794 --> 00:48:54.565
will be fine. And that is just
the beginning. Here is what is

00:48:54.565 --> 00:48:56.667
going to happen with the next
regulation they come out with.

00:48:56.667 --> 00:49:00.704
There will be a million more
examples just like this. We have

00:49:00.704 --> 00:49:03.774
a process that is creating
programs that cannot compile and

00:49:03.774 --> 00:49:07.011
making them with laws with hew
ming us penalties. That's what

00:49:07.011 --> 00:49:12.316
is broken here. And the
overreach in this area has

00:49:12.316 --> 00:49:16.454
massive, massive dangerous
implications. Deemed exports

00:49:16.454 --> 00:49:21.692
alone means those who have H1Bs
are cast out of our community as

00:49:21.692 --> 00:49:26.630
per eyas. Technical data is
something that you, as a human

00:49:26.630 --> 00:49:29.767
being, cannot understand but the
lawyers among us will argue

00:49:29.767 --> 00:49:32.870
about for years at 1000 dollars
an hour to tell you if you're

00:49:32.870 --> 00:49:37.074
allowed to open your mouth and
talk not person next to you.

00:49:37.074 --> 00:49:40.444
Required for -- again, some of
these phrases should scare you

00:49:40.444 --> 00:49:43.981
because if you as a person,
can't understand if what you're

00:49:43.981 --> 00:49:48.352
creating and exporting is
required for the building and

00:49:48.352 --> 00:49:52.323
delivery of command and delivery
systems, then you're at risk no

00:49:52.323 --> 00:49:55.392
matter what you do. And that is
what this regulation does. It

00:49:55.392 --> 00:49:58.729
puts all of us under this giant
sword so the people who knock on

00:49:58.729 --> 00:50:02.566
your door, can say by the way, I
noticed you were violating the

00:50:02.566 --> 00:50:05.603
law. We love to you cooperate on
something else. That would be

00:50:05.603 --> 00:50:10.641
awesome. I can make this stuff
go away. And there was a very

00:50:10.641 --> 00:50:13.777
bizarre section in the
regulation when they went to

00:50:13.777 --> 00:50:17.748
defend it on their phone calls
as they started getting some

00:50:17.748 --> 00:50:20.451
heat, which said that if you
release it to the public or

00:50:20.451 --> 00:50:24.655
vendor you're okay. But if you
release it to just private

00:50:24.655 --> 00:50:28.559
industry, you're not okay. And
we are talking about some value

00:50:28.559 --> 00:50:32.863
decisions in the disclosure
arguments that don't reflect

00:50:32.863 --> 00:50:37.368
this community at all and don't
reflect the industry at all. And

00:50:37.368 --> 00:50:40.604
again, just to nail this point
down, penetration testing

00:50:40.604 --> 00:50:42.606
software, which is this current
regulation would have been

00:50:42.606 --> 00:50:49.480
restricted as much as a nuclear
bomb, is a required operational

00:50:49.480 --> 00:50:55.619
practice for every company in
America. And I think we talked

00:50:55.619 --> 00:50:59.857
briefly, especially Mara did,
that export control if you're

00:50:59.857 --> 00:51:02.526
going to apply it, should at
least have some hope of

00:51:02.526 --> 00:51:05.529
accomplishing the desired goals.
I don't believe that the desired

00:51:05.529 --> 00:51:09.166
goals are worth accomplishing
but I want to run this down

00:51:09.166 --> 00:51:12.303
here. Here is how you protect
those poor journalists and

00:51:12.303 --> 00:51:14.571
activist against thin fisher and
gamma. Give them an iPad.

00:51:14.571 --> 00:51:16.573
Because neither can attack
unpatched iPads. So that is

00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:27.518
cheap. I'm willing to donate
iPads to these people to avoid

00:51:27.518 --> 00:51:32.222
regulation because I think it is
a cheap way to do it. Here is

00:51:32.222 --> 00:51:36.594
what you don't do. Ban all
software that makes you

00:51:36.594 --> 00:51:42.599
uncomfortable at great costs to
the rest of the world. And I

00:51:42.599 --> 00:51:45.235
think we should talk a little
bit about licensing because even

00:51:45.235 --> 00:51:49.907
permissive licensing kills sales
and retards innovation. Because

00:51:49.907 --> 00:51:53.744
in order to go through the
encryption controls, you

00:51:53.744 --> 00:51:56.981
currently have to wait one month
after developing your software

00:51:56.981 --> 00:51:59.650
and this is almost all software
because the rule is, anything

00:51:59.650 --> 00:52:03.620
that links the live SSV under
this rule. And if you do

00:52:03.620 --> 00:52:06.323
anything to your crip tow that
changes your crypto or how to

00:52:06.323 --> 00:52:09.893
use your crip tow, you're
supposed to send them a note and

00:52:09.893 --> 00:52:13.597
explain it and describe it and
wait 30 days and then you can do

00:52:13.597 --> 00:52:16.433
a release. And so if you
wondered why core impact and

00:52:16.433 --> 00:52:21.905
canvass are on a monthly release
cycle, this is why. And it's

00:52:21.905 --> 00:52:26.677
extremely difficult to innovate
under this kind of condition.

00:52:26.677 --> 00:52:30.681
And of course, anyone actually
malicious f there was a

00:52:30.681 --> 00:52:34.418
malicious Ethiopian person that
Nate doesn't like for some

00:52:34.418 --> 00:52:39.223
reason, then they could always
get a account. That's what they

00:52:39.223 --> 00:52:43.560
are going to do. Even at the
best chances, there is no way

00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:46.330
export control could work even
if it was meant to work, which

00:52:46.330 --> 00:52:53.904
it is not. So, I think this
community, all 700 people in

00:52:53.904 --> 00:52:57.541
here, are largely of the opinion
that code is not a weapon. Code

00:52:57.541 --> 00:53:01.912
is speech. And I think part of
the reason of that is, we

00:53:01.912 --> 00:53:05.549
understand something at a much
more basic level, which is that

00:53:05.549 --> 00:53:09.553
you can break down any fact into
an infinite number of smaller

00:53:09.553 --> 00:53:12.456
facts, which you can then
combine in combinations to

00:53:12.456 --> 00:53:17.094
produce the original fact. So
for example, if I was going to

00:53:17.094 --> 00:53:20.531
write a paper on if you have the
extended instruction pointer,

00:53:20.531 --> 00:53:23.901
then you can use a certain
technique to by pass ASLR and

00:53:23.901 --> 00:53:26.270
then I would write a separate
paper on, here is how I would

00:53:26.270 --> 00:53:29.940
get the IP using adobe reader
and a particular technique. And

00:53:29.940 --> 00:53:35.245
if I could bind those things up,
those are controllable. But if

00:53:35.245 --> 00:53:37.648
you I don't, they are not
controllable. That's the key

00:53:37.648 --> 00:53:41.018
problem with regulation in any
space where we are trying to

00:53:41.018 --> 00:53:48.725
regulate speech in this way. And
of course, the irony in this is

00:53:48.725 --> 00:53:52.696
that when you see people who are
privacy activists, a spousing

00:53:52.696 --> 00:53:55.399
these kinds of controls, they
are not looking forward to the

00:53:55.399 --> 00:53:58.969
obvious next step, which is to
enforce them, you need a global

00:53:58.969 --> 00:54:03.373
surveillance network, which is a
horrible thing to have to put in

00:54:03.373 --> 00:54:10.514
to their hats. So in summary,
their idea is bad and they

00:54:10.514 --> 00:54:13.951
should feel bad. And in the end,
what is going do happen if this

00:54:13.951 --> 00:54:18.088
stuff goes through as is, or
even close to as is, is it that

00:54:18.088 --> 00:54:20.691
all of you are going to feel
bad. So I'm hoping that everyone

00:54:20.691 --> 00:54:24.528
takes that hour to comment on
the next one and we can further

00:54:24.528 --> 00:54:29.533
influence it by means of killing
it. And that's what I have got.

00:54:29.533 --> 00:54:33.003
And hopefully everyone agrees
with me and we can all go.

00:54:42.546 --> 00:54:46.717
(Applause) >> So, I'm Matt and I
should say in spite of the

00:54:46.717 --> 00:54:50.554
introduction, I'm not a lawyer.
Though I do occasionally

00:54:50.554 --> 00:54:54.825
impersonate one. I'm a Computer
Science Professor. And one

00:54:54.825 --> 00:54:59.997
question is, what am I doing
here? I am working in this

00:54:59.997 --> 00:55:05.903
abstract field and I'm not
directly a target of these

00:55:05.903 --> 00:55:10.340
regulations in the sense that
nobody thinks that what I do and

00:55:10.340 --> 00:55:14.945
what people like me do is bad
and needs to be regulated. I

00:55:14.945 --> 00:55:17.681
mean, the worst people say about
what I do is that it is useless

00:55:17.681 --> 00:55:23.153
and stupid. But I don't think
anybody says that what I do is

00:55:23.153 --> 00:55:29.960
harmful. And I don't think even
the Wassenaar advocates think

00:55:29.960 --> 00:55:34.898
that academic published research
in this area is something that

00:55:34.898 --> 00:55:37.834
is supposed to be regulated or
at least that's not a

00:55:37.834 --> 00:55:43.640
particularly common feeling. So,
it would be very easy for me as

00:55:43.640 --> 00:55:46.410
an academic to say this is
something that I should sit out

00:55:46.410 --> 00:55:49.580
and watch and let people with
the vested interest like Dave,

00:55:49.580 --> 00:55:55.485
fight this out for their
interests. And in particular,

00:55:55.485 --> 00:56:01.425
the work that I do, when you
look a little closer at how it

00:56:04.094 --> 00:56:11.068
actually gets done and how these
regulations to be implemented,

00:56:11.068 --> 00:56:15.839
particularly over time I start
to become a lot more worried.

00:56:15.839 --> 00:56:21.178
And one reason is that, my job
is to think of things and

00:56:21.178 --> 00:56:26.149
publish papers for the greater
good and I publish things and

00:56:26.149 --> 00:56:30.187
fundamentally that's a defensive
activity. The more we learn

00:56:30.187 --> 00:56:35.726
about what to do, its more
robust systems we can build. But

00:56:35.726 --> 00:56:39.429
at the level of work that we are
doing, the distinction is

00:56:39.429 --> 00:56:42.266
meaningless. We can't study
defense without studying offense

00:56:42.266 --> 00:56:48.272
and in fact if you look at the
papers that we publish, we tend

00:56:50.340 --> 00:56:54.444
to flip around between defense
work and overtly defense,

00:56:54.444 --> 00:56:59.950
overtly offense back and forth.
Somebody publishes defense, and

00:56:59.950 --> 00:57:03.186
then attack and at the end of
that arms race we end up with

00:57:03.186 --> 00:57:08.492
something a little bit stronger.
So fundamentally, I'm in the

00:57:08.492 --> 00:57:12.429
offense business as much as I'm
in the defense business. Another

00:57:12.429 --> 00:57:15.766
thing that should reassure me is
I don't produce products or

00:57:15.766 --> 00:57:20.504
export things or sell things.
But it is true that

00:57:20.504 --> 00:57:25.309
fundamentally what we are doing
is not producing in the academic

00:57:25.309 --> 00:57:28.011
research world. We are not
producing code that we are

00:57:28.011 --> 00:57:34.318
selling to people or code we are
incorporating into attack

00:57:34.318 --> 00:57:41.958
products. But when you look at
the process, there is quite a

00:57:41.958 --> 00:57:46.229
bit of code exchanged and there
is quite a bit of exporting

00:57:46.229 --> 00:57:53.804
going on. About half depending
on your institution, will go up

00:57:53.804 --> 00:57:59.743
or down but it's certainly in
the ballpark. About half of our

00:57:59.743 --> 00:58:03.013
graduate students are foreign
nationals and that's generally

00:58:03.013 --> 00:58:07.951
true at any research oriented
University. People come to the

00:58:07.951 --> 00:58:11.855
United States to study this
stuff. We have colleagues in

00:58:11.855 --> 00:58:15.792
another countries that we
collaborate with and the process

00:58:15.792 --> 00:58:22.199
of producing research is often
involved with a process of

00:58:22.199 --> 00:58:27.037
experimentation exchanging code
and working on things. The

00:58:27.037 --> 00:58:30.474
export regulations, effectively
limit what I can say privately

00:58:30.474 --> 00:58:36.480
with my colleagues prior to
publication, and that means

00:58:39.416 --> 00:58:42.085
essentially it's not regulating
the output of my work, it's

00:58:42.085 --> 00:58:46.289
regulating the process of doing
my work in order to produce that

00:58:46.289 --> 00:58:49.960
output. So people who say, you
don't have to worry because

00:58:49.960 --> 00:58:53.263
you're papers are published by
the first amendment, you don't

00:58:53.263 --> 00:58:58.869
have to worry because this only
affects attack tools and you're

00:58:58.869 --> 00:59:03.173
not selling attack tools. And
you're not exporting things over

00:59:03.173 --> 00:59:07.077
-- that's true about the output
but not true about the process

00:59:07.077 --> 00:59:10.647
necessarily. So even though
there are many reassuring

00:59:10.647 --> 00:59:14.351
reasons to think that this is
work that shouldn't or that I

00:59:14.351 --> 00:59:20.123
and people like me shouldn't
worry about, when we drill down

00:59:20.123 --> 00:59:23.860
to the actuality process, this
is something that me and my

00:59:23.860 --> 00:59:30.567
colleagues have to be worried
about every day. Now I'm lucky

00:59:30.567 --> 00:59:35.505
that I work for a big fancy
pants institution that can

00:59:35.505 --> 00:59:42.846
afford lawyers. And fortunately,
at my institution, the lawyers

00:59:42.846 --> 00:59:47.417
that we employ generally, see as
their job finding ways for me to

00:59:47.417 --> 00:59:52.756
do my work instead of finding
ways to stop me from doing work.

00:59:52.756 --> 00:59:55.525
And as soon as -- but as soon as
I talk to them about export

00:59:55.525 --> 00:59:59.629
rules, that flips. The answer
tends to be, you're taking some

00:59:59.629 --> 01:00:04.401
risk here. You need to worry
about that. We better go and get

01:00:04.401 --> 01:00:08.839
a license to do this before you
do that. Unfortunately, I have

01:00:08.839 --> 01:00:13.243
the support where they will help
me with this, but these are

01:00:13.243 --> 01:00:19.049
extremely difficult rules to
comply with even in the easy

01:00:19.049 --> 01:00:22.519
case where you know that you
don't have to make an argument,

01:00:22.519 --> 01:00:25.922
where you just have to go
through the motion. Many people

01:00:25.922 --> 01:00:28.825
who are doing research of the --
at the same caliber or higher

01:00:28.825 --> 01:00:30.827
than people like me at
universities, aren't affiliated

01:00:30.827 --> 01:00:35.398
with universities and don't have
that kind of institutional

01:00:35.398 --> 01:00:41.605
support. So for me, with
institutional support, it's

01:00:41.605 --> 01:00:45.375
hard. Somebody without
institutional support, it

01:00:45.375 --> 01:00:50.013
becomes kind of a death nail.
Now the last thing I worry about

01:00:50.013 --> 01:00:57.220
is, as a Veteran of cryptowars 1
in the 1990s before we needed to

01:00:57.220 --> 01:01:02.325
number the cryptowars, the
primary thing we were talking

01:01:02.325 --> 01:01:06.863
about was export law.
Cryptography was covered under

01:01:06.863 --> 01:01:14.404
ITAR and the lever the
government had to regulate

01:01:14.404 --> 01:01:17.941
cryptography was not that there
were rules about using

01:01:17.941 --> 01:01:21.511
cryptography domestically, but
that there were rules about

01:01:21.511 --> 01:01:28.485
using cryptography
Internationally. And that was

01:01:28.485 --> 01:01:33.924
what we were talking about in
the first cryptowars. Now we won

01:01:33.924 --> 01:01:40.363
that and now we -- largely
deregulated most consumer-grade

01:01:40.363 --> 01:01:44.868
and research-grade crypt oh, but
what that illustrates to me is

01:01:44.868 --> 01:01:51.041
the way that regulations that
are intended to accomplish one

01:01:51.041 --> 01:01:56.379
set of policy goals here when
they are implemented, in the

01:01:56.379 --> 01:02:02.285
future, can be used to
accomplish other policy goals

01:02:02.285 --> 01:02:06.590
that weren't even on the table
or being considered by the

01:02:06.590 --> 01:02:11.661
people proposing them. And I
worry here, that today we look

01:02:11.661 --> 01:02:15.465
at this and we say, nobody is
meaning to regulate academic

01:02:15.465 --> 01:02:21.438
inquiry into computer security.
That may not be true 10 years

01:02:21.438 --> 01:02:28.345
from now under the trump
administration or what have you.

01:02:28.345 --> 01:02:36.319
And, these rules may change in
the regulatory tone may change

01:02:36.319 --> 01:02:41.524
later. So, this is something
that I find worth engaging in

01:02:41.524 --> 01:02:46.463
and I think you need to consider
whether it is something that you

01:02:46.463 --> 01:02:52.469
need to engage in as well. So
thanks. (Applause) >> So I also

01:02:57.774 --> 01:03:00.343
note that we have these little
buzzers that make funny noises

01:03:00.343 --> 01:03:03.580
and we were supposed to press
them if anybody disagrees with

01:03:03.580 --> 01:03:09.519
each other. And nobody seems to
disagree with anything any of us

01:03:09.519 --> 01:03:13.623
said. >> I disagree we won the
cryptowar. I think we actually

01:03:13.623 --> 01:03:18.795
lost. So two of you said we won.
But when you sell software,

01:03:18.795 --> 01:03:22.232
anywhere, in the country
externally, bays every piece of

01:03:22.232 --> 01:03:27.370
software uses crypto in some
way, you're under very strict

01:03:27.370 --> 01:03:32.275
regulatory frameworks and as
much as like you're going to get

01:03:32.275 --> 01:03:35.612
a license, the fact is, you're
sales process is going to be

01:03:35.612 --> 01:03:39.249
pretty messed up. You're sending
away to the government a list of

01:03:39.249 --> 01:03:41.451
all of your customers, which
some of you may feel

01:03:41.451 --> 01:03:45.255
uncomfortable with and many
other regulatory issues with

01:03:45.255 --> 01:03:49.125
even understanding. These are
not simple. These are some of

01:03:49.125 --> 01:03:53.463
the most complex convoluted laws
on the planet that you, as a

01:03:53.463 --> 01:03:57.834
simple researcher, are now being
required to understand or else

01:03:57.834 --> 01:04:00.336
be under severe penalty. The
same thing true of kepto. I

01:04:00.336 --> 01:04:05.008
think we lost. That's my
personal opinion >> Let me jump

01:04:05.008 --> 01:04:10.513
on something that Dave just
said. The rules are very

01:04:10.513 --> 01:04:13.983
difficult to understand. And I'm
a lawyer so I'm going to look at

01:04:13.983 --> 01:04:16.419
this through a U.S.
constitutional law perspective.

01:04:16.419 --> 01:04:18.421
And this is again, going to be a
gross over simple indication. In

01:04:18.421 --> 01:04:23.426
constitutional law in the U.S.,
we have a doctrine called, void

01:04:23.426 --> 01:04:29.833
for vagueness. If a criminal law
is vague enough that an average

01:04:29.833 --> 01:04:33.303
person of ordinary intelligence
can't tell whether their conduct

01:04:33.303 --> 01:04:37.040
would be criminalized or not,
that law fails constitutional

01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:44.147
scrutiny. We have seen that it
is most common in hate speech or

01:04:44.147 --> 01:04:51.888
in excitement context. But it
works here too. If an ordinary

01:04:51.888 --> 01:04:57.060
person of average intelligence
reads the Wassenaar control list

01:04:57.060 --> 01:05:01.631
and can't understand them, then
the implementation of those

01:05:01.631 --> 01:05:06.669
control list would be denial of
due process and unconstitutional

01:05:06.669 --> 01:05:10.640
>> And that gets to one of the
sort of core issues about export

01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:13.543
control which is like I said
earlier, you can't control

01:05:13.543 --> 01:05:17.013
something if it is -- you can't
choose a choke point technology

01:05:17.013 --> 01:05:20.817
if it is ubiquitous. So when
something is omnipresent liken

01:05:20.817 --> 01:05:24.554
corruption like the command and
delivery platforms, you run into

01:05:24.554 --> 01:05:29.392
the same problem. You don't
know. And therefore the control

01:05:29.392 --> 01:05:37.167
fails. >> I think it is telling
that in fact, BIS has on their

01:05:37.167 --> 01:05:41.704
website web applications that
run you through an expert system

01:05:41.704 --> 01:05:46.276
to determine if certain phrases
apply to you. Such as required

01:05:46.276 --> 01:05:50.713
for, or as needed by. There are
little phrases in the regulation

01:05:50.713 --> 01:05:54.184
that you cannot understand. Only
the expert system can

01:05:54.184 --> 01:05:57.487
understand. And I think they are
minute to help you but they

01:05:57.487 --> 01:06:00.523
design -- meant to help you but
they demonstrate the design of

01:06:00.523 --> 01:06:04.460
the arguments is already vague
and if you talk to your local

01:06:04.460 --> 01:06:08.164
export control individual, which
unfortunately immunity gets the

01:06:08.164 --> 01:06:13.069
privilege of doing a lot, they
will tell you as well that even

01:06:13.069 --> 01:06:16.906
the lawyers underbuys don't
really have a clear

01:06:16.906 --> 01:06:19.609
understanding of it. That they
can explain to you, for example,

01:06:19.609 --> 01:06:22.645
what soft swear meant to be old
and what is not. Because these

01:06:22.645 --> 01:06:25.782
issues are so complex and they
are rarely going to court it's

01:06:25.782 --> 01:06:32.655
been really rare to see the
crypto stuff result in a penalty

01:06:32.655 --> 01:06:36.659
against a company. But that's
not as important as whether or

01:06:36.659 --> 01:06:39.762
not it is used as a hammer in
general, which I think should

01:06:39.762 --> 01:06:46.002
scare you more. >> It's pretty
well established that the rules

01:06:46.002 --> 01:06:50.607
are intended to prevent the
availability of surveillance

01:06:50.607 --> 01:06:54.544
software to repressive regimes.
But there are questions about

01:06:54.544 --> 01:06:59.148
whether or not these rules are
effective in doing that and

01:06:59.148 --> 01:07:03.786
whether they would also sweep in
lots of legitimate software at

01:07:03.786 --> 01:07:09.025
the same time, if we could use
that term. So, I'd like to give

01:07:09.025 --> 01:07:15.164
Randy an opportunity to respond
to that and sort of give more

01:07:15.164 --> 01:07:22.939
context into how the rules are
being tailored to cover just

01:07:22.939 --> 01:07:29.512
what the original intent was. >>
RANDY WHEELER: I think the

01:07:29.512 --> 01:07:36.419
comments are right on point,
that the Wassenaar control list

01:07:36.419 --> 01:07:41.758
attempts to describe particular
products, particular

01:07:41.758 --> 01:07:47.764
functionalities, and the in
stent to narrowly define what

01:07:50.566 --> 01:07:55.338
was going to be controlled, but
in fact, what we have learned

01:07:55.338 --> 01:08:02.378
from the public comment process,
is that either the language is

01:08:02.378 --> 01:08:08.918
not well stated so that
reasonable people with

01:08:08.918 --> 01:08:13.957
potentially different
vocabularies are reading the

01:08:13.957 --> 01:08:20.229
language differently, and as
well a number of unknown or

01:08:20.229 --> 01:08:25.735
unexpected products or
activities are being swept into

01:08:25.735 --> 01:08:30.873
the control and that's we want
to address going forward. Is

01:08:30.873 --> 01:08:36.679
there a way to capture only the
products that we are interested

01:08:36.679 --> 01:08:43.186
in captureing and only licensing
those exports that are of

01:08:43.186 --> 01:08:48.391
concern. Certainly from an
administrative law perspective,

01:08:48.391 --> 01:08:56.299
and as a regulator, I think it's
poor use of government resources

01:08:56.299 --> 01:09:00.269
and a very poor use of company
and industry and researcher

01:09:00.269 --> 01:09:06.275
resources to -- (Broken audio)
>> She is gone. We lost her.

01:09:19.188 --> 01:09:25.194
Network resources, too. >> Who
wants to say something

01:09:27.196 --> 01:09:33.202
controversial? >> I think she
might be back. Hold on. Are you

01:09:35.471 --> 01:09:38.074
back? >> RANDY WHEELER: I'm back
>> You said resources and then

01:09:38.074 --> 01:09:46.082
you disappeared >> RANDY
WHEELER: Sorry. I just meant

01:09:46.082 --> 01:09:49.452
that I think it is a poor use of
everybody's resources, both the

01:09:49.452 --> 01:09:56.225
government resources and
industry or researchers

01:09:56.225 --> 01:10:01.964
resources to spend time worrying
about transactions, export

01:10:01.964 --> 01:10:06.302
transactions, or deemed export
transactions, that are subject

01:10:06.302 --> 01:10:12.141
to a policy of approval. There
is no point in requiring

01:10:12.141 --> 01:10:16.212
licenses for those types of
activities and so we should work

01:10:16.212 --> 01:10:21.451
to only cover those transaction
that is would be of concern >>

01:10:21.451 --> 01:10:27.023
So in order to cover just those
certain transactions, it seems

01:10:27.023 --> 01:10:33.329
like it is a project of
definitions. And, a lot of what

01:10:33.329 --> 01:10:38.735
the concern is, how intrusion
software is being defined and I

01:10:38.735 --> 01:10:42.038
think there is a bigger question
as to whether or not intrusion

01:10:42.038 --> 01:10:44.740
software is -- of any kind of
meaningful definition. So, I'd

01:10:44.740 --> 01:10:49.112
like to open that up to Randy
first, and also I'd like to hear

01:10:49.112 --> 01:10:52.048
from the rest of the panel about
if there is anything to be had

01:10:52.048 --> 01:10:54.050
there. >> RANDY WHEELER: I would
quickly agree with you from the

01:10:54.050 --> 01:10:59.989
comments we received. It is
problematic definition. Again,

01:11:05.995 --> 01:11:12.001
the people who are in -- we have
government regulators trying to

01:11:14.604 --> 01:11:16.606
define this and then when people
who actually deal in the

01:11:16.606 --> 01:11:24.580
products and technology that
look up the definition, it

01:11:24.580 --> 01:11:29.385
either doesn't -- they don't
understand it what it was

01:11:29.385 --> 01:11:33.389
intended to do or they used the
vocabulary differently and that

01:11:33.389 --> 01:11:39.095
is up for regulation then if
there is lack of understanding

01:11:39.095 --> 01:11:44.100
of what it covers. And
particularly if it is understood

01:11:44.100 --> 01:11:47.069
to be broader than it was
supposed to be, then it needs to

01:11:47.069 --> 01:11:53.075
be revised. The frequently asked
questions were an attempt to

01:11:55.077 --> 01:11:58.381
address that but we got to the
point where even in the answers

01:11:58.381 --> 01:12:02.985
to the questions, that we posted
our website, we were referring

01:12:02.985 --> 01:12:06.689
back to the regulatory language,
and we just kind of got stuck

01:12:06.689 --> 01:12:11.427
because we didn't have the
correct vocab layer tow address

01:12:11.427 --> 01:12:14.697
the issues that were being
raised. So that is what we hope

01:12:14.697 --> 01:12:21.304
to look into in the next step of
the discussions. Thank you. >>

01:12:21.304 --> 01:12:28.244
So one of the things that we
asked in our comments to BIS,

01:12:28.244 --> 01:12:33.416
which was also echoed by Google
among others, is that congress

01:12:33.416 --> 01:12:38.921
department and I guess, the
State Department, go back to the

01:12:38.921 --> 01:12:42.892
Wassenaar Arrangement itself.
The next meeting is at the end

01:12:42.892 --> 01:12:50.166
of this year and work on
clarifying Americans through BIS

01:12:50.166 --> 01:12:53.736
but working with the 41 member
states of the Wassenaar

01:12:53.736 --> 01:12:59.775
Arrangements to add clarity to
the control list there. Software

01:12:59.775 --> 01:13:04.113
that modifies the standard
execution path of a program.

01:13:04.113 --> 01:13:10.720
What does that mean? Why are we
focusing on that? And that is

01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:13.990
not something that BIS can do
alone. That is something that

01:13:13.990 --> 01:13:18.794
needs to go back to the
Wassenaar Arrangement itself. So

01:13:18.794 --> 01:13:20.796
that is our best case scenario
if BIS didn't just do a revised

01:13:20.796 --> 01:13:26.802
proposed rule and open it back
up for comments but that BIS and

01:13:30.473 --> 01:13:36.545
State Department go to Wassenaar
and change the control list

01:13:36.545 --> 01:13:41.117
there to make it better and then
do revised proposed ruling >>

01:13:41.117 --> 01:13:44.820
And by make them better, he
means let's just remove this.

01:13:44.820 --> 01:13:48.891
Because there is no good way to
do this. What you hear from

01:13:48.891 --> 01:13:52.895
people -- he doesn't agree but
he's wrong. If I agreed with him

01:13:52.895 --> 01:13:55.965
we would both be wrong and that
would be terrible. And here is

01:13:55.965 --> 01:14:00.002
the thing. They would say
regulation in this space is

01:14:00.002 --> 01:14:03.506
inevitable so you might as well
as an industry feel free to come

01:14:03.506 --> 01:14:06.976
up with language you're willing
to be bound by. And I will tell

01:14:06.976 --> 01:14:11.781
you this, that is a fool's
errand. And it is a trap you

01:14:11.781 --> 01:14:16.519
should not fall into and I think
even if you could describe all

01:14:16.519 --> 01:14:21.357
of today's software you found,
the reality is, you're also

01:14:21.357 --> 01:14:24.894
describing software that in the
next generation is going to be

01:14:24.894 --> 01:14:27.830
required for normal operational
business. Because is this say

01:14:27.830 --> 01:14:32.001
community that moves far faster
than regulation and always will

01:14:32.001 --> 01:14:34.837
and always should if we are
going to survive. And I think

01:14:34.837 --> 01:14:37.673
that when they say please
describe some language that

01:14:37.673 --> 01:14:41.310
works for us today, you should
say, I need language that works

01:14:41.310 --> 01:14:44.947
for us forever and it's not
possible and therefore we should

01:14:44.947 --> 01:14:48.351
not do it. >> MARA TAM: Also
worth noting the convolution

01:14:48.351 --> 01:14:51.220
actioner rising from the
Wassenaar language is due in

01:14:51.220 --> 01:14:55.224
large part to the fact that
Wassenaar was never designed for

01:14:55.224 --> 01:14:59.729
Human Rights purposes. I mean,
this was a - auto export control

01:14:59.729 --> 01:15:05.434
regime that Wassenaar inherited
was all about controlling arms.

01:15:05.434 --> 01:15:10.039
And several advocacy groups,
namely International end cause,

01:15:10.039 --> 01:15:13.976
decision E. decision to get
these category 4 and 5 entries

01:15:13.976 --> 01:15:17.747
added and they were successful.
One of the irritating things

01:15:17.747 --> 01:15:21.283
about that is they knew that
Wassenaar was not fit for

01:15:21.283 --> 01:15:24.987
purchases. They knew that export
control would not work for these

01:15:24.987 --> 01:15:28.791
items. But they persisted. And
unfortunately, we are dealing

01:15:28.791 --> 01:15:32.461
with that right now and goods
intentions and all of that but

01:15:32.461 --> 01:15:39.435
this was not the right way to go
about it. >> From my

01:15:39.435 --> 01:15:44.707
perspective, it's not the
software that is a problem. What

01:15:44.707 --> 01:15:49.211
hacking team does, what thin
fishy do, it's a standard remote

01:15:49.211 --> 01:15:55.217
administration tool. You can use
any of the remote administration

01:15:57.219 --> 01:16:02.858
tools would have worked just as
well to spy on my client in the

01:16:02.858 --> 01:16:07.263
Ethiopia lawsuit. What we care
about, what matters isn't the

01:16:07.263 --> 01:16:10.933
tool itself it's the service
support and most importantly

01:16:10.933 --> 01:16:14.537
training that comes along with
it. Thin fisher doesn't cost

01:16:14.537 --> 01:16:18.607
very much but getting your
intelligence agency all strained

01:16:18.607 --> 01:16:22.211
up to use it and the ongoing
support contract is what gamma

01:16:22.211 --> 01:16:26.682
makes its money on. That's the
problem. These tools -- it's not

01:16:26.682 --> 01:16:31.487
the tool. It's what goes -- it's
the infrastructure surrounding

01:16:31.487 --> 01:16:37.493
it. The Wassenaar Arrangement
was -- sort of designed to take

01:16:40.529 --> 01:16:44.300
that into account. Intrusion
software is not controlled under

01:16:44.300 --> 01:16:48.170
the Wassenaar Arrangement it's
the infra structure around

01:16:48.170 --> 01:16:51.841
intrusion software that is
controlled. Technology required

01:16:51.841 --> 01:16:57.146
for this et cetera. But without
tailoring it specifically to

01:16:57.146 --> 01:17:02.251
state uses. And it is those
state uses that we see causing

01:17:02.251 --> 01:17:06.255
significant harm out there in
the real world. >> Keep in mind,

01:17:06.255 --> 01:17:11.193
under U.S. law f I'm correct,
anything that is designed

01:17:11.193 --> 01:17:14.196
specifically for U.S. government
or military use would be

01:17:14.196 --> 01:17:17.533
controlled under ITAR and the
same -- this is something that

01:17:17.533 --> 01:17:20.402
no one mentioned is that
actually half of the team was

01:17:20.402 --> 01:17:23.172
perfectly well regulated under
the Wassenaar and they went to

01:17:23.172 --> 01:17:26.242
the government and said can I
have a license? The government

01:17:26.242 --> 01:17:32.047
says yes you can for anyone you
want. So even if under the most

01:17:32.047 --> 01:17:35.384
strict interpretation of thieves
regulations, the reality is

01:17:35.384 --> 01:17:40.289
those chomps operated out of
smaller countries, which would

01:17:40.289 --> 01:17:42.992
be every company in this
business if U.S. decides to

01:17:42.992 --> 01:17:46.595
implement these regulations, can
easily go to their government

01:17:46.595 --> 01:17:50.699
and ask for an out anyway. So
even if there was a perfect

01:17:50.699 --> 01:17:54.436
language that applied only tow
really bad things, which we

01:17:54.436 --> 01:17:57.473
don't know what are, but if
there was perfect language, it

01:17:57.473 --> 01:18:00.976
still wouldn't work because you
would have every company going

01:18:00.976 --> 01:18:05.014
to their government saying, I
want an out >> An alternative

01:18:05.014 --> 01:18:08.217
you have to worry about pushing
these governments into

01:18:08.217 --> 01:18:11.820
capabilities developments and I
think Nate raises a good point

01:18:11.820 --> 01:18:15.357
which is it is the back end
support which leads these

01:18:15.357 --> 01:18:21.630
technologies to be so harmful in
those context. But if these

01:18:21.630 --> 01:18:27.369
states surveillance agencies are
no longer to buy off the rack,

01:18:27.369 --> 01:18:33.075
they will move to capabilities
development for themselves and

01:18:33.075 --> 01:18:36.178
that is a very serious problem.
There is no unwritten law of

01:18:36.178 --> 01:18:39.715
cyber cyb that says Bahrainian
engineers couldn't come up with

01:18:39.715 --> 01:18:43.419
an equivalent of packing teams
RCS especially now the source

01:18:43.419 --> 01:18:49.491
code is leaked. So controlling
this from the Tom down simply

01:18:49.491 --> 01:18:52.361
will not work. >> Especially
when we are talking about

01:18:52.361 --> 01:18:55.464
activities that are done by 10
people with computers you can

01:18:55.464 --> 01:19:00.970
buy off the shelf. I think that
is -- the inefficiency of

01:19:00.970 --> 01:19:04.440
regulation in this space can't
be overstated. >> So we are

01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:08.811
getting a good sense of what the
objectives are. It would be

01:19:08.811 --> 01:19:13.649
great if you could fill us in on
where these objectives come

01:19:13.649 --> 01:19:18.654
from. I think a lot of people
might make the criticism that it

01:19:18.654 --> 01:19:24.560
may be -- or ask the question as
to whether or not it is properly

01:19:24.560 --> 01:19:28.530
within the scope of the mission
of BIS or commerce or the

01:19:28.530 --> 01:19:33.569
government to be taking the
position as to what types of

01:19:33.569 --> 01:19:40.009
software should be made
available to any particular

01:19:40.009 --> 01:19:44.046
regime. So the question is,
where does these regulations of

01:19:44.046 --> 01:19:47.616
course don't say on their face,
you can't sell to a particular

01:19:47.616 --> 01:19:50.753
repressive regime and doesn't
define who they are. It defines

01:19:50.753 --> 01:19:56.292
the thing. So if you can give us
insight into where the input on

01:19:56.292 --> 01:19:59.895
these particular sets of
regulations are coming from

01:19:59.895 --> 01:20:05.901
within the U.S >> >> So, there
isn't an export control of

01:20:16.345 --> 01:20:19.982
community involved with the
Export Administration regulation

01:20:19.982 --> 01:20:24.887
prescribed by statute. State
Department, defense department,

01:20:24.887 --> 01:20:31.093
and Department of Commerce. And
we all provide expert group

01:20:31.093 --> 01:20:35.264
members to attend the Wassenaar
discussions. The consensuses?

01:20:35.264 --> 01:20:41.270
2013, that -- the consensus was
in 2013 there was a set of

01:20:47.943 --> 01:20:52.581
products that was of concern
within the scope of the

01:20:52.581 --> 01:21:00.356
Wassenaar man date, that
addresses dual use products that

01:21:00.356 --> 01:21:07.496
can be used by the military or
by civilian agencies for

01:21:07.496 --> 01:21:14.536
civilian uses and so that is how
the language was added to the

01:21:14.536 --> 01:21:19.808
Wassenaar list. And then I think
that it is fair to say that

01:21:19.808 --> 01:21:23.445
immediately, even though we have
the understanding at the time,

01:21:23.445 --> 01:21:30.586
what the products were described
in the language that that was

01:21:30.586 --> 01:21:35.290
not perhaps a good understanding
and the public comments

01:21:35.290 --> 01:21:39.361
certainly born that out that
there are many products in this

01:21:39.361 --> 01:21:43.799
space that could be considered
to be described in the language

01:21:43.799 --> 01:21:49.338
that were not intended to be
controlled under the controllist

01:21:49.338 --> 01:21:55.377
entrees. So we don't have a
disagreement here. There was an

01:21:55.377 --> 01:21:59.782
intent to control certain
products but a good number of

01:21:59.782 --> 01:22:03.552
products were then swept in the
technical description and that

01:22:03.552 --> 01:22:07.890
is what we are dealing with now.
And all of the comments so far

01:22:07.890 --> 01:22:13.395
have echoed the comments we
received in the public process

01:22:13.395 --> 01:22:19.468
and we'll be certainly taken
seriously under consideration

01:22:19.468 --> 01:22:24.139
going forward. >> So speaking of
-- thank you for that answer.

01:22:24.139 --> 01:22:27.476
So, speaking of the public
process, we'd like to open up

01:22:27.476 --> 01:22:30.779
the floor here just to audience
questions. So they'll have to --

01:22:30.779 --> 01:22:34.316
we don't have a mic for the
audience so we'll have to make

01:22:34.316 --> 01:22:38.220
do and repeat the questions and
we would love to hear your input

01:22:38.220 --> 01:22:44.226
and of course panelists, feel
free to jump in. Line up behind

01:22:47.429 --> 01:22:53.435
Joe. >> AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Off
mic) >> So the question was, is

01:23:09.318 --> 01:23:15.224
the only reason we control crypt
oh, the Wassenaar Arrangement?

01:23:15.224 --> 01:23:18.794
And then the second part is, is
there any good reason to control

01:23:18.794 --> 01:23:25.133
the export of crypt analysis? So
the answer to the first question

01:23:25.133 --> 01:23:31.673
is, no. We have controlled
crypto since -- that's a

01:23:31.673 --> 01:23:35.844
pre-Wassenaar thing. And then
the second half of it is, why do

01:23:35.844 --> 01:23:39.047
we still? >> MARA TAM: So
cryptography was controlled

01:23:39.047 --> 01:23:46.021
under CoCom, the predecessor to
the Wassenaar arrangement and

01:23:46.021 --> 01:23:49.124
it's worth noting when
encryption came first came under

01:23:49.124 --> 01:23:55.998
export control, it was not as
sort of insane as it sounds now.

01:23:55.998 --> 01:23:59.167
I mean, encryption was a big boy
toy. It was something that

01:23:59.167 --> 01:24:02.871
nation states did. It was not --
in the era before personal

01:24:02.871 --> 01:24:06.975
computing it was not ubiquitous.
So, export control might have

01:24:06.975 --> 01:24:11.346
made sense at some point. I
don't think it still does. >>

01:24:11.346 --> 01:24:16.351
And that was another thing which
I, in the comment section after

01:24:16.351 --> 01:24:19.488
the Electronic Frontier
Foundation said, is before we

01:24:19.488 --> 01:24:23.926
attempted to do anything more in
surveillance software, let's

01:24:23.926 --> 01:24:29.531
decontrol encryption entirely.
I'm not sure they will do that

01:24:29.531 --> 01:24:34.803
but that was what I asked for >>
And crypto export controls are

01:24:34.803 --> 01:24:41.576
perfect examples of one policy
goal when the regulations were

01:24:41.576 --> 01:24:45.547
originally enacted to keep
crypto boxes out of the hands of

01:24:45.547 --> 01:24:52.321
military adversaries. Perfectly
good public policy goal if there

01:24:52.321 --> 01:24:55.357
are crypto boxes and military
adversaries that might be able

01:24:55.357 --> 01:25:00.095
to exploit them. And then
software got invented. And

01:25:00.095 --> 01:25:03.665
suddenly, we are now worrying
about law enforcement

01:25:03.665 --> 01:25:07.469
domestically and these
regulations that were enacted

01:25:07.469 --> 01:25:12.307
for a purpose completely
different from what they are

01:25:12.307 --> 01:25:17.679
being enforced for >> So Randy,
just quickly on the crypto

01:25:17.679 --> 01:25:22.851
subject, that is obviously not
part of Wassenaar, crypto has

01:25:22.851 --> 01:25:30.692
been regulated more tightly in
the past and the regulations we

01:25:30.692 --> 01:25:33.395
have now are relatively now more
relaxed. Can you give us insight

01:25:33.395 --> 01:25:36.298
into any trends that BIS with
respect to how crypto might be

01:25:36.298 --> 01:25:42.304
regulated going forward >> RANDY
WHEELER: Certainly a lot of

01:25:45.107 --> 01:25:49.611
changes to the encryption
entrees T is a Wassenaar control

01:25:49.611 --> 01:25:54.249
under category 5 part two. I
have been involved in the

01:25:54.249 --> 01:25:58.987
program, unfortunately we had a
series of de-controls in the

01:25:58.987 --> 01:26:02.758
encryption provisions. But in
the same way that we have the

01:26:02.758 --> 01:26:09.297
technical description issues in
the proposed control list

01:26:09.297 --> 01:26:14.036
entrees, we have them in the
encryption provisions as well.

01:26:14.036 --> 01:26:18.473
For example, I would point to a
couple of new decontrol notes, L

01:26:18.473 --> 01:26:25.047
and M, that we just implemented
in the regulations this May and

01:26:25.047 --> 01:26:28.583
again, they are technical
descriptions that are not

01:26:28.583 --> 01:26:34.623
exactly product descriptions and
we are in my office still trying

01:26:34.623 --> 01:26:39.127
to work through exactly what
product these de-control notes

01:26:39.127 --> 01:26:44.232
cover and don't cover. And these
are decontrol notes L and M so

01:26:44.232 --> 01:26:49.638
that means there are several
others starting with A. And we

01:26:49.638 --> 01:26:53.442
go through all of this and it's
a very broad control with many

01:26:53.442 --> 01:26:58.980
different carve outs and notes
and so forth. We have limited

01:26:58.980 --> 01:27:03.051
the encryption controls to
products whose primary function

01:27:03.051 --> 01:27:06.788
is communications computing
networking or information

01:27:06.788 --> 01:27:13.528
security, which makes
refrigerators not subject, that

01:27:13.528 --> 01:27:17.065
have the alarm system that is
have encryption. And that is a

01:27:17.065 --> 01:27:20.936
good thing that didn't happen
until 2010. We are still working

01:27:20.936 --> 01:27:24.673
on that. We still would like to
have a positive list. We would

01:27:24.673 --> 01:27:31.713
welcome public participation in
that process as well to try to

01:27:31.713 --> 01:27:38.019
make the rules more concise, and
more understandable. There are

01:27:38.019 --> 01:27:42.557
many permissive provisions in
the encryption area. Many

01:27:42.557 --> 01:27:49.865
license exceptions that is very
broad and for example, it

01:27:49.865 --> 01:27:53.301
applies to almost all deemed
exports of technology. So, we

01:27:53.301 --> 01:27:59.307
have a very permissive regime in
the end but a lot of text to get

01:28:02.043 --> 01:28:06.515
there. And certainly it could
use a lot of improvement. I

01:28:06.515 --> 01:28:09.050
could talk about the encryption
controls all day. I have a

01:28:09.050 --> 01:28:16.725
day-long seminar that goes from
soup to nuts. And we would like

01:28:16.725 --> 01:28:21.463
to continue to improve them and
again, we welcome public

01:28:21.463 --> 01:28:26.134
participation through the
Advisory Committee process for

01:28:26.134 --> 01:28:32.140
that purpose >> Perhaps one day
there will be day-long seminars

01:28:36.444 --> 01:28:42.450
what intrusion software is. So,
we have got -- we have a line up

01:28:49.558 --> 01:28:55.564
of questions. So we should take
the next one. >> AUDIENCE

01:29:00.735 --> 01:29:06.741
MEMBER: (Off mic) >> I think the
question is -- sorry if I'm

01:29:11.947 --> 01:29:17.953
paraphrasing. I didn't hear the
whole thing. I think you're

01:29:21.323 --> 01:29:26.595
getting as, technology changed
and the sues of technology

01:29:26.595 --> 01:29:29.764
changed, are the regulations
still relevant or are the

01:29:29.764 --> 01:29:32.634
regulations following the
technology in an appropriate

01:29:32.634 --> 01:29:38.640
way? >> I think he is almost
saying as well that did we tell

01:29:38.640 --> 01:29:42.444
the NSA. This metadata might be
more important than data by

01:29:42.444 --> 01:29:46.848
allowing people to export crypto
because PGP uses rare. Anyone

01:29:46.848 --> 01:29:50.452
using PGP therefore needs to be
looked at. And when we

01:29:50.452 --> 01:29:53.622
deregulate a little bit but not
too much, it's not everywhere,

01:29:53.622 --> 01:29:57.225
it's not omnipresent so you can
do a sort and select on people

01:29:57.225 --> 01:30:00.662
just using crypto for targeting.
That's a good question and no

01:30:00.662 --> 01:30:03.965
one here has the answer >>
That's not why crypto moved out

01:30:03.965 --> 01:30:09.971
of ITAR. Because we won our case
>> Or he has the answer >> We

01:30:14.075 --> 01:30:18.413
got the stronger crypto controls
that resulted in export grade

01:30:18.413 --> 01:30:24.185
encryption back in the 90s. We
got those controls deemed

01:30:24.185 --> 01:30:26.321
unconstitutional. That's why it
was -- that's why those controls

01:30:26.321 --> 01:30:32.327
are slightly less. So the
question is, was the value of

01:30:35.363 --> 01:30:38.600
meat data part of the reason
that national security

01:30:38.600 --> 01:30:45.507
establishment in the United
States was okay with that? I

01:30:45.507 --> 01:30:51.513
think that they weren't quite
thinking along those lines at

01:31:31.753 --> 01:31:37.759
that time. >> Next question,
colin? >> AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Off

01:32:18.032 --> 01:32:24.038
mic) >> Someone has to repeat
that >> Let me just paraphrase

01:32:30.512 --> 01:32:37.752
into a couple -- how did the
crypto regulations affect you,

01:32:37.752 --> 01:32:43.358
me, in my daily work? And the
short answer is, the crypto

01:32:43.358 --> 01:32:47.462
regulations probably don't hurt
my daily work that much because

01:32:47.462 --> 01:32:52.333
I have already spent enormous
investment in figuring out where

01:32:52.333 --> 01:32:57.005
those boundaries are and I'm
really comfortable with where --

01:32:57.005 --> 01:33:00.775
knowing at least where some of
the bright lines are and how I

01:33:00.775 --> 01:33:04.145
do my work without crossing
them. When it comes to intrusion

01:33:04.145 --> 01:33:08.883
software, those lines are
inherently a lot more blurry and

01:33:08.883 --> 01:33:13.555
I think what it will sheen I
spend a lot more time talking to

01:33:13.555 --> 01:33:21.196
our lawyers at my very generous
University and less time doing

01:33:21.196 --> 01:33:23.565
my day job, which is filing
grant applications. >> So for

01:33:32.040 --> 01:33:35.810
Randy, I think the question -- I
don't know if you heard all of

01:33:35.810 --> 01:33:39.113
that. But I think there is -- we
have a lingerie question as to

01:33:39.113 --> 01:33:45.120
what kind of exceptions are
there or would there be for

01:33:47.989 --> 01:33:50.558
research use perhaps, on
unintrusion software and those

01:33:50.558 --> 01:33:57.799
technologies required to build
intrusion software? >> RANDY

01:33:57.799 --> 01:34:02.237
WHEELER: We are starting at the
point with everything being

01:34:02.237 --> 01:34:05.039
controlled under the proposed
rule. The possibilities going

01:34:05.039 --> 01:34:11.045
forward are from my point of
view, endless. They could be

01:34:15.216 --> 01:34:20.155
certainly a broad license
exception this could be changes

01:34:20.155 --> 01:34:26.694
to the control language. So it
really depends how the

01:34:26.694 --> 01:34:32.500
discussion proceeds over the
next few months. >> Thank you >>

01:34:32.500 --> 01:34:37.839
I'll just add a quick -- even
academics occasionally end up

01:34:37.839 --> 01:34:43.845
finding themselves on the wrong
end of export control

01:34:43.845 --> 01:34:47.115
investigation. And it doesn't
happen that often. But it does

01:34:47.115 --> 01:34:53.121
happen in very significant ways.
In physics and in bio and to a

01:34:57.492 --> 01:35:04.299
lesser extent information
systems. I don't think you can

01:35:04.299 --> 01:35:10.271
paint it with that specific a
brush. >> Colin is the one

01:35:10.271 --> 01:35:14.642
person on earth who likes this
thing. So if you want to know

01:35:14.642 --> 01:35:17.478
more about that position, I
recommend you listen to his

01:35:17.478 --> 01:35:21.516
Twitter. I think we have time
for one more question. There is

01:35:21.516 --> 01:35:27.522
two. Two more questions. >> Make
it quick. >> AUDIENCE MEMBER:

01:35:36.497 --> 01:35:40.101
(Off mic) >> Colin is speaking
on a different Wassenaar panel

01:35:40.101 --> 01:35:44.572
tomorrow, I think. Tomorrow?
Tomorrow morning. >> You might

01:35:44.572 --> 01:35:47.208
want to ask why they didn't
invite any of you guys to

01:35:47.208 --> 01:35:51.379
comment before they put this
regulation down your throats. >>

01:35:54.015 --> 01:35:59.520
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Off mic) >> I
don't know if you noticed the

01:35:59.520 --> 01:36:04.959
presence of Randy Wheeler on the
panel. So the question was, are

01:36:04.959 --> 01:36:12.166
any of us in favor of regulation
at all? And if not, why don't we

01:36:12.166 --> 01:36:17.272
have a balanced panel and of
course we have Randy who is the

01:36:17.272 --> 01:36:21.509
Director of Export. >> But there
is a long discussion about this

01:36:21.509 --> 01:36:24.946
stuff. Feel free to post to
daily Dave column if you wish to

01:36:24.946 --> 01:36:31.452
propose things. >> I think that
the point is a valid one that as

01:36:31.452 --> 01:36:37.458
the software industry continues
to mature, and as a world where

01:36:42.063 --> 01:36:46.467
we transition more towards a
future cyber war, these

01:36:46.467 --> 01:36:53.007
technologies are going to or
will become more and more

01:36:53.007 --> 01:36:58.046
relevant on the battlefield and
there will be increasing

01:36:58.046 --> 01:37:01.315
government interest not just in
the U.S. but increasing

01:37:01.315 --> 01:37:04.252
government interest globally in
setting up some kind of

01:37:04.252 --> 01:37:08.089
regulatory regime. So it
shouldn't come as a surprised we

01:37:08.089 --> 01:37:11.959
are here today and I think this
is probably the first of quite a

01:37:11.959 --> 01:37:18.433
few discussions like this we
will have >> I'll say I'm not --

01:37:18.433 --> 01:37:23.538
I'm not sure that I would make a
broad statement saying that no,

01:37:23.538 --> 01:37:27.041
none of this should ever be
regulated in any way. I can

01:37:27.041 --> 01:37:33.147
imagine all sorts of bad thing
that could be done with the

01:37:33.147 --> 01:37:38.186
kinds of software being
discussed here that may well

01:37:38.186 --> 01:37:43.691
deserve regulation. I don't know
how to draft regulations without

01:37:43.691 --> 01:37:47.428
enormous collateral damage. >>
And I would be in favor of

01:37:47.428 --> 01:37:51.532
regulation that controls the
provision of support for these

01:37:51.532 --> 01:37:55.303
kinds of technologies to
government end users. That would

01:37:55.303 --> 01:38:00.308
be a regulation I would get
behind. So, I don't care about

01:38:00.308 --> 01:38:08.182
-- I don't care about a remote
administration tool. What I care

01:38:08.182 --> 01:38:12.720
about is the provision of
support to the domestic version

01:38:12.720 --> 01:38:18.126
of NSA all across the world.
That should require a license.

01:38:18.126 --> 01:38:22.864
The tool itself, the technology
behind it, you just go and get

01:38:22.864 --> 01:38:26.868
that >> Maybe not an export
license. Maybe it should just be

01:38:26.868 --> 01:38:29.403
something you can sue people in
U.S. court about like we're

01:38:29.403 --> 01:38:32.774
doing already and it shouldn't
be done in export control at >>

01:38:32.774 --> 01:38:36.677
so with respect to who is for
regulation. It's worth pointing

01:38:36.677 --> 01:38:40.848
out as Randy noted earlier,
there will be another round of

01:38:40.848 --> 01:38:44.986
proposed rules and another
comment period. And I know that

01:38:44.986 --> 01:38:50.124
the BIS is very interested in
hearing comments from everybody

01:38:50.124 --> 01:38:53.861
who may be interested in
submitting them and she

01:38:53.861 --> 01:39:00.601
referenced the number of them
earlier today. So, I'd like to

01:39:00.601 --> 01:39:06.774
hear her advice on what kind of
comments are most helpful to BIS

01:39:06.774 --> 01:39:10.378
in figuring out how to do this.
But with the comment about who

01:39:10.378 --> 01:39:14.515
is for regulation, BIS is not in
the business of making value

01:39:14.515 --> 01:39:17.485
judgments about whether or not
certain things should be

01:39:17.485 --> 01:39:20.922
regulated or not it's there to
fulfill the mission and do the

01:39:20.922 --> 01:39:24.859
best job it can so comments in
general that are directed to,

01:39:24.859 --> 01:39:28.362
this is really horrible, go
away, you're idiots, this is

01:39:28.362 --> 01:39:32.500
dumb. That kind of thing is not
really helpful obviously. So if

01:39:32.500 --> 01:39:36.737
you could provide something more
helpful than that to guiding us

01:39:36.737 --> 01:39:41.209
how to move forward with the
comments. >> RANDY WHEELER:

01:39:41.209 --> 01:39:47.882
Well, again, the public comment
period for the proposed rule has

01:39:47.882 --> 01:39:53.454
closed. We certainly will accept
additional public comments but

01:39:53.454 --> 01:39:58.759
they won't necessarily be in the
record. But we do want to

01:39:58.759 --> 01:40:03.397
identify specific issues from
the comments that we received

01:40:03.397 --> 01:40:09.203
the most important ones, and to
try to flush those out and have

01:40:09.203 --> 01:40:14.075
all interested parties issues
the ecosystem, the

01:40:14.075 --> 01:40:17.445
constituencies, including
government agencies, that are

01:40:17.445 --> 01:40:24.418
involved in cybersecurity, to
weigh in and help us, the inner

01:40:24.418 --> 01:40:31.392
agency, go forward as
appropriate. Beyond that, I'm

01:40:31.392 --> 01:40:36.864
not sure that there will be
another proposed rule. It will

01:40:36.864 --> 01:40:40.334
not be a final rule based on
this proposed rule so there will

01:40:40.334 --> 01:40:44.505
be an opportunity for more
public comments. We do have the

01:40:44.505 --> 01:40:48.576
technical Advisory Committee
meetings which we will advertise

01:40:48.576 --> 01:40:53.314
published in the Federal
Register and we can have open

01:40:53.314 --> 01:41:00.254
sessions where interested
parties can discuss the issues

01:41:00.254 --> 01:41:03.858
that have been identified and we
do hope to have broad

01:41:03.858 --> 01:41:07.194
participation in that process
during the rest of the calendar

01:41:07.194 --> 01:41:13.200
year. Thank you. >> I have one
more question. >> Hi. There

01:41:15.536 --> 01:41:18.806
seems to be pretty good
consensus among the panelists on

01:41:18.806 --> 01:41:26.681
the definitions being not the
best, and ubiquity of some tools

01:41:26.681 --> 01:41:31.385
and so forth. I wanted to
follow-up on the issue of

01:41:31.385 --> 01:41:35.656
service being a service provider
and support and the sort of

01:41:35.656 --> 01:41:39.994
customer that you're selling
these tools to or people selling

01:41:39.994 --> 01:41:44.498
the tools to. Nate, one of his
first slide, is it a government

01:41:44.498 --> 01:41:48.002
enduser or somebody else? Is
there a different regulatory

01:41:48.002 --> 01:41:54.008
approach that would conceivably
work to focus on who are the

01:41:54.008 --> 01:41:57.478
buyers and what are they doing
with it? Or do you lose it

01:41:57.478 --> 01:42:02.216
because if you sell to like an
Ethiopian small businessman that

01:42:02.216 --> 01:42:06.554
eventually -- would be in the
hands of the Ethiopian

01:42:06.554 --> 01:42:11.559
government? >> That's a good
point. >> So I think it's a good

01:42:11.559 --> 01:42:13.761
question for Randy. If I
understand the question

01:42:13.761 --> 01:42:20.201
correctly, under a licensing
regime, how do you discern who

01:42:20.201 --> 01:42:24.638
the end customer is as part of a
licensing process? So if someone

01:42:24.638 --> 01:42:31.779
is selling to a oppressive
regime or just selling to random

01:42:31.779 --> 01:42:35.583
interested perhaps researchers
in that same country? Is there

01:42:35.583 --> 01:42:38.219
any way to distinguish that as
part of the process? >> So the

01:42:38.219 --> 01:42:40.921
answer is, yes. And we have a
white paper on how to do it.

01:42:40.921 --> 01:42:46.927
Companies should Intuit a know
your customer policy. We saw

01:42:46.927 --> 01:42:51.332
this illustrated very nicely in
the hacking team document from

01:42:51.332 --> 01:42:58.773
metro guard sold to a hacking
team and we saw an e-mail from

01:42:58.773 --> 01:43:02.576
him to hacking team saying, I
know who your customers are and

01:43:02.576 --> 01:43:08.616
I'm okay with it. So, that's the
sort of thing which I would love

01:43:08.616 --> 01:43:14.021
to bring a lawsuit about. But
yes, a robust know your customer

01:43:14.021 --> 01:43:19.293
scheme, I think is the best way
to determine it. >> Flowcharts

01:43:19.293 --> 01:43:22.830
are magic. Have magic powers. >>
Randy, do you have any further

01:43:22.830 --> 01:43:27.868
comment on know your customer?
>> RANDY WHEELER: That's just

01:43:27.868 --> 01:43:31.005
right that is certainly a
provision already in the

01:43:31.005 --> 01:43:37.311
regulations, the know your
customer, in a licensing

01:43:37.311 --> 01:43:43.084
process. The end user at times a
statement is required and

01:43:43.084 --> 01:43:47.722
certainly in a license exception
situation or no license required

01:43:47.722 --> 01:43:51.559
situation, the know your
customer requirement still

01:43:51.559 --> 01:43:57.565
applies to ensure a license is
not required. Thanks >> Just one

01:44:00.868 --> 01:44:03.337
more thing there. I think
honestly, the EFF is going down

01:44:03.337 --> 01:44:07.408
the wrong path. I'm going to get
him drunk and we'll correct it.

01:44:07.408 --> 01:44:12.480
And I'll tell you why. And it's
pretty simple, which is that the

01:44:12.480 --> 01:44:16.584
Wong Wong technology corporation
calls you up and says they want

01:44:16.584 --> 01:44:21.689
a copy of a random thing, some
gadget ear widget. Now under the

01:44:21.689 --> 01:44:25.793
current rule set, you're
supposed to find out if they are

01:44:25.793 --> 01:44:29.363
owned or mostly owned or
controlled by the Chinese

01:44:29.363 --> 01:44:33.701
government. But in reality, no
U.S. company can ever really

01:44:33.701 --> 01:44:37.371
know. There is it no way to
know. So even if you have

01:44:37.371 --> 01:44:40.808
perfect, and I think immunity
has perfect know your customer

01:44:40.808 --> 01:44:43.244
abilities, and you have a
flowchart on your wall which

01:44:43.244 --> 01:44:46.213
explains it to your admin, keep
in mind it's not a lawyer

01:44:46.213 --> 01:44:48.949
figuring this out. It's your
admin. The same person who

01:44:48.949 --> 01:44:53.521
answers the phone. And they go
through the flowchart and they

01:44:53.521 --> 01:44:56.357
go, you have a web page. Your
web page looks good. It's all in

01:44:56.357 --> 01:45:00.294
Chinese but I don't know.
Whatever. So I would say

01:45:00.294 --> 01:45:05.299
dividing a regulatory framework
against this when anyone in

01:45:05.299 --> 01:45:07.301
China is very difficult to
determine if they are a

01:45:07.301 --> 01:45:09.303
government-owned,
government-controlled

01:45:09.303 --> 01:45:13.207
corporation or not is probably
not the right direction to go.

01:45:13.207 --> 01:45:15.509
>> But the tools we are
concerned about are tools that

01:45:15.509 --> 01:45:20.748
are sold only tow Governments.
Hacking team and gamma only sell

01:45:20.748 --> 01:45:22.750
to Governments. So they
certainly know who their

01:45:22.750 --> 01:45:25.219
customers are >> With that,
unfortunately, we are out of

01:45:25.219 --> 01:45:27.588
time. The next panel is dying to
get in and play with the AV

01:45:27.588 --> 01:45:32.193
equipment. So, just want to
extend some recognition here to

01:45:32.193 --> 01:45:36.730
Mara Tam who did some amazing
things behind-the-scenes to make

01:45:36.730 --> 01:45:41.769
this panel happen. And also
thank you certainly to Randy

01:45:41.769 --> 01:45:47.308
Wheeler for really this unique
opportunity I to discuss these

01:45:47.308 --> 01:45:51.212
proposals with you. And thank
you to all of you for coming in

01:45:51.212 --> 01:45:55.683
to this talk today. (Applause)
