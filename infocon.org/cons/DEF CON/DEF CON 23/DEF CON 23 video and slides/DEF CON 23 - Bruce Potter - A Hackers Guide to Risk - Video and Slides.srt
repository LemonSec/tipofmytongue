00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.006
So Paul the good and on fit bit
and who has these -- they are

00:00:08.976 --> 00:00:16.149
(audio drop) or my friend has
too many steps so Paul from

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:22.723
training for they marathon so
when he had a weekend warrior

00:00:22.723 --> 00:00:29.329
challenge and you challenge your
friends and know you u are

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:36.503
training for a marathon and they
get cranky and Paul has 40 --> 000

00:00:36.503 --> 00:00:43.677
steps and everyone else has
20 --> 000. So Paul -- I have had

00:00:43.677 --> 00:00:49.683
half a cup of coffee so I am
cranky. So Paul is getting read

00:00:52.052 --> 00:00:57.591
you to run his marathon and my
wife -- you want me to use a

00:00:57.591 --> 00:01:03.530
proper name? No. It's a logical
reference not absolute. Anyway

00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:10.003
so Paul is getting ready and
they are sick of losing -- no,

00:01:10.003 --> 00:01:14.274
no, I love you deer. Paul is
getting ready to run the

00:01:14.274 --> 00:01:20.280
marathon and he says screw this
guy he is not -- so he has been

00:01:23.417 --> 00:01:25.986
training for months so they say
fuck this guy so they are going

00:01:25.986 --> 00:01:31.992
to walk and they do it health
think audio drop they turn off

00:01:40.934 --> 00:01:43.971
Bluetooth anything on their
phone so no one gets wise to it

00:01:43.971 --> 00:01:49.910
on the 50 file walk and at the
end of day after he runs the

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:56.383
marathon they are like fuck you
Paul. Now the kid thing was --

00:01:56.383 --> 00:02:02.322
every word of it on the part of
fucking with me at the end of

00:02:24.478 --> 00:02:27.314
the day I was eat that and then
all of it -- I have like so a

00:02:27.314 --> 00:02:32.686
marathon is about 55 --> 000 step
was all the others I had 65 --> 000

00:02:32.686 --> 00:02:37.624
steps and all of a sudden boom.
>> So we made badges for their

00:02:37.624 --> 00:02:41.128
non-marathon they ran and so
Paul here is your spiteful

00:02:41.128 --> 00:02:45.699
badge. (CLAPPING) and just so
you know at the end of the day

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:49.903
Heidi's fit bit didn't register
all the steps she was like 5000

00:02:49.903 --> 00:02:55.175
steps so she put it on me and I
walked around my house in the

00:02:55.175 --> 00:03:00.013
dark until 10:00 at night until
I had the right steps. I wear to

00:03:00.013 --> 00:03:04.384
God. I was walking around the
yard. Keep on cruising. >> This

00:03:04.384 --> 00:03:11.291
is a great honor. Thank you for
much. (CLAPPING) >> Thank you,

00:03:11.291 --> 00:03:16.363
Paul. So you have come to Def
Con and you want touchy feel I

00:03:16.363 --> 00:03:22.536
will talks and risk. This talk
was born out of rage so I was

00:03:22.536 --> 00:03:28.075
sitting around the night and I
was reading Twitter but some

00:03:28.075 --> 00:03:30.077
vulnerability was announced and
there is terrible able some

00:03:30.077 --> 00:03:34.081
vulnerability and I thought we
do a lousy job of understanding

00:03:34.081 --> 00:03:39.453
management and risk in this
community so I kick understand

00:03:39.453 --> 00:03:46.993
out RSV response and I sent
retinaculum in a figured that

00:03:46.993 --> 00:03:52.999
would know it in the bit bucket
and it got accepted. So I give

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:02.008
the talk. There will be a lot of
stories here today. I start my

00:04:02.008 --> 00:04:07.080
talks that you should not
believe anything I say and that

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.517
is very general broad statement
and I would encouraging you to

00:04:10.517 --> 00:04:14.721
include that on every talk that
you include here or conference.

00:04:14.721 --> 00:04:16.823
I have no degree. Did you
graduate? >> Yes. >> It was

00:04:16.823 --> 00:04:22.829
cool. State the obvious the man
says it is cool that is the

00:04:30.804 --> 00:04:36.810
quality of education you get
from the state of Alaska and

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:49.356
founder of this new group CTO.
The thing that gets me I have

00:04:54.661 --> 00:05:00.801
been coming to Def Con seven and
have been speak since eight. It

00:05:00.801 --> 00:05:06.807
is hard to know the thing but
easy to convince people. When I

00:05:12.179 --> 00:05:16.016
wanted to get into this industry
I fancied myself smart and I

00:05:16.016 --> 00:05:20.153
knew a lot of shit and going to
tell me about it but I did is

00:05:20.153 --> 00:05:23.390
have a desire to tell people so
should I write a book and I

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:29.396
decided to write one on
security. And downloaded a book

00:05:34.501 --> 00:05:39.339
thing they had and submit an
application to oriel. I will and

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:44.077
for a book idea application is
like a marketing book. So I send

00:05:44.077 --> 00:05:47.881
all this stuff in sent all this
stuff in and they sent me

00:05:47.881 --> 00:05:51.184
something three weeks later here
is your contract and I said shit

00:05:51.184 --> 00:05:58.425
I need to learn something about
80211 security. I owned no

00:05:58.425 --> 00:06:04.364
wireless devices at the time so
I should go out and figure this

00:06:06.967 --> 00:06:12.973
out and that is honestly a lot
of what you read and hear are

00:06:16.209 --> 00:06:22.782
people getting these ideas and
then getting up on stage

00:06:22.782 --> 00:06:29.389
spouting random shit. You need
to challenge everything that you

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:36.663
hear at Def Con and other
events. All kinds of different

00:06:36.663 --> 00:06:44.537
things this is to super clear we
get grumpy about product pitches

00:06:44.537 --> 00:06:51.411
but in reality almost every
person that gets on stage sells

00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:59.219
a service and they get up here
and they get money for it.

00:06:59.219 --> 00:07:03.523
Consult and the get rich to get
on stage to tell you things. So

00:07:03.523 --> 00:07:08.895
it a still economic. Don't think
because we are on stage that we

00:07:08.895 --> 00:07:14.901
are not whoring ourselves out.
>> This talk is now canceled. So

00:07:22.042 --> 00:07:27.480
I am just killing time before
questions. At the end of the day

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:34.287
you need to hold me and everyone
in the community accountable and

00:07:34.287 --> 00:07:41.094
this is crazy bullshit that has
happened in the last couple of

00:07:41.094 --> 00:07:47.934
years so my wife runs SSMOO con.
We sell out in 20 some seconds.

00:07:47.934 --> 00:07:53.940
It's a popular is what I like to
call it but one of reasons that

00:08:08.254 --> 00:08:11.091
we started that is because we
are sick of coming to other cons

00:08:11.091 --> 00:08:14.627
and listening to -- I don't want
to stand up and be that person

00:08:14.627 --> 00:08:20.633
you can say I disagree. If you
stand up and say you disagree

00:08:25.672 --> 00:08:31.678
and you better have a good
reason. We small them SHOO balls

00:08:35.849 --> 00:08:43.356
and we encouraging the speaker
if you disagree you have to

00:08:43.356 --> 00:08:47.527
inform the speaks of this ahead
of time because they will get

00:08:47.527 --> 00:08:54.534
grumpy when projectiles come
their way so it does turn into

00:08:54.534 --> 00:08:58.538
blues brothers which is good and
so I would encouraging you with

00:08:58.538 --> 00:09:04.477
the mind set when you come to a
talk like this if you disagree

00:09:09.182 --> 00:09:16.289
stand up and hold that person
accountable. Nobody called me

00:09:16.289 --> 00:09:24.130
out for anything. I have been
called out half a does sen times

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:30.136
because I have flat out lied
about things just to get people

00:09:32.439 --> 00:09:40.046
say something. But they don't.
Seg way let's talk about nuclear

00:09:40.046 --> 00:09:46.052
disaster, no. That is kind of
what the this talk (audio drop)

00:09:48.354 --> 00:09:54.360
I'm feeling the meth kicking in.
So some situation where we fail

00:09:56.663 --> 00:10:00.834
to understand risk
appropriately. Number one

00:10:00.834 --> 00:10:06.840
reactor. What is up, Dan? Thank
you. We are all familiar within

00:10:09.142 --> 00:10:16.749
incident. Kind of big deep. 9.0
earthquake. Seems like a proper

00:10:16.749 --> 00:10:22.755
place like the settlers got
there it is nice place here but

00:10:25.058 --> 00:10:31.965
we should build a nuclear
reactor. I know nothing of

00:10:31.965 --> 00:10:38.204
Japanese history I so just
invented Japanese settlers. That

00:10:38.204 --> 00:10:45.812
was some poor history going on
there. The interest from risk

00:10:45.812 --> 00:10:53.720
for me the report afterwards
called the disaster manmade and

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:58.358
not because the tsunami was
manmade but bad decisions made

00:10:58.358 --> 00:11:02.795
before and during and after that
let's to 3-quarters of nuclear

00:11:02.795 --> 00:11:08.668
material and all material being
released into the environment.

00:11:08.668 --> 00:11:14.007
It was because they didn't
prepare and didn't have

00:11:14.007 --> 00:11:19.946
processes in a procedure in
place and when the incident

00:11:19.946 --> 00:11:25.885
happened they continued to make
bad decisions mostly I think

00:11:25.885 --> 00:11:32.425
everything is okay mode. We
could have released a lot more

00:11:32.425 --> 00:11:40.166
so you should be happy. Like --
how do you think they got

00:11:40.166 --> 00:11:45.605
DOMOCON. Next, so deep wire
horizon another bad incident

00:11:45.605 --> 00:11:51.611
that occurred in 2009 (audio
drop) 4000 feet under sea they

00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:59.385
started drilling and went for
another 7-miles until they got

00:11:59.385 --> 00:12:06.693
the oil. Really poor
understanding of history. In

00:12:06.693 --> 00:12:12.632
20,102 thing blew up, killed 11
people and worse oil spill in

00:12:12.632 --> 00:12:18.871
the history of mankind and the
reports and judge that was

00:12:18.871 --> 00:12:25.945
involved found there was a
disregard for known risks and

00:12:25.945 --> 00:12:33.720
just ridiculousness, the judge
used that phrase but that is my

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:40.793
trademark phrase. That were
beyond the realm of reality. And

00:12:40.793 --> 00:12:46.799
it took months to clean up and
the whole time BP is saying

00:12:50.003 --> 00:12:56.009
65 --> 000-gallons are coming up a
day and everyone is saying is it

00:12:58.478 --> 00:13:05.952
is million gallons. The tuna
most have exploded so again like

00:13:05.952 --> 00:13:08.788
people all along new that pad
things were happening but didn't

00:13:08.788 --> 00:13:14.127
judge risk appropriately. Now,
on the flip side of that discuss

00:13:14.127 --> 00:13:18.898
of deep water horizon. I was
standing in dunkin donuts and

00:13:18.898 --> 00:13:25.505
there are these kids eight years
old buying turbo hots which is

00:13:25.505 --> 00:13:30.476
something eighth year-old
doesn't need. And this woman is

00:13:30.476 --> 00:13:36.482
in front of me and she is making
her head and she islike that is

00:13:38.718 --> 00:13:45.892
crazy. You know what is else is
crazy, like what. Please tell me

00:13:45.892 --> 00:13:51.698
what cells crazy and she starts
talking about the gulf oil spill

00:13:51.698 --> 00:13:55.134
and I'm like man it is really
bad but when the gulf and

00:13:55.134 --> 00:14:02.008
everything around it collapses
it's going to be going to be

00:14:02.008 --> 00:14:09.382
terrible and I said tell me
more. In her mind the earth is

00:14:09.382 --> 00:14:15.488
like a layer cake. She explains
this to me there is layer of oil

00:14:15.488 --> 00:14:18.591
in the middle of the earth that
we are tapping into and all that

00:14:18.591 --> 00:14:23.830
oil quote unquote is going to
come out from the gulf and there

00:14:23.830 --> 00:14:26.799
will be a big gap and tsunami
will wipe out everything f she

00:14:26.799 --> 00:14:34.307
was concerned in the next few
days her life would end that the

00:14:34.307 --> 00:14:41.914
gulf would collapsing. I'm like
you don't understand either. It

00:14:41.914 --> 00:14:47.920
was amazing to me like the lack
of knowledge her base

00:14:50.256 --> 00:14:56.262
understanding of the situation
led her to make more -- because

00:14:58.598 --> 00:15:04.537
the gulf was going to employed
but the earth is not made of

00:15:08.407 --> 00:15:14.413
layer cake. (indiscernible) I
will not repeat you man. Do you

00:15:16.749 --> 00:15:22.755
want me to repeat the question
but that was just dumb. So the

00:15:26.125 --> 00:15:29.061
other side of the coin, has
anyone had their car fixed.

00:15:29.061 --> 00:15:35.067
Let's look at that to -- knew
about the defects in their -- so

00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:43.376
wasn't on the books so that
would not force a recall and not

00:15:47.246 --> 00:15:53.252
spent this money to rebuild air
bags and 34 million cars. Is

00:15:56.355 --> 00:16:02.295
this being transcribed for Def
Con, then I apologize for the

00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:10.636
F-bomb words. I will try to
speak with more -- (laughter)

00:16:13.005 --> 00:16:20.379
I'm going to watch myself over
there now. You can all go

00:16:20.379 --> 00:16:22.682
because I am enamored with that.
La-la-la. >> CAPTIONER: Stop it

00:16:22.682 --> 00:16:28.688
now. (laughter) >> Just kidding.
I can see you but I can talk to

00:17:05.391 --> 00:17:09.996
you. Can't see you -- sorry.
(laughter) >> I love you other

00:17:09.996 --> 00:17:14.600
person. >> CAPTIONER: Me too. >>
This is why you wake up at 10:00

00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:20.606
to be clear. >> CAPTIONER: All
right. Get serious. >> So this

00:17:28.547 --> 00:17:34.553
is (laughter) sorry I am messing
with you now. Okay, go ahead.

00:17:42.495 --> 00:17:48.501
Continue --me too. >> This is
made up numbers. So you can

00:17:56.442 --> 00:18:02.381
disagree with it. Number of cars
on the road quarter billion. It

00:18:10.323 --> 00:18:16.329
is really hard to find numbers
about specific of how severe

00:18:18.364 --> 00:18:24.370
accidents are back in 80s and
90s worry about cancer -- air

00:18:29.508 --> 00:18:32.144
bag deployment so let's say a
hundred percent out there

00:18:32.144 --> 00:18:37.483
involved Takata air bags that
occur every year in the United

00:18:37.483 --> 00:18:43.489
States they involved in
deployment is quarter million

00:18:52.698 --> 00:18:55.134
you can read this math. I will
not go through it. I have gone

00:18:55.134 --> 00:18:59.405
through it a number of times.
The neat thing is not all air

00:18:59.405 --> 00:19:05.344
bags are shit and as it turns
out most is design so according

00:19:10.049 --> 00:19:15.588
to testing on average you will
have between . 04 percent and .

00:19:15.588 --> 00:19:20.860
08 percent air blacks debris and
blow shrapnel into the face of

00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:26.132
person that is involved in the
accident so say that is 188

00:19:26.132 --> 00:19:31.404
people a year give other take so
that quarter million people 188

00:19:31.404 --> 00:19:37.143
of them are hit in the face with
shrapnel and some of those

00:19:37.143 --> 00:19:40.446
people anyway, so the shrapnel
in the face is not that big of

00:19:40.446 --> 00:19:43.916
deal because they caught a guard
rail in the chest. People die in

00:19:43.916 --> 00:19:47.453
car crashes. So let's say a
hundred people a year are blast

00:19:47.453 --> 00:19:53.459
in the face with shrapnel in the
United States due to deployment

00:19:59.298 --> 00:20:04.603
problem. And what is worse case.
I have been bad at the math here

00:20:04.603 --> 00:20:08.941
and presuming worse case
scenario so a hundred people

00:20:08.941 --> 00:20:13.813
less effected by this and
results in the largest recall in

00:20:13.813 --> 00:20:18.984
car history costing easily over
a billion dollars people losing

00:20:18.984 --> 00:20:26.158
their jobs, all kind of money
being spent on this and hurts

00:20:26.158 --> 00:20:30.196
the economy. Is preventing a
hundred injuries a year worth

00:20:30.196 --> 00:20:34.500
the billion dollars. I don't
know I am not up here to make

00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:37.503
the claim that it is or is not
but when we make decisions about

00:20:37.503 --> 00:20:41.340
the largest recall and we see
people getting drug up by

00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:45.478
congress -- your baby should not
be strapped in is seat with a

00:20:45.478 --> 00:20:48.781
air bag and it is only a hundred
people -- that does not get your

00:20:48.781 --> 00:20:54.787
ass reelected so what could we
do to save lives a billion

00:21:04.530 --> 00:21:07.733
dollars that is not replacing
air bags. 500 people a year die

00:21:07.733 --> 00:21:09.735
from TB in the United States. I
bet you a bill dollars would

00:21:09.735 --> 00:21:12.738
help those people. 500 people a
year die from gunshot wounds. A

00:21:12.738 --> 00:21:18.744
billion dollars would go along
way to suicide victims in the

00:21:23.315 --> 00:21:29.321
United States. (audio drop) but
if you getting hit in the face a

00:21:41.033 --> 00:21:47.039
hundred people die from suicide.
So the thing is about brand

00:21:55.948 --> 00:22:01.887
protection for organization that
have been affected by this

00:22:06.158 --> 00:22:08.260
because no car company wants to
say it is not important. People

00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:10.796
are going be like I am not
buying a GM and so everybody

00:22:10.796 --> 00:22:18.470
else is doing it so everyone has
to do it it is about brand

00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:25.911
protection. This is what we
think about savings lives and

00:22:25.911 --> 00:22:32.451
preventing people from getting
hurt. That was ignition that was

00:22:32.451 --> 00:22:34.653
different problem. So I have now
been running around here

00:22:34.653 --> 00:22:40.659
giggling at the transcriber so I
could talk about risk what the

00:22:44.463 --> 00:22:49.568
hell is risk so the question is
we use the term a lot like what

00:22:49.568 --> 00:22:53.205
specifically is a risk. I get
this question a lot so I do

00:22:53.205 --> 00:22:56.475
commercial consulting and I arm
people to make better risk

00:22:56.475 --> 00:22:59.712
decision and people say I don't
know what is risk is and bad

00:22:59.712 --> 00:23:02.114
things can happen so what does
risk mean so in the abstract

00:23:02.114 --> 00:23:07.553
different organizations have
different risk a bank is loss of

00:23:07.553 --> 00:23:13.692
funds of profit can occur. In
general, it is something you

00:23:13.692 --> 00:23:19.698
care about that is put in harms
way it is a risk. But I don't

00:23:22.001 --> 00:23:28.674
want you to get mired down in
the mechanical views of risk

00:23:28.674 --> 00:23:35.881
think of abstract some terms so
things that can be bad to us,

00:23:35.881 --> 00:23:40.319
that can hurt engineering
efforts but don't necessarily

00:23:40.319 --> 00:23:46.325
have a impact to the business
that is technology any risk.

00:23:46.325 --> 00:23:48.994
Business risk is something that
effects the business operations.

00:23:48.994 --> 00:23:51.597
This is risk and this has
material impact. Another phrase

00:23:51.597 --> 00:23:56.702
is inherit risk is this bad
thing that can happen residual

00:23:56.702 --> 00:24:00.472
risk now I have control and that
risk has been reduced. You hear

00:24:00.472 --> 00:24:06.478
these terms around a lot and
just important to know the

00:24:27.266 --> 00:24:30.769
specificity that you need to use
these terms. I'm not going to

00:24:30.769 --> 00:24:35.107
use them at all again today but
it makes me happy you just need

00:24:35.107 --> 00:24:39.945
to understand different types of
terms that organization use.

00:24:39.945 --> 00:24:43.782
There is deep rat hole that you
can go down and we are not going

00:24:43.782 --> 00:24:49.788
to go down it. There are a bunch
of risk frameworks out there.

00:24:55.327 --> 00:25:00.532
Was it fun? Good time? Those
risk management frameworks

00:25:00.532 --> 00:25:04.169
(audio drop) and lot of
frameworks out there. 830R1 and

00:25:04.169 --> 00:25:08.173
there is concrete process you
can walk through and you don't

00:25:08.173 --> 00:25:12.177
have to pay for it. That is your
tax dollars for work. That is

00:25:12.177 --> 00:25:17.149
something you can go and do a
risk management program. Then

00:25:17.149 --> 00:25:23.155
this cyber security family work
so I was involved in the

00:25:33.932 --> 00:25:41.407
creation of this did anybody a
tend the workshop. One person in

00:25:41.407 --> 00:25:45.411
the back. Do you remember me
from some thing as these

00:25:45.411 --> 00:25:48.247
workshops? He was there. He is
like yeah whatever. Anyway, so

00:25:48.247 --> 00:25:50.582
they were very concerned so this
is a mandate that the president

00:25:50.582 --> 00:25:52.584
gave to create airframe work
that companies could use in

00:25:52.584 --> 00:25:55.053
order fry to measure and have a
common view of how they thought

00:25:55.053 --> 00:25:58.490
about cyber security risk so
state of union 2013 got up on

00:25:58.490 --> 00:26:02.127
stage and said you're going to
do this thing. And what they did

00:26:02.127 --> 00:26:08.133
they went out and held these
workshops, from transportation

00:26:15.274 --> 00:26:21.280
and health care and said what do
you do today with risk

00:26:32.791 --> 00:26:38.797
management. The thing and this
was concerned about in the

00:26:45.137 --> 00:26:49.241
creation of CSF they didn't want
it to be something that you did.

00:26:49.241 --> 00:26:54.246
Because they want to make sure
they were not creating something

00:26:54.246 --> 00:26:58.817
that government agency would be
held responsible to doing and

00:26:58.817 --> 00:27:02.855
their for then creating
regulation. There is concern in

00:27:02.855 --> 00:27:07.893
organization like this that you
create de facto regulation when

00:27:07.893 --> 00:27:11.263
you come up with a way of doing
thing and hurtled that you jump

00:27:11.263 --> 00:27:15.701
over because everyone says you
need to do that. Has anyone read

00:27:15.701 --> 00:27:20.873
the CSF? It is interesting
document and I will touch on it

00:27:20.873 --> 00:27:27.312
more but if you read it the one
take away you will have I don't

00:27:27.312 --> 00:27:32.885
know what to do. That is on
purpose. That is on purpose from

00:27:32.885 --> 00:27:38.023
the CSF. So you are not alone
but there are way to

00:27:38.023 --> 00:27:42.761
operationalize it. So value at
risk like I stand to lose

00:27:42.761 --> 00:27:46.632
something of value how much
would I lose if this e vent

00:27:46.632 --> 00:27:51.637
happened so in certain domains
like financial manufacturing we

00:27:51.637 --> 00:27:55.340
have hard matrix about how much
I would lose if something would

00:27:55.340 --> 00:28:01.980
happen. Banks are great. Why are
their safes to keep from

00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:07.986
steeling money. You push the
risk somewhere else. So that was

00:28:11.490 --> 00:28:17.129
more bid sorry. But banks are
good at understanding risk and

00:28:17.129 --> 00:28:19.998
putting in controls. Because
there is dollar amount audio

00:28:19.998 --> 00:28:23.769
drop -- in cyber I'm going to
use the word cyber and fuck you

00:28:23.769 --> 00:28:26.405
if you don't like it thank you
yes there is few of us that

00:28:26.405 --> 00:28:32.411
cybers are okay things to use --
I have been canceled twice. ASL

00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:48.126
-- no one uses -- eight people
giggle and we are all on list.

00:28:54.833 --> 00:29:00.772
For those don't knows means -- I
don't know who I am talking to

00:29:07.279 --> 00:29:09.781
anymore so cyber bars a way
attempt to assign value to bad

00:29:09.781 --> 00:29:13.719
things happening in cyber space
so very math driven and math is

00:29:13.719 --> 00:29:17.623
cool that is okay. I'm down with
it. If you want to follow me on

00:29:17.623 --> 00:29:21.760
Twitter -- really fascinating
but it is not all that pragmatic

00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:27.766
for people like us. The end of
the day I have -- pulling me

00:29:32.371 --> 00:29:38.377
aside says I don't know what
risk is you don't need a lot of

00:29:42.447 --> 00:29:50.389
fucking matrix. That is 202
level kind of stuff. There is

00:29:50.389 --> 00:29:57.562
also things like 853 with are
controlled frameworks that if

00:29:57.562 --> 00:30:02.067
you -- I want you to be familiar
with these things but if you

00:30:02.067 --> 00:30:06.405
take my presentation and look
for a starting point googling

00:30:06.405 --> 00:30:12.411
these things is place. So the
CVSS system which is how we

00:30:23.321 --> 00:30:27.025
score vulnerabilities. It is of
standard that try to find the

00:30:27.025 --> 00:30:31.396
severity of vulnerability. So 14
different matrix that all get

00:30:31.396 --> 00:30:35.901
rolled together and you assign
number values to these things

00:30:35.901 --> 00:30:43.075
and pop out a number of the back
end so if you look at CVE you

00:30:43.075 --> 00:30:46.044
will see there is all this
information and then underneath

00:30:46.044 --> 00:30:49.314
you have impact where you get
the scores. There was hit that I

00:30:49.314 --> 00:30:54.152
saw this morning. So impact you
get composed into the base score

00:30:54.152 --> 00:30:57.723
and there is freaking number
man. A high resolution number

00:30:57.723 --> 00:31:03.662
how many different values are
there between zero and 10 when

00:31:08.633 --> 00:31:16.441
you go to 10 place. One freaking
hundred values of risk in the

00:31:16.441 --> 00:31:22.447
CVSS that is way too fucking
many. You need five. That was

00:31:26.418 --> 00:31:32.424
the voice of God getting pissed
off about CVSS. So it turns out

00:31:40.398 --> 00:31:43.902
you give people way way too much
to contemplate when you have

00:31:43.902 --> 00:31:48.440
hundred different levels of how
bad something is but it feels

00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:54.446
good because it is math. Math
feels good. Like algebra was

00:31:56.948 --> 00:32:02.888
horses butt. That was bullshit
and fuck that noise and the

00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:12.364
liberal arts majors are like
what's math. I'm a college drop

00:32:12.364 --> 00:32:18.370
out I can say these things. So
the CVSS is also the BCSS. All

00:32:42.594 --> 00:32:45.497
about specific concrete
vulnerability and you have to

00:32:45.497 --> 00:32:48.967
have that to assign a score with
this one you can have the

00:32:48.967 --> 00:32:51.903
concept of vulnerability this
thing may happen and if it was

00:32:51.903 --> 00:32:55.140
there -- still gives you number
still high on resolution of that

00:32:55.140 --> 00:32:58.343
number but I think in a very
interesting way trying to think

00:32:58.343 --> 00:33:00.679
about bad things that might
happen because vulnerability are

00:33:00.679 --> 00:33:03.348
pretty much going on. So let's
talk vulnerability disclose for

00:33:03.348 --> 00:33:06.451
a few seconds. So I feel
passionate about the release of

00:33:06.451 --> 00:33:10.956
information regarding supervisor
and weaknesses. I think the

00:33:10.956 --> 00:33:16.261
release of that information
should benefit the end user as

00:33:16.261 --> 00:33:21.032
much as possible and disclosing
that information to third

00:33:21.032 --> 00:33:25.303
parties just making these
vendors richer and doesn't

00:33:25.303 --> 00:33:30.609
necessarily make the end user
safer and in particular there

00:33:30.609 --> 00:33:34.479
has been study that -- being
exploited by numbers or --

00:33:34.479 --> 00:33:40.485
what's vulnerability when the
patch is out people that write

00:33:43.255 --> 00:33:47.492
the bad stuff can weapon nice
that and start doing bad things

00:33:47.492 --> 00:33:54.232
to everyone all at once. The
vulnerability is -- in which bad

00:33:54.232 --> 00:34:00.171
things happen. So if -- I don't
even though. I was (audio drop)

00:34:05.677 --> 00:34:09.981
dammit at the end of the day, I
get really cranky about the

00:34:09.981 --> 00:34:12.784
third party exploit sales that
go on in this industry. Because

00:34:12.784 --> 00:34:17.155
it doesn't do anything to
protect the end user. And so

00:34:17.155 --> 00:34:23.828
when we think about
vulnerability in this day and

00:34:23.828 --> 00:34:27.432
age when you look at CVE that
means bad things are happening.

00:34:27.432 --> 00:34:32.337
CWSS and the system is us
thinking proactively about bad

00:34:32.337 --> 00:34:34.706
things that might happen in the
future which is way more is

00:34:34.706 --> 00:34:38.643
interesting and useful. If my
leg is sawed-off there is not

00:34:38.643 --> 00:34:44.649
much I can do about it. Zombies
and chain saws in my dreams. So

00:34:51.289 --> 00:34:55.927
we talked about it why is risk
important to hackers. I feel

00:34:55.927 --> 00:35:01.866
that it is important that you
get exposure to it when we

00:35:01.866 --> 00:35:07.339
pressure risk inappropriately on
either side. I am on the deep

00:35:07.339 --> 00:35:13.345
water horizon saying everything
is okay or in DD saying the word

00:35:13.345 --> 00:35:20.318
is going to -- both of those
things make you look bad and in

00:35:20.318 --> 00:35:24.756
the real word when the latest
vulnerability is going be

00:35:24.756 --> 00:35:28.393
release and on post we say --
these are things that the people

00:35:28.393 --> 00:35:31.363
they say them don't look good
and bad thing can happen as a

00:35:31.363 --> 00:35:37.402
result -- I have 10 minutes. Got
to go. Time to simplify. So

00:35:37.402 --> 00:35:43.408
(audio drop) what specifically
is a risk so when I think of

00:35:59.224 --> 00:36:04.095
risk and the threat -- team
didn't have a extra five fingers

00:36:04.095 --> 00:36:10.769
to show me. I have two and I
have three we are close. I have

00:36:10.769 --> 00:36:16.975
is three minutes now. So when I
think of these things I have a

00:36:16.975 --> 00:36:21.479
concrete syntax when I think
about risk and threat when you

00:36:21.479 --> 00:36:25.784
google this you will find me and
that is it so if you disagree

00:36:25.784 --> 00:36:29.421
with this feel free to throw
stones but I have used these

00:36:29.421 --> 00:36:33.591
models in the past and they have
worked with me so I would like

00:36:33.591 --> 00:36:36.494
to encouraging you to think
about that. The risk is there is

00:36:36.494 --> 00:36:41.166
likely hood this some cause will
result in impact. The threat is

00:36:41.166 --> 00:36:43.168
accurate -- we will get into all
of this. It is okay. And

00:36:43.168 --> 00:36:47.372
vulnerability is really just a
weakness that can be exploited

00:36:47.372 --> 00:36:53.378
and walk through a example of
this so you can see so when

00:36:59.384 --> 00:37:05.323
someone says what is risk you
can say this is what the risk.

00:37:11.362 --> 00:37:17.001
Here is risk. So looking at this
syntax that I proposed here is

00:37:17.001 --> 00:37:20.638
likelihood. Highly likely. Here
is the cause. Attacker will gain

00:37:20.638 --> 00:37:24.909
access to data base server. That
was like the big thing on my

00:37:24.909 --> 00:37:30.915
entire presentation. We have
actors and actions we have

00:37:43.161 --> 00:37:50.301
assets and we outcomes. Now if
you were paying attention which

00:37:50.301 --> 00:37:53.037
I hope you were not but early in
the syntax of threat I had

00:37:53.037 --> 00:37:56.508
motivation. I have clients that
care about the motivation of

00:37:56.508 --> 00:37:58.510
people attacking their systems
and clients that just could give

00:37:58.510 --> 00:38:02.013
a shit because bad guys are
going to do bad things and

00:38:02.013 --> 00:38:08.019
haters are going to hate so when
I go through threat modeling

00:38:13.725 --> 00:38:16.461
will not include motivation
because it ends up not being

00:38:16.461 --> 00:38:23.668
important. If you want to learn
more go google my talk from

00:38:23.668 --> 00:38:27.438
(indiscernible) (audio drop) it
is URL on the freaking

00:38:27.438 --> 00:38:33.444
PowerPoint slide do you ever
right it down or do you say I

00:38:36.114 --> 00:38:40.251
will google that shit. So I am
encouraging to google that shit.

00:38:40.251 --> 00:38:43.221
I put shit and skew you in the
talk so anyway -- I swear a lot.

00:38:43.221 --> 00:38:45.857
I did not swear in my
(indiscernible) talk so I am

00:38:45.857 --> 00:38:51.896
making up for it now. I am
dropping F bombs with disregard.

00:38:51.896 --> 00:38:57.902
So here is specific example, so
high level risk and really

00:39:07.912 --> 00:39:12.183
likely people are going to break
into our stuff and steel is

00:39:12.183 --> 00:39:15.687
information. So will are
external actors that can do

00:39:15.687 --> 00:39:18.823
(indiscernible) and insiders who
can do log in stuff and we have

00:39:18.823 --> 00:39:21.359
these facilities so the
vulnerability and threats are

00:39:21.359 --> 00:39:28.466
composed into this rising
statement that you can take and

00:39:28.466 --> 00:39:31.269
hand it to people that don't
understand the technical piece.

00:39:31.269 --> 00:39:35.607
There is bad guys are going to
get into data base and get our

00:39:35.607 --> 00:39:41.613
stuff. This risk threat and
vulnerability something that

00:39:44.215 --> 00:39:47.352
worked effectively at
communicating risk in our domain

00:39:47.352 --> 00:39:53.358
you may not agree with this or
disagree with this but keeping

00:40:00.465 --> 00:40:04.569
it simple and having a clear
distinction I think is important

00:40:04.569 --> 00:40:07.972
and also important in how it
gets composed. In 2002 -- when

00:40:07.972 --> 00:40:13.978
he said how do we measure risk
they had equation. Vulnerability

00:40:17.482 --> 00:40:23.021
likely hood against impact. And
you come up with a number. As it

00:40:23.021 --> 00:40:29.761
turns out they thought it was
too simple so we will come out

00:40:29.761 --> 00:40:36.401
with somebody more complex so
this was stole when from 201 and

00:40:36.401 --> 00:40:42.407
I will say it was not same
thing. This is much more complex

00:40:45.543 --> 00:40:49.614
view of risk. I'm saying this is
more complex view around if you

00:40:49.614 --> 00:40:52.383
trying to sink your teeth into
risk for the first time I might

00:40:52.383 --> 00:40:54.452
say to look at the older
documentation first.

00:40:54.452 --> 00:41:00.391
Thirty-seven -- you may be a
Fed. Is that a black badge, sir.

00:41:11.569 --> 00:41:17.575
No, the old human. Why it is
black? They had black human

00:41:19.911 --> 00:41:25.717
badges one year? Jesus Christ,
tell me what is happening; cats

00:41:25.717 --> 00:41:29.454
and dogs living together. So
scale I think is interesting as

00:41:29.454 --> 00:41:34.659
far as looking at likely hood
you only need five numbers you

00:41:34.659 --> 00:41:38.563
don't need a hundred. Almost
certain somewhat likely these

00:41:38.563 --> 00:41:43.301
are subjective but risk is
subjective so just pick five. I

00:41:43.301 --> 00:41:48.940
think what is interesting one of
guys that had this model he said

00:41:48.940 --> 00:41:54.145
I only need three and high
likely hood it is happening to

00:41:54.145 --> 00:41:59.217
us already or companies look
like us in our vertical and

00:41:59.217 --> 00:42:02.920
medium is happening to companies
and other vertical but not near

00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:08.860
us and low is not just freaking
happening because those are the

00:42:08.860 --> 00:42:15.867
three states of shit it can be
in. I like that model, sir. If

00:42:15.867 --> 00:42:23.374
you let me use his real name I
would but he won't. So we when

00:42:23.374 --> 00:42:30.681
from five to three. You need
five not a hundred. You can read

00:42:30.681 --> 00:42:36.687
-- this is great part of risk
because it is very simple and

00:42:36.687 --> 00:42:42.627
very low resolution, pick one
and go with it. When you make

00:42:42.627 --> 00:42:45.196
compos these things together you
can take these kind of simple

00:42:45.196 --> 00:42:48.833
statements and compos them
through a process. Why do we

00:42:48.833 --> 00:42:51.536
make bad risk decisions.
Misunderstanding any of those

00:42:51.536 --> 00:42:55.907
knowns lead to a bad risk
decision. If you don't

00:42:55.907 --> 00:43:00.978
understand the asset that's you
have because you don't know the

00:43:00.978 --> 00:43:06.984
threat actor space, if you don't
understand complexity of action

00:43:13.324 --> 00:43:19.330
and how hard it is exploit
something you will make bad risk

00:43:23.367 --> 00:43:28.005
decision to in order no be good
at risk management the run

00:43:28.005 --> 00:43:35.246
bummer of side thing is you need
be expert in a lot of stuff. You

00:43:35.246 --> 00:43:40.785
need to know a little bit about
a lot and that hard because we

00:43:40.785 --> 00:43:47.525
often times we tend to
specialize especially early in

00:43:47.525 --> 00:43:51.095
our careers. That means you
don't get the broad visibility

00:43:51.095 --> 00:43:54.298
you need in order to make risk
decisions. There is risk

00:43:54.298 --> 00:43:58.269
consultants and you think these
guys get paid a lot of money but

00:43:58.269 --> 00:44:01.439
they need to make good decision
around risk. You didn't

00:44:01.439 --> 00:44:07.445
understand that tsunami and you
didn't understand the impact it

00:44:12.517 --> 00:44:18.523
would have -- they are fuel
tanks were washed out to sea

00:44:29.901 --> 00:44:32.470
like the engines were still
there and could have run the

00:44:32.470 --> 00:44:36.541
systems but all the diesel ended
up in the Pacific. That is not

00:44:36.541 --> 00:44:40.044
hard to model. Diesel fuel
floats. It is like a boat. These

00:44:40.044 --> 00:44:46.050
are not things you would like to
put near the ocean to keep the

00:44:49.253 --> 00:44:55.259
nuclear plant safe. What is not
for us to think about but the

00:44:59.564 --> 00:45:05.503
some how the people that built
-- said yeah that makes sense.

00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:16.981
They misunderstood these nouns
and had effect in Japan. Even

00:45:16.981 --> 00:45:23.821
after you man in middle attack I
have to spend a lot of time post

00:45:23.821 --> 00:45:29.794
processing the connection to see
if there is anything inside of

00:45:29.794 --> 00:45:35.232
it that was of value. How would
we write this. Five minutes.

00:45:35.232 --> 00:45:41.238
Yes. I always get a spare
minute. That is Def Con for

00:45:48.879 --> 00:45:52.283
Bruce. If I actively man in
middle you, that is very

00:45:52.283 --> 00:45:54.285
unlikely thing to occur. Of all
the connections that I have

00:45:54.285 --> 00:45:56.887
committed on the internet I
would say very, very very, very

00:45:56.887 --> 00:46:01.859
very few of them have been man
in the middle. Vast majority --

00:46:01.859 --> 00:46:06.564
hard to man in the middle people
to scale. For the most part most

00:46:06.564 --> 00:46:10.301
enterprise networks it is pretty
hard. But for outside attackers

00:46:10.301 --> 00:46:16.307
it is quite difficult. (audio
drop) and I don't even know what

00:46:26.117 --> 00:46:32.123
I got until I have decringe. Do
you agree with the rating.

00:46:46.504 --> 00:46:53.711
Anyone know which one this was?
Close. Same thing. This is a

00:46:53.711 --> 00:46:57.181
freak vulnerability. This made
they news you all read about

00:46:57.181 --> 00:47:00.551
freak. Actively man in the
middle and spent money to

00:47:00.551 --> 00:47:06.557
encrypt it. 4. 3 somewhere in
the middle. Anyone every execute

00:47:12.463 --> 00:47:14.465
a freak attack or compromised.
Why do we care? Seriously. This

00:47:14.465 --> 00:47:22.406
is the one that caused me pow
have aneurysm to submit this

00:47:22.406 --> 00:47:28.412
talk. There is bullshit. We care
a lot of SSL. Sir? >>

00:47:31.015 --> 00:47:37.021
(inaudible) >> So there are
situations in the future it may

00:47:45.029 --> 00:47:51.035
be different. It is not
different now there for I don't

00:47:55.005 --> 00:48:02.713
care. Look, we can argue when it
is a 43 you can argue it should

00:48:02.713 --> 00:48:09.153
be a 42, 41. When it a high
medium low. We can agree there

00:48:09.153 --> 00:48:15.159
is low to very low. Doesn't make
the cut. Fuck that. So let's

00:48:17.661 --> 00:48:23.667
talk MRI for a second. This is
other thing there is huge amount

00:48:26.170 --> 00:48:33.344
of (audio drop). MRI is about
managing risk for credit cards

00:48:33.344 --> 00:48:41.185
right. As it turns out, totally
MRI complain they must have not

00:48:41.185 --> 00:48:48.192
got owned some wasn't else had
measured risk years ago and said

00:48:48.192 --> 00:48:51.128
MRI this looks like something we
should do to protect credit

00:48:51.128 --> 00:48:53.898
cards and we didn't have a lot
of art so they develop add

00:48:53.898 --> 00:48:56.734
checklist -- you have to have
the right key size because we

00:48:56.734 --> 00:49:00.104
don't want to say it is
compromising a credit card. Go

00:49:00.104 --> 00:49:06.110
crack me a 1024 key. Bring it on
I will wait. So anyway, but we

00:49:17.655 --> 00:49:22.960
get inundated with MRI violation
all the time. You have weak key

00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:28.866
sizes for the stuff I care about
1024 is fine. People will

00:49:28.866 --> 00:49:34.872
complain so we have people sent
us and say here is MRI

00:49:36.974 --> 00:49:44.415
checklist. When you report
people to MRI people do you know

00:49:44.415 --> 00:49:49.787
what happens? Nothing. Not a
goddam thing. Secondly show me

00:49:49.787 --> 00:49:52.089
the risk for me not having a
strong enough key size to clear

00:49:52.089 --> 00:49:58.095
I don't know 500 credit card
transaction a year. It doesn't

00:50:00.130 --> 00:50:06.136
exist. Fuck you. (laughter) wow,
so like time wrap up. (laughter)

00:50:12.910 --> 00:50:18.382
I have day job or I did. I may
be applying for a new one so, so

00:50:18.382 --> 00:50:25.322
let's real quick when you want
to operationalize risk -- here

00:50:25.322 --> 00:50:29.793
is complicated box I will spare
you the first step don't worry

00:50:29.793 --> 00:50:35.799
about this shit. Not important.
So I'm simplifying your risk

00:50:39.336 --> 00:50:42.840
management program now. How you
are doing? Fine. Identify threat

00:50:42.840 --> 00:50:50.681
sources and events. Pick a
threat model. Use something but

00:50:50.681 --> 00:50:56.687
use a structured process to get
rid of the net landscaped. It is

00:51:00.791 --> 00:51:04.261
important to not use your own
personal bias to think about

00:51:04.261 --> 00:51:08.432
what is bad. You need coverage
of the landscape in order to

00:51:08.432 --> 00:51:11.936
understand what is bad. Formal
processes like what show stack

00:51:11.936 --> 00:51:15.105
has published give you --
outside of you own body of

00:51:15.105 --> 00:51:18.409
knowledge that is very important
so your system is not just

00:51:18.409 --> 00:51:21.845
protected about not only the
things you care about but things

00:51:21.845 --> 00:51:27.851
that are real. There are
formalized processes that get

00:51:31.322 --> 00:51:37.328
you the coverage that which
annoys the shit out of me about

00:51:40.898 --> 00:51:44.234
pen testing there is not a lot
of coverage. All I did was some

00:51:44.234 --> 00:51:47.471
things about getting in and
doesn't help you understand the

00:51:47.471 --> 00:51:53.477
risk into your organization. You
need to do more than testing use

00:51:59.917 --> 00:52:05.622
some common sense. How likely is
it to occur and then go figure

00:52:05.622 --> 00:52:09.493
out how bad it would be. This is
common sense and a bunch of

00:52:09.493 --> 00:52:16.900
boxes were missed when you lot
how wide is wide then core is

00:52:16.900 --> 00:52:22.906
pretty cool because it is all
things security in Excel spread

00:52:29.747 --> 00:52:35.519
sheet. They have subdomains
underneath it that is like what

00:52:35.519 --> 00:52:40.924
we do. Your job fits into that
bucket somewhere. That is

00:52:40.924 --> 00:52:43.827
coverage you need to have when
you think about risk. I know I

00:52:43.827 --> 00:52:48.532
am out of time. Do I have time
for question. No time for

00:52:48.532 --> 00:52:54.538
questions. In general you need
to -- I have one minute left so

00:52:57.174 --> 00:53:03.113
I will wrap it up. All right. So
in general I do want to

00:53:15.993 --> 00:53:19.096
encourage you and this has been
ranty and I apologize because

00:53:19.096 --> 00:53:22.533
when I see us making bad
decisions when the road map of

00:53:22.533 --> 00:53:25.936
success is clear to me. People
have gone down this road. Make

00:53:25.936 --> 00:53:29.039
better things happen. Don't be
part of problem. That's it. Bye.
