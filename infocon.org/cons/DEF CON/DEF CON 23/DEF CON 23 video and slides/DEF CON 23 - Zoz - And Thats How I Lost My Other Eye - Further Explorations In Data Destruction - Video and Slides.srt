00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:03.437
 >> Hello Defcon, im actually
gonna break with tradition this

00:00:03.437 --> 00:00:06.907
time then start on minute early
because I have so much shit to

00:00:06.907 --> 00:00:11.478
show you guys that I am worried
how much to fit in here. I am

00:00:11.478 --> 00:00:17.484
confident saying there are more
explosion in this presentation

00:00:20.721 --> 00:00:24.591
than Def Con history because sit
nearly quarter century of Def

00:00:24.591 --> 00:00:30.864
Con. That is blowing my mind. A
lot of projects are not soloed.

00:00:30.864 --> 00:00:35.836
I called in so many favors and
lot of friends went above to

00:00:35.836 --> 00:00:41.842
help me out. Think the only
person that made it here is RF.

00:00:45.078 --> 00:00:51.084
So I hope he is awake. I had to
do this by Bruce they were data

00:00:53.287 --> 00:00:59.593
center, very valuable stuff.
They kick around some ideas it

00:00:59.593 --> 00:01:05.532
could be a target for some
criminals to come and steel

00:01:10.037 --> 00:01:13.640
everything so could you have a
switch that you could flip to

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.911
destroy all the disc in the data
sinister and I thought this was

00:01:17.911 --> 00:01:24.484
cool and wanted to follow-up and
then four years later I thought

00:01:24.484 --> 00:01:29.723
where are we now. We have data
centers have all the stuff

00:01:29.723 --> 00:01:34.428
stolen. And we don't know how
much we can trust crypt to.

00:01:34.428 --> 00:01:40.434
Which is only secure as the
keys. So think about it. So here

00:01:49.876 --> 00:01:53.013
are the goals. Flip is switch,
(indiscernible) protect your

00:01:53.013 --> 00:01:59.786
data center against highly
motivated organization such as

00:01:59.786 --> 00:02:05.726
three letter agency and of
course the big one, produce a

00:02:07.761 --> 00:02:12.099
lot of destruction for the Def
Con audience for all f you here.

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:18.105
So that means more high
explosives and more voltage. So

00:02:21.408 --> 00:02:24.611
these are the rules that they
came up with. You have a one use

00:02:24.611 --> 00:02:30.617
server. Sixty seconds to
completion. I want to make a

00:02:44.798 --> 00:02:51.004
joke about Bruce and Shane here
but I won't. Don't set off the

00:02:51.004 --> 00:02:58.278
fire systems. I don't really
care about that so don't worry

00:02:58.278 --> 00:03:03.383
about that. Contain the damage
within the equipment and protect

00:03:03.383 --> 00:03:08.555
near by humans. Quick word on
this technology. Tend to be made

00:03:08.555 --> 00:03:13.860
out of aluminum and glass.
Almost everything I do here will

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.596
work on glass. The coding is
really interesting of our disc I

00:03:16.596 --> 00:03:18.732
they have under layers co-bolt
-- and these layers tend to be

00:03:18.732 --> 00:03:24.738
separated by four lays of
(indiscernible). So very

00:03:35.615 --> 00:03:41.621
chemically reactive. Here are
results from Def Con 19. They

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:52.165
did three categories and split
it up between the three of them.

00:03:52.165 --> 00:03:57.704
And the results were they had
some regulatory issues with

00:03:57.704 --> 00:04:00.173
deployment because they were
working with 10 write which can

00:04:00.173 --> 00:04:04.044
be used to make targets and they
did some melting of the aluminum

00:04:04.044 --> 00:04:10.050
and hardies and they discovered
that the driver is -- often a

00:04:21.061 --> 00:04:25.632
alumni mum and suck up heat like
crazy and hard to melt and did

00:04:25.632 --> 00:04:29.970
some chemical injection. Total
fail. Then the most fun they had

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.405
with physical tools used a lot
of wood working tools, and

00:04:32.405 --> 00:04:36.877
burned themselves a lot. You
should watch the talk. Just go

00:04:36.877 --> 00:04:42.883
line and watch it. And then they
did some depleting of the

00:04:47.287 --> 00:04:50.690
platters which worked greaten to
glass platter but failed on

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:56.696
aluminum. When they decommission
disc -- (indiscernible) sorry,

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.177
so when you get rid of drives
you want to predict your TOAs

00:05:10.177 --> 00:05:17.017
are able to collect and exploit
drives. I talked to a guy who

00:05:17.017 --> 00:05:21.388
did EOD work in Iraq and he was
under instruction if he found

00:05:21.388 --> 00:05:27.794
hardenings that were not crushed
or burnt he could get stuff off

00:05:27.794 --> 00:05:35.402
of them. So here is my one, 101
slide so if you here for the 101

00:05:35.402 --> 00:05:41.408
you can leave this slide. Open
the drive, remove the platters

00:05:47.914 --> 00:05:53.920
and rub it with magnet and crush
break and deform it by the

00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:01.361
method of your choice and then
separate the debris and don't

00:06:01.361 --> 00:06:03.597
dispose it in the same place. So
the rest of this talk hopefully

00:06:03.597 --> 00:06:09.603
interesting to you not
necessarily useful. I decided to

00:06:13.807 --> 00:06:16.509
use three different techniques
thermal kinetics and electric.

00:06:16.509 --> 00:06:18.879
Here is some things that I
didn't do so is that you can try

00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:21.081
them or realize lay I don't do
them. I want to look at

00:06:21.081 --> 00:06:23.083
flameless chemical reactions. I
didn't find any that got hot

00:06:23.083 --> 00:06:25.218
enough. You can melt aluminum
easily. So method number one the

00:06:25.218 --> 00:06:29.956
plasma cutters. I expected it to
make more of mess but as you can

00:06:29.956 --> 00:06:35.762
see completes about in 402nds
and very, very easy to contain

00:06:35.762 --> 00:06:43.136
and you can bid array of plasma
heads and looks good so far. I

00:06:43.136 --> 00:06:49.476
wanted to see if it would keep
spinning and so one insertion

00:06:49.476 --> 00:06:55.649
point would be enough to destroy
the top platter. Will start to

00:06:55.649 --> 00:07:00.453
leak out the bottom to know that
it is done. This drive stayed

00:07:00.453 --> 00:07:03.223
hot more a lodge time so this
shot is after I repeatedly

00:07:03.223 --> 00:07:05.592
burned myself taking out the
screws. It thermally stopped

00:07:05.592 --> 00:07:07.694
quickly. It stopped and burned a
hole through there and if you

00:07:07.694 --> 00:07:09.796
look lower platters the hole
went through -- you have to have

00:07:09.796 --> 00:07:11.798
multiple cutting head parts. So
that is the disassembled thing

00:07:11.798 --> 00:07:13.800
and didn't make a lot of mess.
Totally feasible in my opinion.

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:15.802
Next I thought well, these guys
use propane torches what if we

00:07:15.802 --> 00:07:17.804
just use the drive fuel, pump
oxygen through the drive and

00:07:17.804 --> 00:07:19.806
start off with magnesium and see
if the drive will consume

00:07:19.806 --> 00:07:21.808
itself. So here is oxygen
injection. I drilled a vent hole

00:07:21.808 --> 00:07:23.810
so didn't go to completion and
here is high speed shot with

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:25.812
F700. So a little bit of
containment issue, I feel like I

00:07:25.812 --> 00:07:27.814
could figure engineering of
this. That is what it looked

00:07:27.814 --> 00:07:29.816
like before opening. And inside
did make quite a mess and you

00:07:29.816 --> 00:07:31.818
know this was -- there is it
after cleaning platter and you

00:07:31.818 --> 00:07:33.987
can see nicely melted on one
side and I feel like with some

00:07:33.987 --> 00:07:36.122
more engineering effort here and
you know a lot of oxygen through

00:07:36.122 --> 00:07:38.391
this space that I can make this
consume the whole drive so that

00:07:38.391 --> 00:07:40.393
is potentially feasible. I know
that everything is here to see

00:07:40.393 --> 00:07:42.962
and it is what you come to see
which is therapy mite. So what I

00:07:42.962 --> 00:07:45.398
wanted to do is credit a therapy
mite that I pump into the drive

00:07:45.398 --> 00:07:47.701
and just really fuck it up big
time so I experimented and first

00:07:47.701 --> 00:07:49.970
of all sing this is 101I know
you know this. Ion and aluminum

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:51.971
swap oxygen partners like a
swingers party and releases a

00:07:51.971 --> 00:07:54.341
lot of energy and you get up to
2500. If you use ion three oxide

00:07:54.341 --> 00:07:56.443
so here I am stirring all slurry
and looks nice. Very, very

00:07:56.443 --> 00:07:58.745
smooth and you can easily inject
it. So I thought this was great.

00:07:58.745 --> 00:08:00.780
I should include you in what
happened next so here I am

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:03.783
trying to set off the thermite
with a blow torch and you see

00:08:03.783 --> 00:08:09.789
this is eight times sped up. So
really not reacting good so my

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:40.220
theory is the solvent is forming
Niacels with oxygen inside. I

00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:45.258
tried a lot of solvents and you
can see if I run a magnet over

00:08:45.258 --> 00:08:48.962
it very small amounts of iron
are being produced so reaction

00:08:48.962 --> 00:08:52.999
is not really happening here. Is
oxide is just being blown out

00:08:52.999 --> 00:08:58.071
with the smoke. So next idea is
if you open up a disc -- we

00:08:58.071 --> 00:09:01.341
could hide thermite you can fill
about 15-grams of thermite

00:09:01.341 --> 00:09:05.412
inside a drive. And you can
still the heads don't need to

00:09:05.412 --> 00:09:09.449
move into that space you can
still read and write with the

00:09:09.449 --> 00:09:13.820
drive in there and this makes me
feel like a drug dealer. But

00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:18.191
makes me laugh when I go to
airport and they make you turn

00:09:18.191 --> 00:09:22.228
off your electrics. So here is
shot with the thermite. Not too

00:09:22.228 --> 00:09:26.933
bad. But you can see that a lot
of stuff has burned and stuff

00:09:26.933 --> 00:09:30.970
all over the platters but closer
examination here we see the nice

00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:34.674
shiny chemical -- when it is
washed off bugger all has

00:09:34.674 --> 00:09:38.378
happened to those flatters.
Total fail. I was not ready to

00:09:38.378 --> 00:09:42.082
give up yet and in military
thermite grenades they use --

00:09:42.082 --> 00:09:46.119
what the nitrate does is produce
-- to move everything around and

00:09:46.119 --> 00:09:49.823
so burns hotter. So here is
15-grams of therapy mate much

00:09:49.823 --> 00:09:54.194
more violent as you can see.
Here is high speed shot. The top

00:09:54.194 --> 00:09:57.897
of this drive is screwed on
really hard. Producing much more

00:09:57.897 --> 00:10:01.968
spots and debris we can deal
with this the it still works.

00:10:01.968 --> 00:10:06.673
Don't remember the frame rate
this was shot at. Open it up

00:10:06.673 --> 00:10:10.910
with a glove this time. Some ion
that has attached itself and we

00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:12.912
have pretty good heat defamation
of the platter there and we

00:10:12.912 --> 00:10:14.914
welded the platter together over
here but most of that platter is

00:10:14.914 --> 00:10:16.916
still recoverable by electron
techniques and stuff like that

00:10:16.916 --> 00:10:18.918
so once again fail. Well, there
are other types of thermite.

00:10:18.918 --> 00:10:20.920
(laughter) for example cup of
thermite so the same thing

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:22.922
happens copper -- 4. 4 to one
copper oxide to one by weight. A

00:10:22.922 --> 00:10:24.924
very aggressive thermite. So
let's see what happens when we

00:10:24.924 --> 00:10:26.926
stick as much as we can on that
-- first of all so I thought wow

00:10:26.926 --> 00:10:28.928
that stuff rules. They surprised
me how fast it went. So maybe it

00:10:28.928 --> 00:10:30.930
will work with this stuff so
made up one of best slurries and

00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:32.932
-- it's burns a lot better than
the ion thermite but still

00:10:32.932 --> 00:10:34.934
reaction is restarted by the
purification. Anyway, so let's

00:10:34.934 --> 00:10:36.936
stick (audio drop) delivery
mechanism some other way. This

00:10:36.936 --> 00:10:38.938
is another high speed shot. So
keep watching because once again

00:10:38.938 --> 00:10:40.940
the lid of this drive is screwed
down tieing and you see the lid

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:42.942
exiting stage right. But keep
watching because you will see

00:10:42.942 --> 00:10:44.944
the drive coming from somewhere
airborne. (laughter) so this is

00:10:44.944 --> 00:10:46.946
experiment coded most of
(indiscernible) in copper. So

00:10:46.946 --> 00:10:48.948
everything in there now is going
to have great conductivity. So

00:10:48.948 --> 00:10:50.950
what is inside of the top plate.
You can really made some nice

00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:52.952
art with this technology so tell
Eddie to kick things up a notch

00:10:52.952 --> 00:10:54.954
in the vendor area and that is
what the drive itself looks like

00:10:54.954 --> 00:10:56.956
and you see it is every where as
you would expect from that shot.

00:10:56.956 --> 00:10:58.958
You can see that is stuck a lot
of things to the platter and

00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:00.894
looks nice. So let's watch it
and see how things really work.

00:11:00.894 --> 00:11:02.896
Some of it struck but we have to
say in feasible but fun. So time

00:11:02.896 --> 00:11:04.898
to get serious here and I
thought well the way that people

00:11:04.898 --> 00:11:06.900
talk about thermite drives they
get thermite prove the drive and

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:08.902
melt straight through it so I
thought let see if we can do

00:11:08.902 --> 00:11:10.904
this in one you so I built a
ceramic mold. 250-grams of

00:11:10.904 --> 00:11:12.906
thermite so I used a piece of
styrofoam to fill space in that

00:11:12.906 --> 00:11:14.908
material and made it match to
drive so I could clamp it on and

00:11:14.908 --> 00:11:16.910
there it is. So let's see if
that is enough. (audio drop) so

00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:18.912
as you can see my careful
containment worked perfectly.

00:11:18.912 --> 00:11:20.914
Miles workshop has a large area
rug on the floor. This shot sent

00:11:20.914 --> 00:11:22.916
a significant portion of that
rug on fire. Sorry Miles -- that

00:11:22.916 --> 00:11:27.253
looks so impressive. Surely
can't be too much left of the

00:11:27.253 --> 00:11:32.192
drive that we just did that to.
Once again I am now taking no

00:11:32.192 --> 00:11:36.462
chances with how hot things are
after doing this stuff. So we

00:11:36.462 --> 00:11:41.067
can see iron and made it way
through the top of the drive

00:11:41.067 --> 00:11:44.971
through that hole there and
inside made a mess of the

00:11:44.971 --> 00:11:48.541
electronics but we I have
already brushed that with my

00:11:48.541 --> 00:11:52.779
finger and seen there is still
plenty of nice clean platter in

00:11:52.779 --> 00:11:56.349
there. Look at that. Looks
almost good as new. So

00:11:56.349 --> 00:11:59.519
unreliable. So next time someone
safes drive destruction thermite

00:11:59.519 --> 00:12:03.156
no problems just remember there
are huge heat sink and you will

00:12:03.156 --> 00:12:07.927
need a lot of thermite. So
moving on to part two. Kinetic.

00:12:07.927 --> 00:12:13.666
Goal here was to deform spindle
mutilate the drive and retarded

00:12:13.666 --> 00:12:19.939
any form of mechanical scanning
to be done after the fact and

00:12:19.939 --> 00:12:26.179
degassing is not fun the watch.
One was to do a horizontal

00:12:26.179 --> 00:12:33.486
crusher that would fit in 1U. I
was sure It would work so I

00:12:33.486 --> 00:12:39.726
didn't bother doing it. I wanted
to use my pressure cutting tools

00:12:39.726 --> 00:12:45.999
but that was just for fun
because to build a water jet

00:12:45.999 --> 00:12:52.238
cutter into your data system is
in feasible. I wanted to start

00:12:52.238 --> 00:12:58.511
off with some methods and one
tools I use is this concrete

00:12:58.511 --> 00:13:05.218
nail gun and use as propel lend
charge to drive nails into the

00:13:05.218 --> 00:13:10.957
concrete and happened so fast
you can't really see the nail.

00:13:10.957 --> 00:13:16.429
It is gone through the block.
Here is another shot with this

00:13:16.429 --> 00:13:22.435
you have to hit it with a
hammer. The tool to make it go

00:13:25.705 --> 00:13:31.711
which is you have to do
something different to do it on

00:13:38.217 --> 00:13:44.223
hardies but you can see the
plastics there. So I yield the

00:13:47.193 --> 00:13:53.199
end of the drive so we can see
what happens and we hit it with

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:19.926
a nail gun and boom. No problem
at all going through the cast

00:14:26.799 --> 00:14:32.805
aluminum bottom of drive and all
the platters that cracks the

00:14:37.677 --> 00:14:43.683
cast aluminum drive part. There
is a close up of it and you can

00:14:51.557 --> 00:14:57.563
build array of these things. So
I think totally feasible we also

00:15:03.369 --> 00:15:09.375
had a pneumatic nail gun. Let's
give it a shot. I didn't even

00:15:16.215 --> 00:15:22.221
use a new drive for it. Right.
But it turns out it goes

00:15:29.095 --> 00:15:35.101
straight through the fucking
drive. Really nice so uses a big

00:15:40.006 --> 00:15:46.012
flat pancake cylinder so the one
on this nail gun is big but you

00:15:53.853 --> 00:15:59.859
could easily build a low profile
cylinder that would fit in your

00:16:05.665 --> 00:16:11.671
extra 1U and punch through the
drive in a whole bunch of places

00:16:18.544 --> 00:16:24.550
so nice. There is close upshot.
But this is why we came here.

00:16:31.424 --> 00:16:37.430
There the not doubt that we
destroy drives with high

00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:47.306
explosives and we also get
thermal factor as bonus so the

00:16:52.211 --> 00:16:58.217
goals was for me let's see if we
confine this explosion to

00:17:04.023 --> 00:17:10.029
equipment and I wanted to
experiment with new techniques.

00:17:12.932 --> 00:17:18.938
Binary explosive and -- and
another subgoal here was for me

00:17:23.809 --> 00:17:29.815
to pass go collect $200 and do
not go to jail for this. So this

00:17:38.658 --> 00:17:44.664
is Felix a commercial high
explosive liquid binary. It was

00:17:48.567 --> 00:17:54.574
expensive. So I created my own.
It is similar to a non-yum -- it

00:18:02.348 --> 00:18:08.354
is based on nitromethane and you
use steric acid aluminum. So

00:18:14.961 --> 00:18:18.631
that means these individual
components are easy to ship.

00:18:18.631 --> 00:18:21.334
They are not explosive until you
mix them. I don't know the

00:18:21.334 --> 00:18:24.904
ratios that is reaction so
nitromethane is high explosive.

00:18:24.904 --> 00:18:26.906
Aluminum acts as sensitizer. So
adds energy to the mixture. I

00:18:26.906 --> 00:18:28.908
thought that with my friends who
have a federal high explosive

00:18:28.908 --> 00:18:30.910
manufacturing license, it turns
out we found right before we

00:18:30.910 --> 00:18:32.912
were starting this project not
just the Feds that you care

00:18:32.912 --> 00:18:34.914
about this shit you have to get
state license as well. We just

00:18:34.914 --> 00:18:36.916
managed to get it done in time
so we all legal and could do

00:18:36.916 --> 00:18:39.018
this stuff but the big thing we
needed to have was the range

00:18:39.018 --> 00:18:41.020
because the state wants to in
special your manufacture

00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:43.022
facility. You understand where
this is going on. So we ended up

00:18:43.022 --> 00:18:45.024
very luckily finding a local
bomb squad that let us use their

00:18:45.024 --> 00:18:47.026
range. My friends and I forming
a consulting group. If you want

00:18:47.026 --> 00:18:49.095
to do this work talk to me but
it regulatory hell but that is

00:18:49.095 --> 00:18:51.097
better than being in prison. So
steric acid is important

00:18:51.097 --> 00:18:53.099
component. So use aluminum
powder that is steric acid

00:18:53.099 --> 00:18:55.101
coded. The blasting cap just
throws it around so what is

00:18:55.101 --> 00:18:57.103
total fail. When you get the
acid contend approximately right

00:18:57.103 --> 00:18:59.105
this is what it looks like. Many
of the people here now this so

00:18:59.105 --> 00:19:01.040
this is 101 so let's talk about
effects. The name of when he way

00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:03.042
shape charge means you have
groove but can be linear in your

00:19:03.042 --> 00:19:05.044
high explosive so when you put
that with the groove facing the

00:19:05.044 --> 00:19:07.046
material you want to cut and you
set it off, the cavity

00:19:07.046 --> 00:19:09.048
concentrates the shock wave and
forms a jet and you line the

00:19:09.048 --> 00:19:11.050
cavity with copper and form a
liquid metal jet that can cut

00:19:11.050 --> 00:19:13.052
through whatever you are trying
to cut through. Very technique.

00:19:13.052 --> 00:19:15.087
So here are few like design tips
so I was laying out a cup to

00:19:15.087 --> 00:19:17.623
hold the Felix CAD. You want to
stand off by two to three and a

00:19:17.623 --> 00:19:19.625
half diameters and charge height
should be higher than the cone.

00:19:19.625 --> 00:19:22.995
So what I thought about what
doing is linear shape charge in

00:19:22.995 --> 00:19:26.132
shape of ring and put on top of
the drive so you cut through the

00:19:26.132 --> 00:19:28.834
platters and I designed to fit
this within 1U. So we can fit

00:19:28.834 --> 00:19:33.839
60-grams of Felix in the
container. Don't concern

00:19:33.839 --> 00:19:39.845
yourself with this stage at the
containment because I work on

00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:50.556
that later. This is shot at
normal speed and then just

00:19:55.227 --> 00:20:01.233
slowed down. Hear is another
shot same technique, same

00:20:03.969 --> 00:20:09.975
amount. You can see a bit of
this drive exit stage right.

00:20:12.812 --> 00:20:17.349
Here are the results. A lot of
unconsumed aluminum so that mix

00:20:17.349 --> 00:20:20.986
was not correct. That was over
aluminum. You don't need too

00:20:20.986 --> 00:20:24.290
much to sensitize -- (audio
drop) it has crushed the

00:20:24.290 --> 00:20:27.259
platters. So something damage
and would be difficult to

00:20:27.259 --> 00:20:31.230
explode -- has done it's job and
cut through but that corresponds

00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:35.868
to where the cap was placed on
that shot so we are doing the

00:20:35.868 --> 00:20:39.839
right thing but we are having
trouble capping it. So I thought

00:20:39.839 --> 00:20:43.776
about another idea what about if
I we make our shape charges

00:20:43.776 --> 00:20:47.747
radial. So we found a lot of
aluminum around for those shots

00:20:47.747 --> 00:20:52.384
and I made a lid with a little
hole. So there is 3D printed

00:20:52.384 --> 00:20:55.688
charge. Hundred grams of Felix
this time and bigger physical

00:20:55.688 --> 00:21:00.593
thing and you see the cord that
we use to set it off. 80 inches

00:21:00.593 --> 00:21:05.231
of cord. Where did it go? This
camera that is inside you can

00:21:05.231 --> 00:21:11.237
see get as good shake from the
shock wave. This is from go

00:21:19.245 --> 00:21:25.251
pro-and you can see bits of the
drive go in all directions. So

00:22:10.329 --> 00:22:16.335
we had the search a bit the find
the pieces. This one is

00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:46.432
interesting because all of the
surface components being taken

00:22:46.432 --> 00:22:48.968
off the board. Here is part
platters and we got some

00:22:48.968 --> 00:22:50.970
welding. That is top plate
welded together. So very nice so

00:22:50.970 --> 00:22:52.972
that made us think let's try to
do compression welding. So this

00:22:52.972 --> 00:22:54.974
is just a straight up cord shot.
Hundred grain cord in that top

00:22:54.974 --> 00:22:56.976
one and double sided versus
doing some on each side to have

00:22:56.976 --> 00:22:58.978
the shock wave from outside in
and compressing to. So we did

00:22:58.978 --> 00:23:00.913
another interesting experiment.
But this is double shot. That is

00:23:00.913 --> 00:23:02.915
how we set it up. So the drive
is not in frame but doesn't move

00:23:02.915 --> 00:23:04.917
far. But quite well balanced.
Here is slow down shot. So you

00:23:04.917 --> 00:23:06.919
can see a couple of feet but a
sloped piece of land there so

00:23:06.919 --> 00:23:08.921
drops down to where you can't
see it in that shot. There is

00:23:08.921 --> 00:23:10.923
the drive that the plates on it.
So when we took that top plate

00:23:10.923 --> 00:23:16.929
off we you see it did not strip
the drive. So this is number one

00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:07.346
shot. So not the shot that we
just saw. Didn't strip the

00:24:42.047 --> 00:24:48.053
platter but it did compress
together very nicely and

00:25:10.743 --> 00:25:14.813
explosively well. You can't see
because the red head is welded

00:25:14.813 --> 00:25:18.384
to the top platter. And this
double shot. So the single shot

00:25:18.384 --> 00:25:25.257
is half times the double shot so
this is 40 percent of the charge

00:25:25.257 --> 00:25:30.662
of the single shot. It did
deform the platter nicely and

00:25:30.662 --> 00:25:37.035
made this cool grief in them.
But we can shear that were not

00:25:37.035 --> 00:25:43.375
welded together in anyway shape
or form. This is a C gate drive

00:25:43.375 --> 00:25:49.114
by the way so goes to show
anything you do to C gate drive

00:25:49.114 --> 00:25:52.117
doesn't work. We do know that
the charge we use to compress

00:25:52.117 --> 00:25:58.123
the platter is between those two
levels. Moving on, the bomb

00:26:27.186 --> 00:26:33.192
squad said to us by the way we
have hundreds of these oil well

00:26:51.710 --> 00:26:54.947
perforators that we want to get
rid of, would you like a few?

00:26:54.947 --> 00:26:57.216
These are like down hole so that
drill the well and stick with

00:26:57.216 --> 00:27:03.155
pipe down it and when it is all
done they put the pipe down it.

00:27:49.234 --> 00:27:55.240
So to go through steel and foot
or so of concrete. So if the

00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:24.796
bomb squad asks you if you want
to be friends and share their

00:29:24.796 --> 00:29:27.099
stuff you say yes. These are set
off so full of very fast high

00:29:27.099 --> 00:29:29.301
explosive and this is little bit
of foil at the top so let's the

00:29:29.301 --> 00:29:31.303
shock wave through and classic
shake charge so you have -- and

00:29:31.303 --> 00:29:33.972
this one I am pointing to has
stand off so everything is right

00:29:33.972 --> 00:29:39.978
to cut through things. So here
is shot that we did with two

00:29:51.223 --> 00:29:57.229
perforators. So you could never
get this shot if you wanted so

00:30:07.873 --> 00:30:13.879
these are the jets that the
blasting cap. The shock wave has

00:30:25.057 --> 00:30:31.063
gone through the cord set off
the charges and has not had time

00:30:54.720 --> 00:31:00.659
to break through the plastic
shell of that cord. This is

00:31:12.471 --> 00:31:16.441
miracle still frame. (CLAPPING)
So here is how we set it up. On

00:31:16.441 --> 00:31:20.378
the engineer of the drive to see
how we cut there -- here's a

00:31:20.378 --> 00:31:24.015
shot. Big camera shot. You can
see a chunk of the drive go

00:31:24.015 --> 00:31:27.385
flying off top left. There you
see how it cuts through the

00:31:27.385 --> 00:31:30.188
casing. Here are the platter
straight through. There is all

00:31:30.188 --> 00:31:33.825
bits that we could find, some
went into the water. Down at the

00:31:33.825 --> 00:31:37.195
bottom right what is that. That
is where the drive was sitting

00:31:37.195 --> 00:31:40.565
that is hole through the quarter
inch steel plate that exit hole

00:31:40.565 --> 00:31:48.540
on the other side and that whole
it dug in the ground. And that

00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:53.078
is piece of wire that we use to
measure the hole. 15 inches

00:31:53.078 --> 00:31:56.915
after going through drive steel
plate. So two bomb squad was

00:31:56.915 --> 00:32:00.352
interested in that. The next
time they bought the smaller

00:32:00.352 --> 00:32:04.222
version of the -- you remember
these one-half terabyte if you

00:32:04.222 --> 00:32:08.059
do anything with disc drives
because h is when the tsunami

00:32:08.059 --> 00:32:11.229
happened and quality control
went through the floor so

00:32:11.229 --> 00:32:15.433
everyone of these C gates drive
failed. So you see what results

00:32:15.433 --> 00:32:19.971
we get there. This time lying
the drive down -- this time we

00:32:19.971 --> 00:32:24.543
brought the S700. So you see a
bunch of drives exiting to the

00:32:24.543 --> 00:32:29.314
top of the screen and you get
more of impression of that from

00:32:29.314 --> 00:32:34.719
the go pro. So they are all out
it have ballpark. We didn't find

00:32:34.719 --> 00:32:40.725
enough -- we found this much and
you see that the drive case just

00:32:44.262 --> 00:32:50.635
very nicely (audio drop) like
that but didn't find the platter

00:32:50.635 --> 00:32:52.838
so we had to do the shot again.
I am not removing the label but

00:32:52.838 --> 00:32:54.840
I will void the warrantee
anyway. The go pro-shot is nice

00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:56.842
of this one. Just graceful ark.
So this is what we find of that

00:32:56.842 --> 00:32:58.844
drive in term of case and did a
nice job of going through the

00:32:58.844 --> 00:33:00.779
center spindle and there are the
platters so we cut through the

00:33:00.779 --> 00:33:02.781
platters but not this spindle
itself so I feel like we could

00:33:02.781 --> 00:33:04.783
tune the shape charges to go
through the hard drive. There is

00:33:04.783 --> 00:33:06.785
one other charge I want to try
which is diamond charge you

00:33:06.785 --> 00:33:08.787
create a flat high explosive and
you cap it and when you set it

00:33:08.787 --> 00:33:10.789
off the shock wave comes from
both sides and you get a jet

00:33:10.789 --> 00:33:12.791
that comes out either side and
cuts through what you want to

00:33:12.791 --> 00:33:14.793
cut through. It is like a high
explosive fruit roll up and I

00:33:14.793 --> 00:33:16.795
have used it before (audio drop)
we had some, and I wanted to use

00:33:16.795 --> 00:33:18.797
this on the shoot but it is
difficult to transport. You have

00:33:18.797 --> 00:33:20.799
to be black carded to transport
this stuff bassed on packages so

00:33:20.799 --> 00:33:22.801
we had a small amount but the
package said I was a kitchen

00:33:22.801 --> 00:33:24.803
role. So instead I3D printed a
container and filled it with

00:33:24.803 --> 00:33:26.805
Felix so here it is set up
60-grams of Felix and good to go

00:33:26.805 --> 00:33:28.807
on the drive and this shot the
diamond charge under the big

00:33:28.807 --> 00:33:30.809
steel plate and we were getting
rid of perforators under the big

00:33:30.809 --> 00:33:32.811
steel plate. So there I think
three of the small perforators

00:33:32.811 --> 00:33:34.813
under there that you will need
to know that for this video. So

00:33:34.813 --> 00:33:36.815
what is big plate coming down.
The heavy plate is not in that

00:33:36.815 --> 00:33:43.788
shot. But it is in this shot.
This was I think our last shot

00:33:43.788 --> 00:33:49.794
of the day. So wait for it.
There is quarter inch stele

00:33:56.401 --> 00:34:02.340
plate and there is half inch
one. So a good thing we didn't

00:34:10.015 --> 00:34:16.021
need that anymore because it was
gone. But there is the drive.

00:34:19.090 --> 00:34:21.092
Didn't do too much just acted
like a platter charge but didn't

00:34:21.092 --> 00:34:23.094
cut it total failure. Anyway, it
was interesting. I would like to

00:34:23.094 --> 00:34:25.096
try that again with the sheet.
Can we make this work in

00:34:25.096 --> 00:34:27.098
equipment. We want to decouple
it from the equipment and store

00:34:27.098 --> 00:34:29.100
it again. Sometimes of damping
material. Would be great to use

00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:31.102
some kind of substance that the
incompressible matrix. And it

00:34:31.102 --> 00:34:33.104
could be good if we can inject
it into the equipment when we

00:34:33.104 --> 00:34:35.106
wanted to. When could we get a
high tech thing? Thank you pyro.

00:34:35.106 --> 00:34:37.108
So we went to engineering
structures. So a big cup of this

00:34:37.108 --> 00:34:39.110
stuff over the explosive and the
-- so I said I return back to

00:34:39.110 --> 00:34:41.112
this shot, the single shot blues
the shaving cream inside a box.

00:34:41.112 --> 00:34:43.114
Let's see how that did. You can
see the -- so all right. This

00:34:43.114 --> 00:34:45.116
was a shot in which is drag was
-- that was the first frame of

00:34:45.116 --> 00:34:49.821
the shaving cream shot. With a
hundred grain cord. This is

00:34:49.821 --> 00:34:56.528
first frame without the shaving
cream from a charge that was 40

00:34:56.528 --> 00:35:03.768
percent size of left ones. So if
nothing else we are damping the

00:35:03.768 --> 00:35:10.475
flame and heat pull that is
coming out of that. That is

00:35:10.475 --> 00:35:17.215
interesting to me so we tried
this again. Kind of simulator so

00:35:17.215 --> 00:35:21.886
here is 75-grams of Felix. This
is one year rack simulator.

00:35:21.886 --> 00:35:26.391
Pieces welded to it set up here
coating in shaving cream so just

00:35:26.391 --> 00:35:30.562
getting idea of stuffing stuff
and what is going to happen. So

00:35:30.562 --> 00:35:34.399
I think that is pretty
impressive . Here is the 700

00:35:34.399 --> 00:35:37.869
shot. Like stuff goes flying but
different from those undamped

00:35:37.869 --> 00:35:41.406
shot that we did. Here is still
plate and made a dentin the

00:35:41.406 --> 00:35:47.412
plate and that is where the
drive was but not perforated and

00:36:44.002 --> 00:36:50.008
here is other one. We did unfold
the angle iron and split -- you

00:37:44.863 --> 00:37:48.032
see the drive in printed on the
plate there. But there's -- the

00:37:48.032 --> 00:37:50.034
summary here after damping stuff
with enough engineering effort

00:37:50.034 --> 00:37:52.904
it just might fucking work. So I
have to go fast because not too

00:37:52.904 --> 00:37:55.240
many things in there. We have
electricity in the data center

00:37:55.240 --> 00:37:57.976
so things I didn't do. I didn't
want to put you through that.

00:37:57.976 --> 00:38:00.678
First thing I wanted to do is
explode bridge wire so here is

00:38:00.678 --> 00:38:03.448
sketch capacitor bank. This is
how we charge it up and I could

00:38:03.448 --> 00:38:06.417
not find anyone had SSDs that
would give to me. But I am too

00:38:06.417 --> 00:38:09.587
cheap to spent them on SSDs to
blow them up. So I think we can

00:38:09.587 --> 00:38:11.723
draw some conclusions here.
Here's high speed shot of that.

00:38:11.723 --> 00:38:15.160
So I wanted to -- to a drive and
see if we can crus the force of

00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:19.197
that explosion. So you see in
the high speed shot it didn't

00:38:19.197 --> 00:38:25.203
work nothing happened to that
chip but when we looked at it

00:38:37.282 --> 00:38:43.288
the memory chip faired fine but
we did decap the microcontrol on

00:38:55.400 --> 00:39:01.339
other side. That is blasted
parting material off the chip.

00:39:10.415 --> 00:39:16.421
But we cannot rely on this
method. What about if we have

00:39:28.499 --> 00:39:34.505
drives and hooked up to power
and ground. So I saw it power

00:39:48.119 --> 00:39:54.125
ground and here is the -- so we
see we did some damage there and

00:40:00.231 --> 00:40:03.701
we is see that we blue the flash
memory chip off the board. You

00:40:03.701 --> 00:40:07.171
can see the internal leads. So
make a lot of damage to that and

00:40:07.171 --> 00:40:09.874
one thing we don't know is how
recoverable are flash memories.

00:40:09.874 --> 00:40:12.610
Whether you can use Microsoft
techniques to get stuff back but

00:40:12.610 --> 00:40:15.313
I will say feasible to destroy
things that way. For regular

00:40:15.313 --> 00:40:18.049
drives, that's -- so you can
wrap a coil around something

00:40:18.049 --> 00:40:21.252
metal and destroy the hell out
of it. Here is another shot of

00:40:21.252 --> 00:40:23.988
that. There is a big difference
between the soda can and

00:40:23.988 --> 00:40:26.457
hardies. This is a hundred
thousand frames per second. So

00:40:26.457 --> 00:40:29.427
you see that this squeezes down
quickly. This is other sides so

00:40:29.427 --> 00:40:32.163
the whole time I have been
talking over this slide 10

00:40:32.163 --> 00:40:34.632
seconds have not elapsed. Would
be really great to destroy

00:40:34.632 --> 00:40:37.602
hardies that way but the level
is unknown. So here is summary.

00:40:37.602 --> 00:40:40.071
The most feasible method in each
category plasma platter cutter

00:40:40.071 --> 00:40:42.573
work. Oxygen cutter could be
feasible. Kinetic nail guns were

00:40:42.573 --> 00:40:45.276
great. Possibly failing part of
the rules number of eyes lost,

00:40:45.276 --> 00:40:48.012
zero. (CLAPPING) just before the
goon drags me off stage here

00:40:48.012 --> 00:40:50.715
(audio drop) they grabbed him
away from his laptop and they

00:40:50.715 --> 00:40:54.419
got everything they needed to
put him away for life. So we can

00:40:54.419 --> 00:40:59.857
develop system that connected to
our computer so using Bluetooth

00:40:59.857 --> 00:41:05.797
this. Feel free to talk to me
about this later on thanks.
