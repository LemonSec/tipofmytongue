00:00:00.167 --> 00:00:06.840
So how many people know who I
am? Those who don't, I'm

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:11.144
private, been doing DEF CON here
18 years as a Goon, one of

00:00:11.144 --> 00:00:14.681
public things I do is called
spot the Fed. 	In the old day,

00:00:14.681 --> 00:00:21.822
ratio was 30% federal to
attendee, of course the cell

00:00:21.822 --> 00:00:28.295
phone goes off -- it was kind of
competition to spot the Fed.

00:00:28.295 --> 00:00:30.797
	Now it's just like shooting
ducks in the barrel, we don't do

00:00:30.797 --> 00:00:36.169
much any more. 	The "I am the
Fed" shirt is one of most

00:00:36.169 --> 00:00:43.243
covenanted shirts in the (phone
going off again) that's them

00:00:43.243 --> 00:00:51.118
telling me, 	>> Hello, I'm on
stage right now. 	Can I call you

00:00:51.118 --> 00:00:57.291
back. 	Thank you very much. 	My
9 year old doesn't take no for

00:00:57.291 --> 00:01:02.362
an answer and kept ringing and
ringing. 	It's so popular they

00:01:02.362 --> 00:01:07.267
steal from each other to get the
T-shirt. 	And we had FEDS

00:01:07.267 --> 00:01:11.672
throwing other FEDS under the
bus. 	So would someone like to

00:01:11.672 --> 00:01:16.209
spot the Fed, they jump up
together and you look at them,

00:01:16.209 --> 00:01:22.215
almost like twins, it was, stand
up sir, you sir, stand on chair.

00:01:26.887 --> 00:01:32.125
	 Muscle structure, khaki pants,
cargo, that was stock uniform.

00:01:32.125 --> 00:01:37.397
	Only thing missing is the gun
bag and, you get them into

00:01:37.397 --> 00:01:42.102
questioning and turns out
they're both from the same FBI

00:01:42.102 --> 00:01:44.237
office and inspiring for the
shirt. 	There's a speaker

00:01:44.237 --> 00:01:50.243
cancellation, so I'll open up
floor. 	Fed are like Canadians,

00:01:58.218 --> 00:02:00.153
they walk among us but do you
really know who they are?

00:02:03.557 --> 00:02:06.093
(Laughter) so, would anyone like
to spot the Fed in the audience?

00:02:10.831 --> 00:02:13.133
This is the audience
participation part, by the way.

00:02:15.736 --> 00:02:23.143
	Anyone have any guesses? Yes,
sir? This is like back in old

00:02:23.143 --> 00:02:29.149
Soviet Russia where you announce
your neighbors (Laughter). 	That

00:02:34.621 --> 00:02:40.761
guy is the most, I guy in the
black shirt? That kid there?

00:02:40.761 --> 00:02:46.767
Stand up sir, come on down, pull
up your pants, yes you. 	Anyone

00:02:50.604 --> 00:02:56.943
else want to play spot the Fed?
	Come on stage. 	Anyone else?

00:02:56.943 --> 00:03:02.883
You too, sir. 	You're not very
bright, are you sir. 	Yes, sir.

00:03:05.285 --> 00:03:10.691
	You. 	There's 2 of you, yes,
yes. 	You can't spot each other.

00:03:14.061 --> 00:03:20.067
	The guy with button down shirt?
They lie by the way. 	(Laughter)

00:03:25.205 --> 00:03:31.211
are your parents married. 	Were
they married to each other? Not

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:43.356
a Fed. 	Not a Fed. 	Anyone else
want to try? You don't get to

00:03:46.126 --> 00:03:51.498
randomly pick people you don't
like. 	That gentlemen right

00:03:51.498 --> 00:03:53.500
there. 	Come on down, you too,
ma'am. 	I thought we covered

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:59.673
this at first. 	You both come
down. 	You can tell how they

00:03:59.673 --> 00:04:05.612
walk, because if there's a gun
belt one side sticks out more.

00:04:23.196 --> 00:04:29.402
	Ma'am you pick up microphone as
well. 	What makes you think. 	>>

00:04:29.402 --> 00:04:35.408
He seems square dressed and very
vanilla, telltale sign for me.

00:04:40.614 --> 00:04:46.586
	I don't think there's a Fed in
the office for talk

00:04:46.586 --> 00:04:49.422
cancellation. 	>> If they're
running off the room when they

00:04:49.422 --> 00:04:51.658
say spot the Fed, it's probably
a Fed. 	>> Mainly his stature,

00:04:51.658 --> 00:04:57.998
	>> This is not date the Fed.
	This is spot the Fed. 	>> We

00:04:57.998 --> 00:05:05.539
brought him on the stage, did I
drill, how did you know he was a

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:11.545
Fed, she said I slept with him
yesterday. 	And pulled wallet

00:05:13.814 --> 00:05:19.819
and checked credits. 	I'm sorry
is someone from OSI out there in

00:05:37.904 --> 00:05:42.209
audience, raise your hand, don't
be afraid. 	I know you're out

00:05:42.209 --> 00:05:46.680
there, help me out here. 	Can
someone who is maybe associated

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:51.051
-- say what happened when you
lose your credits. 	Attendee:

00:05:51.051 --> 00:05:56.623
[Static-inaudible]. 	>> See
there's a Fed. 	It's a bad

00:05:56.623 --> 00:06:03.597
thing, almost as bad as losing
your gun. That's how she

00:06:03.597 --> 00:06:08.201
identified him. 	-- just because
he look that's way, wearing

00:06:08.201 --> 00:06:14.207
tennis shoes with black socks.
	>> Yeah ready to run if he

00:06:18.278 --> 00:06:25.652
needs to. 	>> I was going to
say, of all tracks that run in

00:06:25.652 --> 00:06:29.689
this particular room. 	One I
expect Feds to go to, do it

00:06:29.689 --> 00:06:35.695
yourself Nukeproffing, -- 	>>
Which is profiling, shame on

00:06:44.037 --> 00:06:51.511
you. 	Audience, do you have any
questions? Objective is to

00:06:51.511 --> 00:06:56.483
figure out if they're FEDS, you
can ask them any question you

00:06:56.483 --> 00:06:58.818
want. 	>> Do you have clearance?
Are you from Israel, sir? United

00:06:58.818 --> 00:07:00.854
States? Where are you from?
Netherlands. 	Do you have

00:07:00.854 --> 00:07:06.860
clearance? Not any more. 	That
ends the game. 	They're probably

00:07:24.144 --> 00:07:31.551
not FEDS. 	That's how we spot
the FEDS. 	Attendee:

00:07:31.551 --> 00:07:33.553
[Static-inaudible]. 	>> North or
south of the river, which Fed?

00:07:33.553 --> 00:07:38.525
Are north or south of the river.
	He doesn't know what you're

00:07:38.525 --> 00:07:44.531
saying. 	Inside or outside the
building. 	Attendee: Way outside

00:08:03.717 --> 00:08:09.723
the building. 	>> Way outside
the building. 	Have you ordered

00:08:18.131 --> 00:08:24.137
a copy of DD 14. 	>> Don't know
what that is, 	>> Anyone else

00:08:30.009 --> 00:08:34.114
have questions. 	Stand up sir.
	I think I know you. 	To you

00:08:34.114 --> 00:08:40.120
have defined benefit pension?
	>> No. 	Once again, probably

00:08:47.594 --> 00:08:53.600
not FEDS. 	One more. 	If what
person is a Fed? Is the camera

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:06.446
man a Fed? (Laughter). 	No he's
a union man. 	Or new Communist

00:09:14.988 --> 00:09:19.726
party. 	I can tell you honestly
there are Feds in the room. 	If

00:09:19.726 --> 00:09:25.732
they haven't already run out of
room. 	Try one more -- okay, in

00:09:29.269 --> 00:09:33.473
the audience who might be a Fed,
they come in all shapes, sizes

00:09:33.473 --> 00:09:39.479
an colors. 	Attendee: I nominate
this guy. 	>> That gentlemen

00:09:46.152 --> 00:09:53.793
right there, come on down. 	Once
a again, khaki shorts,

00:09:53.793 --> 00:09:59.799
	Attendee: Describe the watch.
	>> It is a [static-inaudible]

00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:19.586
W, 	>> He's a convict sir, not a
Fed. 	(Laughter) are you from

00:10:24.023 --> 00:10:28.595
Australia? 	>> New Zealand. 	>>
Close. 	I'm going to drop a

00:10:28.595 --> 00:10:32.632
third hint. 	There are at least
3 of them in the audience right

00:10:32.632 --> 00:10:34.634
now. 	Goons can't spot FEDS.
	It's called insider trading.

00:10:34.634 --> 00:10:36.636
	Somebody else. 	Not picking the
man that was just picked. 	Once

00:10:36.636 --> 00:10:38.638
again, -- I see -- God you all
suck (Laughter). 	He's got the

00:10:38.638 --> 00:10:44.644
outfit for it. 	Something that
flipped me out this year, FBI

00:11:35.328 --> 00:11:40.900
generally does not allow facial
hair, several FBI agents this

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:46.539
year have beards. 	Well groomed
beards and capped teeth, too.

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:06.593
	>> Were you worried when there
was the breach of. 	Attendee:

00:12:06.593 --> 00:12:08.661
[Static-inaudible]. 	>> DEF CON
-- again, did you get the first

00:12:08.661 --> 00:12:13.066
letter from OPM. 	>> No I did
not get a letter. 	>> Did you

00:12:13.066 --> 00:12:16.869
get e-mail. 	>> No e-mail. 	>>
Are you authorized to carry a

00:12:16.869 --> 00:12:20.640
concealed weapon 	>> Yes, in my
home state. 	>> Are you allowed

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:23.176
to carry on airplane. 	>> No.
	>> [static-inaudible]

00:12:23.176 --> 00:12:26.045
(Laughter) that's the kind of
question we're looking for.

00:12:26.045 --> 00:12:32.051
	(Applause). 	>> I really don't
know the difference (Laughter).

00:12:51.604 --> 00:12:57.610
	>> Not a Fed or good at hiding.
	Were you not worried about

00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:32.779
breach. 	>> I was worried. 	>>
Because I have clearance. 	I

00:13:32.779 --> 00:13:37.417
never got a letter, but I don't
know why. 	>> That's because

00:13:37.417 --> 00:13:43.356
they're doing second batch,
working on contractor right now.

00:13:43.356 --> 00:13:49.362
	Thank you for participating.
	Notice the hair cut, short on

00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:00.006
the sides. 	I got up this
morning and had it on backwards,

00:14:08.581 --> 00:14:15.321
until someone pointed it out it
was backwards. 	-- they'll be

00:14:15.321 --> 00:14:21.294
another spot the Fed, thank you
for participating and thanking

00:14:21.294 --> 00:14:27.300
for being good sports. 	Thank
you, thank you.
