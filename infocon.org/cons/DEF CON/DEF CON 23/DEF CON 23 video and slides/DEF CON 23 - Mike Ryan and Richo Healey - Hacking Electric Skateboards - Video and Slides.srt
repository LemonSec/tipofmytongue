00:00:00.367 --> 00:00:05.939
>> This is going to be a lot of
fun. I saw a preview of this

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:10.811
this morning, and this might be
a mistake we are going the play

00:00:10.811 --> 00:00:13.814
around with some skateboards.
And how many thought it would be

00:00:13.814 --> 00:00:19.820
a good idea to put a motor on
there. Let give these guys a big

00:00:26.727 --> 00:00:32.733
hand. (CLAPPING) Hello. How's it
going. So yeah. I'm Richard.

00:00:35.402 --> 00:00:42.609
This the Mike. I'm Richard. I
work for a company called

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:50.450
Stripe, so I work for E-bay and
I like Bluetooth and wireless

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:56.456
stuff and I am the voice of
reason sometimes. So like why do

00:00:58.926 --> 00:01:04.865
we do this to your selves the
thing for us made me think I'm

00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:15.175
going the buy electric
skateboard so I live in San Fran

00:01:15.175 --> 00:01:21.181
so this has now paid for itself
and it is impossible to get

00:01:23.684 --> 00:01:31.525
stolen and the kick starter was
huge and we thought this should

00:01:31.525 --> 00:01:37.531
be good maybe we should be the
first one to have a good poke at

00:01:41.301 --> 00:01:49.142
it. Like high -- it's there. You
saw Chris and Charlie before

00:01:49.142 --> 00:01:52.479
this. But not all of us can
afford the brick a car

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:58.485
repeatedly and we thought that
may someone hacking research. So

00:02:03.523 --> 00:02:09.763
first up is boosted so h is was
the first one we got our hands

00:02:09.763 --> 00:02:15.769
on. This is my daily compute. I
can go forward and backwards

00:02:25.178 --> 00:02:31.184
that is 22-miles an hour in
freedom units. This is an

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:46.266
Australian company. This goes
forward and has breaks since it

00:02:51.905 --> 00:02:56.643
only has one motor when you hit
the brakes you pull into traffic

00:02:56.643 --> 00:03:02.582
and the board called ego this is
knock off of boosted. You --

00:03:12.826 --> 00:03:17.697
it's literally as stiff as a
blank. So maybe noted the design

00:03:17.697 --> 00:03:23.970
friend you back a blackboard
with orange wheels that is how

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:31.945
it is done so the first thing we
want to talk about was boosted.

00:03:31.945 --> 00:03:39.920
Can go forward and backward and
you go down a big hill you can

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:47.327
pick up some of the power that
you lost and it uses Bluetooth.

00:03:47.327 --> 00:03:54.167
So used live (indiscernible) and
I think this boost board is in

00:03:54.167 --> 00:04:01.508
more countries so I was skating
one day and (audio drop) and has

00:04:01.508 --> 00:04:07.781
this thing called square which
is full of signals and train

00:04:07.781 --> 00:04:14.588
tracks and I was like skating
along and going in traffic and

00:04:14.588 --> 00:04:21.161
the board just loses power under
me and so I wonder if we can do

00:04:21.161 --> 00:04:26.800
this rely and this is only
(indiscernible) that has been

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:32.806
allocated to a skateboard. So it
turns out that was kind of

00:04:36.643 --> 00:04:42.649
tricky so like I had this
skateboard about fete like there

00:04:45.685 --> 00:04:51.691
was something Dodge by the and I
new it had Bluetooth and I new

00:04:57.197 --> 00:05:03.136
that Mike knew a lot of things
about Bluetooth. So I bought a

00:05:07.807 --> 00:05:13.814
bunch of bluetooths and -- I
bought a bunch of them and tried

00:05:18.518 --> 00:05:24.524
to sniff some packets and didn't
go well and I called Mike and

00:05:29.196 --> 00:05:35.202
said how did this work. And
before this research new nothing

00:05:38.238 --> 00:05:44.244
about Bluetooth and not also in
the right places but making some

00:05:48.081 --> 00:05:52.485
progress so he purchased some
over teeth and had no idea what

00:05:52.485 --> 00:05:56.890
he was doing so the way a over
tooth works got a controller and

00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:02.829
small radio on it that can be
reconfigured to talk like

00:06:05.031 --> 00:06:11.538
Bluetooth so we have some code
for following connections and

00:06:11.538 --> 00:06:19.079
putting the data on the PC. So
we were fired these guys up and

00:06:19.079 --> 00:06:25.085
got some packets out of it so
the interesting thing about

00:06:27.687 --> 00:06:30.790
modern Bluetooth -- pretty good.
The thing about this electric

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:35.028
skateboard they decided not to
use it. If they have everything

00:06:35.028 --> 00:06:38.431
we are about to show you would
have been a lot harder so yeah

00:06:38.431 --> 00:06:44.437
it was a poor choice because of
this lack of crypt to. 25 You

00:06:47.173 --> 00:06:53.179
can think of it has a key value
store in normally it is like you

00:06:56.549 --> 00:07:02.489
make a request and get some data
back and that is not actually

00:07:04.624 --> 00:07:10.196
how they used It if you take a
look at the next slide. So this

00:07:10.196 --> 00:07:17.337
is what we first got when we
dumped some traffic straight off

00:07:17.337 --> 00:07:25.078
the board. So the part that I
have highlighted is the value so

00:07:25.078 --> 00:07:32.819
inside of daily frame there is
bunch f of data the value is

00:07:32.819 --> 00:07:39.359
basically like the payload that
gets seem at the application and

00:07:39.359 --> 00:07:47.067
this says 02,102 that is as key
everything is as key and their

00:07:47.067 --> 00:07:53.606
entire protocol talks ASCII on
the wire which is sort of

00:07:53.606 --> 00:07:58.378
bizarre for talking to embedded
device. So we missed a lot of

00:07:58.378 --> 00:08:02.615
them because of the amount of
nose. If you just like -- hard

00:08:02.615 --> 00:08:10.256
to find anything else. So we
drank a bunch of beers and --

00:08:10.256 --> 00:08:16.329
and we discovered that it talks
duplex protocol where controller

00:08:16.329 --> 00:08:23.002
messages on the handle and --
having pulled the board apart

00:08:23.002 --> 00:08:30.877
and looked at it we know there
is blue radio part that exposes

00:08:30.877 --> 00:08:38.752
the serial port. So this is like
the first batch of messages that

00:08:38.752 --> 00:08:46.059
we got. We took like a five
minute capture of fiddling with

00:08:46.059 --> 00:08:53.933
the bottle and the thing we did
this research on it is expert

00:08:53.933 --> 00:09:01.141
mode and beginner mode is not
much fun. Let's you control the

00:09:01.141 --> 00:09:07.147
speed and fuel let's you ask it
how much fuel it has and we

00:09:09.616 --> 00:09:17.524
looked at it one through five
and we put at gauge nine hoping

00:09:17.524 --> 00:09:23.797
it could crash but didn't do
that. So like this got is as far

00:09:23.797 --> 00:09:29.669
as the language that the bot
talks but didn't get as close as

00:09:29.669 --> 00:09:36.042
we thought we would so Bluetooth
is more complicated if you

00:09:36.042 --> 00:09:41.114
trying to do basic stuff so we
got some old school tools for

00:09:41.114 --> 00:09:48.521
trying to speak Bluetooth. Rich
described minimal. I would

00:09:48.521 --> 00:09:54.294
describe as nonexistence. Blue
-- pretty good but complicated

00:09:54.294 --> 00:10:00.300
to do the right thing and
challenging to do the wrong

00:10:02.402 --> 00:10:08.441
thing. Has this like bizarre
fascination -- and kind of like

00:10:08.441 --> 00:10:11.377
doing other things with spec
mandates which is not very fun

00:10:11.377 --> 00:10:17.984
so we were trying to do some
work in this old system and we

00:10:17.984 --> 00:10:20.820
were realized wasn't going to
work out so I dusted off some

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:26.826
code and I thought I'm going to
sent some data to this Bluetooth

00:10:29.129 --> 00:10:35.502
and buzz like mad. That is how
it works. Actually in the

00:10:35.502 --> 00:10:41.941
process I accident Bluetooth
stack and so we implemented a

00:10:41.941 --> 00:10:48.915
bunch of stuff on of the of this
and so I mean for me coming in

00:10:48.915 --> 00:10:54.921
outsider and if we are not
nothing a lot about Bluetooth --

00:10:57.223 --> 00:11:03.162
happens to sent message on the
wire. Whether or not it was

00:11:05.465 --> 00:11:10.770
running make (indiscernible)
welcome change. So we sat down

00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:16.342
and we coded up some BT code
that could talk to the board in

00:11:16.342 --> 00:11:23.516
the language that it wanted to
and we spun the wheels. So

00:11:23.516 --> 00:11:30.690
anyway, we like patted ourselves
on the back and like great we

00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:37.830
can talk to board but the trick
is like Bluetooth will only

00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:45.605
allow one device to be connected
at the time and this is problem.

00:11:45.605 --> 00:11:53.346
So the point of thing so that
meant that it was not immediate

00:11:53.346 --> 00:11:59.352
obvious how do I get control of
his bot and mess with it. So I

00:12:02.221 --> 00:12:06.659
was like thinking getting then
off to that intersection if you

00:12:06.659 --> 00:12:14.000
make it everything stops working
and I went to Mike about said

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.638
why don't we just jam Bluetooth
-- so turns out jamming

00:12:18.638 --> 00:12:25.745
Bluetooth -- is challenging and
does a bunch of things. We did

00:12:25.745 --> 00:12:32.285
not consider that outcome. That
is the right response. So we

00:12:32.285 --> 00:12:39.392
would like make so much noise
that nothing can talk and then

00:12:39.392 --> 00:12:45.398
we can sneak in a thing to the
bot. So jamming Bluetooth -- is

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:53.706
not that easy so Mike is like it
is not that easy but he said to

00:12:57.210 --> 00:13:04.851
me quote literal never going to
work. So we kind of did some

00:13:04.851 --> 00:13:10.256
science that looked like this.
It also looked like this. So

00:13:10.256 --> 00:13:17.530
this is a analyzer showing
2-point-hertz IV M. So using

00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:23.536
hacker RF we configure it to
shout a bunch of noise in max

00:13:26.973 --> 00:13:32.979
band with that it can is that
the fourth of the spectrum. So

00:13:36.315 --> 00:13:42.755
that didn't work so we -- excuse
me. >> How are these guys doing?

00:13:42.755 --> 00:13:48.761
(CLAPPING). So I figured it was
appropriate because these things

00:13:51.597 --> 00:13:56.969
have wheels and we have one of
tesla crew this is Jeff. Say hi

00:13:56.969 --> 00:14:03.076
to Jeff. Now I don't know about
the shooting glen lib its stuff

00:14:03.076 --> 00:14:08.081
but we will give it a try. What
do we do with new speakers. He

00:14:13.386 --> 00:14:18.291
says that was pretty lame. What
do we do with new speakers. I

00:14:18.291 --> 00:14:24.297
heard a few other choices but we
will just do a shot. We do not

00:14:32.839 --> 00:14:38.845
kill the speakers. Def Con. >>
Shooting glen nothing like it.

00:14:43.483 --> 00:14:49.489
Please give that back. Where the
guy riding the skateboard he

00:14:54.160 --> 00:15:00.099
really need as drink. I think we
should get -- a shot. I think he

00:15:04.971 --> 00:15:10.977
needs more than one. Dominic is
going to be part of your

00:15:16.682 --> 00:15:22.688
entertainment has made some poor
life choices leading up to this

00:15:31.764 --> 00:15:37.770
moment. Everyone say good buy to
Dominic. (CLAPPING). We took the

00:15:42.542 --> 00:15:48.815
kid gloves off and wrote fir
wear and screamed as much as

00:15:48.815 --> 00:15:52.418
possible. Doesn't matter we are
trying to do bad things here so

00:15:52.418 --> 00:15:58.424
I was talking to Mike and it was
like the designed the protocol

00:16:01.727 --> 00:16:07.733
to stop us from doing this kind
of thing. So we went back the

00:16:11.838 --> 00:16:17.844
drawing board and so I had done
a little bit of Bluetooth --

00:16:21.214 --> 00:16:27.220
jamming in the past but it is
easy to jam connect as hey are

00:16:31.324 --> 00:16:37.330
created but hard to jam existing
connections. And put in magic to

00:16:39.966 --> 00:16:47.907
jam those guys and actually
turns out to be effective. But

00:16:47.907 --> 00:16:53.913
the problem is -- mode works by
capturing -- so you have to

00:16:57.283 --> 00:17:05.157
capture the address. And then
after that you have to capture

00:17:05.157 --> 00:17:11.764
the hop interval. So we go coded
this up and looked like this.

00:17:11.764 --> 00:17:17.937
Yeah, this was surprisingly a
lot more effective than the

00:17:17.937 --> 00:17:23.943
previous things. So in case this
is not clear the bottom graph if

00:17:25.945 --> 00:17:31.951
you look at the magnitude looks
lower and in the top chart the

00:17:33.986 --> 00:17:39.992
red parts is when the radio was
screaming and the reason it has

00:17:41.994 --> 00:17:46.933
the stepping pattern because
recovered what frequency the

00:17:46.933 --> 00:17:52.939
other radios are on and just
jumps with that and then no one

00:17:54.974 --> 00:18:00.913
else -- and then we win which
brings us to Dominic has me

00:18:02.949 --> 00:18:08.955
ridden this thing before. So we
set up these jammers and jam his

00:18:10.957 --> 00:18:16.696
connection and connect in the
meantime and do some stuff to

00:18:16.696 --> 00:18:22.702
it. I'm not ready yet. So then
I'm going the slam into reverse

00:18:26.472 --> 00:18:32.478
and Dominic is going to go
flying. Would you like a

00:18:35.114 --> 00:18:41.120
cigarette Dominic. Come on let's
do it. We have three for three

00:18:56.435 --> 00:19:00.039
jamming. We tried this so many
times. Just keep skating around.

00:19:00.039 --> 00:19:06.045
Come closer. You're being shy.
Why are you doing this wrong.

00:19:13.185 --> 00:19:19.191
This is embarrassing. I hate
live demos. I hate them so much.

00:19:44.817 --> 00:19:50.222
I hate demos so much. This is
really dissatisfying. Go back

00:19:50.222 --> 00:19:56.629
and forth once more and then we
will quit and drink very heavy

00:19:56.629 --> 00:20:01.033
this sucks. It should be
working. (laughter) fuck it

00:20:01.033 --> 00:20:08.407
let's pass be the bot and I will
flip it up. It is jammed. By

00:20:08.407 --> 00:20:14.313
Dominic. (CLAPPING) that was not
a success but we tried. So we

00:20:14.313 --> 00:20:19.718
will talk about what was
supposed to happen. We have like

00:20:19.718 --> 00:20:24.657
had spurring times trying to jam
things in noisy environments

00:20:24.657 --> 00:20:30.062
when we filmed this thing one
worked great and another one

00:20:30.062 --> 00:20:36.435
didn't. This Ali way is the one
next to office. People are using

00:20:36.435 --> 00:20:42.341
a lot of technology in this
room. So anyway, he is series

00:20:42.341 --> 00:20:48.748
about using the clicker on this
talk. I am so excited to use

00:20:48.748 --> 00:20:56.122
this so we had a demo ready and
we were not sure Def Con would

00:20:56.122 --> 00:21:03.429
let us get away with it and they
would not. So we were like how

00:21:03.429 --> 00:21:10.803
do we get close to the rider.
There it goes. So we stuck it to

00:21:10.803 --> 00:21:16.675
drone and we were concerned
about the bot ending up on the

00:21:16.675 --> 00:21:23.082
engineer of the hotel. So this
is about where we turned the jam

00:21:23.082 --> 00:21:28.020
on. And so (CLAPPING) it turns
out strapping a Bluetooth and

00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:34.026
three over teeth and over is
shit to a drone causes weight

00:22:43.395 --> 00:22:49.235
issues. This is best idea that
we had. So a agent X around.

00:22:49.235 --> 00:22:55.241
This is a different thing.
(audio drop) this is really ease

00:22:59.378 --> 00:23:05.317
-- that was one of the most
terrifying things I have e seen.

00:23:18.497 --> 00:23:23.068
A massive drone with four huge
carbon reinforced propellers

00:23:23.068 --> 00:23:29.074
flying at you. We got off to a
shaky start last year and they

00:23:31.377 --> 00:23:37.149
have never dealt with security
before. They were really

00:23:37.149 --> 00:23:43.522
surprised that were not using
crypt to and they were quite

00:23:43.522 --> 00:23:49.528
sure they were and we are sure
you are not. So we did wind up

00:23:54.300 --> 00:24:00.139
working with them towards the
end and they implemented a fix.

00:24:00.139 --> 00:24:06.078
They published a book yet. They
are just beta testing in.

00:24:06.078 --> 00:24:11.450
Security research. Making the
world a better place. I can't

00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:18.457
even say it with a straight
face. So next on the hit list

00:24:18.457 --> 00:24:23.829
was (indiscernible) we didn't
bring this one to vegas because

00:24:23.829 --> 00:24:31.370
it is huge. So it has a better
range than boost did because the

00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:37.810
entire thing is made up of
batteries and have this very odd

00:24:37.810 --> 00:24:43.749
looking remote instead of having
a thumb trigger has the finger

00:24:43.749 --> 00:24:50.756
trigger. I took one look of this
thing and thought yeah but got

00:24:50.756 --> 00:24:56.762
on it and said no. So kind of
neat. So a friend of ours lent

00:24:58.831 --> 00:25:04.970
awes bot and says Bluetooth --
like in a lot of places on the

00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:11.944
marketing material and we are
convinced that we are good at

00:25:11.944 --> 00:25:17.950
this at this point. So I think
this should be easy I don't need

00:25:20.953 --> 00:25:26.959
Mike so we have the same hair
theses that we used last time

00:25:29.328 --> 00:25:37.069
hooked them up and got nothing.
So spent while to figure out

00:25:37.069 --> 00:25:44.777
whether it was a environment
again. I live in San Fran so

00:25:44.777 --> 00:25:51.884
when I just like sniffing
without the board on there was

00:25:51.884 --> 00:25:57.890
so much noise -- I was likely
don't you come over and built

00:26:00.192 --> 00:26:06.198
the faraday cage. And so this is
our faraday cage. This is snow

00:26:08.567 --> 00:26:15.307
board box wrapped in layer
tinfoil but it worked pretty

00:26:15.307 --> 00:26:20.679
well, with the remote inside of
box and board outside the remote

00:26:20.679 --> 00:26:25.350
was not able to bond with it so
we capture this data from inside

00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:30.856
so we think the Bluetooth --
should be here somewhere but

00:26:30.856 --> 00:26:34.793
nothing nothing at all. So we're
kind of like puzzling over this

00:26:34.793 --> 00:26:41.133
for a while and -- (audio drop)
we thought we should pull it

00:26:41.133 --> 00:26:48.640
apart and still unclear if we
told him we were going to do

00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:56.148
this. So hi Ryan if you are here
we pulled your skateboard apart.

00:26:56.148 --> 00:27:02.087
So this is labeled RF on it and
it was a little bit bizarre and

00:27:04.756 --> 00:27:09.995
called the -- it is not
Bluetooth -- chip. Which like

00:27:09.995 --> 00:27:15.134
led me to ask some questions.
This is small. This is big

00:27:15.134 --> 00:27:20.205
bigger and this is the word
Bluetooth. So I had some

00:27:20.205 --> 00:27:27.212
confusion about this. So fuck I
went too soon. So talks about

00:27:27.212 --> 00:27:34.853
this thing call power -- so
talks about shock birrs with the

00:27:34.853 --> 00:27:42.728
trademarks that are in the data
sheet. So we were like okay.

00:27:42.728 --> 00:27:44.730
This is not Bluetooth -- we
don't know anything about it.

00:27:44.730 --> 00:27:50.202
That is weirds so we still at my
place and hanging out with our

00:27:50.202 --> 00:27:54.673
faraday cage and at this point
we can clearly had too much

00:27:54.673 --> 00:28:00.612
beer. And so we didn't have a
hacker F. So I got as far as

00:28:08.687 --> 00:28:14.693
sniffing USB once and put it in
a drawer and me looked at it

00:28:22.935 --> 00:28:29.408
again and we like dumped a bunch
of traffic and we still got

00:28:29.408 --> 00:28:33.745
nothing and we were like looked
like that (indiscernible) at

00:28:33.745 --> 00:28:38.817
this point had no idea why we
were not getting anything. Kind

00:28:38.817 --> 00:28:44.756
ever aside don't yell it out but
if you come up to us afterward

00:28:44.756 --> 00:28:50.662
and you can guess why this thing
is strapped back to thing I will

00:28:50.662 --> 00:28:55.434
buy you a beer. I have asked
several different engineers what

00:28:55.434 --> 00:28:59.972
is used for and got several
different answers. So we didn't

00:28:59.972 --> 00:29:05.978
get anywhere with the remote so
we pulled the other thing apart.

00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:14.519
So inside of bar is odd. 95
percent of surface area the

00:29:14.519 --> 00:29:20.125
taken up by battery and this
compartment that is cramped so

00:29:20.125 --> 00:29:26.098
we pulled everything out and
bunch of off the shelf parts. It

00:29:26.098 --> 00:29:32.638
is above the front wheel which
makes sense from a design

00:29:32.638 --> 00:29:38.377
perspective but just a bizarre
design so they have the video on

00:29:38.377 --> 00:29:45.450
the website education planing
how to like fix a flaw in if you

00:29:45.450 --> 00:29:51.456
remote the not bonding properly
and involves tape to stuff and

00:29:51.456 --> 00:29:57.963
unclear what hey were doing at
the time. Our hunch given that

00:29:57.963 --> 00:30:03.969
it says Bluetooth -- but they
just shipped it off to

00:30:03.969 --> 00:30:10.509
contractor. This is why we were
not seeing data from the remote

00:30:10.509 --> 00:30:17.015
because nothing to see. Does
have a nine member bit field in

00:30:17.015 --> 00:30:24.656
it. So we went ahead and looked
at this and new we're were not

00:30:24.656 --> 00:30:32.264
going to use a you we're tooth
to pick at it all -- radio

00:30:32.264 --> 00:30:38.603
version of the NRF chip that was
in the remote and I was looking

00:30:38.603 --> 00:30:45.877
at this trying to figure out how
the recovery this data and I saw

00:30:45.877 --> 00:30:53.151
that Travis wrote a blog post
and had a code that do the right

00:30:53.151 --> 00:31:00.358
thing out to box. So high five
for making my job easy. So we

00:31:00.358 --> 00:31:06.598
wrote some code to sniff evolve
using this device. A little bit

00:31:06.598 --> 00:31:12.604
of code on top of good fit so I
may send in a request for that.

00:31:14.906 --> 00:31:21.146
We came up with the jamming
attack and was not amazing but

00:31:21.146 --> 00:31:27.285
beyond that there was nothing to
do the bot didn't know how to do

00:31:27.285 --> 00:31:32.190
enough stuff for it to do the
main things to it. This thing

00:31:32.190 --> 00:31:37.863
had a throttle and that was it
so we jammed it and made one

00:31:37.863 --> 00:31:43.268
roll down the hill. So anyway,
so brings up to ego. This one

00:31:43.268 --> 00:31:49.274
says Bluetooth -- over it and
has smart phone appearance you

00:31:59.184 --> 00:32:05.123
figure out that point has they
be Bluetooth -- so you see where

00:32:08.059 --> 00:32:14.499
this going. So rich pulls out
over teeth and at this point

00:32:14.499 --> 00:32:19.471
doesn't know how to use them
properly. So he attempted to

00:32:19.471 --> 00:32:25.377
sniff it and didn't see any
packets and we were still at a

00:32:25.377 --> 00:32:31.283
lost. So the next thing I did
was I was attacking the remote

00:32:31.283 --> 00:32:36.721
because that was like your the
thing that we are interested in

00:32:36.721 --> 00:32:41.693
with dicking with so they did
say downloaded from the store

00:32:41.693 --> 00:32:47.299
and I like turned it on and said
searching for device and still

00:32:47.299 --> 00:32:49.868
nothing. And I was looking at
the board and there was this

00:32:49.868 --> 00:32:55.874
switch on the side but the grum
it say BT/WiFi and I said no.

00:32:59.878 --> 00:33:05.750
Surely not. No one would build a
skateboard that talks WiFi that

00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:11.389
would be crazy. So turns out
they didn't. They just put words

00:33:11.389 --> 00:33:17.963
that don't mean the things
inside the bot on them and I

00:33:17.963 --> 00:33:23.435
looked at the smart phone
appearance. There was not a

00:33:23.435 --> 00:33:29.441
whole lot in there but turns
otophone Bluetooth -- is crazy

00:33:29.441 --> 00:33:34.446
hard the jam. So io phones and
talk to Bluetooth -- chip and

00:33:34.446 --> 00:33:40.385
tell it to avoid the channels
that are being used by the LT

00:33:40.385 --> 00:33:47.659
connections so they don't use
all of the data commands and the

00:33:47.659 --> 00:33:54.933
mode jammer that we talked about
with boosted doesn't work at all

00:33:54.933 --> 00:34:02.140
with ego working on the iphone.
So talks something. So we like

00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:08.146
had a good look at it and what
does this thing talk. So based

00:34:10.615 --> 00:34:17.022
on the position of the switch --
the (indiscernible) so we like

00:34:17.022 --> 00:34:22.794
pulled it open as we want do and
we identified the radio part

00:34:22.794 --> 00:34:27.132
kind of but it had the serial
numbers scratched off and

00:34:27.132 --> 00:34:31.937
unclear whether or not this was
a technique or damaging in

00:34:31.937 --> 00:34:38.043
chipping so we were at this for
a little while and we had this

00:34:38.043 --> 00:34:41.680
moment when Mike has
contribution the research. So

00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:46.618
this is a hacker of portapak.
This is shield that it is on top

00:34:46.618 --> 00:34:53.058
of the hacker F and turns it
into a hand held video and we

00:34:53.058 --> 00:34:58.563
used it for a wide band spectrum
analyzer. That is not Bluetooth.

00:34:58.563 --> 00:35:04.035
So we started digger further so
using the hacker F and regular

00:35:04.035 --> 00:35:10.008
hacker forking mode and it looks
like this and if you kind of

00:35:10.008 --> 00:35:17.349
hard to see on here but if you
look at it collies I will it is

00:35:17.349 --> 00:35:23.788
SFK so one frequency for zero
and one for one and we were able

00:35:23.788 --> 00:35:29.294
to do a little bit of radio and
demoderate that into something

00:35:29.294 --> 00:35:35.734
that we could look at and counts
the bits so we were able to

00:35:35.734 --> 00:35:41.072
recovery the offset and access
code use to identify the packets

00:35:41.072 --> 00:35:47.445
and the rate and later we could
plug that into something like a

00:35:47.445 --> 00:35:54.052
over tooth and sniff it. But we
had the fire up a new radio and

00:35:54.052 --> 00:36:01.092
connect a bunch of boxes with a
bunch of lines. But it is quite

00:36:01.092 --> 00:36:03.094
difficult to work with
especially if you don't know

00:36:03.094 --> 00:36:10.602
anything about DSV. Felt like
this when I was using it. We

00:36:10.602 --> 00:36:17.208
could see the packets and how
frequently they were occurring

00:36:17.208 --> 00:36:23.214
and these slides are way out of
order. This is my fault. So we

00:36:26.418 --> 00:36:32.424
had -- so we bluing this stuff
into the over tooth but the

00:36:34.959 --> 00:36:42.867
device used a different channels
and it time between packets as a

00:36:42.867 --> 00:36:48.073
single channel and we could
measure packets on the different

00:36:48.073 --> 00:36:50.809
channel and we could figure out
the hot order between those

00:36:50.809 --> 00:36:58.516
channels so first up is this
histogram where I sat on the

00:36:58.516 --> 00:37:05.590
single channel. Using the high
resolution channel and you see

00:37:05.590 --> 00:37:11.296
they cluster neatly into these
buckets so on a single channel

00:37:11.296 --> 00:37:18.470
you get two packets 44m s apart
and you see the first packet and

00:37:18.470 --> 00:37:24.609
second and third and turns out
there is 11m s between those

00:37:24.609 --> 00:37:28.546
guys so we found out there were
four channels this thing used

00:37:28.546 --> 00:37:33.618
and time between the first three
channels was 11m s guess what

00:37:33.618 --> 00:37:37.922
the time was between the next
channel was 11m s so we black

00:37:37.922 --> 00:37:41.259
boxed reverse engineered the way
the protocol hops through the

00:37:41.259 --> 00:37:48.333
channels and have some code in
over tooth to do all of this. So

00:37:48.333 --> 00:37:54.339
I think -- I don't know if we
pushed this stuff out yet. So

00:38:01.746 --> 00:38:06.951
once we reimplemented we are
like great. Why don't we have a

00:38:06.951 --> 00:38:12.957
stab at jamming this thing so as
we mentioned doesn't have a

00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:19.164
reverse. So this is what your
jammer looks like in practice.

00:38:19.164 --> 00:38:23.067
So jammer works by listening to
single word of packet and turns

00:38:23.067 --> 00:38:29.073
to over tooth around in -- mode
and hop to the next channeling a

00:38:34.379 --> 00:38:40.385
spews out data and if you do for
a while the board gives up and

00:38:51.396 --> 00:38:56.000
loses connection. So I'm going
to spin the wheels here so thing

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:01.940
done have a notion of reverse
which is I'm practical which

00:39:06.411 --> 00:39:12.417
means we can't throw people off
directly one thing we can do

00:39:20.491 --> 00:39:26.497
know meaning that if you grab
someone past the hill they are

00:39:34.572 --> 00:39:40.578
on the mechanical spear. Works
like every time 90 percent of

00:39:47.485 --> 00:39:53.491
the time. We had a slide for
that demo. Out of order again.

00:40:02.767 --> 00:40:08.773
So we ran into the same issues.
We looked at it and was really

00:40:18.049 --> 00:40:22.153
fun to Dick with but only
interbase was take message out

00:40:22.153 --> 00:40:28.159
of the wire so no at lot that we
can do with interfering of

00:40:30.728 --> 00:40:36.734
functions of the bot and means
it that unlikely the vendors

00:40:48.212 --> 00:40:54.218
will be and the patch these
things. So towards the end we

00:43:19.964 --> 00:43:22.333
were working on this thing and
thought like fuck it there is

00:43:22.333 --> 00:43:24.869
some more stuff in boosted and
sing like the very start of this

00:43:24.869 --> 00:43:27.238
research I wanted to show on the
skateboard. That is thing I

00:43:27.238 --> 00:43:29.607
wanted so we got to thinking
what if we can code on

00:43:29.607 --> 00:43:31.609
skateboard. So we pulled the
board apart. (indiscernible) but

00:43:31.609 --> 00:43:34.111
as we start to dig into it we
found them but couple of months

00:43:34.111 --> 00:43:36.113
after we started this research
(indiscernible) if you look at

00:43:36.113 --> 00:43:38.249
bottom it says firmware update
available and we were like neat.

00:43:38.249 --> 00:43:40.418
So we were like firmware
facilities good so give it some

00:43:40.418 --> 00:43:43.154
code and sounds like fun so we
took one of bot and we dumped

00:43:43.154 --> 00:43:45.323
the platelet traffic that was
heading between the bot as well

00:43:45.323 --> 00:43:47.859
as back end and we figure we
could work out how we send

00:43:47.859 --> 00:43:50.428
firmware to bot and what it
looks like. So a lot of hours

00:43:50.428 --> 00:43:52.763
later we stip together some that
looks like a firmware bot and

00:43:52.763 --> 00:43:54.932
combination of these things and
they're were things about it the

00:43:54.932 --> 00:43:57.101
string had (indiscernible) we
got a list of all the things

00:43:57.101 --> 00:43:59.470
that you do with the board. You
can get the current version.

00:43:59.470 --> 00:44:01.939
Numb skull command and I worked
out what it was, it was the

00:44:01.939 --> 00:44:04.308
number of skill levels. And in
doing so our good friend --

00:44:04.308 --> 00:44:06.844
(audio drop) so we wanted to
know how do we get new firm

00:44:06.844 --> 00:44:09.413
where that is key thing that we
wanted to do. But looks like

00:44:09.413 --> 00:44:11.582
(indiscernible) so like this is
the firmware that we unpack and

00:44:11.582 --> 00:44:13.918
this is Bluetooth -- packet they
are the same bytes and before

00:44:13.918 --> 00:44:16.087
that there are extra commands
and BTLD says give me your

00:44:16.087 --> 00:44:18.656
firmware so accepts region and
says like to me BBR is the thing

00:44:18.656 --> 00:44:21.592
that we interested in. So we are
like what do we do with this. I

00:44:21.592 --> 00:44:24.161
mean you can do something shitty
to a rider. I like believe in

00:44:24.161 --> 00:44:26.497
learning my own hardware but at
this point we break the board.

00:44:26.497 --> 00:44:29.066
So we are done to would be
minute so we will talk about

00:44:29.066 --> 00:44:31.435
golf board that use the same
stuff and has hit people riding

00:44:31.435 --> 00:44:33.571
down gulf courses. Neither of us
plays gulf but would be

00:44:33.571 --> 00:44:35.740
interesting to play with these.
Someone should hack a gulf bot.

00:44:35.740 --> 00:44:38.509
And safe hex is welcome to come
up if they escort us off the

00:44:38.509 --> 00:44:41.245
stage. So I want to shout out to
Bruce for being great to work

00:44:41.245 --> 00:44:43.614
with in the sense they didn't
try to run us financially but

00:44:43.614 --> 00:44:45.616
they were cooperative and
implemented a fix and if buy

00:44:45.616 --> 00:44:47.618
electric skateboard buy a
boosted board. This is stuff

00:44:47.618 --> 00:44:49.620
that we worked on and we are
releasing everything. Thanks for

00:44:49.620 --> 00:44:51.622
having us.
