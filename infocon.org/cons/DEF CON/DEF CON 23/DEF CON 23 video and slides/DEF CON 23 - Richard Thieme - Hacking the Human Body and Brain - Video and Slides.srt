00:00:00.067 --> 00:00:04.404
How great it is, 20 years ago
when I first spoke at DEF CON,

00:00:04.404 --> 00:00:08.008
the talk is hacking,
transplanting life for the 21st

00:00:08.008 --> 00:00:14.281
Century, a lot came to be true,
the people in audience were kids

00:00:14.281 --> 00:00:20.921
and now they have responsibility
of good and evil in the world.

00:00:20.921 --> 00:00:26.260
	Saw they would be thought
leaders in the century, they

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:33.166
are, and create, space we live
and move, which is the IT space,

00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:37.704
security space we inhabit.
	Because revolution is old, it

00:00:37.704 --> 00:00:41.275
gathered momentum and conquered
the world and created the flat

00:00:41.275 --> 00:00:46.713
form we live. 	Because of that,
every other thing on flat form

00:00:46.713 --> 00:00:53.453
is accelerating at the same rate
the speed that it itself moved

00:00:53.453 --> 00:00:58.558
at and generated and bio is one
of those areas. 	It's

00:00:58.558 --> 00:01:03.463
accelerated, by bio I mean
broadly speaking, all aspects of

00:01:03.463 --> 00:01:08.835
biology and neuroscience that
will impact us more and more,

00:01:08.835 --> 00:01:13.040
they are genuinely creating a
new kind of humanity. 	And

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:19.913
framing who we're going to be
and design ourselves to be. 	It

00:01:19.913 --> 00:01:23.884
sounds like science fiction but
it isn't, some is on the level

00:01:23.884 --> 00:01:31.458
of smaller animals than us but
it will migrate and the proof of

00:01:31.458 --> 00:01:34.928
concept is established by doing
the work on those animals, some

00:01:34.928 --> 00:01:39.633
of those in the same form, some
not. 	But it's worth taking a

00:01:39.633 --> 00:01:43.537
look at. 	I want to start with
quote from Edgar Mitchell,

00:01:43.537 --> 00:01:49.543
Apollo 14 astronaut. 	From a
conversation we had. 	In space I

00:01:53.013 --> 00:01:57.551
had epiphany, experience of
connectedness of everything. 	I

00:01:57.551 --> 00:02:01.922
came to understand it, where you
experience, see separateness of

00:02:01.922 --> 00:02:06.793
things with physical eye and see
connectedness in altered state.

00:02:10.364 --> 00:02:14.868
	I had to find deep issues,
recognizing scientific cosmology

00:02:14.868 --> 00:02:20.307
was incomplete and religious
cosmology chaotic. 	Looking for

00:02:20.307 --> 00:02:25.178
new myth about ourselves by but
by myth I mean truth. 	Amazing

00:02:25.178 --> 00:02:30.917
thing is not he experiences
unity of all things, we

00:02:30.917 --> 00:02:35.255
experience as anything as
separate at all. 	Our condition

00:02:35.255 --> 00:02:41.061
ever being is
interconnecttiveness not only

00:02:41.061 --> 00:02:46.033
with each other but with
everything. 	So this talk is

00:02:46.033 --> 00:02:49.403
trying to face down the fact
that humans are opened systems

00:02:49.403 --> 00:02:53.173
of information and energy. 	And
the current work in bio tech,

00:02:53.173 --> 00:03:00.213
nano tech, artificial organisms,
so surveillance, intrusion,

00:03:00.213 --> 00:03:04.785
health and healing and weapons
to disarm, debilitate and kill,

00:03:04.785 --> 00:03:08.689
intersects with tradition, all
information security model, but

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:14.528
becoming a tail that wags the
dog, the hacker dog. 	IT causes

00:03:14.528 --> 00:03:19.199
identity shift. 	By turning
command and control, individuals

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:23.003
who exercise authority in
hierarchal ways to nodes and

00:03:23.003 --> 00:03:28.442
network who learn they can
exercise power by participating

00:03:28.442 --> 00:03:31.778
in network and attempt to
control and dominate, do not

00:03:31.778 --> 00:03:36.283
work in the same way. 	Now what
we called individual selves are

00:03:36.283 --> 00:03:39.619
dissolving into realtime,
physical modular network

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:45.625
systems, transforming identity
and, future. 	We're physical,

00:03:48.895 --> 00:03:53.667
we're not computer. 	And
research turns into prototypes

00:03:53.667 --> 00:03:57.404
and prototypes into the
indications what it means to be

00:03:57.404 --> 00:04:02.142
human is generally being
transformed. 	Symbiotic side

00:04:02.142 --> 00:04:07.814
board system [static-inaudible]
splicing organic humans and

00:04:07.814 --> 00:04:11.718
intelligent machinery is the
platform but goes beyond

00:04:11.718 --> 00:04:15.522
computing in the Internet and
information systems by which we

00:04:15.522 --> 00:04:19.993
mean communication information
systems we had made. This is

00:04:19.993 --> 00:04:24.131
about the we who made and our
making a system of energy and

00:04:24.131 --> 00:04:28.802
information flows in which we're
increasingly embedded. 	That may

00:04:28.802 --> 00:04:31.872
sound obvious, but requires
unusual mind to undertake the

00:04:31.872 --> 00:04:37.744
analysis of the obvious, he also
said major advances in

00:04:37.744 --> 00:04:42.215
civilization are processes that
wreck the society in which they

00:04:42.215 --> 00:04:47.120
occur and that is what is
happening to us today. 	It's the

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.858
business of the future he went
on to be dangerous, among the

00:04:51.858 --> 00:04:57.397
merits science to equip the
future for duties. 	Scientists

00:04:57.397 --> 00:05:02.602
and technologists are doing, by
altering identity of humanity,

00:05:02.602 --> 00:05:08.608
to new species we don't know yet
and find those we did in the

00:05:12.179 --> 00:05:17.884
past. 	The future is here but
unevenly distributed. 	The

00:05:17.884 --> 00:05:21.188
latest development read like
sci-fi for a good reason, how

00:05:21.188 --> 00:05:27.194
left brain dreams of own future.
	In the book Earth To Moon, took

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:37.170
one hundred years before what he
predicted became reality. 	Brave

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:42.475
New World in the 30's, and 60
years later we were ingesting

00:05:42.475 --> 00:05:49.115
SOMA and conditioning society.
	Create notion of cyberspace in

00:05:49.115 --> 00:05:54.020
the word and 10 years later
everybody was living in it. 	10

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:58.525
years ago, Bruce Sterling, said
to me, there's no way to predict

00:05:58.525 --> 00:06:02.429
the future any more, in science
fiction because future has

00:06:02.429 --> 00:06:05.865
already happened and most you
can do is 4 or 5 years, and most

00:06:05.865 --> 00:06:11.871
of that is obsolete, most people
still live out there, not this

00:06:15.375 --> 00:06:18.979
room of elite but normals we
call it. 	Those who live in the

00:06:18.979 --> 00:06:24.985
hump of the bell curve and hump
along. 	I created that word and

00:06:28.688 --> 00:06:32.525
happiest tweets, humpling, in
this book Mind Games, in break

00:06:32.525 --> 00:06:38.531
memory I formulate that concept,
hump is 100%, dominant and

00:06:44.437 --> 00:06:47.741
manage and manipulate society.
	Master is first, designing and

00:06:47.741 --> 00:06:50.944
substantiating and humplings
humping along, and those that

00:06:50.944 --> 00:06:56.950
have Fox News channel.
	(Applause) So, the future is

00:07:10.497 --> 00:07:16.503
here. 	(Laughter) Living tissue
is being made artificially, you

00:07:22.375 --> 00:07:25.111
know that. 	Memories made of
this is an old song, but coming

00:07:25.111 --> 00:07:28.148
to mean something different.
	Memories are made of proteins

00:07:28.148 --> 00:07:34.154
and proteins can be altered and
transfers. 	One of modules of

00:07:37.324 --> 00:07:44.431
this talk will be about memory.
	Talking about memories, the

00:07:44.431 --> 00:07:49.202
ground of matrix for identity
and now it can be impaired,

00:07:49.202 --> 00:07:53.740
eliminated, taken emotional
charge off, altered or moved,

00:07:53.740 --> 00:08:01.081
created falsely. 	So who are we
then? It was said in

00:08:01.081 --> 00:08:03.817
[static-inaudible] about 3 D
printing a couple years ago,

00:08:03.817 --> 00:08:07.587
it's in the early stages, but
transplantable organs are years

00:08:07.587 --> 00:08:13.593
away, bladders, lungs and livers
tomorrow, so far we have heart

00:08:15.595 --> 00:08:20.533
values, small 3 D clusters of
tissue to experiment on,

00:08:20.533 --> 00:08:25.205
cartilage for knees, nose and
joints. 	I'll say more about

00:08:25.205 --> 00:08:29.809
that. 	3 D printing you can do,
experiment with creating own

00:08:29.809 --> 00:08:35.181
living tissue, close the door
when you get done, so can't come

00:08:35.181 --> 00:08:40.620
under the door out of the room
after you. 	You can't appreciate

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:44.057
what is happening with biotech
without grasping that you can't

00:08:44.057 --> 00:08:48.194
grasp the totality of what's
happening. 	Advancing faster

00:08:48.194 --> 00:08:53.633
than anyone can know. 	So, this
is a [static-inaudible] trip.

00:08:53.633 --> 00:08:57.504
	We think we're walking into a
different kind of future and

00:08:57.504 --> 00:09:00.573
find ourselves coming back to
who we are, published papers are

00:09:00.573 --> 00:09:02.575
out of date by the time they're
published. 	And much of the work

00:09:02.575 --> 00:09:04.644
is done in the dark, in research
facilities in military and

00:09:04.644 --> 00:09:10.650
communities. 	They're often off
the grid. 	Making place all over

00:09:19.058 --> 00:09:23.129
the world and being done by
network amateurs supported by

00:09:23.129 --> 00:09:29.035
nation states -- in other words
biohacking is hacking now,

00:09:29.035 --> 00:09:34.340
period. 	Information system is
merely the machinery which

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:37.610
connects the humanity that is
[static-inaudible] from itself.

00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:43.183
	Let me turn to somebody who
says better than I can.

00:09:43.183 --> 00:09:48.822
	Christopher Green. 	Has worn
many hats. 	Resume' 17 pages

00:09:48.822 --> 00:09:54.394
long and all solid. 	16 years
reporting only the director of

00:09:54.394 --> 00:10:00.200
CIA, senior division analyst for
weapons and intelligence,

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:06.206
bimedical branch of CIA, worked
for GM, done global work. 	To

00:10:09.742 --> 00:10:14.013
talk about who he is, took into
studies, we conversed a few

00:10:14.013 --> 00:10:20.453
hours in Detroit. 	With the
explosion of discoveries in area

00:10:20.453 --> 00:10:25.124
of neuroscience will come
individuals, countries that

00:10:25.124 --> 00:10:30.964
exploit findings for nefarious
purposes. 	It's growing offshore

00:10:30.964 --> 00:10:35.869
and hidden. 	Customers do not
possess diagnosable neurological

00:10:35.869 --> 00:10:43.710
disorder but, want to prevent a
probable decline and in the

00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:50.250
performance degradation arena,
scientists and physicians are

00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:54.854
joined and challenged in new
ways. 	Translate that -- they

00:10:54.854 --> 00:10:59.592
want to give advantage to
themselves. 	Want to prevent

00:10:59.592 --> 00:11:03.696
themselves from declining or
being impaired and the

00:11:03.696 --> 00:11:07.800
advantages they seek will
challenge our core values

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:12.539
because they will challenge our
ethics and our fundamental way

00:11:12.539 --> 00:11:17.877
of doing things. 	Implications
for military, law enforcement,

00:11:17.877 --> 00:11:22.815
intelligence communities he went
on to those we experienced in

00:11:22.815 --> 00:11:26.319
the past. 	Material science and
biochemistry, threats in nuclear

00:11:26.319 --> 00:11:32.325
weapons, cyber warfare and
chemical and biological

00:11:34.794 --> 00:11:40.733
Weaponry, peer related scholarly
study, neurocognitive future are

00:11:40.733 --> 00:11:46.839
outdated by the time of
publication. 	Until recently, it

00:11:46.839 --> 00:11:52.645
is not known how to control
action potentials. 	Using

00:11:52.645 --> 00:11:58.117
manipulative energies to make
muscle and the organisms that

00:11:58.117 --> 00:12:03.189
had the muscle do things. 	Now
we know it's 5 years old.

00:12:03.189 --> 00:12:07.594
	Transcranial pulse to
ultrasound, in other words not

00:12:07.594 --> 00:12:13.600
invasive. 	Non plants, uses
pulsed ultrasound. 	Generated

00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:20.907
motor responses in mice.
	Getting through layers of skin

00:12:20.907 --> 00:12:24.811
and skull to, [static-inaudible]
hard reconfiguring waiver

00:12:24.811 --> 00:12:26.813
[static-inaudible] generates
comparable motor responses to

00:12:26.813 --> 00:12:28.815
those using implanted
electrodes. 	Already we're

00:12:28.815 --> 00:12:30.817
growing out of implants in the
brain which have been used to

00:12:30.817 --> 00:12:32.819
work on certain diseases. 	What
can ultrasound do, modify

00:12:32.819 --> 00:12:34.821
behavioral states and memory
formation. 	Manipulate brain

00:12:34.821 --> 00:12:36.823
function and stimulate the
production of brain drive, in

00:12:36.823 --> 00:12:39.325
the -- to increase brain
plasticity. 	Means we can use

00:12:39.325 --> 00:12:45.965
pulse to ultrasound to enhance
ability of brain to respond to

00:12:45.965 --> 00:12:49.202
plasticity to inputs fed into it
and sensory input and cognitive

00:12:49.202 --> 00:12:51.471
input to challenge it to make
sense to the world around it.

00:12:51.471 --> 00:12:53.473
	And it could eliminate
memories. 	First probably in

00:12:53.473 --> 00:12:55.475
gaming show up in hackers, they
will be able to download

00:12:55.475 --> 00:12:57.477
information and experiences.
	While encoding them into the

00:12:57.477 --> 00:12:59.479
brain, using ultrasound. 	That
could lead to creativity hats.

00:12:59.479 --> 00:13:01.414
	They already exist, making the
pulse all that sound -- putting

00:13:01.414 --> 00:13:03.416
them in hat and enhancing
ability to have brain to respond

00:13:03.416 --> 00:13:05.418
to life and to focus. 	To be
highly focused. 	Why is it

00:13:05.418 --> 00:13:07.420
important for military, the
focused soldier, the post

00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:09.422
important soldier. 	Attentive to
the task at hand. 	The means to

00:13:09.422 --> 00:13:11.424
detect, record, modulate brain
signals is moving faster than we

00:13:11.424 --> 00:13:14.160
can grasp. How can we guess
which applications can be

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:20.967
pursued by organizations in this
country and others

00:13:20.967 --> 00:13:23.436
[static-inaudible] and interest,
which may be for good, maybe for

00:13:23.436 --> 00:13:29.442
evil. 	Okay. 	Another quote --
he wrote, long time ago, 1998,

00:14:44.951 --> 00:14:50.823
last century, bottom line --
human body much like a computer

00:14:50.823 --> 00:14:54.427
contains myriad data processors,
include but not limited to

00:14:54.427 --> 00:14:58.564
chemical electrical activity of
the brain, the heart and

00:14:58.564 --> 00:15:02.068
peripheral nervous system.
	Signal sent from cortex from

00:15:02.068 --> 00:15:09.942
brain to body, signals and light
sensitive retina, cornea of eye,

00:15:09.942 --> 00:15:11.944
in the threshold of era in which
these data processors in human

00:15:11.944 --> 00:15:14.313
body will be manipulated,
debilitated. 	This is serious

00:15:14.313 --> 00:15:20.319
stuff and serious threat
potential exists. 	This is where

00:15:26.726 --> 00:15:30.763
it comes in the realm of hacker
DOM. White hat, black hat,

00:15:30.763 --> 00:15:36.769
whatever that may mean, he wrote
that in 1998. 	Work done inside,

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:44.777
in the dark generally is not out
here or noticed out here for

00:15:44.777 --> 00:15:48.481
20-30 years, like stealth
technology, or drones.

00:15:48.481 --> 00:15:54.487
	Developed in the 1970's are
just now becoming known. 	One

00:15:58.391 --> 00:16:03.462
way to determine the future
we're talking is look inside the

00:16:03.462 --> 00:16:06.132
research and development, how
you do that creative work and

00:16:06.132 --> 00:16:11.838
connect dots best over time
lines using tools

00:16:11.838 --> 00:16:16.175
[static-inaudible] online to see
where we have already been. 	And

00:16:16.175 --> 00:16:22.248
how, it is often used for
covering deception to protect

00:16:22.248 --> 00:16:27.787
secrets that it represents. 	So
we're saying companion

00:16:27.787 --> 00:16:32.258
[static-inaudible] in the Navy
indicates magnetic fields of low

00:16:32.258 --> 00:16:36.696
levels can influence animal
behavior, creating seizures and

00:16:36.696 --> 00:16:42.435
blocking short-term memories.
	We can erase memories. 	Most of

00:16:42.435 --> 00:16:47.039
you are young, who is 60 or
over, raise your hand, you had

00:16:47.039 --> 00:16:53.045
colonoscopy, I know surgeon,
people work in surgical center,

00:17:05.858 --> 00:17:11.330
crying out now you need this,
and come out hour later and say

00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:14.934
how was your procedure, it was
great. 	I didn't feel a thing.

00:17:14.934 --> 00:17:18.271
	What they didn't have were the
memories of what they did feel.

00:17:18.271 --> 00:17:23.543
	The drug they gave him made
sure those memories were wiped

00:17:23.543 --> 00:17:27.246
out. 	We can do it that way,
people willingly consent -- and,

00:17:33.686 --> 00:17:39.058
and through magnetic fields of
low levels that can block short

00:17:39.058 --> 00:17:43.663
memory formation. 	We know on
societal level that's what media

00:17:43.663 --> 00:17:50.136
has done, that's what memory
hole is for, distract people

00:17:50.136 --> 00:17:54.040
from what's real and happening
by giving them nonsense. 	My

00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:56.042
wife and I watch watched
[static-inaudible] it was

00:17:56.042 --> 00:18:01.981
seamless transition. Because we
were watching that nonsense both

00:18:09.655 --> 00:18:15.661
movie and real life basis --
horrible things, I go to

00:18:18.931 --> 00:18:24.804
intelligence briefings and all
the people are being blown up,

00:18:24.804 --> 00:18:30.109
kidding, bombs exploding and
great way to start the day. 	But

00:18:30.109 --> 00:18:35.548
it's real. 	And reality is, will
not go away because you refuse

00:18:35.548 --> 00:18:41.787
to believe in it. 	All emerging
technology, hazards 2 ways. 	Go

00:18:41.787 --> 00:18:48.561
horribly wrong or unforeseen
consequences when they go right.

00:18:48.561 --> 00:18:51.697
	Bad intentions drive -- we
developed atom bomb to stop

00:18:51.697 --> 00:18:58.537
Hitler, when Germany went down,
we had to use it and used on

00:18:58.537 --> 00:19:06.112
Japan. 	In part warning to
Soviets, what we could do in the

00:19:06.112 --> 00:19:12.118
postwar world. 	Neurotechnology
products will all be dual use,

00:19:18.924 --> 00:19:21.894
products intended for health
will be sold for enhancement and

00:19:21.894 --> 00:19:28.367
degradation, safety, social,
legal constraints we think about

00:19:28.367 --> 00:19:32.104
here may not apply in other
countries. 	Other wants

00:19:32.104 --> 00:19:34.106
applications --
[static-inaudible] is to

00:19:34.106 --> 00:19:36.308
discover them and warn and
prepare counter measures. 	But

00:19:36.308 --> 00:19:42.314
so far, our governments do not
have internal capacity to warn

00:19:47.186 --> 00:19:50.189
against neuroscientific
developments that could lead,

00:19:50.189 --> 00:19:52.425
what we anticipate will happen,
will happen [static-inaudible]

00:19:52.425 --> 00:19:58.431
coming. 	That's why science and
technology is priority for

00:20:02.768 --> 00:20:09.341
intelligence collection and
analysis. 	We are no longer the

00:20:09.341 --> 00:20:12.778
best and brightest at this, it's
all over the world and we're

00:20:12.778 --> 00:20:19.051
alone in this any longer. 	So,
how do you live in a world

00:20:19.051 --> 00:20:22.955
without walls. 	I used to say
that about IT, bringing down,

00:20:22.955 --> 00:20:25.357
now it's around identities
themselves. 	Identities are

00:20:25.357 --> 00:20:33.032
functional boundaries and brown
drinks around organisms,

00:20:33.032 --> 00:20:37.369
species, internal systems of
organs, that's what's going with

00:20:37.369 --> 00:20:43.375
the way of geopolitical borders.
	Weakest link in security chain

00:20:51.817 --> 00:20:56.555
is definition of problem, often
not what people think it is, the

00:20:56.555 --> 00:20:59.391
weakest link in identity chain
is also the definition of

00:20:59.391 --> 00:21:02.895
problem and real definition of
identity is not what people are

00:21:02.895 --> 00:21:05.831
using and working with, you are
who you are becoming, who we're

00:21:05.831 --> 00:21:12.938
making ourselves become and
think in 20th Century, old think

00:21:12.938 --> 00:21:17.109
is adequate to intelligent
organism developing on the

00:21:17.109 --> 00:21:22.648
planet, in the 21st Century and
hacking is about to enter that

00:21:22.648 --> 00:21:25.384
space with passion. 	The
Microsoft(r) slogan, should be

00:21:25.384 --> 00:21:29.288
who do you want to be today and
what do you want to be today.

00:21:29.288 --> 00:21:35.294
	So talking about identity, what
is identity? Many years ago we

00:21:37.696 --> 00:21:45.671
had this book, Society Of Mind.
	He said -- [static-inaudible]

00:21:45.671 --> 00:21:51.677
mind is modular and looks like
this. 	You think a different

00:21:57.116 --> 00:22:03.923
image, as a metaphor it looks
like that. 	It's modular units,

00:22:03.923 --> 00:22:11.197
integrated and referred to an
illusionary self. 	Each mind is

00:22:11.197 --> 00:22:16.569
made of smaller processes. We
join them in societies or

00:22:16.569 --> 00:22:21.974
networks. 	It also leads to
sense of self and illusionary

00:22:21.974 --> 00:22:26.045
sense of self Einstein called,
open it will illusion of

00:22:26.045 --> 00:22:34.053
consciousness. 	It is nothing
more than elaborate illusion.

00:22:34.053 --> 00:22:41.727
	Many believe about selfhood
unravel. 	This is relevant.

00:22:41.727 --> 00:22:44.230
	Because whatever is plugged
into existing neuron the

00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:48.234
channels that exist into the
brain, the body brain which is

00:22:48.234 --> 00:22:53.472
one system, will parse that and
neo plastic brain can be used as

00:22:53.472 --> 00:22:56.809
inputs an in grated to
self-awareness and self will

00:22:56.809 --> 00:23:00.279
think that is who it is, the way
you think you are not. 	You will

00:23:00.279 --> 00:23:07.486
be that which is created into
the, assimilated into and

00:23:07.486 --> 00:23:13.492
unified with that illusionary
sense of self just defined. 	So

00:23:13.492 --> 00:23:15.995
like the Internet disappeared.
	How many said I'm going on the

00:23:15.995 --> 00:23:20.766
Internet today. 	Young people,
older people, say I'm going to

00:23:20.766 --> 00:23:27.273
text, tweet, make a call. 	You
refer to event of going on the

00:23:27.273 --> 00:23:31.310
Internet by appliance replace
invisible Internet going into

00:23:31.310 --> 00:23:36.115
the background. 	We don't say
turn on power grid, we say turn

00:23:36.115 --> 00:23:41.453
on lights or projector. 	If
somebody from 17th century come

00:23:41.453 --> 00:23:46.125
into our society. 	All they see
is power lines, you filter them

00:23:46.125 --> 00:23:49.928
out so you don't see them. We
make things invisible out of new

00:23:49.928 --> 00:23:56.101
context of our lives and full
with new content that can then

00:23:56.101 --> 00:23:58.537
be created. 	Sensory extensions
can be plugged into us in a way

00:23:58.537 --> 00:24:04.476
that plasticity of the brain can
take advantage of and integrate.

00:24:11.250 --> 00:24:17.022
	People that learn Braille, it's
done with fingertips, raised

00:24:17.022 --> 00:24:20.793
dots and people who are blind,
at first can't feel anything, I

00:24:20.793 --> 00:24:23.629
-- way to hear. 	First put it
on, you felt vibrations but

00:24:23.629 --> 00:24:29.635
after months, you formulate
words that activate different

00:24:36.141 --> 00:24:42.147
sensors. 	When you learn the
Braille, the part of brain that

00:24:44.183 --> 00:24:46.719
links to sensitivity of
fingertips increases it's

00:24:46.719 --> 00:24:52.725
connectivity. 	Grows more and
more neurons. 	What you intend,

00:24:58.397 --> 00:25:04.036
what attend to, often engages
the brain in a kind of secondary

00:25:04.036 --> 00:25:08.474
effort to make sure you get what
you want. 	I knew a guy blind,

00:25:08.474 --> 00:25:15.647
could speed up cassette tapes,
nobody has them -- you know what

00:25:15.647 --> 00:25:20.018
I mean? And you put in machine
and it gets caught up, and

00:25:20.018 --> 00:25:26.392
unwind tape and curse. 	He sped
those up 6 times because he

00:25:26.392 --> 00:25:30.896
trained his brain to hear speech
at 6 times normal speed. 	The

00:25:30.896 --> 00:25:36.635
brain can do astonishing things
in response to what we ask them

00:25:36.635 --> 00:25:39.905
to do. 	We add artificial
retinas, Cochlear Implant,

00:25:39.905 --> 00:25:46.512
infrared night vision glasses,
the guy that built the field

00:25:46.512 --> 00:25:52.151
safe belt. 6 weeks,
[static-inaudible] he had built

00:25:52.151 --> 00:25:58.157
line with 13 vibrating pads,
outside was power line, connect

00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:09.134
to magnetic field. 	At first it
was strange, but whole

00:26:09.134 --> 00:26:13.906
perception of who he was and
where he was shifted. 	Developed

00:26:13.906 --> 00:26:18.077
internal map of city in head.
	Always knew his way home.

00:26:18.077 --> 00:26:22.581
	Always new were north was,
tricky bit not creating sensors

00:26:22.581 --> 00:26:28.587
[static-inaudible] start to work
with them, the tricky part is

00:26:30.656 --> 00:26:34.359
processing the input. 	So you
had to change sensory data.

00:26:34.359 --> 00:26:40.666
	Ultrasound, infrared, something
human brain is trained to

00:26:40.666 --> 00:26:46.672
accept. 	Brain is more flexible
than we thought. 	Now, we can

00:26:50.008 --> 00:26:53.712
build them. 	It's limited only
by your imagination. 	In terms

00:26:53.712 --> 00:26:58.383
of what shall I explore, from
the environment that my brain

00:26:58.383 --> 00:27:04.323
did not detect. 	1996 they
wanted to work in retinal

00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:11.730
display from outside source
directly on the retina of

00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:18.270
viewer's eye. 	A program
manager, announced project.

00:27:18.270 --> 00:27:22.007
	Direct interface to enable
visual display of information

00:27:22.007 --> 00:27:28.013
without glasses or goggles.
	[Static-inaudible] base display

00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:40.025
device, short-term goal was this
big, couple inches high, even

00:27:40.025 --> 00:27:47.499
table simple visual display.
	The visual fidelity, this is

00:27:47.499 --> 00:27:53.305
not ready for prime time but
eventually as enhanced you'll

00:27:53.305 --> 00:27:56.608
find the device could replace
all virtual reality and

00:27:56.608 --> 00:28:04.116
augmented reality displays. 	So
what you're seeing there, is guy

00:28:04.116 --> 00:28:10.122
wearing second SIGHT, retinal
prosthesis, reroutes visual data

00:28:13.825 --> 00:28:17.462
to eye parts that still work.
	It's like a video camera

00:28:17.462 --> 00:28:22.134
gathers light, transmits to
brain by implant as electrical

00:28:22.134 --> 00:28:29.575
signal. 	You can also see with
tongue. 	Guy did this, put

00:28:29.575 --> 00:28:34.479
sensors on the tongue enabled
someone to see in the same way

00:28:34.479 --> 00:28:39.451
that magnetic field could be
detects. 	Another example, color

00:28:39.451 --> 00:28:46.258
blind monkeys, using gene
therapy, were able to see red or

00:28:46.258 --> 00:28:53.365
green. 	The surprise we can do
with adult animals, evidence of

00:28:53.365 --> 00:28:59.371
visual system is incredibly
plastic, -- [static-inaudible]

00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:09.748
take up a notch. 	Some women see
more colors than all men. 	I

00:29:09.748 --> 00:29:15.754
think on X chromosome -- it's
genetic mutation and enables

00:29:20.959 --> 00:29:27.165
brain to process thousands of
shades, lights, colors that

00:29:27.165 --> 00:29:29.701
other people cannot see. 	To a
color blind person to see not

00:29:29.701 --> 00:29:35.707
color blind is extraordinary and
see enhanced way that 20% of

00:29:38.410 --> 00:29:45.117
women can see [static-inaudible]
how little norms see. 	That's

00:29:45.117 --> 00:29:47.919
great metaphor for what hackers
can [static-inaudible] -- this

00:29:47.919 --> 00:29:53.925
is important part. 	Brains are
wired the same way as person

00:29:59.498 --> 00:30:05.504
with normal vision. 	Can they
see more, by practicing,

00:30:09.174 --> 00:30:12.844
practicing makes perfect even
when it comes to neuropathways.

00:30:12.844 --> 00:30:18.850
	Even many more
[static-inaudible] may exist,

00:30:21.753 --> 00:30:26.224
know it or have exceptional
color perception because they

00:30:26.224 --> 00:30:31.263
haven't first noticed that they
did, second allowed themselves

00:30:31.263 --> 00:30:34.733
to do special exceptional and
different, and willing to

00:30:34.733 --> 00:30:40.739
practice to train brains to pay
attention to sensory inputs.

00:30:44.443 --> 00:30:46.945
	That's really important.
	Because it says even if you're

00:30:46.945 --> 00:30:51.717
wired for it, in your
chromosomes, you have to allow

00:30:51.717 --> 00:30:56.121
yourself to know who you are,
not listen to the voices that

00:30:56.121 --> 00:31:00.358
disparage who you are, allow
yourself to receive sensory

00:31:00.358 --> 00:31:04.963
input and have the guts to train
your brain to become exceptional

00:31:04.963 --> 00:31:09.901
and special. 	It is no accident
that moves about the X men are

00:31:09.901 --> 00:31:13.739
so popular. 	It's what we're
talking about. 	Talking about

00:31:13.739 --> 00:31:17.209
mutants with some superpowers,
which some people, some of them

00:31:17.209 --> 00:31:21.213
say they want. 	Okay. 	What time
is in. 	Is it really, where is

00:31:21.213 --> 00:31:27.219
my guy? Somebody is suppose to
tell me it's 2 minutes past, oh,

00:31:30.756 --> 00:31:36.762
there you are, thank you. Thank
you (Laughter) well, I'm back,

00:31:41.099 --> 00:31:45.137
let me try to hop through the
important points. 	You can't go

00:31:45.137 --> 00:31:48.039
overtime. 	People never remember
what you say, but if you go 10

00:31:48.039 --> 00:31:52.544
minutes over, they remember.
	Remember that guy, he went on

00:31:52.544 --> 00:31:59.084
and own. What was he talking
about? I don't know. 	All right.

00:31:59.084 --> 00:32:04.589
	So, a lot of work we do is with
animals. 	We don't know yet how

00:32:04.589 --> 00:32:10.695
much will import to humans, how
we use animals is prototypical.

00:32:10.695 --> 00:32:16.701
	Some of it extreme. 	What you
have here a genuine diagram of

00:32:23.442 --> 00:32:27.212
procedure that's carried out,
where the head of monkey A was

00:32:27.212 --> 00:32:32.350
transplanted onto the head of
monkey B. 	It was the first

00:32:32.350 --> 00:32:38.423
successful head transplant and
almost 50 years ago. 	Now,

00:32:38.423 --> 00:32:41.993
doctor in Italy says he'll do
this with humans in two years.

00:32:41.993 --> 00:32:47.032
	There might be a problem
dealing with humans. 	For one,

00:32:47.032 --> 00:32:50.569
here is a mouse we did it with,
see how happy the mouse is.

00:32:55.373 --> 00:33:01.313
	Happily. 	Here is another one
giving away what happened to it,

00:33:04.249 --> 00:33:09.087
white body, black head. 	In this
case we used electromagnetic

00:33:09.087 --> 00:33:13.158
pulses to detect what the mouse
was thinking after the

00:33:13.158 --> 00:33:16.595
procedure. 	And that's what the
mouse was thinking (Laughter).

00:33:16.595 --> 00:33:22.601
	(Applause). 	Well, if I line up
to do these things, one thing to

00:33:29.674 --> 00:33:33.245
put a chip in your arm, before
you do head transplant,

00:33:33.245 --> 00:33:35.247
remember, unintended
consequences, this is a movie,

00:33:35.247 --> 00:33:39.618
not real life. 	Her head about
to be removed and put on another

00:33:39.618 --> 00:33:45.624
body. 	So, they're using
animals. 	They have hybrid

00:33:50.795 --> 00:33:56.401
insect. 	Wanted to create bug
army out The Beatles an bees.

00:33:56.401 --> 00:34:00.505
	They're using shark
[static-inaudible] they have

00:34:00.505 --> 00:34:05.543
better ability to detect
electromagnetic field around us.

00:34:05.543 --> 00:34:11.549
	The program, controlled arrive
of insect of 5 meters of target

00:34:15.787 --> 00:34:18.690
-- where it must remain
stationary indefinitely

00:34:18.690 --> 00:34:26.197
[static-inaudible] -- transmit
data from [static-inaudible],

00:34:26.197 --> 00:34:28.967
one thing to send a spy into
harms way, another thing to send

00:34:28.967 --> 00:34:34.773
a beetle. 	The way we think.
	They tried to do detection of

00:34:34.773 --> 00:34:40.779
biological warfare, by using
honey bees, it found that after

00:34:44.149 --> 00:34:47.385
initial success, nevertheless
they're instinctive behavior

00:34:47.385 --> 00:34:52.023
were feeding and mating and
prevented them from -- reliably,

00:34:52.023 --> 00:34:56.594
in other words, they opted for
sex and food. 	That discovery is

00:34:56.594 --> 00:35:02.534
probably what led to this, sex
gay bomb. 	Laboratory, Air Force

00:35:07.806 --> 00:35:14.980
laboratory in Ohio, because,
then, by spreading pheromones,

00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:20.986
among soldiers, the goal of this
program was to turn them into

00:35:24.723 --> 00:35:30.729
that. 	See? That's an actual
photo. 	It's true, sexual

00:35:33.565 --> 00:35:36.668
orientation could not be changed
so this didn't work. 	But they

00:35:36.668 --> 00:35:42.140
tried and wanted to build a gay
bomb and hope, soldiers would be

00:35:42.140 --> 00:35:46.911
so enamored with one another,
they with spread their uniforms,

00:35:46.911 --> 00:35:48.913
have sex and forget about
fighting. 	Unfortunately,

00:35:48.913 --> 00:35:54.919
they're basing what
heterosexuals do more often than

00:35:59.624 --> 00:36:05.563
gays. 	So we use animals, here
you have a robot, dog robot,

00:36:09.601 --> 00:36:15.607
cheetah robot, and here, there's
cheetah, there's the dog. 	More

00:36:18.076 --> 00:36:20.979
and more robotics being supplied
with this, using animals,

00:36:20.979 --> 00:36:27.519
prototype of what we want to do
with human beings. 	Want to make

00:36:27.519 --> 00:36:33.625
stronger, faster, great ability.
	This is insect they created,

00:36:33.625 --> 00:36:41.066
CPU on this guy, didn't take
much, turn left, turn right,

00:36:41.066 --> 00:36:46.004
fly, stop, left and right, pay
attention, turn on sensors, turn

00:36:46.004 --> 00:36:51.910
on data, bring it back. 	Sharks
are senses humans don't have so

00:36:51.910 --> 00:36:57.916
they're working with sharks in
the same way, remote control.

00:37:01.252 --> 00:37:07.158
	[Static-inaudible] of course.
	In the bulletin of atomic

00:37:07.158 --> 00:37:14.466
sciences, these are non
classified statements made, --

00:37:14.466 --> 00:37:17.535
not all good research will be
done exclusively in the west,

00:37:17.535 --> 00:37:20.205
results of work will make sick
people well etc... --

00:37:20.205 --> 00:37:27.745
[static-inaudible] 	They'll do
stem cell research in a way we

00:37:27.745 --> 00:37:33.752
will not accept, use unwilling
prisoners as well as willing.

00:37:41.593 --> 00:37:48.566
	-- work on [static-inaudible].
	Some sheep have livers with up

00:37:48.566 --> 00:37:54.372
to 80% human cells. 	Produce
compounds made by human livers.

00:37:54.372 --> 00:37:57.909
	We have pigs with pig blood
cells, human blood cells and

00:37:57.909 --> 00:38:03.848
characteristic of both. 	You can
find that in my family. 	But --

00:38:08.453 --> 00:38:12.690
Stanford -- heading project that
injected human stem cells into

00:38:12.690 --> 00:38:19.497
mouse [static-inaudible] they
want to increase percentage to

00:38:19.497 --> 00:38:23.334
100% human brains in mice bodies
in order to better understand

00:38:23.334 --> 00:38:27.238
diseases. 	Starts with good
intentions, understand diseases,

00:38:27.238 --> 00:38:32.377
but 100% human brain in a mouse,
you can imagine the response.

00:38:32.377 --> 00:38:39.784
	What the, it's only the start
if that mouse learns to speak.

00:38:39.784 --> 00:38:42.854
	Rabbits, human hybrids used for
human research for study of

00:38:42.854 --> 00:38:44.856
Parkinson's disease. 	So you
have [static-inaudible] --

00:38:44.856 --> 00:38:50.862
identity of species up for
grabs, and you have

00:38:54.365 --> 00:39:01.239
[static-inaudible] why are we
doing this. 	Some of you saw

00:39:01.239 --> 00:39:06.911
this earlier, this is, I think
-- one of best places to go to

00:39:06.911 --> 00:39:11.916
find out what has happened and
is happening is historic review

00:39:11.916 --> 00:39:17.088
of proposals and information and
study that's come out of

00:39:17.088 --> 00:39:20.692
[static-inaudible] you can
connect a lot of dots. 	So you

00:39:20.692 --> 00:39:24.028
learn, there's experimental
Pentagon program, develop 2

00:39:24.028 --> 00:39:29.601
types of terminator type
prosthetic arms -- programs

00:39:29.601 --> 00:39:35.607
limbs, flew F 35 fighter
simulator using thoughts. 	It

00:39:39.577 --> 00:39:45.583
wants to build pacemaker device
are hard drive the sorts for the

00:39:49.487 --> 00:39:53.424
brain. 	They want to use memory
chip and alter consciousness of

00:39:53.424 --> 00:39:57.462
soldiers to make them fully
aware. 	It's important to

00:39:57.462 --> 00:40:03.601
remember, 20, 30, 40 years these
things began to be developed.

00:40:03.601 --> 00:40:09.607
	Give you examples. 	1996, Air
Force scientific advisory board

00:40:09.607 --> 00:40:13.244
prevent involuntary muscle
movements, control emotions,

00:40:13.244 --> 00:40:19.250
sleep, interfere with short-term
and long-term memory, produce

00:40:21.686 --> 00:40:25.657
and delete experiment sets.
	Think about that, these are

00:40:25.657 --> 00:40:29.661
high words for something
challenging and daunting --

00:40:29.661 --> 00:40:34.799
1998. 	Paralyzed person move a
cursor by thinking, the person's

00:40:34.799 --> 00:40:38.536
brain is computer mouse. 	2000,
command Robotic thinks

00:40:38.536 --> 00:40:42.573
[static-inaudible] robot X
wherever it is in the world.

00:40:42.573 --> 00:40:45.510
	2002, mind [static-inaudible].
	When you go through timeline

00:40:45.510 --> 00:40:49.614
and connect the dots easy to see
where it trends toward the

00:40:49.614 --> 00:40:55.620
future and what kind of trends
govern it and to human identity.

00:41:23.081 --> 00:41:25.984
	They want to create a real
zombie army, you know what

00:41:25.984 --> 00:41:31.990
computer zombie army looks like,
you know from movies what a real

00:41:34.993 --> 00:41:40.998
zombie army looks like, this is
only half a joke. 	Because, with

00:41:44.702 --> 00:41:48.306
implants and universal
connectivity between the being

00:41:48.306 --> 00:41:51.709
and who the implants are, put
that will develop a

00:41:51.709 --> 00:41:55.880
[static-inaudible] mind and we
already heard how instrumental

00:41:55.880 --> 00:42:00.718
it is to use those implants to
change the action behavior and

00:42:00.718 --> 00:42:05.089
thinking and memory of the
individuals so networked. 	What

00:42:05.089 --> 00:42:09.694
would it really look like to be
so network? It will look like

00:42:09.694 --> 00:42:14.332
this. 	They call them
brainettes, formed by multiple

00:42:14.332 --> 00:42:20.738
animal brains, starting with
rats, exchanging information in

00:42:20.738 --> 00:42:25.743
realtime through direct brain to
brain interfaces, provide core

00:42:25.743 --> 00:42:31.249
of new type of computing device,
organic computer. 	Organic

00:42:31.249 --> 00:42:36.187
computer devices means not only
we can network animals with one

00:42:36.187 --> 00:42:40.258
another to increase processing
power, we can network ourselves

00:42:40.258 --> 00:42:43.928
with other species and supplies
our perceptions back and forth

00:42:43.928 --> 00:42:48.032
from one to another. 	Said of
reporting out we add perceptual

00:42:48.032 --> 00:42:50.034
field [static-inaudible] it is
using the connectivity to

00:42:50.034 --> 00:42:56.040
enhance the ability of all the
members of different species to

00:42:58.843 --> 00:43:06.617
be part of one another. 	Back to
KIF green. 	We need realtime

00:43:06.617 --> 00:43:12.023
cognitive measurements to watch
people think while under stress.

00:43:12.023 --> 00:43:16.427
This is achievable goal
scientifically. 	Now global,

00:43:16.427 --> 00:43:22.533
increasing beyond the control of
governments and public and

00:43:22.533 --> 00:43:25.369
individual scientists in the
areas of anthropology trained

00:43:25.369 --> 00:43:27.371
[static-inaudible]. 	Remember,
concerned with defense and

00:43:27.371 --> 00:43:33.377
offense. 	Someone objected to
treatment of [static-inaudible]

00:43:44.155 --> 00:43:50.161
because special ally friends and
deputy director said we have no

00:43:56.567 --> 00:44:02.507
allies, we have no friends, we
have only targets, read

00:44:05.309 --> 00:44:09.113
wikiautoleaks, Edward Snoden.
	If everybody is possible

00:44:09.113 --> 00:44:16.053
target, outside of sphere of
nation state and inside. You can

00:44:16.053 --> 00:44:20.258
connect the dots. 	What is they
want, they don't want

00:44:20.258 --> 00:44:22.827
incremental change.
	Unconventional approaches

00:44:22.827 --> 00:44:30.768
outside mainstream challenge
assumptions and potential to

00:44:30.768 --> 00:44:38.242
change practices and create
entirely new fields. 	You don't

00:44:38.242 --> 00:44:41.045
want, just incremental change.
	They're not kidding. 	They're

00:44:56.494 --> 00:44:58.930
not kidding. 	Held symposium in
Bay Area, from start up

00:44:58.930 --> 00:45:04.869
companies and academia, to look
at advances in engineering,

00:45:07.371 --> 00:45:14.178
driving biology into new era,
one in which biology is

00:45:14.178 --> 00:45:22.119
technology. 	We've got to come
to, oh, shoot -- come to, close

00:45:22.119 --> 00:45:29.660
to the end. 	So let me just hit
on points rather than discuss in

00:45:29.660 --> 00:45:32.597
any detail. 	Repair genetic
defenses and cause the brain to

00:45:32.597 --> 00:45:38.603
grow tissue where it doesn't
normally. 	Regenerate body

00:45:42.707 --> 00:45:48.746
parts, bladders, new life forms.
	You have capacity to do

00:45:48.746 --> 00:45:54.752
artificial intelligence and
create synthetic organisms. 	One

00:45:57.555 --> 00:46:03.494
thing it wants to do is,
MORPHING, -- I put it up there,

00:46:08.399 --> 00:46:12.737
because image, because what is
happening to human identity as

00:46:12.737 --> 00:46:16.641
we describe it. Starting in one
place, it will go somewhere

00:46:16.641 --> 00:46:23.514
else. 	We can talk about whole
micro biome and fecal

00:46:23.514 --> 00:46:26.250
transplants, when you, look it
up on the web, you want get

00:46:26.250 --> 00:46:32.256
image of fecal transplant.
	You'll get happy patient. 	It's

00:46:55.212 --> 00:46:59.150
new, you can go and do hacking
in the biome, it's successful,

00:46:59.150 --> 00:47:05.089
there's a program called give a
shit campaign and it's true. 	In

00:47:09.627 --> 00:47:13.364
other words, shit not only
happens but it patterns.

00:47:13.364 --> 00:47:18.235
	[Static-inaudible] unique as
fingerprints better than, want

00:47:18.235 --> 00:47:23.708
to hit points of memory. 	What
is being done with memory, we

00:47:23.708 --> 00:47:29.647
can record a memory, play back
into mouse, mouse that does not

00:47:29.647 --> 00:47:34.585
have it. 	Plant real and false
memories, transplant, alter,

00:47:34.585 --> 00:47:40.791
delete, create new false
memories. 	10 years ago rats

00:47:40.791 --> 00:47:43.561
were trained to fear
[static-inaudible] and lost that

00:47:43.561 --> 00:47:49.567
fear when drug injected into
brain. 	We have drugs that ease

00:48:01.412 --> 00:48:07.418
the pain of bad memories
[static-inaudible]. 	Long-term

00:48:12.823 --> 00:48:18.929
memories not really lost and
just access to memories and has

00:48:18.929 --> 00:48:24.935
been restored in laboratory.
	Brain waves can be used to

00:48:27.338 --> 00:48:33.344
guide memory formation. 	Amnesia
can be undone. 	On and on.

00:48:37.948 --> 00:48:42.286
	Memories, be modulated or
erased, enhanced or put into

00:48:42.286 --> 00:48:48.292
long-term core for retrieval.
	Do not underestimate according

00:48:51.095 --> 00:48:54.398
to the people I talked to,
ability to target selective

00:48:54.398 --> 00:48:59.937
memories, not chemotherapy
[static-inaudible] target

00:48:59.937 --> 00:49:05.609
selected memories for deletion
and alteration. 	For the mouse

00:49:05.609 --> 00:49:09.580
we know we implanted false
memory, transplanted no another

00:49:09.580 --> 00:49:16.754
[static-inaudible] it's all
about cybernetics. 	Who is doing

00:49:16.754 --> 00:49:22.760
the control, okay. 	Does that
mean you're excited? No. 	Okay,

00:49:25.329 --> 00:49:31.335
I'm finishing, now. 	(Laughter),
one more picture? I have to have

00:49:43.681 --> 00:49:49.687
permission. 	I don't want to
violate the thing here, example

00:49:57.127 --> 00:50:03.133
where you can go for this,
THYNC, you can zap yourself

00:50:17.748 --> 00:50:20.451
here, it's product available. 	
Move this around, I don't know

00:50:20.451 --> 00:50:26.590
if it works. 	This is what the
company says it looks like, this

00:50:26.590 --> 00:50:32.596
is what some people think it
looks like after the fact.

00:50:35.633 --> 00:50:39.770
	There's a lot of biohacking you
can do. 	I will try to put these

00:50:39.770 --> 00:50:44.475
notes in some order so that they
will be accessible in the whole

00:50:44.475 --> 00:50:49.346
of this presentation which I'm
sorry ran long, when you

00:50:49.346 --> 00:50:56.287
integrate it, look all over the
world what's being assimilated

00:50:56.287 --> 00:50:59.523
and synthesize it and think
about what it means for humanity

00:50:59.523 --> 00:51:05.229
in the next week, month, year,
it's humanity 2.0. 	You have to

00:51:05.229 --> 00:51:10.601
face, I am going to participate
in creating that new humanity or

00:51:10.601 --> 00:51:16.607
a victim of it, thank you very,
very much. 	(Applause).
