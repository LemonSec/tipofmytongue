00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.440
Hi everyone. So I have a lot of
stuff to get through and not a

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:12.913
lot of time. I am Ryan Mitchell
and I know the name is weird for

00:00:12.913 --> 00:00:17.217
me too surprise. This is
separating the box from the

00:00:17.217 --> 00:00:23.257
humans so who I am other than my
name. I am software engineer. I

00:00:23.257 --> 00:00:28.362
work in Boston APA back end Java
stuff and I have author of two

00:00:28.362 --> 00:00:31.932
jobs that have nothing to do
with my day job. I am engineer

00:00:31.932 --> 00:00:39.506
graduate and I take night
classes I have been doing that

00:00:39.506 --> 00:00:47.047
for a few years and graduating
with my masters in engineering.

00:00:47.047 --> 00:00:53.053
So I submitted a brief proposal
to oriel I will for a hacking

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:01.929
book and pythons is a popular
language these days so I called

00:01:04.164 --> 00:01:10.170
it web scraping with python and
I put together a proposal and

00:01:12.339 --> 00:01:18.979
they accepted my hacking back.
Thank you. And I don't have a

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:26.053
lot of time so instead I'm going
to focus on the first step.

00:01:26.053 --> 00:01:31.491
Separating the bots from the
humans. Because if you web

00:01:31.491 --> 00:01:38.565
administrator what do you want
to do you want to feel out who

00:01:38.565 --> 00:01:46.139
is the human and who is the
bots. And if you web scraper you

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:48.842
want to try to avoid the
administrators from stopping you

00:01:48.842 --> 00:01:52.913
so constant back and forth so
this could be called how to look

00:01:52.913 --> 00:01:58.919
like a human when you are bots
and h is very important. So we

00:02:01.455 --> 00:02:04.091
are at Def Con, hopefully you
heard of web scrapers before.

00:02:04.091 --> 00:02:08.261
Lost audio -- they can take
their sweet time and they can be

00:02:08.261 --> 00:02:15.502
smart or dumb. But we're going
tostart off with the defense

00:02:15.502 --> 00:02:21.508
stuff so we're going to go
through the stupid human things

00:02:25.946 --> 00:02:31.952
to stop bots. So completely
legally and unenforceable and

00:02:34.488 --> 00:02:40.494
not one standard of anything it
is called robot inclusion

00:02:43.997 --> 00:02:51.571
standard but IUTF doesn't
recognize and it government

00:02:51.571 --> 00:02:57.577
doesn't recognize. It is like
your and your friends got

00:03:01.014 --> 00:03:07.020
together and one of you friends
happen to be google so nice

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:16.596
forgetting out of indexing but
other than that is use less for

00:03:16.596 --> 00:03:19.499
blocking bots other than the
good ones that want to follow

00:03:19.499 --> 00:03:24.938
it. Term of service this can be
more useful but only in specific

00:03:24.938 --> 00:03:28.842
circumstances and those a
usually when you and the

00:03:28.842 --> 00:03:34.948
American who wrote the bots end
up in court. You have to if you

00:03:34.948 --> 00:03:40.620
have to click a agree you
problem bring -- if you have to

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.826
agree to terms of service that
is contract so you should be

00:03:45.826 --> 00:03:50.597
really careful about scraping
the site but at the bottom of

00:03:50.597 --> 00:03:56.269
the page go for it that is not
enforceable and do other thing

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:00.507
to access the site in order they
can't just enforce the terms of

00:04:00.507 --> 00:04:06.513
service because it happen to be
on the site. So headers, so a --

00:04:10.817 --> 00:04:14.121
you can change the headers in
chrome. So most there are use

00:04:14.121 --> 00:04:19.993
less most websites do check the
heards so if you go the Amazon

00:04:19.993 --> 00:04:25.999
-- they will send you 403
forbidden. Java, I know we have

00:04:33.807 --> 00:04:39.813
other opinions about this. I'm
not going the sway anyone here.

00:04:47.654 --> 00:04:52.292
You are now taking the code
excuse for where you have a

00:04:52.292 --> 00:04:55.562
controlled environment and give
the client -- don't quite know

00:04:55.562 --> 00:04:59.799
what is going on and makes your
site less use able but you are

00:04:59.799 --> 00:05:05.739
protected against bots most can
execute Java script. Embedding

00:05:08.508 --> 00:05:14.581
text and images don't do that.
Your site is not use able by

00:05:14.581 --> 00:05:20.587
anyone anymore like the -- not
resize able so don't try that

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:27.828
and if it is read able if you do
have text that can be read then

00:05:27.828 --> 00:05:32.699
it is very easy to OCR so not
stopping anyone at all. I kind

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:38.705
of catches most catches are
breakable if you use a caption

00:05:41.107 --> 00:05:44.978
make sure sit really good like
old google or make sure that is

00:05:44.978 --> 00:05:51.585
so obscure that no one is going
look at it so behavioral

00:05:51.585 --> 00:05:59.426
patterns is where the future is.
The google recap here is demo

00:05:59.426 --> 00:06:05.365
here and I have been doing it so
often what it will mark me as a

00:06:12.072 --> 00:06:17.811
bots. It did it. But if I
refresh it and click on again

00:06:17.811 --> 00:06:22.315
there see now I have not moved
my mouse around enough for it to

00:06:22.315 --> 00:06:25.385
convince them I am not a robot.
That is kind of thing that is

00:06:25.385 --> 00:06:31.391
robot would do so now it wants
me to select all the images.

00:06:37.998 --> 00:06:43.770
Okay. So behavioral patterns, if
someone is not moving over the

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:46.706
page appropriately or loading
things too fast or typing too

00:06:46.706 --> 00:06:51.344
fast or not scrolling down the
page so that could be a clue

00:06:51.344 --> 00:06:56.650
that is bots. Honey bots -- what
is something that is used often.

00:06:56.650 --> 00:07:01.922
Humans can't see it bots can see
it and bots thinks that humans

00:07:01.922 --> 00:07:08.261
can see it over wise they would
be obvious honey bots. And it is

00:07:08.261 --> 00:07:14.267
important to use the honey bots
to the robot text one you have

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:24.911
the bad robot -- tells me not to
go there I'm going to go there

00:07:24.911 --> 00:07:29.182
honey bots and the google bots
will not go to it and you will

00:07:29.182 --> 00:07:33.753
not block them. Now is the fun
part and we are going to go over

00:07:33.753 --> 00:07:36.856
optical and Java execution. So
optical character recognition.

00:07:36.856 --> 00:07:42.862
There is caption here. That
we're going to go to. All right.

00:07:59.279 --> 00:08:04.217
So you can see a couple things
about this caption there is

00:08:04.217 --> 00:08:10.223
prefix thing here. Notice it has
this gray background and has

00:08:12.759 --> 00:08:18.765
this blue lines going through it
and you can build this image

00:08:22.669 --> 00:08:28.675
getter that uses the library to
go and clean this image you

00:08:32.579 --> 00:08:38.585
functions like it is gray if so
take it out. You have things you

00:08:42.021 --> 00:08:45.825
can go around the perimeter of
the image and see what the first

00:08:45.825 --> 00:08:50.130
non-gray pixels are and these
are the lines here and cleaning

00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:53.500
the image you can get really
nice looking things like this.

00:08:53.500 --> 00:09:00.874
And then you can start to do
things with it. So the first

00:09:00.874 --> 00:09:06.880
step in using this tool that I
made that you can get to I have

00:09:13.253 --> 00:09:19.259
the link here. Here is the test
track trainer so you download

00:09:30.036 --> 00:09:36.042
the folder and label them so
this is 40 AGU labeled -- I

00:09:46.286 --> 00:09:52.358
suppose you can ship it off to
amazon -- but it is not that

00:09:52.358 --> 00:09:57.564
hard. Watch a few movies and
kind of relaxing. The next step

00:09:57.564 --> 00:10:02.735
is to bring it into the
software. This is just being run

00:10:02.735 --> 00:10:08.374
from my documents. It is just
Java and the with be found the

00:10:08.374 --> 00:10:14.414
hub page. So add a collection of
files let's go to ones that are

00:10:14.414 --> 00:10:20.053
labeled but let's do them again.
So open as many files as you

00:10:20.053 --> 00:10:25.258
want you get these boxes and
when you move them around it

00:10:25.258 --> 00:10:29.596
creates bots files. Creates
these bots files and this is

00:10:29.596 --> 00:10:34.167
very necessary stop for training
optical character recognizers

00:10:34.167 --> 00:10:36.736
and I have tried to make it
painless as possible. So

00:10:36.736 --> 00:10:40.974
download -- knew one and this
goes through all the images

00:10:40.974 --> 00:10:46.713
until you run out and you get a
nice folder full of bots file

00:10:46.713 --> 00:10:52.719
that's look like this. So this
is really important you need to

00:10:55.855 --> 00:11:01.794
keep a back up because it will
over write them and destroy

00:11:06.666 --> 00:11:13.806
them. So you have bots PNG and
put it into the images folder

00:11:13.806 --> 00:11:19.812
here. And now we go to fun part.
Training so this is what uses

00:11:22.015 --> 00:11:28.021
tester acts. Run shape
clustering. I don't remember

00:11:31.925 --> 00:11:36.496
what half these things are and I
spent hour was documentation.

00:11:36.496 --> 00:11:43.336
This is library that was built
by academics very difficult to

00:11:43.336 --> 00:11:48.942
use. All you have to do is get
your bots files with the

00:11:48.942 --> 00:11:53.413
appropriate names named with
their solution and you say

00:11:53.413 --> 00:11:58.518
python 3 I have both of them
installed. Trainer . PY. Go and

00:11:58.518 --> 00:12:01.688
just does everything for you
which is really nice because

00:12:01.688 --> 00:12:05.158
back in the days we had to write
commands. Now the next step is

00:12:05.158 --> 00:12:10.029
you get this -- so our language
that we're using for this is

00:12:10.029 --> 00:12:16.035
called CAP. If we wanted to
solve any regular text we use

00:12:31.951 --> 00:12:37.957
ENG training file but we make
our own here and we need to move

00:12:50.336 --> 00:12:54.674
that. I'm just trying to copy
the file. So we created this

00:12:54.674 --> 00:12:57.577
file in the images director with
all the bots files and image

00:12:57.577 --> 00:13:03.683
files then we just move it over
and now test track knows what

00:13:03.683 --> 00:13:07.787
the language CAP is and how the
run it so we can do something

00:13:07.787 --> 00:13:13.793
like this where we want to get
the text from let's just use

00:13:20.199 --> 00:13:26.205
image that images to by the
labeled folder. Let's check that

00:13:34.013 --> 00:13:41.988
one out. It Y4EE. So I did plan
that one ahead of time but does

00:13:41.988 --> 00:13:48.061
work well. But remember our goal
is to go to this and post a

00:13:48.061 --> 00:13:51.264
comment. So let's check out the
code what does now that we have

00:13:51.264 --> 00:13:56.903
everything all built. So this
uses the same code that is in

00:13:56.903 --> 00:14:02.942
the image training file so it is
you colored and we clean our

00:14:02.942 --> 00:14:09.515
images before we trained it so
when we get the image we have to

00:14:09.515 --> 00:14:15.421
clean it again before we can do
that comparison. So the main

00:14:15.421 --> 00:14:18.658
function is post comment and
goes in here and first thing it

00:14:18.658 --> 00:14:24.997
does is get me a caption. So
this is where posting our

00:14:24.997 --> 00:14:28.968
comment and goes and gets this
SI code that is code at the end

00:14:28.968 --> 00:14:34.841
of image that acts as a seed for
the random cap you don't have to

00:14:34.841 --> 00:14:40.847
you work with it in memory but I
prefer to download it and then

00:14:45.485 --> 00:14:51.491
it uses text track and then gets
solution and checks to see if it

00:14:56.162 --> 00:15:02.101
has four characters and then it
puts in the parameters and puts

00:15:05.204 --> 00:15:11.210
in a post request and you might
get a error page in which your

00:15:16.616 --> 00:15:23.990
-- python will explode but
hopefully that will not happen.

00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:29.996
So let's try this out. Python
three comment poster. Let watch

00:15:33.966 --> 00:15:38.771
it. It is going to work. It is
loading the page and -- success.

00:15:38.771 --> 00:15:44.777
(CLAPPING) so I did that in like
10 minutes you can too. But for

00:16:05.164 --> 00:16:11.170
the bots file creation but you
can too. So I mentioned a jacks

00:16:18.477 --> 00:16:24.483
that is important part of
internet today so I have a bots

00:16:30.723 --> 00:16:38.598
that can handle this. So there
is this page. H is contend that

00:16:38.598 --> 00:16:42.235
will appear while the page is
loading now the important text

00:16:42.235 --> 00:16:48.241
pops up. This is the contend
that we would scrape so what we

00:16:50.509 --> 00:16:56.515
need the -- in my slides I have
the download link. So download

00:16:59.652 --> 00:17:05.591
phantom JS browser that runs in
the background you can run from

00:17:08.027 --> 00:17:14.033
the channel line and let it do
its thing. You can execute Java

00:17:16.102 --> 00:17:22.108
script from the command line. So
remember I have that website. So

00:17:25.478 --> 00:17:29.315
this is text that it displayed
first. So this script is doing

00:17:29.315 --> 00:17:35.321
its job. It should wait for a
little bit while the page is

00:17:37.523 --> 00:17:44.497
loading and the text you want to
retrieve should pop up. So it is

00:17:44.497 --> 00:17:52.271
going on. I have given you web
driver, the driver gets that

00:17:52.271 --> 00:17:58.277
page and sleep seconds. So honey
bots. Here is bots proof form.

00:18:00.513 --> 00:18:06.519
Why it is bots proof. Have a lot
of honey bots. Most people have

00:18:09.121 --> 00:18:15.127
hid input fields and you see in
the CSS, I moved it 50 --> 000

00:18:39.518 --> 00:18:45.858
pixels to the write so these are
things that bots try to fill out

00:18:45.858 --> 00:18:51.864
and I think there is one at the
top of the page so there are

00:18:54.100 --> 00:19:01.040
other ones too that I invented
and basically input type with a

00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:03.409
couple of DIVs overlaying. That
make it so that you can't -- I

00:19:03.409 --> 00:19:09.415
don't notice anything going on.
You can't select that so it

00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:20.626
meets the three criteria.
Visible to humans and in visible

00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:30.336
to bots so we use the same celeb
yum and you can select tag name

00:19:34.006 --> 00:19:40.012
if you have DIVs overlaying it
and the text is the same as the

00:19:52.458 --> 00:19:58.464
backgrounding text color then it
can be tricked sometimes. So

00:20:01.167 --> 00:20:08.541
let's run this. Going to give
that page and every time it a

00:20:08.541 --> 00:20:15.915
field is not displayed it will
tell you it is trapped. If you

00:20:15.915 --> 00:20:21.420
bots filling out the form or
navigating from link to link it

00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:27.426
is easy to see if it is
displayed first before you go to

00:20:32.631 --> 00:20:38.637
it. It found the type is hidden.
The display non-is track. But

00:20:43.209 --> 00:20:47.947
our honey bots covered with DIVs
that we can't see it all so that

00:20:47.947 --> 00:20:53.919
worked out well and in the last
five minutes I wanted to take a

00:20:53.919 --> 00:20:58.357
couple questions but first run a
really cool script that I like.

00:20:58.357 --> 00:21:03.829
This is so the amazon previews
that are protected. These are

00:21:03.829 --> 00:21:09.835
embedded with imagines. Not
difficult for a bots. These are

00:21:13.639 --> 00:21:19.645
a jacks limited so we can use a
bots to go grab this text and

00:21:23.149 --> 00:21:29.155
print it out. This worked better
on a larger screen but I will

00:21:36.996 --> 00:21:43.035
pop up Firefox you can see it
work. You can do this with

00:21:43.035 --> 00:21:49.041
phantom JS as well. Any
questions? He said do you have

00:22:11.497 --> 00:22:17.503
idea what the defense might be
or attacks might be against this

00:22:26.579 --> 00:22:32.151
new generation of behavioral
defenses and I think the big one

00:22:32.151 --> 00:22:37.790
is going to be things like that
where you use Java script and

00:22:37.790 --> 00:22:42.995
you can make the mouse move and
interact with dragon drop and

00:22:42.995 --> 00:22:46.866
send characters one key at a
time so you can add in all this

00:22:46.866 --> 00:22:51.937
timing and making the mouse move
with functions so I think the

00:22:51.937 --> 00:22:59.278
next version is going to
emulating the behavioral

00:22:59.278 --> 00:23:05.217
patterns. It broke. It took so
long to load. So I will try it

00:23:20.132 --> 00:23:25.671
against. So how do you defend
against Java script. It use a

00:23:25.671 --> 00:23:32.778
brassiere. The only thing
between the bots and human in

00:23:32.778 --> 00:23:38.784
this case is what the behavior
is like and can hey do things

00:23:41.987 --> 00:23:47.993
like a human would be able the
do. Caps and behavioral and caps

00:23:51.230 --> 00:23:57.236
might not be that great. And I
wanted to let you know that

00:24:00.372 --> 00:24:06.979
everything is available at
python . com and I will put it

00:24:06.979 --> 00:24:12.985
up after the talk and I will be
in the Def con23 lounge after

00:24:20.225 --> 00:24:25.064
this, drinking happily.
