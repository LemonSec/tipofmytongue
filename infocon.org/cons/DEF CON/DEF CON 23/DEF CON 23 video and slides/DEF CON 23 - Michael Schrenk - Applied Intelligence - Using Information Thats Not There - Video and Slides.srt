00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:03.303
So, I want to tell you a story
today about intelligence and

00:00:03.303 --> 00:00:07.074
intelligence collection. And
when you talk about

00:00:07.074 --> 00:00:10.844
intelligence, unless there's
been a well-known leak in the

00:00:10.844 --> 00:00:14.047
press or something, there ain't
a whole lot of examples to talk

00:00:14.047 --> 00:00:18.418
about. And we'll certainly talk
about those. But I was really

00:00:18.418 --> 00:00:21.488
wanting to do today is talk
about some actual projects. Most

00:00:21.488 --> 00:00:26.727
of the time my intelligence
clients, they don't want me to

00:00:26.727 --> 00:00:29.730
talk about what I'm doing for
them for obvious reasons.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.901
Sometimes I get lucky where I
was able to talk about it, but

00:00:33.901 --> 00:00:39.907
normally that's not the case. So
a couple of years ago, I decided

00:00:43.577 --> 00:00:48.815
that if I wanted to become my
own intelligence client, okay.

00:00:48.815 --> 00:00:51.385
So what I ended up doing is I
went into business with my

00:00:51.385 --> 00:00:57.558
girlfriend and we have an online
retail business. And it's doing

00:00:57.558 --> 00:01:03.563
pretty well. We're in our second
year. And it's growing. And I

00:01:03.563 --> 00:01:06.833
like to think the reason that
it's growing is not because we

00:01:06.833 --> 00:01:10.971
work hard, but we do work hard.
I like to think it's because we

00:01:10.971 --> 00:01:15.008
have got these little hacker
brains and we just have the

00:01:15.008 --> 00:01:21.014
sales channels that we use. And
I'll describe why that is

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.223
important in a bit here. The
other thing that's important for

00:01:30.223 --> 00:01:32.225
retail businesses is you want to
know exactly what kind of

00:01:32.225 --> 00:01:34.361
inventory to buy before you buy
it. I'll show you the

00:01:34.361 --> 00:01:38.765
intelligence that we use to do
that. And I'm also going to show

00:01:38.765 --> 00:01:45.005
you how we manipulate markets or
as I tell my mother, how we

00:01:45.005 --> 00:01:50.277
protect our investments. All
right. So when people hear the

00:01:50.277 --> 00:01:54.147
word intelligence, usually they
think immediately, military

00:01:54.147 --> 00:01:57.117
intelligence, right? Well, this,
there's not a whole of that that

00:01:57.117 --> 00:02:00.354
applies to what we do. The other
side of it is either business

00:02:00.354 --> 00:02:02.489
intelligence or competitive
intelligence. And those two are

00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:05.759
really pretty different, but I
think it's important that we

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.263
describe the differences between
the two. Business intelligence

00:02:10.263 --> 00:02:15.902
is what's happening within your
business. You use internal data

00:02:15.902 --> 00:02:22.075
and you focus on knowing your
operations and you focus on

00:02:22.075 --> 00:02:26.546
knowing your resources. And what
you really are trying to do is

00:02:26.546 --> 00:02:31.118
make the whole operation just
more effective and more

00:02:31.118 --> 00:02:37.124
efficient and everything. And
that's all very useful. But it's

00:02:51.838 --> 00:02:54.841
also very different than
competitive intelligence.

00:02:54.841 --> 00:02:56.910
Because with competitive
intelligence, you're trying to

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.580
find what's happening outside
your organization. It doesn't

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:06.186
matter if you're a business or a
political organization or if you

00:03:06.186 --> 00:03:10.657
are a investigative journalist
trying to collect information.

00:03:10.657 --> 00:03:14.027
This is all more competitive
intelligence. You're using

00:03:14.027 --> 00:03:18.799
external data, and your focus is
on knowing your competitors and

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:22.936
knowing your markets. So this is
the area where we're going to

00:03:22.936 --> 00:03:25.806
live today. We're going to live
in the competitive intelligence

00:03:25.806 --> 00:03:30.777
area. So a lot of people, they
think competitive intelligence,

00:03:30.777 --> 00:03:37.250
that's kind of murky. But it's
important to know that

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.720
competitive intelligence is
taught in every top business

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.559
school. In fact if you are
running a business, it's your

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:49.262
responsibility to do this kind
of stuff. It's also important to

00:03:49.262 --> 00:03:51.965
know that there is actually a
professional association of

00:03:51.965 --> 00:03:55.202
people who do competitive
intelligence, with newsletters

00:03:55.202 --> 00:04:01.441
and conferences and that whole
thing. So I want to talk about

00:04:01.441 --> 00:04:05.212
the title a little bit, applied
intelligence. So when I'm

00:04:05.212 --> 00:04:08.715
talking about applied
intelligence, I'm talking about

00:04:08.715 --> 00:04:12.752
intelligence that's actionable.
Something that's going to change

00:04:12.752 --> 00:04:17.224
the way you're doing things. The
problem is that most of the

00:04:17.224 --> 00:04:20.393
intelligence that's collected
for the organizations that do

00:04:20.393 --> 00:04:25.766
collect it, it's not actionable.
It won't actually change what

00:04:25.766 --> 00:04:31.772
they're doing. And the other
problem is most organizations

00:04:31.772 --> 00:04:35.342
tend to overcollect intelligence
when they do collect it. So when

00:04:35.342 --> 00:04:38.445
you do that, it comes at a
higher cost, and you've got more

00:04:38.445 --> 00:04:42.616
exposure. The other thing is
that a lot of the intelligence

00:04:42.616 --> 00:04:45.552
that's collected is done because
people just feel obligated to

00:04:45.552 --> 00:04:51.625
collect. Not with any real
reason. So, for example, I don't

00:04:51.625 --> 00:04:53.927
know how many of you saw this.
This is something I had up, I

00:04:53.927 --> 00:04:58.431
was tweeting about it. I came up
with a little scraper that every

00:04:58.431 --> 00:05:01.701
hour would go after the Def Con
site and it would make it a

00:05:01.701 --> 00:05:07.574
printable mobile version of the
Def Con speaker schedule and

00:05:07.574 --> 00:05:10.710
it's still up there if you're
looking for it. And if you go

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:14.681
through my Twitter account you
can find it. So I'm doing this

00:05:14.681 --> 00:05:17.751
and it's cool and it's useful
and I know a lot of people were

00:05:17.751 --> 00:05:20.854
using it because I was
collecting analytics on this

00:05:20.854 --> 00:05:25.192
stuff, right? So I got the
access time, IP addresses, I

00:05:25.192 --> 00:05:27.828
wrote a cookie so I could tell
if people were looking at it

00:05:27.828 --> 00:05:32.766
more than once. But this is more
analytics. It's not really

00:05:32.766 --> 00:05:36.703
intelligence. And the reason I
don't consider this to be good

00:05:36.703 --> 00:05:41.241
intelligence is because there's
absolutely nothing in these logs

00:05:41.241 --> 00:05:44.911
that would have changed anything
that I was doing. In fact, the

00:05:44.911 --> 00:05:48.148
only thing that I found that was
really interesting is probably

00:05:48.148 --> 00:05:52.352
about 90% of the traffic was
bots. It wasn't even human

00:05:52.352 --> 00:05:56.089
activity. But again that's not
going to really affect anything

00:05:56.089 --> 00:05:59.993
that I was doing. Now, if I
wanted to make this implied

00:05:59.993 --> 00:06:03.663
intelligence, what I could have
done is instead of just having a

00:06:03.663 --> 00:06:07.734
static table with all the
schedule on it, I could have

00:06:07.734 --> 00:06:11.771
given people the option to click
on the talks they wanted to go

00:06:11.771 --> 00:06:17.444
to, and I could have generated a
nice little schedule for people

00:06:17.444 --> 00:06:21.681
to take along. Oh, 4:00 I need
to be on this track. That would

00:06:21.681 --> 00:06:25.886
have been handy. And it also
potentially would have created

00:06:25.886 --> 00:06:29.489
some actionable intelligence.
Because if I had this

00:06:29.489 --> 00:06:33.693
information, and if I had it in
aggregate, I could make some

00:06:33.693 --> 00:06:37.697
projections as to which talks
are going to be really popular,

00:06:37.697 --> 00:06:41.434
which ones are we going to run
out of seating, and it could

00:06:41.434 --> 00:06:44.904
have been useful for people
doing speaker ops. I didn't do

00:06:44.904 --> 00:06:49.175
any of this kind of stuff, but I
see the potential use that could

00:06:49.175 --> 00:06:53.813
have changed the way things were
done. Okay. The second part of

00:06:53.813 --> 00:06:57.751
the title, information that's
not there, or isn't there, that

00:06:57.751 --> 00:07:02.555
is a direct reference to
metadata. Now, for most of us,

00:07:02.555 --> 00:07:06.626
we had no idea what metadata was
until the Edward Snowden

00:07:06.626 --> 00:07:10.297
disclosures came across, and
suddenly we heard the word

00:07:10.297 --> 00:07:14.434
surveillance, we all know what
that is. And we knew that things

00:07:14.434 --> 00:07:19.539
that we were doing online, on
our phones, even at the library,

00:07:19.539 --> 00:07:23.643
were now subject to surveillance
and there was something called

00:07:23.643 --> 00:07:28.181
metadata that was involved in
this. And people in the United

00:07:28.181 --> 00:07:33.486
States, we were pretty much
confused. But fortunately we

00:07:33.486 --> 00:07:39.726
have public officials that can
help us in this area. So Diane

00:07:39.726 --> 00:07:44.064
Fine Stein comes up and says
this was a hastily called

00:07:44.064 --> 00:07:50.403
meeting, and she goes as you
know, this is just metadata.

00:07:50.403 --> 00:07:56.209
There's no content involved.
Okay. So as a citizen of the

00:07:56.209 --> 00:07:59.679
United States, this made me feel
pretty damn good, right? It's

00:07:59.679 --> 00:08:04.184
just, okay. So you know I went
to the library but you don't

00:08:04.184 --> 00:08:06.853
know what I looked at? Okay.
That's pretty good. So then our

00:08:06.853 --> 00:08:13.059
own president got involved. So
nobody is listening to your

00:08:13.059 --> 00:08:16.229
phone calls. That's not what
this program is about. They're

00:08:16.229 --> 00:08:19.232
just looking at names or they're
not looking at names and they're

00:08:19.232 --> 00:08:23.069
not looking at content. But
sifting through the so-called

00:08:23.069 --> 00:08:29.376
metadata. They're sifting
through the data. I'm pretty

00:08:29.376 --> 00:08:33.346
familiar with data. I'm not
familiar with a sift command.

00:08:33.346 --> 00:08:39.552
(Laughter.) So this was good.
This was very good. (Applause.)

00:08:39.552 --> 00:08:45.558
Now I know more about metadata.
You can sift it. So I'm starting

00:08:50.263 --> 00:08:53.767
to feel pretty good about
metadata. But I really got

00:08:53.767 --> 00:08:57.103
confused then when Michael
Hayden, who is the former NSA

00:08:57.103 --> 00:09:00.807
boss chimed in, he said oh, we
kill people based on metadata.

00:09:00.807 --> 00:09:06.813
(Laughter.) So okay, I need to
know a little more now. I need

00:09:12.552 --> 00:09:17.157
to know just a little more.
Okay. So metadata. Metadata is

00:09:17.157 --> 00:09:21.561
so important, and it's largely
misunderstood. And we probably

00:09:21.561 --> 00:09:25.765
all know that metadata is data
that describes other data,

00:09:25.765 --> 00:09:30.804
right? But more importantly than
that, it's data that provides

00:09:30.804 --> 00:09:37.710
context for information. And
usually the very best metadata

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:43.116
doesn't even really exist. It
needs to be created. And that's

00:09:43.116 --> 00:09:49.389
where the fun is. That's where
the data hacking happens. So if

00:09:49.389 --> 00:09:55.328
you study metadata academically
in college, they've got this

00:09:55.328 --> 00:10:00.433
whole plethora of categories for
metadata, I like to keep it

00:10:00.433 --> 00:10:04.404
simple and say there's two kinds
basically. There's parametric

00:10:04.404 --> 00:10:08.341
data, that's data that has to be
collected or created and then

00:10:08.341 --> 00:10:12.278
there's imbedded data. And this
is probably where most people

00:10:12.278 --> 00:10:16.316
got familiar with metadata
initially, like in the '90s. And

00:10:16.316 --> 00:10:20.220
that's generally user created.
It tends to be stuff like the

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:23.690
imbedded headers on a digital
photograph that describes the

00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:29.062
camera that was used, when the
picture was taken, the F-stops,

00:10:29.062 --> 00:10:34.634
geo codes. This has become a
whole branch of law now because

00:10:34.634 --> 00:10:39.072
it's all admissible in courts.
I've got a couple of examples of

00:10:39.072 --> 00:10:43.576
these of data that's leaked this
way. This is one I used last

00:10:43.576 --> 00:10:45.912
year if you were at my talk and
I'm using it again because I

00:10:45.912 --> 00:10:51.417
just love it. This is a selfie
of a Russian soldier that was

00:10:51.417 --> 00:10:54.988
uploaded to Instagram. And
unfortunately, before he

00:10:54.988 --> 00:10:58.825
uploaded it, he didn't remove
the geo codes. So it revealed

00:10:58.825 --> 00:11:01.494
the fact that while his
government said they had no

00:11:01.494 --> 00:11:07.267
troops in Ukraine, he was in
Ukraine. Another example,

00:11:07.267 --> 00:11:10.403
another war-related example,
this is kind of a famous one.

00:11:10.403 --> 00:11:16.709
This is the Tony Blair memo.
This is the memo that was the

00:11:16.709 --> 00:11:21.781
justification for the invasion
of Iraq in what, 2002 or 2003,

00:11:21.781 --> 00:11:26.619
something like that. Right after
9/11. And it was actually used

00:11:26.619 --> 00:11:30.757
by Colin Powell when he went to
the United Nations to make his

00:11:30.757 --> 00:11:34.394
justification. And the
assumption was that this was

00:11:34.394 --> 00:11:38.198
done by area specialists and it
was all original work,

00:11:38.198 --> 00:11:43.770
well-researched. We find out it
was actually plagiarized. And

00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:47.674
not just plagiarized, but it was
plagiarized by a graduate

00:11:47.674 --> 00:11:51.711
student someplace in the UK. Oh,
that was the original document

00:11:51.711 --> 00:11:55.615
was a graduate student's paper.
And they know it was plagiarized

00:11:55.615 --> 00:11:58.518
because not only was the content
the same, but so were the

00:11:58.518 --> 00:12:02.455
grammatical errors. So where
this gets interesting though is

00:12:02.455 --> 00:12:07.060
in the metadata, Microsoft
Office files are full of

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:14.067
metadata. If you look at the
metadata here, we can see here

00:12:14.067 --> 00:12:18.037
that the people who did the
plagiarizing, we can figure out

00:12:18.037 --> 00:12:21.107
who they were and we can see
that they were not area

00:12:21.107 --> 00:12:23.876
specialists but they were
actually political advisers to

00:12:23.876 --> 00:12:29.082
Tony Blair so it's kind of a
nasty thing. This kind of stuff

00:12:29.082 --> 00:12:35.855
happens a lot though. The CEO of
Google a couple of years ago, he

00:12:35.855 --> 00:12:39.626
wanted to just put a PowerPoint
presentation online that was

00:12:39.626 --> 00:12:42.362
just kind of a general status
report for how things were

00:12:42.362 --> 00:12:48.167
happening. What he neglected to
do though is when he made that

00:12:48.167 --> 00:12:50.903
report, he actually made a copy
of a very confidential

00:12:50.903 --> 00:12:55.375
PowerPoint presentation that was
for internal use only and he did

00:12:55.375 --> 00:12:59.412
a lot of editing of the slides.
What he neglected to do was edit

00:12:59.412 --> 00:13:04.250
the speaker notes and he
released the specifics of a

00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:08.655
project called Google drive and
it was well before it was

00:13:08.655 --> 00:13:14.494
officially announced. So watch
what you put in your speaker

00:13:14.494 --> 00:13:19.032
notes because it's out there.
Okay. So let's talk -- that was

00:13:19.032 --> 00:13:22.468
imbedded metadata. Let's look a
little about parametric metadata

00:13:22.468 --> 00:13:28.541
and see how that's used. So
according to the NSA, this is

00:13:28.541 --> 00:13:32.211
their own admission, this is
what they collect. They collect

00:13:32.211 --> 00:13:36.516
phone numbers of parties making
phone calls; they collect the

00:13:36.516 --> 00:13:41.421
time a call was placed; they
collect the duration of a phone

00:13:41.421 --> 00:13:47.160
call; and also who initiated the
call. Okay? That's kind of

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:51.431
invasive, right? But you know,
it's actually -- they're not

00:13:51.431 --> 00:13:55.468
doing anything that any Android
app isn't making available to

00:13:55.468 --> 00:13:59.138
the developer, right? Stuff is
in there. It's in all your

00:13:59.138 --> 00:14:04.343
phones if you have an Android.
But with this metadata, you can

00:14:04.343 --> 00:14:07.513
get a lot of really interesting
stuff. What they're really after

00:14:07.513 --> 00:14:11.684
is the relationships between
callers. Because the metadata

00:14:11.684 --> 00:14:14.754
creates the context within the
phone calls, how they were

00:14:14.754 --> 00:14:18.324
placed, and within that you can
figure out the relationships

00:14:18.324 --> 00:14:21.694
with the callers. And these
relationships can then be

00:14:21.694 --> 00:14:25.098
profiled. And once you've
profiled them you can pick up

00:14:25.098 --> 00:14:28.735
the anomalies and outliers. And
at that point it becomes

00:14:28.735 --> 00:14:32.905
possible to differentiate
between a phone call being made

00:14:32.905 --> 00:14:36.375
by a parent at work to their
child, making sure they got home

00:14:36.375 --> 00:14:39.212
from school okay. That phone
call is going to look very

00:14:39.212 --> 00:14:42.882
different than some criminal
operative calling in for

00:14:42.882 --> 00:14:46.119
instructions. It's going to look
very different. And they're also

00:14:46.119 --> 00:14:48.621
able to identify things like
burner phones because those are

00:14:48.621 --> 00:14:50.623
things like big outliers since
those are the things that stick

00:14:50.623 --> 00:14:56.796
up. The other thing is you can
look at the patterns that people

00:14:56.796 --> 00:14:59.899
are calling and the
relationships and you can tie

00:14:59.899 --> 00:15:03.169
them to other events and if
other events affect the way

00:15:03.169 --> 00:15:06.372
people relate, there may be a
connection between that and

00:15:06.372 --> 00:15:09.142
those events. So these are the
kinds of things that the NSA

00:15:09.142 --> 00:15:14.180
looks for. These are the real
red flags. And they'll go three

00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:18.951
hops. So what that means is if
you have a phone call

00:15:18.951 --> 00:15:22.588
unknowingly with somebody who
has had a phone call with

00:15:22.588 --> 00:15:26.225
somebody who is a person of
interest, now suddenly you're

00:15:26.225 --> 00:15:29.395
kind of a person of interest
too. So that's how that all

00:15:29.395 --> 00:15:35.701
works. So you could look at this
and say yeah, it makes sense

00:15:35.701 --> 00:15:39.906
that they would look at metadata
because it's the easy way out.

00:15:39.906 --> 00:15:42.809
Otherwise they would have to
look at all these conversations

00:15:42.809 --> 00:15:45.745
and they would probably have to
do some kind of speech-to-text

00:15:45.745 --> 00:15:49.649
conversion and deal with
languages and they would have to

00:15:49.649 --> 00:15:54.987
deal with dialects and all that
kind of stuff. But it's just

00:15:54.987 --> 00:15:58.191
better data. Just flat out
better data. It's already

00:15:58.191 --> 00:16:03.296
digital. It can be processed.
But it needs to be created.

00:16:03.296 --> 00:16:06.532
That's the important thing about
metadata. All these

00:16:06.532 --> 00:16:10.169
relationships and stuff need to
be figured out. It's kind of

00:16:10.169 --> 00:16:14.340
like how long do you need to
play the game of Clue before you

00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:18.878
know it's Mrs. Peacock killing
colonel mustard in the library

00:16:18.878 --> 00:16:22.915
with a candle stick. If you're
good at it you'll figure it out

00:16:22.915 --> 00:16:28.921
before other people playing the
game. How do we do metadata? How

00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:40.600
do we process things? Well, I'm
not the NSA. I don't have

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:45.838
unlimited resources and stuff.
So the area where I live is

00:16:45.838 --> 00:16:50.843
called operational security or
op sec. That is a military term.

00:16:50.843 --> 00:16:55.948
What that refers to is looking
at your day-to-day operations to

00:16:55.948 --> 00:16:59.485
see what kind of intelligence
you're leaking. And if you have

00:16:59.485 --> 00:17:04.323
an adversary looking at your
day-to-day operations, what kind

00:17:04.323 --> 00:17:08.227
of actionable intelligence can
they collect? Well, I do this

00:17:08.227 --> 00:17:13.199
online. The Internet is my
theater. So I look at things

00:17:13.199 --> 00:17:17.336
like employment postings. Last
year I gave examples about how

00:17:17.336 --> 00:17:21.240
companies leak strategic plans
through their employment

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:23.976
postings, and I think you can
kind of figure out how that

00:17:23.976 --> 00:17:28.915
could probably happen, right? If
you think individuals leak

00:17:28.915 --> 00:17:32.451
information about themselves on
social media, wait until you get

00:17:32.451 --> 00:17:35.888
a whole organization together
leaking information on social

00:17:35.888 --> 00:17:43.029
media. It's a lot of information
gets leaked this way. The way

00:17:43.029 --> 00:17:47.133
orders are fulfilled, so if you
go online, place an order on a

00:17:47.133 --> 00:17:51.304
website, and if you watch the
process, you see what kind of

00:17:51.304 --> 00:17:54.006
e-mails you get back, you look
at order numbers, all this kind

00:17:54.006 --> 00:17:58.277
of stuff, you can learn a lot
about the way a company fulfills

00:17:58.277 --> 00:18:02.648
items, where things are shipped
from, that kind of stuff. If

00:18:02.648 --> 00:18:06.886
they have a store, and if they
maintain a store, you can learn

00:18:06.886 --> 00:18:09.889
all kinds of stuff about pricing
strategies, the products they

00:18:09.889 --> 00:18:12.692
choose to stock, the products
that they choose not to stock.

00:18:15.695 --> 00:18:20.466
Very rich source of
intelligence. If you sell

00:18:20.466 --> 00:18:24.236
something to a company online,
the way they buy things can be

00:18:24.236 --> 00:18:28.174
very revealing. In fact, you can
tell a lot about an

00:18:28.174 --> 00:18:31.944
organization's financial health
just by looking at the check

00:18:31.944 --> 00:18:36.882
numbers. Just little things like
that. And then there's the whole

00:18:36.882 --> 00:18:42.421
regulatory area. And this is
largely things that are done for

00:18:42.421 --> 00:18:46.025
transparency. You know,
financial filings, things

00:18:46.025 --> 00:18:51.931
courts, variance licenses, all
that kind of stuff. Together,

00:18:51.931 --> 00:18:55.968
this is where I get competitive
intelligence from. This is where

00:18:55.968 --> 00:19:01.641
I live. And for my counter
intelligence clients, this is

00:19:01.641 --> 00:19:07.713
what we protect. Okay? So the
first area I'm going to talk

00:19:07.713 --> 00:19:12.251
about, as far as things that we
really have been able to

00:19:12.251 --> 00:19:18.924
capitalize on, is sequential
numbers. And the privacy leak,

00:19:18.924 --> 00:19:22.962
the data leaks that happen with
sequential numbers. It's really

00:19:22.962 --> 00:19:27.833
staggering. Sequential numbers
are used everywhere. I mean,

00:19:27.833 --> 00:19:31.337
absolutely everywhere. They're
on your vehicle identification

00:19:31.337 --> 00:19:38.077
number. Social security numbers,
ticket numbers, order numbers. I

00:19:38.077 --> 00:19:44.016
mean, they are literally
everywhere. And you know, from a

00:19:44.016 --> 00:19:48.287
data standpoint, you need unique
identifiers to represent things

00:19:48.287 --> 00:19:52.258
like orders, people, all that
kind of stuff. You but you don't

00:19:52.258 --> 00:19:56.362
need sequential numbers. And
typically the only reason these

00:19:56.362 --> 00:20:01.600
numbers become sequential is
because it's sloppy programming.

00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:06.372
Somebody programs an online app
and instead of providing a

00:20:06.372 --> 00:20:11.377
unique order number, they
basically reveal the index for

00:20:11.377 --> 00:20:14.980
that order and it's some table
someplace. So they end up being

00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:19.485
sequential. Unless you've got
chargebacks and weird things

00:20:19.485 --> 00:20:22.188
going on. But you can pretty
much count on these things being

00:20:22.188 --> 00:20:26.759
sequential. So I'm going to show
you a little story, I'm going to

00:20:26.759 --> 00:20:31.197
tell you a little story, to show
the power of sequential numbers.

00:20:31.197 --> 00:20:36.202
And how the U.S. government
almost let an entire generation

00:20:36.202 --> 00:20:41.273
be susceptible to identity
fraud. Here's how it happened.

00:20:41.273 --> 00:20:46.011
Social security cards. They all
have numbers on them. And the

00:20:46.011 --> 00:20:50.049
first three are an area number.
The middle two are a group

00:20:50.049 --> 00:20:53.285
number. I really don't care too
much about those. They basically

00:20:53.285 --> 00:20:55.554
kind of identifies the regions
you're from and that kind of

00:20:55.554 --> 00:20:59.992
thing. But the last four digits
are interesting because those

00:20:59.992 --> 00:21:05.197
are serial numbers. And from
1935 up until 1972 when they

00:21:05.197 --> 00:21:11.871
changed the law, they were truly
sequential numbers. But it

00:21:11.871 --> 00:21:16.142
wasn't a big deal, because, I
don't know about you guys, but I

00:21:16.142 --> 00:21:20.346
grew up in the '70s and I was
probably 14, 15 years old when I

00:21:20.346 --> 00:21:25.050
got my social security card. And
if I had gone with a buddy or if

00:21:25.050 --> 00:21:27.953
there had been somebody else
applying for the number at the

00:21:27.953 --> 00:21:32.191
same time, we would have got
sequential social security

00:21:32.191 --> 00:21:35.928
numbers. Not a big deal, because
there wouldn't be a whole lot to

00:21:35.928 --> 00:21:38.898
connect these two people
together. So if you knew one

00:21:38.898 --> 00:21:41.667
number you probably couldn't
guess the other one because you

00:21:41.667 --> 00:21:45.571
wouldn't know who the other
person was. Well, this all

00:21:45.571 --> 00:21:52.845
changed in 1972. These numbers
became no longer sequential. And

00:21:52.845 --> 00:21:55.714
I don't know why they did that,
but I know the way the

00:21:55.714 --> 00:21:59.118
government works. And I know it
wasn't because they had a lot of

00:21:59.118 --> 00:22:02.154
foresight and were thinking
about the tax reform act of

00:22:02.154 --> 00:22:08.894
1986. Because in 1986, the IRS
said if you are going to declare

00:22:08.894 --> 00:22:14.133
a dependent on your taxes, that
dependent needs to have a social

00:22:14.133 --> 00:22:19.872
security number. And I think it
was probably done more for tax

00:22:19.872 --> 00:22:26.078
reform to weed out fraudulent
activity on taxes, because the

00:22:26.078 --> 00:22:31.417
year they did this, there were 7
million fewer dependents on tax

00:22:31.417 --> 00:22:35.988
forms. But again, I believe it
was an accident that in '72 they

00:22:35.988 --> 00:22:38.724
stopped doing the sequential
numbers. It wasn't because of

00:22:38.724 --> 00:22:42.761
this. I can't believe it was.
But if they hadn't changed the

00:22:42.761 --> 00:22:47.967
law in '72, this would have been
the scenario. You've got three

00:22:47.967 --> 00:22:51.370
kids back in the late '80s, you
need to declare them as

00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:54.874
dependents on your tax forms.
You've got kids that are maybe

00:22:54.874 --> 00:22:58.944
ages 5, 3 and 1. They don't have
social security numbers. So what

00:22:58.944 --> 00:23:02.248
do you do? You go to the post
office, you go to the social

00:23:02.248 --> 00:23:06.852
security administration and you
file for social security cards

00:23:06.852 --> 00:23:10.689
for all of your children at
once. So the bigger the family,

00:23:10.689 --> 00:23:14.360
the bigger the threat. Because
each of these siblings will have

00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:18.330
sequential social security
numbers. And it's pretty easy to

00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:21.000
pick up a social security
number, right? If you work in

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:28.040
HR, if you do credit kind of
stuff or if somebody dies,

00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:30.709
you're all familiar with the
social security death list,

00:23:30.709 --> 00:23:34.380
right? As soon as you die, if
you're an American citizen, your

00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:38.017
social security number gets
published. It becomes public so

00:23:38.017 --> 00:23:41.854
nobody uses it. But if you know
one of these numbers, and you

00:23:41.854 --> 00:23:47.026
know they have siblings, it
would be trivial to guess what

00:23:47.026 --> 00:23:50.963
their social security numbers
are. So I'm very thankful that

00:23:50.963 --> 00:23:55.634
they changed the law. But it
would have been catastrophic

00:23:55.634 --> 00:24:01.140
otherwise. How do we use
sequential numbers in our

00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:04.510
business? And sequential numbers
again are usually not thought of

00:24:04.510 --> 00:24:09.548
as being metadata. But they
really are. So my girlfriend and

00:24:09.548 --> 00:24:14.953
I, we started our business, and
we had tried other things

00:24:14.953 --> 00:24:18.457
before, nothing really caught
on. But we got excited about

00:24:18.457 --> 00:24:24.863
this one, because our
month-to-month sales were pretty

00:24:24.863 --> 00:24:29.068
good. We were having like 150%
increase in sales pretty much

00:24:29.068 --> 00:24:34.206
consistently every month we were
going on this and I was excited.

00:24:34.206 --> 00:24:37.376
I mean this was growing a lot
faster than my consulting

00:24:37.376 --> 00:24:41.246
practice. And I think probably
in the next year or two it's

00:24:41.246 --> 00:24:46.618
going to surpass my consulting
practice, I think. But we were

00:24:46.618 --> 00:24:51.023
getting very confident at this
point, right? By August and

00:24:51.023 --> 00:24:54.493
September, we were plowing money
into the business. Everything

00:24:54.493 --> 00:24:57.529
that we were making we were
putting back in, plus some. So

00:24:57.529 --> 00:25:03.535
we were investing in inventory,
space, shelving, fulfillment

00:25:03.535 --> 00:25:08.807
equipment, scales, all kinds of
stuff. We were doing it because

00:25:08.807 --> 00:25:12.010
we had some confidence. We had
about six months of consecutive

00:25:12.010 --> 00:25:18.050
growth. We're in this now, okay?
And then came October. Sales

00:25:18.050 --> 00:25:21.954
just went through the floor. So
what you need to remember here

00:25:21.954 --> 00:25:27.960
is that we sell on a number of
different channels and probably

00:25:30.696 --> 00:25:34.066
80% of our business comes from
this one channel. And our

00:25:34.066 --> 00:25:39.605
business on that channel was
really, really off. And we were

00:25:39.605 --> 00:25:42.474
getting very concerned because
we were still plowing money into

00:25:42.474 --> 00:25:46.678
this business. So we were
thinking we don't know this

00:25:46.678 --> 00:25:50.115
business. We've only been at
this for a few months. Did we

00:25:50.115 --> 00:25:53.619
enter at a bubble? Did we hit
the peak of the bubble and it's

00:25:53.619 --> 00:25:58.223
going to be this from now on? We
didn't know. So we were trying

00:25:58.223 --> 00:26:02.828
to figure out what was going on.
We were pulling up spreadsheets,

00:26:02.828 --> 00:26:05.564
we're looking at old orders. We
were trying to get a clue,

00:26:05.564 --> 00:26:10.135
right? So my girlfriend's
reading off order numbers and

00:26:10.135 --> 00:26:14.473
amounts and I'm plugging things
into a spreadsheet and we both

00:26:14.473 --> 00:26:16.975
noticed at about the same time
that the order numbers were

00:26:16.975 --> 00:26:21.113
getting bigger. And then it was
like okay, we need to find two

00:26:21.113 --> 00:26:24.049
orders that were close together
and we found two that were

00:26:24.049 --> 00:26:27.586
placed almost at the same time
and the order numbers that we

00:26:27.586 --> 00:26:32.024
were getting from this channel
were incremental. Well, they

00:26:32.024 --> 00:26:34.092
weren't incremental, they were
sequential. Okay. We got

00:26:34.092 --> 00:26:36.094
something now. So here's what we
did. We took the last order

00:26:36.094 --> 00:26:40.399
number that we had to fulfill in
October, and we subtracted the

00:26:40.399 --> 00:26:46.405
last order number we had from
September, and this give us an

00:26:50.409 --> 00:26:54.046
estimate of the number of orders
that were fulfilled through the

00:26:54.046 --> 00:26:58.050
sales channel by all of our
competitors for the month of

00:26:58.050 --> 00:27:03.755
October. Pretty cool, huh? We
knew that they fulfilled 6,500

00:27:03.755 --> 00:27:07.493
orders, roughly, that month.
This was our bad month, mind

00:27:07.493 --> 00:27:11.797
you. So we're thinking, well,
our average order we figured out

00:27:11.797 --> 00:27:17.035
to be 1248 and we had no reason
to believe that our orders were

00:27:17.035 --> 00:27:20.005
any different than anybody
else's that was using the sales

00:27:20.005 --> 00:27:23.709
channel and we determined this
to be pretty typical. It's very

00:27:23.709 --> 00:27:30.048
competitive. So this is pretty
typical. So we took our average

00:27:30.048 --> 00:27:32.851
sale and -- by the way, that
should not be July. It should be

00:27:32.851 --> 00:27:37.089
October. We multiplied it by the
number of orders that we

00:27:37.089 --> 00:27:40.993
estimated for October. And we
figured out that the gross sales

00:27:40.993 --> 00:27:45.497
on this channel in the month of
October, our bad month, was just

00:27:45.497 --> 00:27:50.002
over $81 --> 000. All right. That's
pretty cool. So now let's look

00:27:50.002 --> 00:27:53.972
at the other months. So we took
the last order number from the

00:27:53.972 --> 00:27:57.276
last order that we fulfilled
coming from the sales channel,

00:27:57.276 --> 00:28:00.712
from April, May, June, July, all
the way to October, and we were

00:28:00.712 --> 00:28:03.916
able to figure out the number of
orders that were placed, and

00:28:03.916 --> 00:28:07.452
from this we were able to figure
out the gross sales for that

00:28:07.452 --> 00:28:11.490
channel. Right? Fun with
metadata. Cool stuff, right? We

00:28:11.490 --> 00:28:16.662
were happy, because we looked at
our October sales, and it's like

00:28:16.662 --> 00:28:21.166
well, it's not consistent with
the channel. The market is fine.

00:28:21.166 --> 00:28:25.070
We screwed up someplace. We did
something that caused our sales

00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:29.174
to be off or maybe it was just a
fluke. But we did not enter the

00:28:29.174 --> 00:28:33.078
market at the beginning of a
bubble. So we were able to sleep

00:28:33.078 --> 00:28:37.115
much better at night knowing
this. So better living through

00:28:37.115 --> 00:28:44.389
metadata. So this is what the
channel sales actually looked

00:28:44.389 --> 00:28:47.926
like. Even though ours was
really down for October, there's

00:28:47.926 --> 00:28:52.097
was actually up a little bit. So
we're like what else can we

00:28:52.097 --> 00:28:56.201
figure out? Well, if you want to
figure out what you can figure

00:28:56.201 --> 00:29:00.706
out, write down what you know.
Well, we know that the channel

00:29:00.706 --> 00:29:05.844
that we were selling on, their
commission is around 20%. So

00:29:05.844 --> 00:29:08.046
we're able to figure out how
much commission they were making

00:29:08.046 --> 00:29:12.050
every month. And they were
making $15 --> 000, $16 --> 000 a month

00:29:12.050 --> 00:29:16.555
commission. That's interesting.
We also know that when somebody

00:29:16.555 --> 00:29:21.326
buys something on this channel,
they're charged for postage and

00:29:21.326 --> 00:29:25.964
as resellers we get some of that
back but the channel keeps $1.25

00:29:25.964 --> 00:29:30.769
on every sale. So we're able to
look at the postage that they

00:29:30.769 --> 00:29:34.873
get and we're able to figure out
that their average monthly

00:29:34.873 --> 00:29:41.179
profit for their sales channel
is about $24 --> 000 a month, and

00:29:41.179 --> 00:29:44.449
that they have annual profits of
about $300 --> 000 a year. Well,

00:29:44.449 --> 00:29:48.286
this really got us thinking.
We're thinking this is probably

00:29:48.286 --> 00:29:54.092
not information they wanted to
share. Probably not with

00:29:54.092 --> 00:29:59.064
somebody who's got 20 years of
web development experience. And

00:29:59.064 --> 00:30:03.502
this channel, I mean honestly,
it's probably something -- their

00:30:03.502 --> 00:30:06.505
biggest task every month would
be making pay pal payments,

00:30:08.807 --> 00:30:12.077
doing commission checks off to
people, basically. I can't

00:30:12.077 --> 00:30:15.881
imagine that it takes anybody
more than a couple hours a month

00:30:15.881 --> 00:30:19.384
to run this, seriously. They
don't advertise, they have no

00:30:19.384 --> 00:30:23.088
expenses, they carry no
inventory. Their business model

00:30:23.088 --> 00:30:29.094
is clearly better than ours.
(Laughter.) For now. Again, all

00:30:31.229 --> 00:30:35.000
because of metadata and
sequential numbers. So I'm going

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:40.439
to look a little bit at how we
buy inventory. One of the things

00:30:40.439 --> 00:30:43.542
that I've learned in retail is
that there's a market price for

00:30:43.542 --> 00:30:48.847
everything. And if you're lucky
you will get the market price.

00:30:48.847 --> 00:30:53.351
If it's inventory as it gets
older you lower it over time. So

00:30:53.351 --> 00:30:55.787
you really want to get the
market price but you're not

00:30:55.787 --> 00:31:01.493
going to make it in retail by
charging for more than market.

00:31:01.493 --> 00:31:05.564
It's a good way to not sell
stuff. So the way you make money

00:31:05.564 --> 00:31:09.334
in retail is not by selling
stuff. You make money when you

00:31:09.334 --> 00:31:13.538
buy stuff. Because if something
has a market value, you know you

00:31:13.538 --> 00:31:16.274
can probably sell it for that.
But if you can buy it for well

00:31:16.274 --> 00:31:20.746
below market, that's where you
make your money. So procurement

00:31:20.746 --> 00:31:24.716
is really important for us. And
there's a number of websites

00:31:24.716 --> 00:31:29.387
where we buy stuff, too. And we
sell on multiple websites, but

00:31:29.387 --> 00:31:32.824
this one channel that's got like
80% of our business, it's the

00:31:32.824 --> 00:31:37.963
only true market we deal with. I
refer to it as a true market

00:31:37.963 --> 00:31:42.801
because it's large enough. I
don't know how many people sell

00:31:42.801 --> 00:31:46.071
on this market, but there's a
lot of them. They're not eBay

00:31:46.071 --> 00:31:51.943
but they're big. And there's
literally millions of products

00:31:51.943 --> 00:31:55.080
out there. So it's mature
enough. There are enough

00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:59.217
professional sellers out there.
There's enough market demand,

00:31:59.217 --> 00:32:04.423
supply and demand curve going on
so it is a true market. And if

00:32:04.423 --> 00:32:06.892
you want to know what the market
value is for something, you go

00:32:06.892 --> 00:32:12.030
out and look here. So what we do
is we have bots, we have

00:32:12.030 --> 00:32:16.201
software that goes off and
autonomously looks for things

00:32:16.201 --> 00:32:21.439
that we might want to buy, and
it compares them to our main

00:32:21.439 --> 00:32:25.644
channel where we sell, and it
looks for market prices. And it

00:32:25.644 --> 00:32:29.314
comes up with a little report
like this for us. This would be

00:32:29.314 --> 00:32:34.352
really time consuming. Having
software that does this is

00:32:34.352 --> 00:32:38.190
really nice. Basically what it
does, it identifies the item

00:32:38.190 --> 00:32:41.293
where it found it, what the
price is, what the market price

00:32:41.293 --> 00:32:47.065
is. Anything with a margin of
less than 300% we really don't

00:32:47.065 --> 00:32:50.936
deal with. And it tells us if we
should buy it or ignore it. It's

00:32:50.936 --> 00:32:57.642
really cool. So the little buy
thing, there's actually a link.

00:32:57.642 --> 00:32:59.978
If you click on it, it will
actually go off and show you

00:32:59.978 --> 00:33:03.248
where you can buy it and like I
said, it's a real time saver.

00:33:03.248 --> 00:33:09.254
The next step would be to auto
mate this. Over a nine-month

00:33:12.557 --> 00:33:18.563
period we bought $20 million
worth of cars. Something like

00:33:21.466 --> 00:33:28.874
that. So one of the reasons
we're able to do this is because

00:33:28.874 --> 00:33:34.045
we're selling unique items. And
there are major, major privacy

00:33:34.045 --> 00:33:38.750
issues for retailers that sell
unique items. Truly unique items

00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:41.887
would be things where there's
only one of. Real estate. You've

00:33:41.887 --> 00:33:45.390
got an address, one piece of
real estate there. Vehicles.

00:33:45.390 --> 00:33:51.396
You've got a stock, you've got a
VIN. A specific vehicle.

00:33:53.932 --> 00:33:57.535
Original art is another one. You
can have only one copy of an

00:33:57.535 --> 00:34:01.573
original art unless it's like a
signed photo or something. And

00:34:01.573 --> 00:34:05.577
even then you've got a numbering
system to identify it. Then

00:34:05.577 --> 00:34:08.280
there's also likely unique
items. That would be things like

00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:14.886
first edition books, autographed
items, most used things. And

00:34:14.886 --> 00:34:17.923
these are things where it is
possible that you've got two

00:34:17.923 --> 00:34:22.360
copies of something, but you
probably don't. It's rare enough

00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:26.831
where they only probably have
one copy of a first edition of

00:34:26.831 --> 00:34:30.535
Catcher in the Rye, for example,
because it's rare enough. So

00:34:30.535 --> 00:34:35.607
when you've got a situation like
this, here's what we do.

00:34:35.607 --> 00:34:39.711
Remember, we were very new to
this. We did not know this

00:34:39.711 --> 00:34:45.317
industry at all. But we wanted
to learn. And what we did is we

00:34:45.317 --> 00:34:48.153
wrote software that
automatically collected the

00:34:48.153 --> 00:34:53.491
entire inventory of what we
considered to be our main

00:34:53.491 --> 00:34:56.528
competitors. And this channel
actually made it really easy for

00:34:56.528 --> 00:35:00.598
us to do this because they
actually list the top resellers

00:35:00.598 --> 00:35:07.372
on the channel. So we would look
at all of their inventory. And

00:35:07.372 --> 00:35:10.442
we would do it again. And
basically the delta, the

00:35:10.442 --> 00:35:13.678
difference between these two
over maybe like a day or a

00:35:13.678 --> 00:35:17.515
week's time would give us
metadata to describe what they

00:35:17.515 --> 00:35:22.187
sold and for how much, and also
what didn't sell during that

00:35:22.187 --> 00:35:26.691
period. So this is how we
learned about our competition.

00:35:26.691 --> 00:35:30.762
And we did this a lot. So the
more of this we did, the more

00:35:30.762 --> 00:35:35.900
metadata we got that described
what sold, how much, how long

00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:40.338
their inventory stayed online
before it was sold, and again,

00:35:40.338 --> 00:35:44.676
what didn't sell. And we're able
to do this because if you look

00:35:44.676 --> 00:35:47.712
at the inventory one day, you
look at it another day, if

00:35:47.712 --> 00:35:51.883
something is missing here, you
assume that it sold for the last

00:35:51.883 --> 00:35:57.022
known price, right? And this is,
I mean, you can tell so much

00:35:57.022 --> 00:36:02.927
about businesses that sell
unique or probably or likely

00:36:02.927 --> 00:36:06.331
unique items. If you think of
all the businesses out there

00:36:06.331 --> 00:36:09.534
that put all of their inventory
out online, you can study this

00:36:09.534 --> 00:36:12.637
to the point where you can
almost do their books for them.

00:36:12.637 --> 00:36:17.308
You know what their money is
coming in. So, okay. One more.

00:36:17.308 --> 00:36:21.046
How do we protect our
investments? Well, we have

00:36:21.046 --> 00:36:24.215
software that looks for
situations like this. So if

00:36:24.215 --> 00:36:29.120
we're seller C and our price is
19.50 and we're competitors with

00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:34.893
D and E, we have software that
will go out and flag situations

00:36:34.893 --> 00:36:38.630
like this, where people, for
whatever reason, they're dumping

00:36:38.630 --> 00:36:42.967
stuff for below market value. So
we have software that goes off

00:36:42.967 --> 00:36:45.203
and we immediately buy these
things. This is how we kind of

00:36:45.203 --> 00:36:50.875
pseudo-manipulate our markets.
So if we find things that are

00:36:50.875 --> 00:36:53.411
underpriced like that, we buy
them and they become our

00:36:53.411 --> 00:36:57.415
inventory and we're protecting
our investment. But again, we

00:36:57.415 --> 00:37:00.885
couldn't do this without
intelligence. And like I said, I

00:37:00.885 --> 00:37:05.557
have to believe, if we were just
typical sellers, we would just

00:37:05.557 --> 00:37:10.328
kind of not be doing that well.
You've got to really know the

00:37:10.328 --> 00:37:15.100
business. And in our case, our
proprietary intelligence tools,

00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:18.069
and our collection of metadata
really made the difference for

00:37:18.069 --> 00:37:23.141
us. So if you find this kind of
thing interesting, you can

00:37:23.141 --> 00:37:26.845
follow me on Twitter. And I'll
leave my Twitter handle up for

00:37:26.845 --> 00:37:30.682
the rest of the slides here. I
tend to almost live tweet while

00:37:30.682 --> 00:37:33.251
I'm developing. I'll talk about
bugs I'm finding in my own code

00:37:33.251 --> 00:37:38.289
and stuff like that. The other
thing you can do is watch the

00:37:38.289 --> 00:37:42.494
Def Con website. This set of
slides will be made available on

00:37:42.494 --> 00:37:46.331
that website. These are much
more complete than what you've

00:37:46.331 --> 00:37:51.302
got on your conference DVD.
There was also an article

00:37:51.302 --> 00:37:54.105
written about me in the
Christian science monitor last

00:37:54.105 --> 00:37:57.776
week, that's something you might
want to check out. Six of my

00:37:57.776 --> 00:38:03.448
other Def Con talks are online.
They're all on YouTube. And with

00:38:03.448 --> 00:38:08.786
the exception of I think one,
they all involve intelligence

00:38:08.786 --> 00:38:12.056
and competitive intelligence.
And then finally the last thing

00:38:12.056 --> 00:38:15.126
you might want to do is this is
a book that I wrote, this is the

00:38:15.126 --> 00:38:19.631
second edition of the book I
wrote, and right after this I am

00:38:19.631 --> 00:38:23.201
heading over to the no starch
booth to do a book signing. If

00:38:23.201 --> 00:38:26.871
you have a question that would
be a great time to sit and talk

00:38:26.871 --> 00:38:29.274
and I would love to see you
there. So thank you very much.

00:38:29.274 --> 00:38:31.276
