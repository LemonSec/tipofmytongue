00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.938
>>Uh, so welcome to the contest
and events closing ceremonies.

00:00:04.938 --> 00:00:11.044
I'm Grifter, this is Pander over
here. >>(woo) >>Yeah, so we're

00:00:11.044 --> 00:00:17.317
the new leads for C and E. It's
actually, this year we're over

00:00:17.317 --> 00:00:20.854
contests, events villages,
parties and the demo labs, so

00:00:20.854 --> 00:00:25.158
not a lot, just like a couple
things. Um, yeah, we're kinda

00:00:25.158 --> 00:00:29.429
lazy, thanks man, uh (laughs).
So thank you guys for putting up

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.233
with us, all the organizers,
while we figure out how to get

00:00:33.233 --> 00:00:37.371
things right this year. New
venue, new leads, um, but yeah.

00:00:37.371 --> 00:00:41.909
So let's roll. We don't have a
ton of time, so let's go. So I'm

00:00:41.909 --> 00:00:46.213
just going to go through the
deck and whenever OH! [applause]

00:00:46.213 --> 00:00:52.219
>>Magic. It's still.. We're
almost there. What? I'm not

00:01:00.727 --> 00:01:03.230
worried about it. Before we
didn't have a slide. This is..

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:10.737
>>Yeaaaa! Wooo! >>So first of
we want to say thank you to

00:01:10.737 --> 00:01:14.207
these fine folks over here, our
Contest and Events Goons, so

00:01:14.207 --> 00:01:19.446
please give them a round of
applause. [applause] >>I want to

00:01:19.446 --> 00:01:23.951
say that you guys saw us like
running around like crazy

00:01:23.951 --> 00:01:25.953
whatever, but we were just
sitting on the couches over

00:01:25.953 --> 00:01:29.556
there, so... The couches were
nice this year, right? Couches.

00:01:29.556 --> 00:01:37.064
Who knew? Um, all right. So,
this year, again uh, thanks to

00:01:37.064 --> 00:01:40.767
all of the organizers and the
contestants. Huge, huge round of

00:01:40.767 --> 00:01:43.570
applause for those guys.
[applause] >>Seriously, you have

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:49.576
no idea how early these guys
start planning. We do, now. Um,

00:01:54.748 --> 00:01:57.217
yeah, it's crazy. It's like
February and they're like 'all

00:01:57.217 --> 00:01:59.586
right, let's roll', and I'm
like, 'what?'. They're like

00:01:59.586 --> 00:02:02.622
'sorry we're late, usually we
start in January!' and we're

00:02:02.622 --> 00:02:06.159
like 'Please, Stop.Is this
what's it's going to be like?'

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:11.898
So, 29 contests, 16 events, 12
villages, um, you know, multiple

00:02:11.898 --> 00:02:16.003
parties and all the other stuff
we had this year new, if you

00:02:16.003 --> 00:02:18.572
guys were here on Saturday,
these tables out here by the

00:02:18.572 --> 00:02:22.509
Demo Labs, they were showing off
tools. One of the things we were

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:27.214
doing there was, we get a lot of
submissions to the CFP, uh, like

00:02:27.214 --> 00:02:30.117
the submission process, and the
review board goes through things

00:02:30.117 --> 00:02:32.786
and we're like 'òoh, that
sounds like really cool, but I

00:02:32.786 --> 00:02:36.590
don't know if it's an hour long
talk like on a stage in a giant

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.760
room' and so we want to make
sure that the content gets out

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.229
there, so we put them out and
let people see what they were

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:45.265
doing and talk to them, so um..
It seemed like people liked it

00:02:45.265 --> 00:02:48.001
so we'll be bringing it back
again next year. Let's roll

00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:52.205
straight into it, uh, this is
kind of in alphabetical order,

00:02:52.205 --> 00:02:54.941
and then I'll say that and
immediately go into the letter

00:02:54.941 --> 00:03:01.014
um, but organizer, please
keep this brief, cause we gotta

00:03:01.014 --> 00:03:07.154
roll. So! Um. DEFCON Bots? Yeah,
and if, it's gonna be uh, kinda

00:03:07.154 --> 00:03:11.591
alphabetical order, Beard and
Mustache get ready to roll and

00:03:11.591 --> 00:03:17.030
if you want to start kinda
getting ready as you see the

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.000
letters approaching where your
contest is gong to be at, that

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.006
would be awesome. >>Ok, DEFCON
Bots is... DEFCON Bots is uh...

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:31.978
autonomous robots that shoot
lasers at moving targets. It's

00:03:31.978 --> 00:03:35.315
really hard to do, and these
guys do that. All the software,

00:03:35.315 --> 00:03:38.652
all the hardware. This year they
had to encode messages in their

00:03:38.652 --> 00:03:41.488
lasers, that they're shooting at
the targets, and actually one of

00:03:41.488 --> 00:03:44.157
the team went from the qualifier
third place to second place in

00:03:44.157 --> 00:03:49.729
the finals, by exploiting a
security hole in the laser

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:56.103
protocol. [applause] >>So, these
are first, second, third. Team

00:03:56.103 --> 00:03:58.805
Monkey Business, Team Pew Pew,
Team Monkey Business slaughtered

00:03:58.805 --> 00:04:02.876
everyone, hit like almost 45
targets in 90 seconds in the

00:04:02.876 --> 00:04:06.279
qualifiers, and we have a
special award this year. We have

00:04:06.279 --> 00:04:10.984
the DEFCON Bots 'Really Dark,
Dark Grey Badge Addendum' that

00:04:10.984 --> 00:04:16.990
goes on the badge, so that um,
goes to first place. [applause]

00:04:25.432 --> 00:04:31.571
>>Where's my Beard and Mustache
at? Anyone? Anyone? Jack, Jack,

00:04:31.571 --> 00:04:37.577
Jack Jack Jack? Those people
have beards. Cool. Beverage

00:04:39.746 --> 00:04:45.752
cooling? He's coming. >>So, beer
chilling was a Thing again this

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:56.229
year. Ten years, um, yep, I took
it over, well we coded this

00:04:56.229 --> 00:04:59.866
year, I think we're going to
continue doing that. We had two

00:04:59.866 --> 00:05:04.204
categories. The unlimited and
the hacked together, which ended

00:05:04.204 --> 00:05:07.207
up being really quite effective.
Our biggest challenge this year

00:05:07.207 --> 00:05:10.944
was we were through a hole in
the wall, and nobody was like

00:05:10.944 --> 00:05:14.381
here a guy with a cardboard sign
saying free beer. People were

00:05:14.381 --> 00:05:20.787
like that's not real. Totally
was! So yeah. Um... So this year

00:05:20.787 --> 00:05:25.959
we had Team Hebrew that won the
unlimited challenge with a truly

00:05:25.959 --> 00:05:30.664
ghetto fantastic device. It was
amazing. And then uh, A Ray o

00:05:30.664 --> 00:05:34.401
Naught won the hacked together.
Guys found a bunch of junk

00:05:34.401 --> 00:05:37.571
laying around the hotel and
built something. It was amazing.

00:05:37.571 --> 00:05:40.640
So, round of applause to the,
and I would like to thank these

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:45.145
two guys for putting up with our
super late submission. We didn't

00:05:45.145 --> 00:05:48.615
start in January, but they still
got us out there, so thanks a

00:05:48.615 --> 00:05:54.621
lot guys. >>Black Bag go. >>Hey,
hey! So yeah, Black Bag for

00:06:04.331 --> 00:06:07.734
those of you that don't know is
a sort of lock picking and

00:06:07.734 --> 00:06:10.637
penetration game. You break into
a virtual office, you got to

00:06:10.637 --> 00:06:13.940
pick a bunch of locks while
you're in there, there's getting

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:16.376
data, there's a lot of dick
pics, you know, it's my kind of

00:06:16.376 --> 00:06:20.380
contest. And... this is the last
year I'm ever running it,

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:23.183
because there's not enough
throughput. DEFCON's so big, you

00:06:23.183 --> 00:06:25.418
can only run so many teams.
We're going to something better

00:06:25.418 --> 00:06:29.089
and bigger and faster. But this
year? Secslut from Salt Lake

00:06:29.089 --> 00:06:32.892
City, Utah topped it out.
Yellow37 and Krob did great just

00:06:32.892 --> 00:06:36.062
barely getting ahead of Surprise
Buttplugs. But a lot of these

00:06:36.062 --> 00:06:38.999
people, and I encourage you, if
any of you are contest

00:06:38.999 --> 00:06:42.936
organizer, do this shit. For our
scoring, we give a 10 percent

00:06:42.936 --> 00:06:45.939
point bump, off the top of the
score for anyone who

00:06:45.939 --> 00:06:49.209
participates in charity stuff.
So if you bomb in and just got a

00:06:49.209 --> 00:06:52.412
mohawk, just gave blood, like,
bang. Score, score like it's

00:06:52.412 --> 00:06:55.548
going up.But I let people do
that until the end of the

00:06:55.548 --> 00:06:58.752
contest. So there a whole team
watching their score, then they

00:06:58.752 --> 00:07:01.521
jump to second, then they run
over and all give blood and come

00:07:01.521 --> 00:07:04.024
back with bandages, and they're
like Boom! Give us bonuses!

00:07:04.024 --> 00:07:08.228
Yeah, Secslut crushed it because
they all gave blood. Three, two

00:07:08.228 --> 00:07:10.897
guys got mohawks, they did like
be the match and fusion between

00:07:10.897 --> 00:07:14.501
the contests and events is
awesome, so try to do that and

00:07:14.501 --> 00:07:17.270
come to the DEFCON Shoot next
year, because we blow shit up in

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:23.276
the desert, so thank you! >>All
right. Next up, Coin Droids.

00:07:29.716 --> 00:07:36.756
>>And schema-verse. So Coin
Droids is a robot battle game,

00:07:36.756 --> 00:07:40.393
but played entirely through
Defcoin. So you battle each

00:07:40.393 --> 00:07:44.064
other by sending transactions
let each other trying to steal

00:07:44.064 --> 00:07:48.268
each other's money etc. etc.
This year, oh I have notes, we

00:07:48.268 --> 00:07:53.807
had 240 players which was
ridiculous. 88000 attacks took

00:07:53.807 --> 00:07:58.211
place, with a lot of Defcoin. We
had two different battles. We

00:07:58.211 --> 00:08:01.414
had one that was King of the
Hill, and that was won by Freak.

00:08:01.414 --> 00:08:04.617
That go a little intense for a
couple of people. And the other

00:08:04.617 --> 00:08:08.221
battle which was the boss battle
I agree the best thing to do

00:08:08.221 --> 00:08:10.824
with our contest is to kind of
integrate a bunch of them, so we

00:08:10.824 --> 00:08:13.860
had bosses all over the place
and someone managed to find

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:17.630
three of them and that was
Moondoggie. That was pretty much

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:20.166
it, CoinDroids.com runs all
year, so you can still keep

00:08:20.166 --> 00:08:26.172
playing. Schema Vese is a space
battle game inside a postgres

00:08:31.911 --> 00:08:36.182
database. So select start from
myships, insert in myships, drop

00:08:36.182 --> 00:08:39.652
tables, it's all there. this
year we had 71 trillion tuples

00:08:39.652 --> 00:08:46.559
returned for those data base
nerds in the room that's 2.5

00:08:46.559 --> 00:08:50.764
million actions, and no one
hacked it this year, so it was

00:08:50.764 --> 00:08:54.734
kind of boring, but our prize
this year was our Schema Verse

00:08:54.734 --> 00:08:59.372
cup, which was actually created
a core developer of postgres for

00:08:59.372 --> 00:09:03.576
this competition. So I'd like to
welcome Sysfix quickly, run on

00:09:03.576 --> 00:09:08.348
stage, for being champion this
year. [applause] >>Crack me if

00:09:08.348 --> 00:09:12.652
you can? >>Crack Me if You Can
is the password cracking

00:09:12.652 --> 00:09:16.990
contest, it's our sixth year. So
this year Team HashCat pretty

00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:21.694
much destroyed all the other Pro
Teams, first time we've had a

00:09:21.694 --> 00:09:27.700
back to back winner so they were
out for blood and they did it.

00:09:39.512 --> 00:09:43.716
They get $600 assuming they do a
write up a describing everything

00:09:43.716 --> 00:09:47.821
needed and release updates to
all the we require all the Pro

00:09:47.821 --> 00:09:51.424
Teams to do that in order to get
paid so in a week or two there

00:09:51.424 --> 00:09:54.060
will be new betas of John the
Ripper and HashCat and

00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:57.597
everything that's out there for
everybody. The trick this year

00:09:57.597 --> 00:10:05.238
was it's all UTF-8 so none of it
was in English, it was Japanese,

00:10:05.238 --> 00:10:11.744
Mandarin, it was all these other
things, so most of the updates

00:10:11.744 --> 00:10:17.584
will be for UTF support in the
majority of the tools. Yeah,

00:10:17.584 --> 00:10:22.188
that's it. [applause]
>>Alphabetical order guys...

00:10:22.188 --> 00:10:28.194
>>Dark Net project is an
interactive puzzle, a contest

00:10:32.699 --> 00:10:38.705
based on Daniel Suarez's book
demon. We put up puzzles run by

00:10:46.579 --> 00:10:50.917
an interactive jabber bot across
defcon to help people learn how

00:10:50.917 --> 00:10:54.087
to do things in other villages
other contest we integrated with

00:10:54.087 --> 00:10:57.257
coin droids, help people get
over there, you can learn to

00:10:57.257 --> 00:11:03.162
solder, learn to crack Wi-Fi,
your, learn to use PGP and TOR.

00:11:03.162 --> 00:11:08.768
We had three winners this year
Silk was a first place winner

00:11:08.768 --> 00:11:11.771
got a tremendous number of
points, he also won last year.

00:11:11.771 --> 00:11:16.075
Nolan was our send place winner
and Tilted Kuipers, I think

00:11:16.075 --> 00:11:19.279
that's the pronunciation? Was
our third place winner and we've

00:11:19.279 --> 00:11:22.682
got prizes for you also, see me
afterwards. Thank you very much.

00:11:29.856 --> 00:11:32.192
[applause] >> So Drunk Hacker
History was a new competition

00:11:32.192 --> 00:11:37.497
this year and it was a
storytelling competition with a

00:11:37.497 --> 00:11:42.502
twist. We prepared the eight
contestants with 5 L of vodka, a

00:11:42.502 --> 00:11:46.005
liter of bourbon and half a
liter of rum. And they got on

00:11:46.005 --> 00:11:49.342
stage and got five minutes to
tell a story. And so what ended

00:11:49.342 --> 00:11:52.712
up on what was on paper sounded
like a really good idea, ended

00:11:52.712 --> 00:11:55.815
upping a shit show of epic
proportions. So we have some

00:11:55.815 --> 00:11:58.484
prizes, Jack Daniel, we actually
don't have his prize, is one of

00:11:58.484 --> 00:12:04.657
the contestants stole it .And
Pyro, if your here, we have a

00:12:04.657 --> 00:12:08.628
flask for you. And then the
first place winner was Katie,

00:12:08.628 --> 00:12:14.634
and here's Katie's prize.
[applause] >>Ow. We got Badge

00:12:26.446 --> 00:12:29.449
Hacking, anybody? He's coming.
We're all judging your stride.

00:12:29.449 --> 00:12:35.455
>>Yeah, I'll take that advice to
heart. This is the first year we

00:12:45.598 --> 00:12:49.902
do the badge hacking pageant.
Thanks to judges Joe Grand l0st

00:12:49.902 --> 00:12:54.841
and Zoz. We saw lots of
participation for a first year

00:12:54.841 --> 00:12:59.178
thing. The digital winner was
Loather with a DC22 badge, he

00:12:59.178 --> 00:13:02.548
made a quadracopter out of it.
He did two flights, the first

00:13:02.548 --> 00:13:05.885
flight came back around and
clipped him in the calf. Saw a

00:13:05.885 --> 00:13:09.989
rather surprising amount of
blood there, so great thing that

00:13:09.989 --> 00:13:14.193
he won that. For the analog
winner, it was Rainbow Unicorn's

00:13:14.193 --> 00:13:20.366
Bite, with a knit koozy around
this year's Human badge, kinda

00:13:20.366 --> 00:13:23.069
looked like a tire, it was
pretty sick! And for the

00:13:23.069 --> 00:13:25.538
wildcard badge, it was Mike and
Mikey with amazingly detailed

00:13:25.538 --> 00:13:28.441
counterfeit √úber badges, which
they used to get into DEFCON

00:13:28.441 --> 00:13:34.447
this year, I think. So, thanks
everyone. We'll be back and

00:13:36.716 --> 00:13:42.722
better again next year.
>>(yelling)HACKER JEOPARDY!!!

00:13:45.358 --> 00:13:47.360
[applause] >>At the end you can
lead us in a cheer, but Hacker

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:51.030
Jeopardy is the oldest at DEFCON
at 21 years running. This year

00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:54.667
is won by Win Job, their third
consecutive victory, beating

00:13:54.667 --> 00:13:57.670
L33t M33t and (indiscernible)
and We Fucked it Up, who

00:13:57.670 --> 00:14:00.273
actually went all or nothing and
bellowed out in the finals in

00:14:00.273 --> 00:14:03.343
the middle of the game. That
wasn't too bright. Jeff Moss,

00:14:03.343 --> 00:14:06.746
guest speaker, Wynn Schwartau,
came out and played Wynn

00:14:06.746 --> 00:14:09.816
Schwartau as a contestant, and
did really well. My

00:14:09.816 --> 00:14:12.318
understanding is we had a couple
firsts. We went through our

00:14:12.318 --> 00:14:15.555
first streaker, male
unfortunately, so maybe next

00:14:15.555 --> 00:14:18.691
year we'll do better, at least
for the guys. Ladies I hope you

00:14:18.691 --> 00:14:22.628
enjoyed the show. 140 beers, so
hopefully we're doing the best

00:14:22.628 --> 00:14:26.265
we can to drive up the cost of
DEFCON. And so the ref will now

00:14:26.265 --> 00:14:30.069
lead us in a prayer...
>>(yelling) DON'T FUCK IT UP!!!!

00:14:30.069 --> 00:14:36.909
DON'T FUCK IT UP!!!! DON'T FUCK
IT UP!!!! DON'T FUCK IT UP!!!!

00:14:36.909 --> 00:14:41.514
Until next year.... >>Amen! We
still got a couple shirts If you

00:14:41.514 --> 00:14:47.520
want one come see me after.
[applause] >>Robocalls. There

00:14:50.523 --> 00:14:56.529
they are. >>Ok, so amazingly the
FTC last year, did a Robocall

00:15:06.906 --> 00:15:10.376
honeypot building contest and
more amazingly this year they

00:15:10.376 --> 00:15:14.113
decided to come back. I was one
of the judges. Um, everybody

00:15:14.113 --> 00:15:19.552
hates Robocalls, it's like the
most safest thing in the world

00:15:19.552 --> 00:15:22.488
to be against, and if you tell
people you're working on a

00:15:22.488 --> 00:15:25.958
contest against Robo calls
everybody says yeah that's

00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:30.696
great, so this was a lot of
fun.We had two finalists, this

00:15:30.696 --> 00:15:36.702
year, competing for these
incredibly valuable trophies,

00:15:39.872 --> 00:15:42.408
that all be very easy to fit
into an overhead bin. Our best

00:15:42.408 --> 00:15:49.348
in, and also if they're declared
official winners through the

00:15:49.348 --> 00:15:53.152
Federal Bureaucracy, substantial
cash prizes. So our best in show

00:15:53.152 --> 00:15:56.055
was Team Robo Killer, which did
an amazing amount of work, are

00:15:56.055 --> 00:16:02.061
they here? And our first runner
up was Amant Sangier. Come on up

00:16:05.264 --> 00:16:08.434
and claim your very easy to fit
in an overhead bin trophy.

00:16:08.434 --> 00:16:14.440
>>(crowd) >>If you didn't hear
that, he said that's next year's

00:16:36.662 --> 00:16:42.668
badges! Intel CTF? Blake? You're
dead to us. Network Forensics?

00:17:03.289 --> 00:17:07.426
>>So we come from the small town
of Missoula Montana every year.

00:17:07.426 --> 00:17:11.797
We put up the Network Forensics
contest. What it is, is we put a

00:17:11.797 --> 00:17:15.268
bunch of PCAPs we put together,
showing different things through

00:17:15.268 --> 00:17:23.175
the network's TCP/IP protocol.
It went all the way until they

00:17:23.175 --> 00:17:26.245
late/early in the morning I
guess yesterday. So we have

00:17:26.245 --> 00:17:28.547
Threat Level Pancakes that came
in first, they won a fifth of

00:17:28.547 --> 00:17:33.486
surge. Second place was just one
man, Tom Pole, where ever he is,

00:17:33.486 --> 00:17:38.658
he's the best. And then third,
is Blue Squirrel, who, and they

00:17:38.658 --> 00:17:41.861
finished a couple hours after
Tom, so congratulations, you

00:17:41.861 --> 00:17:47.600
guys are awesome, and anything
from DEFCON for them? No? Yeah,

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:53.606
I did. Maybe?!? Fine. [applause]
>>Open CTF, where ya at? Tamper

00:18:10.323 --> 00:18:16.329
Evident? We are powering
through. All right, also dead to

00:18:20.933 --> 00:18:24.303
us. You guys are gone. Yeah the

00:18:24.303 --> 00:18:26.706
Apparently, they're reprises. So

00:18:26.706 --> 00:18:32.712
Range, Maximus Blackbourne came
in first with, I'm not, what is

00:18:36.415 --> 00:18:40.686

00:19:23.129 --> 00:19:27.466
sign ups this year. I love that
that is still going. is somebody

00:19:27.466 --> 00:19:31.771
here from that? No? Want to say
anything? [Inaudible comment

00:19:31.771 --> 00:19:34.306
from audience] Yeah, there were
20 --> 000 people and 126 signed up.

00:19:34.306 --> 00:19:40.312
Yeah, I guess thats whoops.
[Laughter] So Blood Coat. So 84

00:19:45.051 --> 00:19:51.223
blood donations made this year.
So thanks to Deviant for

00:19:51.223 --> 00:19:54.794
probably getting half of those.
[Laughter] [Inaudible comment

00:19:54.794 --> 00:19:59.031
from audience] Yea, it might be
all of them. Man, those guys

00:19:59.031 --> 00:20:01.434
looked wrecked in there too.
Like somebody came over and

00:20:01.434 --> 00:20:05.438
they're like, 'Holy shit. Like
is that like the medical area?

00:20:05.438 --> 00:20:08.407
Like people are just freaking
passing out.' [Laughter] 

00:20:08.407 --> 00:20:13.746
DefCon. Yeah I was like no
man, they're donating blood

00:20:13.746 --> 00:20:16.082
>> I thought that was where
you went when you like got

00:20:16.082 --> 00:20:22.088
hurt.- [Laughter] It's cool.
Hand Radio Exams. You here?

00:20:24.123 --> 00:20:30.129
Awesome, good. You guys can talk
about it. >> So DC 408 took

00:20:33.466 --> 00:20:36.435
their hand at running hand radio
exams for the first time this

00:20:36.435 --> 00:20:40.272
year. Thank you to all of our
volunteers. Everyone who came

00:20:40.272 --> 00:20:43.742
out and took a test gave a shot.
not everybody passed but its

00:20:43.742 --> 00:20:46.979
great to see the enthusiasm.
Hope you study and try again

00:20:46.979 --> 00:20:52.284
somewhere else. There are dice
that we gave away to everyone

00:20:52.284 --> 00:20:55.387
that passed. If you didn't get
yours, and maybe if you're just

00:20:55.387 --> 00:21:00.659
a ham, you can come find me. You
can have one. >> So as you can

00:21:00.659 --> 00:21:05.064
see we had 124 exams taken this
year. 60 though, 65 of those

00:21:05.064 --> 00:21:08.767
were the Technician Class, which
is your basic entry level. Gets

00:21:08.767 --> 00:21:10.970
you started in it and you can
start transmitting as soon as

00:21:10.970 --> 00:21:14.773
your name and call sign show up
in the SCC database. There were

00:21:14.773 --> 00:21:17.877
11 people who upgrade from the
Technician up to the General

00:21:17.877 --> 00:21:22.448
Class. 9 people who went up to
their Amatuer Extra which is the

00:21:22.448 --> 00:21:25.284
highest class that you can
achieve. We also had a couple

00:21:25.284 --> 00:21:28.687
people who, let's see the actual
number for people who tried to

00:21:28.687 --> 00:21:33.092
do two tests at once was 42.
[Cheers] One person attempted to

00:21:33.092 --> 00:21:38.931
do all three however they fell
short on the last test but they

00:21:38.931 --> 00:21:43.002
will be back. And that's the
stats I have, thank you all. If

00:21:43.002 --> 00:21:45.404
you're interested in your Hand
Radio License, We'll have

00:21:45.404 --> 00:21:49.008
information posted on the forums
as well as being back next year.

00:21:49.008 --> 00:21:55.014
Thank you. [Applause] >>Mohawks.
There she is. [Inaudible comment

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:10.162
from audience] >>Give me my
badge back. Hello, I'm Ed.

00:22:10.162 --> 00:22:12.164
That's like, see we do this
whole Mohawk Con thing that's

00:22:12.164 --> 00:22:14.166
like shaven heads. [Cheers] I
see a good amount of mohawks out

00:22:14.166 --> 00:22:20.172
there but of course never
enough. This year, let's see we

00:22:26.111 --> 00:22:30.849
have... >>We have updated
numbers. >> We have new numbers,

00:22:30.849 --> 00:22:34.987
you want to pull those up?
Because when I sent in the

00:22:34.987 --> 00:22:38.123
information at noon like I was
supposed to we were still

00:22:38.123 --> 00:22:43.095
cutting heads and getting like
huge amounts of even more

00:22:43.095 --> 00:22:48.534
donations and so... >>Cutting
heads. >> Yes. >> Haven't you

00:22:48.534 --> 00:22:50.536
seen all the blood running
around. You know the medical

00:22:50.536 --> 00:22:56.542
bay. >> Alright. Final total for
the EFF was $2,575.00. For

00:23:00.246 --> 00:23:05.584
Hackers for Charity, $1 --> 049.
Den, the Den Hack Box Donation

00:23:05.584 --> 00:23:09.488
Box raised $67.00 just printing
out stickers. That was only, it

00:23:09.488 --> 00:23:14.526
was only here for like a day and
a half and got $67.00. And we

00:23:14.526 --> 00:23:19.665
shaved a total of a 153 heads.
[Applause] So this year, grand

00:23:19.665 --> 00:23:25.471
total raised, $3,691.00 for
charity. [Cheers] Thank you!

00:23:25.471 --> 00:23:30.142
[Applause] >> Alright, IOT
village. There you are. >> Well

00:23:30.142 --> 00:23:37.149
we didn't do anything nice for
charity. So that sucks for us

00:23:37.149 --> 00:23:43.555
but good for them. [Booing] >>
Yup, boo, boo, boo. [Laughter]

00:23:43.555 --> 00:23:50.529
This is the first year of the
Internet of Things Village and

00:23:50.529 --> 00:23:56.535
as you can see.. >> First year,
come on. [Applause] >> We had in

00:23:58.704 --> 00:24:03.008
the village two contests based
off our [indiscernible] broken

00:24:03.008 --> 00:24:07.746
challenge. The 0 Day Track we
found 25 new vulnerabilities and

00:24:07.746 --> 00:24:11.150
just learned that our smart
fridge was manned in the middled

00:24:11.150 --> 00:24:14.353
their email. That just happened
so don't get a smart fridge. And

00:24:14.353 --> 00:24:18.624
we will be going over the
scoring and stuff so if you

00:24:18.624 --> 00:24:21.026
participated in that track we're
going to reach out to you via

00:24:21.026 --> 00:24:25.264
email and get you your prizes.
Our Capture the Flag contest, we

00:24:25.264 --> 00:24:29.201
have team first place was Froggy
Style. Second was Ad Hack. >>

00:24:29.201 --> 00:24:33.639
Froggy Style, where are you?
[Applause] >> Third place is the

00:24:33.639 --> 00:24:37.543
Man of One Wolf. Or something
that I can't see down there

00:24:37.543 --> 00:24:39.545
because I'm short. >> One Man
Wolf Pack. [Laughter] >> We are

00:24:39.545 --> 00:24:46.752
going to be giving over $5 --> 000
in cash prizes so we'll be in

00:24:46.752 --> 00:24:52.758
touch with he winners. Thanks
for having us this year guys, it

00:24:55.327 --> 00:25:01.333
was a a lot of fun. [Applause]
>>Wifi Village [Cheers] >> It's

00:25:03.602 --> 00:25:06.305
good to be here, I'm going to
waste as much time as possible.

00:25:06.305 --> 00:25:09.475
So while this village is here,
we had a whole bunch of contest

00:25:09.475 --> 00:25:12.544
events but we mostly rebuilt the
entire Capture the Flag game. We

00:25:12.544 --> 00:25:16.081
built an entire fake town,
including a nuclear power plant,

00:25:16.081 --> 00:25:19.918
hospital, transmitting broken
poc sag. As well as all the

00:25:19.918 --> 00:25:23.756
standard Wifi stuff so it was
really a lot of fun. We had 15

00:25:23.756 --> 00:25:27.426
teams with 10 tables so it got a
little tight and competitive. We

00:25:27.426 --> 00:25:31.096
had three winners. Raging
Pwners. Been here, they got

00:25:31.096 --> 00:25:35.134
almost half the flags on the
board. So they're as awesome as

00:25:35.134 --> 00:25:37.269
it gets. [Applause] You guys
better try harder next year.

00:25:37.269 --> 00:25:42.775
[Applause] We also had Root
Acquired. And Last Place. Last

00:25:42.775 --> 00:25:45.277
Place did quite a bit better
than last place as it was but

00:25:45.277 --> 00:25:49.348
good for them. we gave away
about $5 --> 000 in high end radio

00:25:49.348 --> 00:25:52.217
gear to the winners. So I want
to thank Black Phone guys,

00:25:52.217 --> 00:25:57.790
Silent Circle, as well as Hacker
Ref, Hacker Warehouse, Newon for

00:25:57.790 --> 00:26:00.125
donating so much really
expensive gear and No Starch

00:26:00.125 --> 00:26:02.628
Press and Hack Five for giving
away a whole bunch of gear for

00:26:02.628 --> 00:26:06.432
us. I'd also like to say that
this has been, I don't even know

00:26:06.432 --> 00:26:09.635
how many years the Wireless
Village but our fearless leader,

00:26:09.635 --> 00:26:14.773
our Father, our Grand Father,
Doc Kahuna has been working on

00:26:14.773 --> 00:26:18.177
this village since DefCon 15 and
he's been running the village

00:26:18.177 --> 00:26:22.181
since 3 years ago I suppose.
Yeah. Oh 5 years ago. He's been

00:26:22.181 --> 00:26:24.349
running the village for 5 years,
I'm not even old enough to stand

00:26:24.349 --> 00:26:27.953
here but somehow he's decided
that the rest of us losers can

00:26:27.953 --> 00:26:31.356
probably hack it on our own. He
told us after all this time he's

00:26:31.356 --> 00:26:36.995
going to retire and make us do
all the work. So a big round of

00:26:36.995 --> 00:26:42.501
applause for the man who's been
running this forever. [Applause

00:26:42.501 --> 00:26:54.613
and Cheering] Thanks everybody.
>> And I am leaving it in some

00:26:54.613 --> 00:26:59.318
very young and capable hands. >>
Alright we stomped a mud hole in

00:26:59.318 --> 00:27:01.854
that so thanks everybody. Again
the main closing ceremonies will

00:27:01.854 --> 00:27:04.857
take place on the Paris side of
the house. So if you're

00:27:04.857 --> 00:27:15.434
interested, head on over that
way. So thanks and we'll see you

00:27:15.434 --> 00:27:19.605
next year. [Applause] Also if
you're interested in running a

00:27:19.605 --> 00:27:21.974
contest or event next year, hit
us up. You can reach me at

00:27:21.974 --> 00:27:23.942
grifter@defcon.org.
Seriously, we want to
see cool shit.

00:27:23.942 --> 00:27:25.944
Make it happen.
