00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:05.172
All right everybody. Good
morning. Thank you for getting

00:00:05.172 --> 00:00:09.643
up and getting down here in time
for our talk. I barely made it

00:00:09.643 --> 00:00:14.081
myself. I understand the
struggle involved. My name is

00:00:14.081 --> 00:00:19.720
Tom cross and this is Collin
Anderson. We're going to talk

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.624
about the new export controls
for intrusion software. I was

00:00:23.624 --> 00:00:29.630
going to start with a quick
background for me and Collin. I

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.437
used to work for systems where I
did a lot of export control

00:00:37.437 --> 00:00:43.443
work. I helped the company
understand what it was that we

00:00:45.612 --> 00:00:51.451
were making and how the export
control rules applied to the

00:00:51.451 --> 00:00:54.821
things that we made. (audio
blipped) and the government

00:00:54.821 --> 00:00:57.357
about that. Vulnerability
research work. I know a lot

00:00:57.357 --> 00:01:02.496
about vulnerability disclosure
and can see some consequences

00:01:02.496 --> 00:01:08.201
that regulations have for
researchers? >> I'm Collin

00:01:08.201 --> 00:01:12.072
Anderson, a network researchers
based in Washington, D.C. I did

00:01:12.072 --> 00:01:16.677
a lot of work based on the
structures of network control,

00:01:16.677 --> 00:01:19.713
patterns of network performance
as they're applied to issues

00:01:19.713 --> 00:01:25.185
such as internet censorship.
Being in DC which is a scarce

00:01:25.185 --> 00:01:32.526
place for people with technology
backgrounds, (audio blipped) as

00:01:32.526 --> 00:01:37.664
a result for the past five years
I looked at issues that are

00:01:37.664 --> 00:01:41.134
rolled into the umbrella of
internet freedom, including

00:01:41.134 --> 00:01:46.540
circumvention tools and
anonymity online and export

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:52.546
controls -- on the low
surveillance and censorship. >>

00:01:57.617 --> 00:02:04.858
I knew that this stuff was
coming down the pike months ago

00:02:04.858 --> 00:02:09.930
when the DEFCON call for papers
opened. It was something that

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:12.666
concerned me. I knew that the
U.S. government was going to

00:02:12.666 --> 00:02:18.438
implement it at some point. I
didn't know when. I felt like it

00:02:18.438 --> 00:02:20.941
was something that the community
needed to understand better and

00:02:20.941 --> 00:02:23.677
I had a conversation with Collin
about it. He was one of the few

00:02:23.677 --> 00:02:27.514
people writing about this before
the United States decided to

00:02:27.514 --> 00:02:33.220
publish it. He wrote a paper on
the controls and what they were

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:39.226
and were not intended to do
(audio blipped) we decided to

00:02:39.226 --> 00:02:42.529
propose a talk. We felt these
issues were relevant to the

00:02:42.529 --> 00:02:46.466
community and the community
needs to understand them. And

00:02:46.466 --> 00:02:52.506
subsequently the United States
published a paper in May and

00:02:52.506 --> 00:02:58.912
opened up a public comment
period. Everybody in the InfoSec

00:02:58.912 --> 00:03:05.252
industry got involved in this
topic and comments were filed.

00:03:05.252 --> 00:03:11.925
And the Window to file comments
closed just before DEFCON. So a

00:03:11.925 --> 00:03:15.328
lot has happened. Collin may be
one of the few people on the

00:03:15.328 --> 00:03:19.066
planet who has read every single
comment (audio blipped) filed.

00:03:19.066 --> 00:03:24.538
There is going to be a second
round of this. A revised

00:03:24.538 --> 00:03:29.609
regulation. Another opportunity
for us to comment. What is

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:33.113
important is that everybody in
the community understand what is

00:03:33.113 --> 00:03:38.051
going on and be engaged and
provide constructive input to

00:03:38.051 --> 00:03:44.191
BIS so they don't screw this up.
And they're going to ask for our

00:03:44.191 --> 00:03:50.197
input again. You know, the
question that we have kind of a

00:03:52.499 --> 00:03:55.435
sarcastic title here. One of the
things we wanted to discuss with

00:03:55.435 --> 00:03:57.671
this talk is this or is this not
a threat to vulnerability

00:03:57.671 --> 00:04:03.610
research. The truth is we don't
know. Part of the reason for

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:15.956
that is neither of us is an
attorney. And so you can't take

00:04:15.956 --> 00:04:20.260
anything seriously. The other
thing is that the government

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.863
doesn't know and they
contradicted themselves on this

00:04:22.863 --> 00:04:28.335
topic and we'll show you where.
And in fact, nobody knows. And

00:04:28.335 --> 00:04:32.005
in fact, Collin and I don't even
agree about it. It's a messy

00:04:32.005 --> 00:04:37.577
topic. But there's actually been
two other talks at DEFCON and

00:04:37.577 --> 00:04:41.715
black hat about this and we
heard opinions from a lot of

00:04:41.715 --> 00:04:45.585
smart people about this topic.
What is important is your

00:04:45.585 --> 00:04:50.690
opinion so we want to use this
hour to help you develop your

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:56.997
own point of view about this
instead of just hearing ours. I

00:04:56.997 --> 00:05:01.701
do want to show you a few of my
favorite comments that were

00:05:01.701 --> 00:05:05.105
submitted to BIS. I didn't read
them all but I went through them

00:05:05.105 --> 00:05:11.778
and I have a few that I think
are hilarious. On the topic of

00:05:11.778 --> 00:05:17.784
(audio blipped) BIS and what is
not constructive with BIS -- the

00:05:21.354 --> 00:05:27.327
first is this. Make that
jailbreak (muffled) BIS does not

00:05:27.327 --> 00:05:30.630
care how many people file
comments. And although I agree

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:35.202
with the sentiment expressed
here, it's not terribly

00:05:35.202 --> 00:05:37.804
persuasive. It helps to have
arguments along with your

00:05:37.804 --> 00:05:45.445
opinion. The second favorite
comment is the one that we

00:05:45.445 --> 00:05:51.451
submitted. And he talks about
his recent or deal with law

00:05:51.451 --> 00:05:55.789
enforcement and there are
comments about what is critical

00:05:55.789 --> 00:06:00.527
of BIS. And this one is
supportive of everything they

00:06:00.527 --> 00:06:05.832
wanted to implement. And he said
he is plotting a violent

00:06:05.832 --> 00:06:10.170
overthrow of the United States
government and having trouble

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:14.641
recruiting to his cause. He
encouraged BIS to proceed so he

00:06:14.641 --> 00:06:18.745
could get more recruits.
Personally I don't plan violent

00:06:18.745 --> 00:06:20.747
overthrows of the United States
governments but when I do I

00:06:20.747 --> 00:06:26.753
usually keep it on the DL until
it's ready to roll. The third

00:06:33.426 --> 00:06:39.466
favorite comment is from
Raytheon. I currently work for a

00:06:39.466 --> 00:06:42.035
company with [indiscernible]
employees and we're getting

00:06:42.035 --> 00:06:48.208
product out the door and I sat
down to write constructive

00:06:48.208 --> 00:06:52.479
commentary on this. Raytheon is
a 60 --> 000 employee federal

00:06:52.479 --> 00:06:56.583
government contractor with
full-time attorneys that work

00:06:56.583 --> 00:07:02.956
for them. They filed a single
page that explained they wanted

00:07:02.956 --> 00:07:09.429
an extension on the time to
comment because their dudes are

00:07:09.429 --> 00:07:13.833
on summer vacation. This is a
new life goal for me. I hope to

00:07:13.833 --> 00:07:18.805
become so powerful that I can
tell the department of commencer

00:07:18.805 --> 00:07:22.275
to hold off on a regulatory
issue because I'm on vacation.

00:07:22.275 --> 00:07:25.578
These comments are not
particularly helpful but

00:07:25.578 --> 00:07:30.984
hopefully by the end of the talk
we can show you comments that

00:07:30.984 --> 00:07:37.691
are helpful. We want to talk
about the basics. What is the

00:07:37.691 --> 00:07:44.164
problem and why is this
happening? And I'm going to turn

00:07:44.164 --> 00:07:49.869
it over to Collin. >> Part of
the reason I'm sure that several

00:07:49.869 --> 00:07:53.273
of you have attended all three
now of the presentations and the

00:07:53.273 --> 00:07:57.911
idea is to give a common core.
We need to be able to speak to

00:07:57.911 --> 00:08:01.881
what the issues are and what the
language has been. There are a

00:08:01.881 --> 00:08:04.918
lot of complexities to this
issue and I think no one has

00:08:04.918 --> 00:08:07.520
talked about the full lead up to
it. What people are trying to

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:10.423
control and what the language
says. There are a lot of

00:08:10.423 --> 00:08:14.527
assumptions and hyperbole, some
true, some not. All driven by

00:08:14.527 --> 00:08:19.833
the complexities of this
regulation. We should take a

00:08:19.833 --> 00:08:26.172
step back. The source of this is
(audio blipped) surveillance is

00:08:26.172 --> 00:08:29.042
becoming a multibillion dollar
industry provided to foreign

00:08:29.042 --> 00:08:36.750
governments, used against
questionable targets on a

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:43.289
continual basis. There's no
greater example of this than the

00:08:43.289 --> 00:08:47.594
hacking team incident. You have
a company that was based in

00:08:47.594 --> 00:08:51.664
Italy selling both to the FBI
and to spotty governments around

00:08:51.664 --> 00:08:55.869
the world without any
precondition on those sales.

00:08:55.869 --> 00:08:59.205
Anywhere from Bahrain that
arrests dissidents to Ethiopia

00:08:59.205 --> 00:09:05.145
to Sudan which is under an arms
control. While the -- team made

00:09:09.649 --> 00:09:13.052
an assertion they had a human
race due diligence problem. The

00:09:13.052 --> 00:09:17.223
recommendation committee was the
CEO of Finn fisher himself. Not

00:09:17.223 --> 00:09:24.798
an independent arbitor of a
legitimate transaction. A

00:09:24.798 --> 00:09:30.804
hacking team, there was an
Italian attorney who was

00:09:33.373 --> 00:09:39.479
effective writing out these
issues, by and large these

00:09:39.479 --> 00:09:44.250
recommendations were ignored. I
want to focus on one thing which

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:48.721
is what happened in hacking team
especially was the hacking

00:09:48.721 --> 00:09:51.724
team's products were being used
to compromise not only

00:09:51.724 --> 00:09:56.463
legitimate targets, not only
counter (audio blipped) but

00:09:56.463 --> 00:09:58.465
democratic activists not only
domestic but also

00:09:58.465 --> 00:10:00.467
internationally. There is
nothing that is going to invite

00:10:00.467 --> 00:10:06.473
regulation from governments more
than having their own -- being

00:10:12.679 --> 00:10:17.851
targeted by these items. This
becomes a product of this sort

00:10:17.851 --> 00:10:22.288
of drag of unregulated space
being used in creating

00:10:22.288 --> 00:10:27.560
increasingly visible breaches of
privacy around the world. So

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:33.299
much so that this became a point
and even congressional testimony

00:10:33.299 --> 00:10:39.939
from intelligence officials on
the sort of threats that

00:10:39.939 --> 00:10:44.177
intelligence officials are
seeing online? >> I mean I think

00:10:44.177 --> 00:10:46.713
this is an issue that lots of
people in this community care

00:10:46.713 --> 00:10:51.551
about. We don't like to see
surveillance technologies used

00:10:51.551 --> 00:10:54.020
by oppressive regimes. (audio
blipped) on different levels. I

00:10:54.020 --> 00:11:00.026
think that most of us agree to
-- the question is what is the

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:09.502
best way to combat it. And also
are there ways to create -- for

00:11:09.502 --> 00:11:11.504
control to combat it that also
don't have negative consequences

00:11:11.504 --> 00:11:18.077
for other important things that
we want to do. You know, often

00:11:18.077 --> 00:11:22.649
creating a new regulation
creates more problems than it

00:11:22.649 --> 00:11:27.220
solves which people many this
community are very familiar

00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:32.192
with. What we -- so we want to
provide some background here.

00:11:32.192 --> 00:11:39.232
What is the Wassenaar
arrangement. The Wassenaar

00:11:39.232 --> 00:11:44.103
arrangement is the agreement
regarding the export of dual use

00:11:44.103 --> 00:11:52.078
items. So let me explain what
dual use item is. We have

00:11:52.078 --> 00:11:58.785
agreements about the export of
military goods, guns, tanks,

00:11:58.785 --> 00:12:03.289
airplanes, stuff like that.
There pretty much is only one

00:12:03.289 --> 00:12:07.093
use for an aircraft carrier in
the military, you can throw a

00:12:07.093 --> 00:12:10.029
party on it but people are not
buying it for consumer usage.

00:12:10.029 --> 00:12:12.031
There are a lot of things that
have legitimate consumer use

00:12:12.031 --> 00:12:18.538
that could be applied to a
military application but are not

00:12:18.538 --> 00:12:25.712
necessarily being sold for that
purpose. That's a dual use item.

00:12:25.712 --> 00:12:31.718
Cartography can be considered
one. It can be used to protect

00:12:34.687 --> 00:12:37.624
espionage. (audio blipped) whole
bunch of countries including

00:12:37.624 --> 00:12:40.760
Russia. They all agree they're
not going to allow certain

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:48.167
commodities to be exported
outside of their country except

00:12:48.167 --> 00:12:54.173
in certain circumstances. There
are two tiers here. The Wassenar

00:12:56.409 --> 00:13:02.949
agreement agreed (audio blipped)
2013. Compelled to implement

00:13:02.949 --> 00:13:10.356
this agreement. The United
States is compelled to implement

00:13:10.356 --> 00:13:16.362
an agreement. And BIS is part of
the department of commerce is

00:13:20.266 --> 00:13:25.672
attempting to implement this in
the United States. There is a

00:13:25.672 --> 00:13:28.908
discussion that is happening
where BIS published and asked

00:13:28.908 --> 00:13:36.683
for comments and having
discussions. But there is a

00:13:36.683 --> 00:13:42.689
discussion going back and saying
let's change what Wassenaar did.

00:13:45.491 --> 00:13:48.494
It's difficult for Wassenaar to
change and it's an important

00:13:48.494 --> 00:13:51.931
dynamic in this discussion that
people need to be cognizant of?

00:13:54.834 --> 00:13:59.305
>> To that effect one of the
things that's important to start

00:13:59.305 --> 00:14:01.941
the talk about is actually
because there are layers,

00:14:01.941 --> 00:14:06.379
effectively what happens is
Wassenaar gives a particular set

00:14:06.379 --> 00:14:10.049
of language and it's up to the
member states in order to

00:14:10.049 --> 00:14:13.352
dictate the licensing policies
and in some ways the

00:14:13.352 --> 00:14:16.622
interpretations. They can
license these things liberally

00:14:16.622 --> 00:14:23.262
or decontrol as in not require a
license for certain set of uses

00:14:23.262 --> 00:14:26.466
but that's up to the member
states. What we're going to talk

00:14:26.466 --> 00:14:29.635
about across a lot of this --
it's important to reflect back

00:14:29.635 --> 00:14:33.372
on if you were here yesterday or
the previous days or if you read

00:14:33.372 --> 00:14:36.042
into this. There is a difference
between the Wassenaar language

00:14:36.042 --> 00:14:38.945
as written and BISs proposed
control. We have to dissect the

00:14:38.945 --> 00:14:42.248
two. You look at route kit and
zero day. A lot of people have

00:14:42.248 --> 00:14:48.254
focused on the undefined use of
these terms but those aren't

00:14:53.025 --> 00:14:57.096
originally in the Wassenaar
language. We're going to say

00:14:57.096 --> 00:15:02.268
this is the Wassenaar language,
this is what BIS added onto it

00:15:02.268 --> 00:15:04.370
and this is where the room for
negotiation for having it

00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:10.376
increased or decreases
presumably decreased or having,

00:15:13.579 --> 00:15:18.951
requiring or requesting specific
definitions to be added to what

00:15:18.951 --> 00:15:23.790
these mean. Like when it comes
up, there's a nebulous term

00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:28.728
carrier grade class. What is
that? If you are interested in

00:15:28.728 --> 00:15:34.467
that, recommending to BIS this
is what carrier-grade class is.

00:15:34.467 --> 00:15:40.540
Clarifications such as that? >>
This is a picture of me at

00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:45.778
DEFCON 4. Wear ago T-shirt that
has RSA implemented which at the

00:15:45.778 --> 00:15:51.851
time was on the U.S. munitions
list and you couldn't export

00:15:51.851 --> 00:15:55.688
outside the United States. It
was considered an arm. So today,

00:15:55.688 --> 00:16:01.627
arms, the export of arms is
controlled by ITAR (ph.) and

00:16:04.363 --> 00:16:10.770
they are operated by the
department of state. If you want

00:16:10.770 --> 00:16:13.472
to export something which is
considered an ITAR commodity you

00:16:13.472 --> 00:16:17.577
have to work with the department
of state to do that. Dual use

00:16:17.577 --> 00:16:19.846
items are not controlled by the
department of state. They're

00:16:19.846 --> 00:16:22.415
controlled by the department of
commerce. Commerce is more

00:16:22.415 --> 00:16:24.417
friendly to business than the
department of state. And

00:16:24.417 --> 00:16:29.255
business is controlled by the
department of commerce. I wanted

00:16:29.255 --> 00:16:35.461
to clarify that distinction
because we talk a lot about ITAR

00:16:35.461 --> 00:16:41.100
in this community and you need
to understand the difference

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:43.903
between dual use under the
department of commerce and under

00:16:43.903 --> 00:16:49.909
the department of state. Another
thing that a lot of people think

00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:02.755
in this community is there are
no export controls on

00:17:02.755 --> 00:17:08.761
Cartography. I guess it's a
matter of opinion. We won a lot

00:17:10.830 --> 00:17:13.699
in the crypt toe war but there
are still export -- on it.

00:17:13.699 --> 00:17:20.006
People do get prosecuted for
doing export controls on

00:17:20.006 --> 00:17:26.012
Cryptography. This is in 2015,
paid $750 --> 000 for unauthorized

00:17:30.416 --> 00:17:37.890
encryption export. It used to be
in the 90s if you wanted to

00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:41.294
export cartography the answer
was usually no. Today you still

00:17:41.294 --> 00:17:44.030
have to ask the government but
the answer is usually yes.

00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:50.036
That's a huge distension in
terms of what we're able to do

00:17:52.471 --> 00:18:00.112
but the bureaucratic load in
having to talk to the government

00:18:00.112 --> 00:18:05.217
is still there. It doesn't
really have a big impact on our

00:18:05.217 --> 00:18:09.822
community, though, because as a
consequence of a lawsuit that

00:18:09.822 --> 00:18:15.828
the EFF filed, the (inaudible)
versus DOJ, they mentioned that

00:18:18.698 --> 00:18:22.868
source code is speech and when
you publish source code you

00:18:22.868 --> 00:18:26.472
engage in the first amendment.
(audio blipped) which allows you

00:18:26.472 --> 00:18:32.478
when you put source code on the
internet it can be exported

00:18:35.147 --> 00:18:40.186
without a license. You are
supposed to notify BIS that you

00:18:40.186 --> 00:18:44.190
did it. Send them an email to
the place where you put it

00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:47.927
online. Other than that, you're
good to go? >> You email the

00:18:47.927 --> 00:18:51.931
NSA. To go back to that point,
actually when we hear of people

00:18:51.931 --> 00:18:54.400
like Matt talk and
cryptographers talk, they are

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:57.503
still controlled but they fall
under a set of license

00:18:57.503 --> 00:19:00.539
exemptions. License exemption is
dense and complicated and no one

00:19:00.539 --> 00:19:03.609
understands it. (audio blipped)
that was initially talked about

00:19:03.609 --> 00:19:06.412
-- the Crypto rules are not
generally enforced. The case

00:19:06.412 --> 00:19:10.016
with a 750 --> 000-dollar fine was a
subsidiary exporting to the

00:19:10.016 --> 00:19:13.319
people's liberation army of
China. When used they're used in

00:19:13.319 --> 00:19:16.088
specific cases very, very
infrequently. Those of you who

00:19:16.088 --> 00:19:19.191
for example work on network, any
sort of network communications

00:19:19.191 --> 00:19:22.595
tool that employs cryptography,
if you are linking -- you fall

00:19:22.595 --> 00:19:24.730
under the export control
regulations. You're generally

00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:28.267
not aware of this because you
false under license TSU, the

00:19:28.267 --> 00:19:34.273
general software note for other
people that have been into this

00:19:56.562 --> 00:20:02.568
(audio blipped) dense category
of control. So the point I'm

00:20:23.989 --> 00:20:29.061
saying, talking about this is
when we talk about regulation, I

00:20:29.061 --> 00:20:31.931
think we think that regulation
automatically leads to the

00:20:31.931 --> 00:20:35.968
kicking down of doors. But in
fact on a daily basis there is a

00:20:35.968 --> 00:20:38.938
regulatory landscape that you
interact with that you might not

00:20:38.938 --> 00:20:44.810
necessarily be aware of. >> A
lot of the questions that I

00:20:44.810 --> 00:20:48.714
heard talking to people at
DEFCON have to do with what is

00:20:48.714 --> 00:20:52.284
the point of having an export
control on software because you

00:20:52.284 --> 00:20:56.388
can just download it? Why is
there an export control on

00:20:56.388 --> 00:21:00.760
cryptography when you can
download PGP? I want to address

00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:06.132
that. I think there are two ways
in which these things function.

00:21:06.132 --> 00:21:11.637
The first is that when you're
working in a company, there's a

00:21:11.637 --> 00:21:17.076
lot of pressure to do deals. So
you get somebody that comes in

00:21:17.076 --> 00:21:21.013
and wants to buy your product.
And the sales guy is incentive

00:21:21.013 --> 00:21:27.720
to do the deal. And the
management team is financially

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:34.260
incensed to do the deal and you
stand up and say, guys I don't

00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:36.962
think we should do this deal
because the customer is

00:21:36.962 --> 00:21:40.266
threatening the security of the
United States. The answer is

00:21:40.266 --> 00:21:43.335
going to be shut up, hippy, we
have a business to run here.

00:21:43.335 --> 00:21:48.641
Export rules work well when
people want to comply with them.

00:21:48.641 --> 00:21:54.947
You don't want to do business
with that guy and you say my

00:21:54.947 --> 00:22:00.352
hands are tied. I can't sell you
the software. Sorry. You can

00:22:00.352 --> 00:22:05.257
tell the sales guy and the
management team, I'm sorry, we

00:22:05.257 --> 00:22:09.862
can't do this business. It puts
businesses in a place they're

00:22:09.862 --> 00:22:13.532
not required to make moral
decisions with respect to who

00:22:13.532 --> 00:22:17.970
they're doing business with. >>
You also don't necessarily want

00:22:17.970 --> 00:22:25.511
a lot of people to make these
... >> There is a tremendous

00:22:25.511 --> 00:22:31.550
amount of pressure to do the
deal. So back in the late 80s,

00:22:31.550 --> 00:22:35.821
India tested a nuclear bomb. As
a consequence of that the United

00:22:35.821 --> 00:22:40.025
States took a bunch of Indian
government agencies and put them

00:22:40.025 --> 00:22:44.964
on a denied party list. A list
of people you're not allowed to

00:22:44.964 --> 00:22:49.902
export to. Decades later, these
guys wanted to buy an IPS that I

00:22:49.902 --> 00:22:54.106
worked on. And they wanted to
(audio blipped) IPS. Trying to

00:22:54.106 --> 00:22:58.677
stop malware in their network.
It had encryption in it. It was

00:22:58.677 --> 00:23:03.082
a controlled commodity and we
couldn't sell it to them because

00:23:03.082 --> 00:23:05.417
they were on the denied party
list. We tried over and over and

00:23:05.417 --> 00:23:12.758
couldn't do it. The sales guys
were round up, sorry, we can't

00:23:12.758 --> 00:23:19.632
do the deal. In 2007, the Bush
administration reached an

00:23:19.632 --> 00:23:25.337
agreement with the Indian
government to provide assistance

00:23:25.337 --> 00:23:28.207
on the war on terror to remove
some of them from the do not

00:23:28.207 --> 00:23:31.744
sell list. These guys called us
the very next day to buy the

00:23:31.744 --> 00:23:39.051
software. Basically I'm sure our
IPS wasn't the key to

00:23:39.051 --> 00:23:45.057
negotiating with the Indian
government but it was on the

00:23:48.827 --> 00:23:55.868
list somewhere. These export
[indiscernible] mechanism that

00:23:55.868 --> 00:23:59.104
the government uses to negotiate
things with other governments.

00:23:59.104 --> 00:24:02.641
It's a stick in the various
different kinds of diplomatic

00:24:02.641 --> 00:24:07.980
things that the government can
do to put pressure on other

00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:10.649
governments. Those are the kinds
of things that can happen that

00:24:10.649 --> 00:24:13.952
really, you know, sure, this
Indian government agency could

00:24:13.952 --> 00:24:18.557
have downloaded snort or
something but people buy

00:24:18.557 --> 00:24:26.098
products for a reason. And that
was enough to give the United

00:24:26.098 --> 00:24:29.601
States some leverage. We're
going a little slow here. We

00:24:29.601 --> 00:24:32.571
want to talk about the new rules
and provide you some background

00:24:32.571 --> 00:24:35.074
(audio blipped) explain what is
being proposed here. We're going

00:24:35.074 --> 00:24:37.343
to start with the IP network
surveillance controls. The

00:24:37.343 --> 00:24:39.345
intrusion software controls. >>
To fly through it because we

00:24:39.345 --> 00:24:41.347
don't have much time. If you
heard yesterday, there is two

00:24:41.347 --> 00:24:43.349
controls that were --
implementation by BIS. They come

00:24:43.349 --> 00:24:45.351
from two sources. The first is
IP network surveillance systems.

00:24:45.351 --> 00:24:51.357
The origin of this originates
from the French delegation to

00:25:05.938 --> 00:25:12.311
Wassenaar. And the reason is
post Gaddafi Libya, a number of

00:25:12.311 --> 00:25:16.015
documents were uncovered showing
their local business, AMSIS was

00:25:16.015 --> 00:25:19.785
providing sophisticated
monitoring systems to the

00:25:19.785 --> 00:25:25.924
government to surveil the entire
info structure which isn't hard

00:25:25.924 --> 00:25:31.930
when it's Libya. They pushed a
particular rule for monitoring

00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:38.937
centers or rather correlation
based off DPI. This is a narrow

00:25:38.937 --> 00:25:43.742
rule. You have a lot of lines
here and they're joined with

00:25:43.742 --> 00:25:47.946
ands. This is important. Part of
the reason they talk about this

00:25:47.946 --> 00:25:51.417
is in the first conversations a
lot of people didn't read the

00:25:51.417 --> 00:25:55.687
rules. And they took these
things like IP network

00:25:55.687 --> 00:25:59.992
surveillance systems, these
labels and assumed it meant DPI

00:25:59.992 --> 00:26:04.096
more broadly. It's not. It's
performing all of the following

00:26:04.096 --> 00:26:09.435
on a carrier class IP network,
IE a national grade IP backbone

00:26:09.435 --> 00:26:14.206
and analysis of the application
layers. So layer 7 on (audio

00:26:14.206 --> 00:26:16.208
blipped) and selected meta data
and application content and

00:26:16.208 --> 00:26:18.210
indexing of that extracted data
and being specifically designed

00:26:18.210 --> 00:26:24.216
to carry out all of the
following. Execution of searches

00:26:34.726 --> 00:26:38.096
based off of hard selector.
Personally identifiable

00:26:38.096 --> 00:26:41.133
information like email addresses
and mapping out the relational

00:26:41.133 --> 00:26:43.869
networks, the social network
mapping of individuals or groups

00:26:43.869 --> 00:26:49.875
of people. This is a very
specialized piece of technology

00:26:52.444 --> 00:26:56.148
and across -- if you look at
Wikileaks, only a few products

00:26:56.148 --> 00:27:03.555
fall under this framework and
they're very specialized. I

00:27:03.555 --> 00:27:07.226
wanted to sort of direct one
thing, Wassenaar has this idea

00:27:07.226 --> 00:27:13.365
of mass market. And what mass
market says is actually

00:27:13.365 --> 00:27:15.868
essentially not only if you're
open source but if you're

00:27:15.868 --> 00:27:18.871
generally available for the
public, we're not going to

00:27:18.871 --> 00:27:22.708
control you. And so this is
something that comes into play

00:27:22.708 --> 00:27:26.278
because effectively the stuff
that is off the shelf, unless

00:27:26.278 --> 00:27:30.616
it's encryption, isn't
controlled by the Wassenaar

00:27:30.616 --> 00:27:37.890
arrangement. This uses crypt toe
so we're going to control it.

00:27:37.890 --> 00:27:41.493
That is a lot of the push back
and it's an important point.

00:27:41.493 --> 00:27:46.365
Suffice it to say the IP network
surveillance system is very

00:27:46.365 --> 00:27:52.137
narrow and probably only ones
into some I think probably

00:27:52.137 --> 00:27:58.377
speculative network intrusion
detection systems. So intrusion

00:27:58.377 --> 00:28:01.747
software however is the largest
point of controversy and

00:28:01.747 --> 00:28:06.885
rightfully so. The Wassenaar
arrangement puts together this

00:28:06.885 --> 00:28:11.657
definition of intrusion
software. It says software

00:28:11.657 --> 00:28:17.329
specially designed or modified
to avoid detection by monitoring

00:28:17.329 --> 00:28:21.466
tools or defeat counter
protective measures of a

00:28:21.466 --> 00:28:25.270
computer network, cable or
devices and performing all of

00:28:25.270 --> 00:28:29.174
the following. The extraction of
data or information from a

00:28:29.174 --> 00:28:33.845
computer or network capable
device. Or the modification of

00:28:33.845 --> 00:28:39.918
user data. That is one possible
route. Or the modification of

00:28:39.918 --> 00:28:43.789
the standard execution path of a
program or process in order to

00:28:43.789 --> 00:28:46.792
allow the execution of
externally provided

00:28:46.792 --> 00:28:50.729
instructions. They provide Def
nixes on monitoring tools and

00:28:50.729 --> 00:28:54.600
protective counter measures. I
think people have a good

00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:59.538
understanding of what those
means but at least you have

00:28:59.538 --> 00:29:04.076
things like DEp and ASLR showing
up on export controls? >> The

00:29:04.076 --> 00:29:10.315
question is, is intrusion -- >>
Right. Sorry. Here is the

00:29:10.315 --> 00:29:14.286
important point about intrusion
software. Intrusion software

00:29:14.286 --> 00:29:20.592
itself is not controlled. That's
the next slide. >> There are no

00:29:20.592 --> 00:29:24.463
controls on intrusion software.
(audio blipped) there is no

00:29:24.463 --> 00:29:29.334
export controls on them. And
this is why this gets confusing.

00:29:29.334 --> 00:29:33.171
What is controlled? One of the
reasons this is super-confusing

00:29:33.171 --> 00:29:36.274
is they didn't come up with a
name for the thing that is

00:29:36.274 --> 00:29:42.014
controlled. I don't know if you
-- you want to do this slide? >>

00:29:44.416 --> 00:29:47.119
Intrusion software is this
definition they use throughout

00:29:47.119 --> 00:29:49.988
the rest of the document.
Intrusion software itself is not

00:29:49.988 --> 00:29:55.627
controlled but they control the
periphery of technologies. The

00:29:55.627 --> 00:29:58.630
reason they did this was smart.
They said the biggest problem is

00:29:58.630 --> 00:30:05.037
if we can control -- this came
out by the way out to have UK

00:30:05.037 --> 00:30:10.942
delegation to Wassenaar and the
reason is they - fin fisher had

00:30:10.942 --> 00:30:15.614
a presence in the country enough
so they had to start to control

00:30:15.614 --> 00:30:21.219
Finn Fisher. If we control
intrusion software that means

00:30:21.219 --> 00:30:24.756
anyone hit by anything
controlled, a target of

00:30:24.756 --> 00:30:30.662
intrusion software would be
engaged in an export control

00:30:30.662 --> 00:30:35.834
violation if they took their
infected malware outside of the

00:30:35.834 --> 00:30:38.837
country. Especially for things
like hacking team, when you

00:30:38.837 --> 00:30:43.108
start to look at in the catalog
is there is a broader periphery

00:30:43.108 --> 00:30:48.013
of technologies used to support
this. Finn agents or RCS is not

00:30:48.013 --> 00:30:52.484
necessarily a substantial thing.
It's not (audio blipped) the

00:30:52.484 --> 00:30:58.490
hacking team's equipment
valuable. We're going to control

00:31:00.559 --> 00:31:04.229
the technologies around it. The
things that interact with it.

00:31:04.229 --> 00:31:10.235
The RCS console. The proxy. The
thin (inaudible) proxy. The

00:31:15.407 --> 00:31:18.910
middle box that is doing
infection by tainting binaries.

00:31:18.910 --> 00:31:22.380
We're going to control the
hardware and software that

00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:27.052
creates the ecosystem around the
technology -- of the Trojan

00:31:27.052 --> 00:31:29.588
itself. Here is where it's more
confusing. They start to do

00:31:29.588 --> 00:31:32.224
technology for the development
of intrusion software. When you

00:31:32.224 --> 00:31:34.392
run into controversy this is
probably the largest issue.

00:31:34.392 --> 00:31:36.762
Technology in terms of Wassenaar
is a specialized thing. It's

00:31:36.762 --> 00:31:38.764
basically information. It's
basically technical data. It's

00:31:38.764 --> 00:31:41.600
technical assistance, it's
blueprints, the structure that

00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:43.668
is necessary for the creation of
that thing. I mean anyone who

00:31:43.668 --> 00:31:47.706
did a computer science 101, how
easy it is to control intrusion

00:31:47.706 --> 00:31:50.509
software. This is one of the
points of ambiguity that we run

00:31:50.509 --> 00:31:53.945
into. Technology is defined,
develop is defined. Intrusion

00:31:53.945 --> 00:31:55.947
software is defined but what all
these things together mean is

00:31:55.947 --> 00:31:57.949
one of the largest things that
you'll see across the FAQs and

00:31:57.949 --> 00:31:59.951
across the conversations and
across the debate. Difficulties

00:31:59.951 --> 00:32:01.887
from all the parties involved
really starting to be able to

00:32:01.887 --> 00:32:03.889
scope this out in a limited way
that doesn't necessarily create

00:32:03.889 --> 00:32:05.891
a burden for researchers like a
lot of the people in the room?

00:32:05.891 --> 00:32:07.893
>> What are the potential
implications of all this? I'm

00:32:07.893 --> 00:32:09.895
going to run fast because we're
getting low on time. But big

00:32:09.895 --> 00:32:11.897
question that everyone asks is
what about full disclosure and

00:32:11.897 --> 00:32:13.899
open source? It's interesting
because a lot of us work in the

00:32:13.899 --> 00:32:15.901
encryption world and we're used
to license exception being the

00:32:15.901 --> 00:32:17.903
mechanism through which open
source software is not

00:32:17.903 --> 00:32:19.905
controlled for export. They
specifically said that TSU does

00:32:19.905 --> 00:32:21.907
not apply to intrusion software.
So that created a lot of

00:32:21.907 --> 00:32:27.913
confusion initially because
people thought that means I

00:32:44.095 --> 00:32:50.101
can't put this stuff out on the
web. There is this separate part

00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:14.826
of the regulations, CFR734.3
which creates an exception for

00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:27.606
things that are publicly
disclosed. This exception does

00:33:47.626 --> 00:33:50.695
not apply to encryption
software. Those who work with

00:33:50.695 --> 00:33:52.697
encryption software, are not
necessarily familiar but it

00:33:52.697 --> 00:33:58.703
applies to intrusion software.
It creates exemptions.

00:34:06.478 --> 00:34:11.349
Fundamental research which is
narrowly defined and things that

00:34:11.349 --> 00:34:14.085
are presented in a classroom
environment and academic

00:34:14.085 --> 00:34:19.891
institution. So (audio blipped)
exceptions that allow you to do

00:34:19.891 --> 00:34:22.494
things and it's important that
it doesn't matter whether or not

00:34:22.494 --> 00:34:28.300
your source code is open. If you
can public object code on the

00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:31.503
internet without publishing the
source code and be free of

00:34:31.503 --> 00:34:37.642
control whereas the encryption
content you have to publish the

00:34:37.642 --> 00:34:43.648
source code. Any slide on this
can benefit with a few pictures

00:34:46.918 --> 00:34:51.523
of Eric. On the one hand with
encryption there is license

00:34:51.523 --> 00:34:55.393
exception and if you want it to
apply you have to email the

00:34:55.393 --> 00:35:01.066
source code and tell them where
it is. On the intrusion software

00:35:01.066 --> 00:35:07.272
there is 15CSR before, it does
not have (audio blipped) does

00:35:07.272 --> 00:35:12.110
not have to be notified. A
different system. If you're here

00:35:12.110 --> 00:35:17.382
and you're talking about stuff
and releasing stuff you don't

00:35:17.382 --> 00:35:20.719
have to worry about export
control. The public sphere is

00:35:20.719 --> 00:35:25.724
removed from the picture and
it's private transactions that

00:35:25.724 --> 00:35:30.762
end up getting controlled. What
about vulnerability research. Is

00:35:30.762 --> 00:35:34.165
it covered. When you expose a
vulnerability to a vendor is

00:35:34.165 --> 00:35:39.204
that covered? That is unclear
and BIS has contradicted

00:35:39.204 --> 00:35:45.777
themselves on this topic. In the
federal register when they

00:35:45.777 --> 00:35:50.148
publish this, they say
technology for the development

00:35:50.148 --> 00:35:55.186
of intrusion software software
includes proprietary research on

00:35:55.186 --> 00:36:00.925
the vulnerabilities and
exploitation of computers. Yes,

00:36:00.925 --> 00:36:03.762
vulnerability research is
controlled. Then BIS after

00:36:03.762 --> 00:36:08.600
getting feed back about this
published an FAQ on the website

00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:12.737
and one of the answers said the
proposed rule said the

00:36:12.737 --> 00:36:17.475
information would not control
vulnerabilities research. They

00:36:17.475 --> 00:36:24.516
said in their fact, neither the
disclosure nor the disclosure of

00:36:24.516 --> 00:36:28.720
the export code would be
controlled. However, this is the

00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:32.724
caveat. I think that BIS has
been operating under the

00:36:32.724 --> 00:36:36.061
assumption when you disclose a
vulnerability the vendor than

00:36:36.061 --> 00:36:39.431
all the information that you
give the vendor becomes public.

00:36:39.431 --> 00:36:41.733
This public - the exception for
things that are published

00:36:41.733 --> 00:36:46.938
applies here and so we don't
have to worry about

00:36:46.938 --> 00:36:51.643
vulnerabilities disclosure. As
you know nah is not entirely

00:36:51.643 --> 00:36:56.848
true. When you disclose a
vulnerability a vendor there is

00:36:56.848 --> 00:37:01.686
technical information that they
don't disclose to the public.

00:37:01.686 --> 00:37:04.923
They put out an advisory. Where
to get the patch and credit you

00:37:04.923 --> 00:37:06.925
(audio blipped) explains how you
got -- and those kinds of things

00:37:06.925 --> 00:37:11.262
because they're not published
may be technology for the

00:37:11.262 --> 00:37:17.268
development of intrusion
softwares issue here. And so

00:37:21.773 --> 00:37:26.444
potentially coordinated
vulnerabilities disclosure could

00:37:26.444 --> 00:37:30.682
be controlled by this unless
they carve out clear exceptions

00:37:30.682 --> 00:37:35.854
for it. This can impact bug
[indiscernible]. Not only

00:37:35.854 --> 00:37:38.056
coordinating this information
across a border but you're

00:37:38.056 --> 00:37:40.725
getting paid for it and not
talking to the vendor directly.

00:37:40.725 --> 00:37:45.463
That's important to point out
because if they do craft an

00:37:45.463 --> 00:37:49.701
exception it needs to include
bug boundary programs? >> This

00:37:49.701 --> 00:37:54.973
is struggling to interpret the
Wassenaar language. This is

00:37:54.973 --> 00:37:57.675
where a large number of people
have the ability to start to

00:37:57.675 --> 00:37:59.677
clarify what the intended scope
of these should be. How you get

00:37:59.677 --> 00:38:01.613
to the effective point where
hacking team and others might

00:38:01.613 --> 00:38:03.615
incur controls if you're
interested in that while not

00:38:03.615 --> 00:38:09.621
necessarily creating an undue
burden on the types of people in

00:38:13.558 --> 00:38:18.096
the room. This is the
translation process that is

00:38:18.096 --> 00:38:24.102
necessary for the participation
of those of you around. >>

00:38:26.404 --> 00:38:30.475
Quickly, one of the things they
controlled is ways to reliably

00:38:30.475 --> 00:38:37.315
and predictably defeat counter
protective measures. There are

00:38:37.315 --> 00:38:42.887
vulnerability disclosure
programs that specifically have

00:38:42.887 --> 00:38:49.260
to do with mitigation bypasses.
Sharing exploit tool samples is

00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:53.932
potentially controlled. They
said exploit tool kits would be

00:38:53.932 --> 00:38:58.303
covered under the proposed rule
and no license exception. Those

00:38:58.303 --> 00:39:00.438
that work in the InfoSec
industry that find these things

00:39:00.438 --> 00:39:03.875
and pass them around on private
mailing lists, potentially that

00:39:03.875 --> 00:39:09.113
activity could be controlled at
least under the initial pass at

00:39:09.113 --> 00:39:12.517
interpreting this. Training
classes? Technology for the

00:39:12.517 --> 00:39:15.887
development of intrusion
software includes sitting down

00:39:15.887 --> 00:39:20.892
and talking to somebody about
it. There are exceptions for

00:39:20.892 --> 00:39:24.429
classes in an academic
environment. There is no

00:39:24.429 --> 00:39:29.701
exception for private training
classes. So we see at BlackHat

00:39:29.701 --> 00:39:34.672
they have expensive training
classes that aren't available to

00:39:34.672 --> 00:39:38.509
the public. They could
potentially become controlled

00:39:38.509 --> 00:39:42.313
and BlackHat would have to ask
what country you're from before

00:39:42.313 --> 00:39:45.750
allowing you in the class.
Traveling outside of the United

00:39:45.750 --> 00:39:50.688
States -- (audio blipped) if
it's on your laptop and you're

00:39:50.688 --> 00:39:55.593
traveling outside of the United
States, you don't have to worry

00:39:55.593 --> 00:39:59.163
about import control. They
didn't apply this intrusion

00:39:59.163 --> 00:40:02.333
software (audio blipped) and
traveled outside the United

00:40:02.333 --> 00:40:09.507
States, potentially you might
have the legally exported the

00:40:09.507 --> 00:40:12.777
software. If you have foreign
coworkers in your office,

00:40:12.777 --> 00:40:17.415
telling them about exploiting a
vulnerability of giving them

00:40:17.415 --> 00:40:21.919
access to tools may potentially
violate the rules because

00:40:21.919 --> 00:40:25.156
they're foreign nationals and
it's considered export? >> That

00:40:25.156 --> 00:40:32.030
is also an idiosyncrasy of the
U.S., this notion of --

00:40:32.030 --> 00:40:34.933
[indiscernible] only exists in
the U.S. And that's one of the

00:40:34.933 --> 00:40:37.201
things that I think people have
run into that they didn't

00:40:37.201 --> 00:40:42.740
necessarily understand. >>
Debugers and exploit generators

00:40:42.740 --> 00:40:45.610
is a question brought up. If
it's especially designed for

00:40:45.610 --> 00:40:51.749
intrusion software it may be
controlled. Some are.

00:40:51.749 --> 00:40:58.489
Jailbreaking software can be
subject to export control. And

00:40:58.489 --> 00:41:00.425
there's this other point. They
said they would have --

00:41:00.425 --> 00:41:06.898
presumptive denial
[indiscernible] that's way more

00:41:06.898 --> 00:41:09.967
aggressive than the Wassenaar
text itself. That is something

00:41:09.967 --> 00:41:12.370
that the United States
government is potentially

00:41:12.370 --> 00:41:16.574
interpreting. I'm trying to blow
through the rest of the slides.

00:41:16.574 --> 00:41:20.778
I think it's important that we
highlight a few comments that

00:41:20.778 --> 00:41:25.383
were submitted that were really
good? >> We've run out of time.

00:41:25.383 --> 00:41:30.488
That is because in 45 minutes we
couldn't get through the entire

00:41:30.488 --> 00:41:33.925
scope of the rule. It's complex.
There is a lot of resources that

00:41:33.925 --> 00:41:35.927
are available and -- going to
incidentally run into. A lot of

00:41:35.927 --> 00:41:43.067
these things are easily fixable
as long as the right people say

00:41:43.067 --> 00:41:49.974
the right things. The last call
closed on the 20th and 260

00:41:49.974 --> 00:41:54.846
comments were filed. The vast
majority were constructive

00:41:54.846 --> 00:42:00.785
involvements from people within
the community. For example, DINO

00:42:03.988 --> 00:42:09.961
from square submitted an issue,
in a personal capacity with

00:42:09.961 --> 00:42:14.065
deemed exports. We work in an
environment in which we have to

00:42:14.065 --> 00:42:16.501
exchange this information, it's
critical. We are not

00:42:16.501 --> 00:42:20.271
facilitating the intrusion of
users, we're trying to protect

00:42:20.271 --> 00:42:24.509
our service. We need access to
deemed exports. We need to be

00:42:24.509 --> 00:42:28.146
able to provide it to foreign
nationals within our office? >>

00:42:28.146 --> 00:42:32.250
This comment is good. He is
explaining why it's good and why

00:42:32.250 --> 00:42:34.419
it's legitimate and why the
regulation might prevent him

00:42:34.419 --> 00:42:36.788
from doing it. That level of
specificity is influential to

00:42:36.788 --> 00:42:43.027
BIS. They need to understand.
(audio blipped). >> In another

00:42:43.027 --> 00:42:49.033
case we have the New York
electrical power association. At

00:42:55.740 --> 00:42:58.543
some point they realized wow, we
have pentesting tools and

00:42:58.543 --> 00:43:02.346
foreign nationals and we have
international companies that

00:43:02.346 --> 00:43:05.683
need to be able to export within
other branches. This is a great

00:43:05.683 --> 00:43:08.286
example. We need to know about
bulk export licenses. We need to

00:43:08.286 --> 00:43:10.721
know about whether it's possible
for you to exempt certain

00:43:10.721 --> 00:43:18.096
countries that are not
necessarily going to engage in

00:43:18.096 --> 00:43:23.701
malicious hacking of dissidents
or intelligence targets. We need

00:43:23.701 --> 00:43:27.138
to know about how we can better
interact with foreign offices

00:43:27.138 --> 00:43:34.779
and facilitate legitimate
research within our company. And

00:43:34.779 --> 00:43:38.549
they laid out points that spoke
to their interest and the

00:43:38.549 --> 00:43:42.086
interest of BIS and basically
the federal government to

00:43:42.086 --> 00:43:46.924
protect the power grid. I
thought one of my favorites was

00:43:46.924 --> 00:43:53.631
cobalt strikes. He wrote through
paragraph by paragraph by saying

00:43:53.631 --> 00:43:56.934
we need to be able to do this.
We are a legitimate business and

00:43:56.934 --> 00:44:02.773
this is how we interact with the
economy. They went through

00:44:02.773 --> 00:44:07.378
paragraphs of recommendations
and articulated the argument to

00:44:07.378 --> 00:44:11.282
address the specific claims.
They had specific things they

00:44:11.282 --> 00:44:15.286
were interested in fixing that
they needed to be protected.

00:44:15.286 --> 00:44:17.722
They don't have to necessarily
endorse the rules. You don't

00:44:17.722 --> 00:44:20.992
need to endorse the rules. You
can think the export controls

00:44:20.992 --> 00:44:25.096
are the bane of their existence
and futile, I will disagree with

00:44:25.096 --> 00:44:27.098
you, but the likelihood, you
have to behavior politically and

00:44:27.098 --> 00:44:29.100
say, irrespective, we wrote
these rules and we disagree with

00:44:29.100 --> 00:44:34.438
them on this basis and this is
how we want to protect our

00:44:34.438 --> 00:44:40.444
assets and our legitimate -- and
this is what you have to do.

00:44:45.983 --> 00:44:49.820
They want information. They did
not have to open up this call.

00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:53.591
Based off of the process, rapid
7 did this. Said this is our

00:44:53.591 --> 00:44:56.194
involvement with the industry.
This is the point in which this

00:44:56.194 --> 00:45:03.834
came to DEFCON. They want your
input. There is going to be a

00:45:03.834 --> 00:45:06.938
second proposed rule that will
come out in the next few months.

00:45:06.938 --> 00:45:10.675
There is technical advisory
committees, they maintained an

00:45:10.675 --> 00:45:16.314
open door and this is the
opportunity for you to protect

00:45:16.314 --> 00:45:19.584
your profession. There you go?
>> I'm sorry we don't have time

00:45:19.584 --> 00:45:25.389
for questions. It's early. I
really appreciate your interest

00:45:25.389 --> 00:45:30.528
this morning. And Collin and I
will be hanging out if you want

00:45:30.528 --> 00:45:32.530
