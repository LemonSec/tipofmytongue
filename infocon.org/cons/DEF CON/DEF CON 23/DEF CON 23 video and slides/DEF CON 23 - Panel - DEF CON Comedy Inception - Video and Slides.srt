00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.974
Let's do this. So I am a former
panelist for what was known as

00:00:06.974 --> 00:00:12.613
the DEFCON comedy jam, otherwise
known as the fail panel. This is

00:00:12.613 --> 00:00:17.584
not the fail panel. It's really
close, though. So the fail panel

00:00:17.584 --> 00:00:20.254
went away. We decided it was
time for it to go away but I

00:00:20.254 --> 00:00:25.058
wanted to carry the torch. Now
the panelist has become the

00:00:25.058 --> 00:00:28.462
moderator. Hence inception.
We're working towards inception.

00:00:28.462 --> 00:00:35.602
We've gone one level deep. We
have a bunch of folks that I

00:00:35.602 --> 00:00:38.705
thought when I was going to
submit the CSP would make a

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:43.010
great part of the resurrected
formerly, what was known as the

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.914
fail panel, now the DEFCON
comedy inception. We'll see what

00:00:46.914 --> 00:00:52.419
we call this as we go. We're
going to have lots of fun. Not

00:00:52.419 --> 00:00:55.689
much has changed. We're here to
poke fun at the industry, poke

00:00:55.689 --> 00:01:01.161
fun at ourselves and troll
everyone while here. To my right

00:01:01.161 --> 00:01:07.167
in no particular order we have
Dan Tentler. Amanda Berlin.

00:01:15.709 --> 00:01:21.715
Chris Sistrunk. Chris Blow. Ill
will Genovese and yours truly.

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.964
Larry Pesce. There are a couple
of panelists this is their first

00:01:36.964 --> 00:01:42.970
time on stage at DEFCON. It's
time to drink. Cyber. I brought

00:01:47.841 --> 00:01:53.847
the good stuff. Amanda, into the
mic. Get it close to your face,

00:02:15.435 --> 00:02:21.441
just like in the rest area. All
right? All right. So Chris,

00:02:24.177 --> 00:02:28.882
Amanda, Will, and Chris,
technically you spoke earlier at

00:02:28.882 --> 00:02:32.486
this Con but it's the first time
here, so drink up. Dan, would

00:02:32.486 --> 00:02:39.760
you be so kind as to pass those
down. I wouldn't ask you to do

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:45.766
anything that I wouldn't do and
we'll get back to that. Cheers.

00:02:51.505 --> 00:02:57.511
>> Cheers. >> Cheers. To fail.
Moving along. While we're here

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:07.087
we're going to be soliciting for
charity? >> Whose charity. >>

00:03:07.087 --> 00:03:10.357
Charity is out on the strip
somewhere soliciting already.

00:03:10.357 --> 00:03:16.363
Okay? All right. In previous
iterations of this panel, we've

00:03:18.965 --> 00:03:23.136
made waffles on stage and all
sorts of other things. We wanted

00:03:23.136 --> 00:03:25.839
something different because
we're different. We're doing hot

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:29.309
sauce tasting for charity. I
have two varieties of hot sauce

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:35.582
that we'll get to in a minute.
Consider that, we're going to do

00:03:35.582 --> 00:03:39.186
hot sauce tasting for charity.
If you have to donate something

00:03:39.186 --> 00:03:45.192
for charity, some of this stuff
is hot, consider the value of

00:03:48.695 --> 00:03:53.033
the antidote. If you can't -- we
have four gallons of milk and

00:03:53.033 --> 00:03:55.168
four loaves of bread. We have
you covered. That said I won't

00:03:55.168 --> 00:04:01.108
ask you to do anything I
wouldn't do. When we initially

00:04:07.681 --> 00:04:10.951
talked about doing this panel we
talked about doing donations for

00:04:10.951 --> 00:04:17.791
the electronic frontier
foundation and hackers for

00:04:17.791 --> 00:04:24.464
charity. I made the executive
decision earlier, we changed the

00:04:24.464 --> 00:04:32.205
charity that we're going to
donate to. How many of you know

00:04:32.205 --> 00:04:35.075
this guy? This is DJ Rantz.
He been in our community for

00:04:35.075 --> 00:04:41.281
many years. He does lots of fun
things for us on stage. Spinning

00:04:41.281 --> 00:04:44.151
all sorts of music and he loves
this community. And in fact the

00:04:44.151 --> 00:04:46.153
community loves him. Are you
here, Rantz? That's okay. I

00:04:46.153 --> 00:04:48.522
talked to DJ Rantz last night
and Rantz is in an interesting

00:04:48.522 --> 00:04:50.690
position. I would consider Rantz
a good friend even though I

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:53.860
don't know him that well. Just
because he is a member of our

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.196
family as hackers and Rantz was
recently diagnosed with

00:04:56.196 --> 00:04:58.198
pancreatic cancer. Undergoing
multiple rounds of chemo. I

00:04:58.198 --> 00:05:00.400
talked to him and he said this
is okay. It's sharing a

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.402
different kind of information.
Rantz was diagnosed with

00:05:02.402 --> 00:05:04.404
pancreatic cancer. This is often
a death sentence. There are

00:05:04.404 --> 00:05:06.406
people that do survive and we
really hope that Rantz is one of

00:05:06.406 --> 00:05:08.408
those people. So in honor of all
that Rantz does for our

00:05:08.408 --> 00:05:10.577
community and to show our love
for DJ Rantz we are going to in

00:05:10.577 --> 00:05:12.579
fact collect donations for
Pancan.org, the pancreatic

00:05:12.579 --> 00:05:14.581
research center. I have done
work with these folks in the

00:05:14.581 --> 00:05:16.583
past. They have worked with all
our legal folks and our other

00:05:16.583 --> 00:05:18.585
charitable organizations to help
fund pancreatic cancer research

00:05:18.585 --> 00:05:20.587
or some cure or ability to
prolong or better the life for

00:05:20.587 --> 00:05:22.589
those diagnosed. I hate to bring
this on a downer to begin with

00:05:22.589 --> 00:05:24.591
but we really love Rantz. Me
personally, and no, not like

00:05:24.591 --> 00:05:26.593
that. Except for that one DEFCON
when gave me my first ever white

00:05:26.593 --> 00:05:32.599
Russian maid in a hotel room. So
Rantz, this one is for you,

00:06:46.906 --> 00:06:50.944
buddy. >> All right. Here's the
blanket statement. Tasting this

00:06:50.944 --> 00:06:54.714
hot sauce is at your own risk.
I'm not going to make you sign a

00:06:54.714 --> 00:07:00.253
waiver. Don't be dumb. This
stuff is hot. We have one that

00:07:00.253 --> 00:07:05.458
is a ridiculous amount of skull
units. We have toothpicks. Why?

00:07:05.458 --> 00:07:10.931
Because some of these you may
want just a little. And then

00:07:10.931 --> 00:07:14.134
again I said I wouldn't ask you
to do anything I wouldn't do

00:07:14.134 --> 00:07:20.140
myself. So bear with me one
second. Here is where you

00:07:22.375 --> 00:07:28.381
(trailed off ...) >> Don't die,
bro. >> We have two versions of

00:07:32.852 --> 00:07:37.891
hot sauce. This is homemade
green zombie hot sauce from our

00:07:37.891 --> 00:07:43.463
garden last season made from
green tomatoes and other secret

00:07:43.463 --> 00:07:49.469
stuff. This is the hot one.
Figures I should have opened the

00:07:51.671 --> 00:07:58.812
toothpicks first. Don't spill
it, bro. Don't fuck it up. Hey,

00:07:58.812 --> 00:08:05.618
I fucked that up. No, that's the
other one. >> Audience

00:08:05.618 --> 00:08:10.790
participation, stick your dick
in it. >> That's the not hot

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:16.796
one. That's the not hot one. >>
I'll ding you all day. >> I

00:08:19.733 --> 00:08:26.940
can't remember the character
name. Breaking Bad. Hector. This

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:32.946
is the really hot one. Note this
is the cap. This is not the

00:08:36.483 --> 00:08:42.088
bottle. Yes, there's a little
bit on there. That stuff. For

00:08:42.088 --> 00:08:48.094
those that don't know, Dan makes
his own pepper stuff that is

00:08:54.567 --> 00:09:02.075
amazing. >> That's good. >> This
is not fuck around hot. >> Oh my

00:09:02.075 --> 00:09:07.947
god, no. Put the top back on. If
you get that stuff on your

00:09:07.947 --> 00:09:14.087
hands, don't touch your private
areas. >> Or do. >> Or anyone

00:09:14.087 --> 00:09:20.126
else's privates unless you hate
them. >> We don't judge. >> We

00:09:20.126 --> 00:09:24.297
just film. >> All right. But if
you do let us know. >> Let me

00:09:24.297 --> 00:09:30.303
get my camera. >> So it's time
for the kick. So we can go get

00:09:32.505 --> 00:09:36.443
started with all this fun stuff
and get you guys to laugh. Don't

00:09:36.443 --> 00:09:39.646
forget to drink. While these
guys are starting to talk, I'm

00:09:39.646 --> 00:09:42.582
going to get the hot sauce and
other fun stuff ready. I'll be

00:09:42.582 --> 00:09:46.052
down at the far end of the stage
and have a place to give

00:09:46.052 --> 00:09:52.225
donations and try some hot sauce
and have a good time. Let's get

00:09:52.225 --> 00:09:56.062
in the van and get ready to jump
off the bridge. Who wants to go

00:09:56.062 --> 00:09:59.165
first? >> We think we elected
Dan to go first. >> We think we

00:09:59.165 --> 00:10:05.171
elected Dan to go first. >> If I
knew it was going to be that

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:13.446
kind of party I would have stuck
my dick in the mashed potatoes.

00:10:16.249 --> 00:10:20.320
>> Dan, I guess you're up. >>
All right. You're coming up

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:25.191
here, buddy. >> He is vastly
unprepared. >> Did we neglect to

00:10:25.191 --> 00:10:31.197
tell you that. Don't fuck it up.
>> I plan on it. >> Dan, did you

00:10:33.933 --> 00:10:39.772
not know we were doing a panel
and stuff? This is the part

00:10:39.772 --> 00:10:45.778
where we troll you. >> Fuck. >>
Oh shit. >> Amanda what is this

00:10:49.582 --> 00:10:52.619
pink thing you have in front of
you, higher, higher. >> This.

00:10:52.619 --> 00:10:58.625
This is my sexist ban hammer of
doom. There is a bolt on one

00:11:01.161 --> 00:11:08.868
side and a dick on the other.
You can be knighted as sexist.

00:11:08.868 --> 00:11:11.838
>> You can be knighted. Will
Will be knighted in 30 seconds.

00:11:15.108 --> 00:11:18.011
>> I found this app Gircon in
the hotel room when we checked

00:11:18.011 --> 00:11:25.118
in. It made it through four
Cons. >> Was it decorated. >>

00:11:25.118 --> 00:11:29.522
I'm pretty sure not. I'm sure I
just ruined some little girl's

00:11:29.522 --> 00:11:34.928
something. >> A pretty princess
hammer. >> The vein work is nice

00:11:34.928 --> 00:11:40.934
though. >> Very crooked. >> Does
it work? >> So. Why, me first?

00:11:59.852 --> 00:12:02.488
>> This is going to be the best
transcript ever. I hope you

00:12:02.488 --> 00:12:07.860
brought helmets because you need
them. I'm going to channel

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:14.734
George Caroline. Anybody go to
Bruce's talk this morning? It's

00:12:14.734 --> 00:12:20.039
going to be that. Larry comes to
me and says we want you on this

00:12:20.039 --> 00:12:23.509
panel. Cool. What's the panel.
The fail panel. I said I have

00:12:23.509 --> 00:12:27.447
the perfect thing. For folks
that aren't aware of the

00:12:27.447 --> 00:12:31.417
research I've done which I
suspect is everyone in the room.

00:12:31.417 --> 00:12:35.221
I have made a habitual problem
of going and finding stupid

00:12:35.221 --> 00:12:39.459
bullshit on the internet that
shouldn't be on the internet and

00:12:39.459 --> 00:12:44.430
ranting about it at conferences
for the last 3 or 4 years. It

00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:48.401
will happen. It's DEFCON. This
is why I came in with a mask.

00:12:48.401 --> 00:12:55.241
Over the last 4 years I've done
a series of talks at a variety

00:12:55.241 --> 00:12:57.677
of conferences where I poke fun
at the different things I found

00:12:57.677 --> 00:13:04.784
connected to the internet and
there are things online that you

00:13:04.784 --> 00:13:09.355
will do the whole Jackie Chan
what the fuck meme face over and

00:13:09.355 --> 00:13:17.263
over. The title is the stupid
things you put on the internet.

00:13:17.263 --> 00:13:23.269
Get me a drink. About me, nobody
cares. Thank you sir. Cheers. If

00:13:25.438 --> 00:13:31.477
there can be a thing, and you
can put a web server on the

00:13:31.477 --> 00:13:35.548
thing, should you put a web
server on the thing? >> Yes. >>

00:13:35.548 --> 00:13:39.652
Yes. >> Let me introduce to
tonight  fucking mascot,

00:13:39.652 --> 00:13:46.159
toast magost. Fuck it, we'll do
it live. Some of you may

00:13:46.159 --> 00:13:53.499
remember my 2014 Twitter rampage
pirate ninja thing I did at

00:13:53.499 --> 00:14:00.373
DEFCON 20. My firehose showdown
talk where I did stuff like

00:14:00.373 --> 00:14:03.876
this. Why the fuck is a TV
station online and I can get to

00:14:03.876 --> 00:14:06.546
it? Why would you give me
control of a fucking television

00:14:06.546 --> 00:14:10.983
station? Why. Who is high and
why aren't they sharing?

00:14:10.983 --> 00:14:16.989
Something German. I dont
know. What the fuck? Drink.

00:14:21.094 --> 00:14:27.633
Windows EE, why? What are you
doing? >> Does that say washing.

00:14:27.633 --> 00:14:33.039
>> That's my stuff. Oh my god,
asterisk, anyone want to make

00:14:33.039 --> 00:14:38.344
phone calls. I bet we can guess
the password. Let's fuck with

00:14:38.344 --> 00:14:42.949
Korea. They're generating power.
Let's fuck with them. Push the

00:14:42.949 --> 00:14:49.288
button and make some news. It's
a really fucking boring Mac

00:14:49.288 --> 00:14:55.294
desktop. Who gives a fuck. Wait
a minute, I wasn't the first one

00:15:00.366 --> 00:15:03.436
here. I wasn't the first one
here either but it looks like

00:15:03.436 --> 00:15:07.373
you can get some ssh keys off
this guy, that is cool. BJMY2

00:15:07.373 --> 00:15:13.613
host source. That is fun.
Anybody been to the dentist

00:15:13.613 --> 00:15:17.049
lately because we can go back
and learn about drilling people

00:15:17.049 --> 00:15:22.488
in the skull. You can write some
python if that's your thing.

00:15:22.488 --> 00:15:27.593
Really angry python that makes
real developers upset. This just

00:15:27.593 --> 00:15:33.599
hurt my face. I don't know what
to say about it. I don't know

00:15:35.635 --> 00:15:43.109
what to say about it. VNC that's
cool. What? Love stage. Where?

00:15:43.109 --> 00:15:48.014
>> Enhance. >> Enhance.
Apparently I can't read. >> Is

00:15:48.014 --> 00:15:55.021
this CSI cyber. >> My brain is
melting. Second column third one

00:15:55.021 --> 00:16:00.960
down. Love stage bang bang. Well
caught. Should we usurp the

00:16:04.897 --> 00:16:11.804
mascot. You can go to college
here if you want. 702, actually

00:16:11.804 --> 00:16:16.475
702 is this area code. Shit. I
didn't notice that before. It's

00:16:16.475 --> 00:16:20.646
Las Vegas. >> That may be the
love stage bang bang. >> Anyone

00:16:20.646 --> 00:16:24.617
know what happens if skate
equipment takes a selfie. It

00:16:24.617 --> 00:16:28.988
might look like that. A picture
of building in which system

00:16:28.988 --> 00:16:36.195
exists. Now I can find it on
Google maps. Another host. This

00:16:36.195 --> 00:16:42.568
one was lonely. HTTP load
testers. Give the public access

00:16:42.568 --> 00:16:47.073
to test things. HTTP server.
This is pre-configured to deny

00:16:47.073 --> 00:16:52.311
service. Bing, well done, good
job? >> Don't they do that

00:16:52.311 --> 00:16:59.452
themselves already? >> Maybe. So
you can find solar bullshits on

00:16:59.452 --> 00:17:02.989
the internet. This could be
cool. I'm not sure. I haven't

00:17:02.989 --> 00:17:04.991
spent a lot of time playing with
it. >> Did you say you didn't

00:17:04.991 --> 00:17:07.894
spend a lot of time playing with
it. >> Probably way too much.

00:17:07.894 --> 00:17:15.635
Many mornings until 5 a.m. This
guy played with it more time.

00:17:15.635 --> 00:17:23.576
Setting up MATLAB to track
sports bowl. If you travel to

00:17:23.576 --> 00:17:26.045
Sidney in the future, there is a
dessert place I can recommend

00:17:26.045 --> 00:17:32.051
and another place you can buy
squid. Squid on the internet.

00:17:34.387 --> 00:17:39.225
Why is there fucking squid on
the internet. The fucks love, oh

00:17:39.225 --> 00:17:46.599
my god, what is that. You are
amazing. This is good. Crowd

00:17:46.599 --> 00:17:49.468
sourcing the fuckery. If you
want to buy some avocados I have

00:17:49.468 --> 00:17:55.474
a place or really piss off some
dude. Right? This goes on for

00:17:59.645 --> 00:18:04.317
... >> There are certain times I
wouldn't want the lights to

00:18:04.317 --> 00:18:08.888
automatically come on. >> Some
of these are ridiculous. A guest

00:18:08.888 --> 00:18:13.693
room and TV room and game room
and hearth. I want these

00:18:13.693 --> 00:18:21.400
problems. A chest of drawers. A
fireplace on the internet,

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:29.008
that's fucking smart. Oh my god.
Okay. Full disclosures. Who

00:18:29.008 --> 00:18:31.010
knows Dave Maner? Oh shit, one
guy. Me and that guy and Dave

00:18:31.010 --> 00:18:37.016
Maner had a show down race on
the internet this year or late

00:18:41.887 --> 00:18:47.893
last year. I forget. You're
going to love this. CSI cyber,

00:18:50.329 --> 00:18:53.032
the Twitter account put a
question to the Twitter verse,

00:18:53.032 --> 00:18:57.903
can you set a fire using the
internet. To which several of us

00:18:57.903 --> 00:19:00.339
no shit jumped out of our chairs
and thought I'll take that

00:19:00.339 --> 00:19:06.278
fucking challenge. Really?
Challenge accepted. And we began

00:19:06.278 --> 00:19:11.984
a Twitter race. We found for the
next three hours just the most

00:19:11.984 --> 00:19:17.623
bat shit random crap you could
find. If John is here, everybody

00:19:17.623 --> 00:19:19.992
should point to John and tell
him how amazing he is. Without

00:19:19.992 --> 00:19:23.195
him he wouldn't be able to do
half this stuff. >> Don't forget

00:19:23.195 --> 00:19:29.201
we have hot sauce up here. Don't
stick your dick in it, please.

00:19:33.873 --> 00:19:38.310
>> You can. I will pay you. >>
If you stick your dick in it,

00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:41.480
you have to eat all of it. >>
John should have named it show

00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:48.587
Dan Tentler. Right? People think
that I'm the guy that made it

00:19:48.587 --> 00:19:52.358
because I'm Dan and it's show
Dan and they put two and two

00:19:52.358 --> 00:19:56.295
together. And I have to tell
them, no, I wish I was that

00:19:56.295 --> 00:20:02.835
clever with the code. I make
people like Paul M angry. I hear

00:20:02.835 --> 00:20:08.674
collusion. Things are happening?
>> If you want to give us money,

00:20:08.674 --> 00:20:12.778
you don't have to have hot
sauce. Just saying. >> It's not

00:20:12.778 --> 00:20:17.183
really giving us money. >> You
can give me all your money,

00:20:17.183 --> 00:20:23.189
also. >> We should invest in
Rantz's cyber pancreas. Right.

00:20:26.192 --> 00:20:32.565
On that note, here is a cyber
car wash. >> Why? Why. Oil

00:20:32.565 --> 00:20:38.771
change. Great. Yeah. That's
fucking smart. Somebody sat down

00:20:38.771 --> 00:20:43.209
and decided I need my oil tanks
on the internet. It's the

00:20:43.209 --> 00:20:49.215
future. This is how it must be.
Who knows where ride Pier is?

00:20:59.658 --> 00:21:02.995
This one I posted before.
Anybody remember this one? The

00:21:02.995 --> 00:21:07.767
friendliest -- on the internet.
This is a caviar cannery in

00:21:07.767 --> 00:21:13.772
Sweden and this made news in
Sweden and other various

00:21:15.941 --> 00:21:22.948
component of Europe. England,
Europe, same thing, whatever. I

00:21:22.948 --> 00:21:28.954
only have two firing neurons and
they're making me drink. You're

00:21:31.157 --> 00:21:37.163
behind. So, yes, fun times. This
one? We'll make sure it stays

00:21:49.275 --> 00:21:55.281
warm for you. Can anybody read
Swedish? I hear Bork, Bork. It

00:22:00.586 --> 00:22:05.925
involves temperatures and pumps.
This is cooler. It's a coal

00:22:05.925 --> 00:22:10.496
mine. Why would you -- why would
you let me play with a coal

00:22:10.496 --> 00:22:17.503
mine? What's better than playing
with coal mines? >> I can think

00:22:17.503 --> 00:22:23.742
of a lot of things. >> Potato
technology. This was part of my

00:22:23.742 --> 00:22:29.381
pirate baby cabana battle 2014.
Crazy bat shit raged silliness

00:22:29.381 --> 00:22:33.686
on Twitter after my panel with
Paul M and Rob last year. We

00:22:33.686 --> 00:22:39.959
scanned the internet live on
stage and had 3600JPEG at

00:22:39.959 --> 00:22:43.729
random. And I picked up the
interesting stuff and put it on

00:22:43.729 --> 00:22:46.198
Twitter and got a lot of
attention. This is one. I had no

00:22:46.198 --> 00:22:51.937
idea and I had no idea what it
was. Until someone said it's

00:22:51.937 --> 00:22:57.943
potato climate control. Now you
can be very comfortable counting

00:23:00.479 --> 00:23:06.018
potatoes. Right. Here is an
Italian hydroelectric plant that

00:23:06.018 --> 00:23:12.024
is generating -- >>
1.21Gigawatts. >> There is one

00:23:15.361 --> 00:23:21.367
line that says 1 --> 087 Kilowatts.
1.087Gigawatta. This one is the

00:23:30.209 --> 00:23:36.548
same thing. But this is in
Swedish I think or maybe Dutch.

00:23:36.548 --> 00:23:39.818
Looks like an electrical relay
station. Same deal. Why in the

00:23:39.818 --> 00:23:43.355
fuck would you let me into your
electrical relay station over

00:23:43.355 --> 00:23:48.460
the internet. >> Is that the Uni
vision logo? >> In door energy

00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:55.734
control. >> Hey Dan, If you got
in would you know what to do

00:23:55.734 --> 00:24:01.674
with it when you got in? >> Dan
never knows what to do when he

00:24:04.910 --> 00:24:08.180
gets in. >> I know nothing. Why
did you let me up here. Prank

00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:12.184
caller, prank caller. Anybody?
You can schedule a meeting in a

00:24:12.184 --> 00:24:19.858
conference room. There is a
portrait project at 8 a.m. This

00:24:19.858 --> 00:24:24.063
is fun. Who was at Smoocon the
last 2 years. Do you remember MS

00:24:24.063 --> 00:24:28.701
paint as a service. You can do
it over the internet. This is a

00:24:28.701 --> 00:24:32.204
hotel lobby sign on the
inter-fect directly essential to

00:24:32.204 --> 00:24:38.210
the public. What if we said
Ebola outbreak? I am not a ham

00:24:45.818 --> 00:24:51.357
radio ultra nerd. I know enough
to make real radio nerds angry.

00:24:51.357 --> 00:24:53.692
Apparently you can run a
repeater off a raspberry buy.

00:24:53.692 --> 00:24:59.698
Here is another one. It's like a
hotel lobby, but it's an office

00:25:08.474 --> 00:25:14.947
directory. Same deal. Whose
pants do you want to make brown

00:25:14.947 --> 00:25:20.953
today? What can brown do for
you? Jenkin's script with VMC on

00:25:25.090 --> 00:25:32.798
top. You can try boats if you
want. I'm not a boat guy. You

00:25:32.798 --> 00:25:37.770
can watch people day trade. This
is -- right? You want to get

00:25:37.770 --> 00:25:41.473
some insider information from
some guy who is broadcasting

00:25:41.473 --> 00:25:45.978
everything to the world or watch
his solar system capture power.

00:25:45.978 --> 00:25:49.815
That is cool. Yeah, power. I'm
not sure what evil stuff you can

00:25:49.815 --> 00:25:52.885
do with the power stuff except
maybe the battery. The dude in

00:25:52.885 --> 00:25:58.891
the pink helmet can help you.
Holy shit a guy brought a

00:26:05.364 --> 00:26:11.470
helmet. One guy put on a helmet.
That dude is prepared. What is

00:26:11.470 --> 00:26:17.075
this? I feel left out. More
hotel lobbies. This is an office

00:26:17.075 --> 00:26:23.081
building lobby. Another -- >>
Drink. >> Next. >> Keep going.

00:26:26.785 --> 00:26:32.791
>> Oh god. So the echoplex is
going to have a bad time. For

00:26:32.791 --> 00:26:38.130
the sake of convenience, you see
people that will put their

00:26:38.130 --> 00:26:42.234
security workstation like the
type of place you walk into that

00:26:42.234 --> 00:26:45.904
has dudes working the counter
with security stuff happening

00:26:45.904 --> 00:26:51.910
and they manage the cameras and
the badge readers. Say again?

00:26:56.148 --> 00:26:59.685
You can or you can watch them on
VMC because it's fucking

00:26:59.685 --> 00:27:06.959
publicly accessible. I'm not a
red it editor. Here is somebody

00:27:06.959 --> 00:27:11.163
you can mess with. A dude on
Reddit who is broadcasting his

00:27:11.163 --> 00:27:13.165
desktop. I have a funny story
about the massive diesel

00:27:13.165 --> 00:27:19.171
generators. A friend of mine did
a security audit for a power

00:27:21.206 --> 00:27:27.212
generation company and these
things for the sake of emissions

00:27:29.648 --> 00:27:35.187
have urea pumped into the
exhaust area? You gonna

00:27:35.187 --> 00:27:38.790
love it. >> What is pumped? >>
Urea. And similar to another

00:27:38.790 --> 00:27:44.796
slide, you can open the valve
and fill the exhaust manifold

00:27:51.603 --> 00:27:57.609
that drowns the generator. Urea
is the component in urine and

00:27:57.609 --> 00:28:02.347
you can literally blast it with
piss or make it rain at least

00:28:02.347 --> 00:28:08.353
for people that are really
short. Sprinklers on the

00:28:10.756 --> 00:28:15.627
internet. I forgot one thing.
There were curtains. You can

00:28:15.627 --> 00:28:20.899
find curtains on the internet,
too. That is fiendish I'm sure.

00:28:20.899 --> 00:28:24.903
Functioning curtains that open
and close. Computer controlled

00:28:24.903 --> 00:28:28.774
curtains. You can open the
curtains and switch to manual

00:28:28.774 --> 00:28:35.981
mode. Japanese radio ham thing
that I found. I don't know if

00:28:35.981 --> 00:28:40.652
they're using ham radio as the
back hall for the networking but

00:28:40.652 --> 00:28:46.925
I guess. I was -- I sadly can't
reed. What does it do. Holy shit

00:28:46.925 --> 00:28:52.931
a thing in Japan that lets nerds
talk to each other over the

00:28:57.803 --> 00:29:03.742
internet. Who thought? Maybe
Travis thought of it. The AVG is

00:29:06.912 --> 00:29:13.085
cool. He didn't find any
threats. I ask again, did

00:29:13.085 --> 00:29:18.523
anybody go to Bruce's talk about
risk? Because like, no threats,

00:29:18.523 --> 00:29:21.526
no you're virus clear. That is
cool. I can look at all of your

00:29:21.526 --> 00:29:27.532
pictures of Chiara and somebody
else. I don't know if this was

00:29:29.635 --> 00:29:32.638
on purpose or if this was
because management people need

00:29:32.638 --> 00:29:36.174
to watch Indian swapping for
massive networking equipment but

00:29:36.174 --> 00:29:40.779
there is that on the internet
too. I don't know what an oil

00:29:40.779 --> 00:29:44.383
celery is. You may not want to
tell the world about them or

00:29:44.383 --> 00:29:50.188
where they are. Or how much oil
they have. To make anybody,

00:29:50.188 --> 00:29:56.194
anybody do medical stuff here?
One guy. Check this out. Yeah.

00:29:58.597 --> 00:30:03.168
Fun shit, right. You're going to
say, but, all the fucking nay

00:30:03.168 --> 00:30:07.873
sayers, it's a demo. What are
you doing. Do you see that

00:30:07.873 --> 00:30:12.110
little thing on the top corner,
it's a demo. Fuck you I had a

00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:16.214
real one with 16 live hospital
patients. Come at me, bro. Why?

00:30:16.214 --> 00:30:22.220
Why? And you know what the
fucked up part about this one

00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:25.691
is, this is RDP, background on
the desktop, you RDP into a host

00:30:25.691 --> 00:30:28.093
and it gives you a login window
over the background. You drag

00:30:28.093 --> 00:30:34.099
the login window off the screen
and you see this full frame. You

00:30:39.471 --> 00:30:42.507
didn't have to authenticate it
to the box. You can just sit

00:30:42.507 --> 00:30:50.382
there and watch. HIPAA. Tell me
these guys weren compliant.

00:30:50.382 --> 00:30:52.384
Tell me they didnt spend a
million dollars a year on

00:30:52.384 --> 00:30:54.553
auditors to come in and fix
their shit? >> Back up one

00:30:54.553 --> 00:31:00.559
slide. >> That one? >> A
hospital bed or a fucking

00:31:00.559 --> 00:31:04.463
hospital bed? >> Ooh, Heart rate
will tell you. >> Depends on the

00:31:04.463 --> 00:31:10.469
person. >> What is that? >> Why
do you spoil everything for me?

00:31:13.105 --> 00:31:19.144
This is cool. I can't tell if
it's a giant Lipo battery but

00:31:19.144 --> 00:31:23.682
you can control it from your
iPhone. The icon in the bottom

00:31:23.682 --> 00:31:28.820
right, the door, this means it's
a touch panel. There's a lot of

00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:30.989
these things on the internet.
The schematic HMI stuff and the

00:31:30.989 --> 00:31:36.695
things that Chris will get into
is all weird bullshit tuck panel

00:31:36.695 --> 00:31:42.467
stuff. These touch panels people
buy and put on walls to control

00:31:42.467 --> 00:31:46.671
things you can VMC in sometimes
would you tell us no credential.

00:31:46.671 --> 00:31:54.646
So this is another what appears
to be really boring Mac VNC

00:31:54.646 --> 00:32:01.686
desktop except not. This one.
And it's the same fucking guy.

00:32:01.686 --> 00:32:09.394
If you look at the name ... It's
the same guy. Where is threat

00:32:09.394 --> 00:32:13.799
butt. I need you, threat butt.
>> Sounds like a personal

00:32:13.799 --> 00:32:19.538
problem. >> No. That is a
personal problem. That is a

00:32:19.538 --> 00:32:24.209
fucking personal problem. What
are you doing. This is Chris'

00:32:24.209 --> 00:32:28.213
slide. His first slide is a back
to the future slide. We're time

00:32:28.213 --> 00:32:34.219
traveling. >> Windows 98. >>
Just wait. Just wait. I got you

00:32:36.555 --> 00:32:41.460
better. It's not window's 98.
And it's dumber. Face slappingly

00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:47.299
dumber. No, just wait. There's
more cameras, too. GEO vision

00:32:47.299 --> 00:32:51.303
does coax and those dome camera
type deals that you see. That is

00:32:51.303 --> 00:32:56.341
cool. But these are boring so
you can get to this guy's DMV

00:32:56.341 --> 00:33:00.946
and watch movies on his tablet.
Or go to this Israeli pharmacy

00:33:00.946 --> 00:33:05.383
and order a bunch of drugs and
get really high. And then when

00:33:05.383 --> 00:33:12.190
you're done you can have Agua
power flushing, cheers! Net

00:33:12.190 --> 00:33:19.531
coffee sounds cool. I don't know
what it does but it has my

00:33:19.531 --> 00:33:26.204
attention. Really camera strike?
Holy shit counter strike 16,

00:33:26.204 --> 00:33:32.210
nice. Well spotted. Los pollos
ramanos. And speaking of crazy

00:33:36.114 --> 00:33:42.754
drug dealing people, here is
$300 --> 000. Right on. And here is

00:33:42.754 --> 00:33:46.458
an Italian something. I don't
know. I don't speak Italian. I

00:33:46.458 --> 00:33:50.428
stared at this thing and I have
no idea what this is. We can tap

00:33:50.428 --> 00:33:54.532
Chris with it. Chris isn't
paying attention? >> What? >>

00:33:54.532 --> 00:33:57.936
Other Chris. My camera is over
there. You didn't fucking wait.

00:33:57.936 --> 00:34:03.875
I can't count on you people for
anything, can I? Is that the

00:34:08.914 --> 00:34:15.687
Spanish mind craft sound. We
have Spanish mind craft. Phil is

00:34:15.687 --> 00:34:21.693
going to have a bad time. I
don't know. Like, I don't know,

00:34:23.828 --> 00:34:28.600
I don't know. You make me drink.
But then again you can feel

00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:34.306
better if you watch him enter a
game. The Italians like letting

00:34:34.306 --> 00:34:40.312
their -- team viewer licenses
lapse on their 408 Kilowatt

00:34:43.214 --> 00:34:47.686
hydroelectric generating
facility. But, you know, maybe

00:34:47.686 --> 00:34:49.688
you can forget about that by
fucking with these guy's

00:34:49.688 --> 00:34:54.960
sprinklers. If you're bored with
that, this is another hotel.

00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:59.831
This one is Oakland if anybody
is from the bay area. Voltage

00:34:59.831 --> 00:35:02.300
sensors are cool. Maybe there is
a camera or I can print circuit

00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:05.971
boards. Who wants to hack some
shit? Who needs Oda (ph.).

00:35:05.971 --> 00:35:11.977
Anybody go to Morgan. Morgan did
a presentation earlier today

00:35:20.218 --> 00:35:25.590
talking about attribution. We
can give them a bad time if you

00:35:25.590 --> 00:35:30.028
want. There is publicly
accessible to the internet. You

00:35:30.028 --> 00:35:34.366
can fuck some shit up that way.
Or make Spanish copies of stuff.

00:35:34.366 --> 00:35:41.973
All the people that were like
98, Windows 98. Windows 2 --> 000.

00:35:41.973 --> 00:35:47.979
Oh know, Windows 98 is bad. Holy
shit. Welcome to my world. It

00:35:52.117 --> 00:35:59.491
gets worse. It gets worse. Wait
for it. Wait. It's the same

00:35:59.491 --> 00:36:05.764
fucking guy. Again. Can you
point out the mistakes he made

00:36:05.764 --> 00:36:09.000
in his evil, evil hacks and
nefarious plots to overthrow the

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:15.006
internet. When is the last time
you saw system 32 on D operating

00:36:17.776 --> 00:36:23.782
system. 7 blah, blah, I explore
dot EXE on DOS, really? This is

00:36:28.753 --> 00:36:32.857
what we call our threat
landscape. Right. This is what

00:36:32.857 --> 00:36:38.229
we're up against. I'm going to
try to open IE on fucking Dos

00:36:38.229 --> 00:36:44.235
and why is Dos available VNC.
How did you sort that shit out.

00:36:48.807 --> 00:36:55.013
An FHS tunnel through time. What
the fuck. I'm going to print out

00:36:55.013 --> 00:36:57.849
a bunch of pore on this giant
printer and that will make me

00:36:57.849 --> 00:37:03.788
feel better. Providential.
Adjective, occurring at a

00:37:06.458 --> 00:37:10.728
favorable time. You can't make
this shit up. Same guy, I think,

00:37:10.728 --> 00:37:16.734
I think. Yep, same guy. On a
Japanese system. Mcafee is

00:37:26.945 --> 00:37:32.951
catching his shit. That's Mcafee
catching a kid doing some stuff.

00:37:41.659 --> 00:37:44.963
I think this is the same Korean
power generation plant. At this

00:37:44.963 --> 00:37:50.969
point -- this is No. 4. When
people go home after Con there

00:38:05.984 --> 00:38:08.386
is going to be a lot of shit to
play with. Especially more blind

00:38:08.386 --> 00:38:15.426
skinny (audio blipped) but
they're dumb. Or they have

00:38:15.426 --> 00:38:18.496
scripts that are blinding places
scripts into every open VMC

00:38:18.496 --> 00:38:20.899
place they can because that's
what it looks like is happening.

00:38:25.103 --> 00:38:32.610
Cubs win I guess. I don't know.
Sure. Like I said a lot of

00:38:32.610 --> 00:38:39.050
shouty arm waving, why. What the
hell. It's colorful times. There

00:38:39.050 --> 00:38:46.724
is big German reservoirs. >>
This is why German's don't play

00:38:46.724 --> 00:38:49.627
scrabble. >> I can't pronounce
that. This one does something. I

00:38:49.627 --> 00:38:57.302
don't know if it's Agua power
flushing. There is regular

00:38:57.302 --> 00:39:04.475
ordinary Swedish meal time, it's
a show, man. You dont know

00:39:04.475 --> 00:39:07.579
about regular ordinary Swedish
meal time. It's good for you.

00:39:07.579 --> 00:39:13.051
Right? But if that distracts
you, you can go back to the day

00:39:13.051 --> 00:39:16.054
traders again, because
apparently they ae really

00:39:16.054 --> 00:39:20.558
happy publishing other shit to
the internet in public.

00:39:20.558 --> 00:39:24.963
Something. If you guys got
something, it's measuring it in

00:39:24.963 --> 00:39:31.569
meters squared ... It's Polish.
That's cool. This talk is in

00:39:31.569 --> 00:39:38.810
English. I don't even know.
This, I got nothing -- right? >>

00:39:38.810 --> 00:39:44.816
Is it a map? >> Yes, it's a map.
It's a fucking potato. >> It's

00:39:48.152 --> 00:39:55.460
Apple maps man. >> Potato. I
will see your potato and raise

00:39:55.460 --> 00:40:01.866
you a hot parlor wash. >> Is
there a happy ending? >> Yes. >>

00:40:01.866 --> 00:40:07.939
Okay. >> How many fans of VSD
are there in the room? How many

00:40:07.939 --> 00:40:12.110
think it's like the gnarlliest
strongest operating system that

00:40:12.110 --> 00:40:18.116
is the most secure? >> Here is a
hint. >> What about now? Good

00:40:20.218 --> 00:40:26.057
job. Single user mode. No
security, nothing. VNC. What

00:40:26.057 --> 00:40:31.462
about now? Anybody lactose
intolerant. We can have you have

00:40:31.462 --> 00:40:35.533
a really bad time. Here is a
dairy plant this one does

00:40:35.533 --> 00:40:41.539
something involving cows. Wait
what? >> They're milking horses.

00:40:52.784 --> 00:40:55.853
Won't someone think of the
children. >> See the really,

00:40:55.853 --> 00:40:58.690
really interesting shit, the
really interesting shit is I had

00:40:58.690 --> 00:41:04.395
no idea that was there. I didn't
notice it. When I find this it's

00:41:04.395 --> 00:41:07.565
like 4 a.m. and I haven't slept.
And then I get on stage and I

00:41:07.565 --> 00:41:12.503
have all you guys to point out
all this stuff that I didn't

00:41:12.503 --> 00:41:16.541
notice the first time. and
its like version 2 for me,

00:41:16.541 --> 00:41:20.078
why the fuck is there a horse
setting on the dairy milk plant.

00:41:20.078 --> 00:41:26.084
Why is there a bull setting. >>
I think it's still considered

00:41:31.322 --> 00:41:36.127
milking. >> Cannibal says it's
hides and not milk. >> This is

00:41:36.127 --> 00:41:42.133
where your children's milk come
from in school. >> Standardized

00:41:44.435 --> 00:41:47.005
testing. That's what that was
about. No wonder they were

00:41:47.005 --> 00:41:51.142
pissed. I would be pissed, too
if they wanted to milk my kids

00:41:51.142 --> 00:41:56.647
at school. User -- whoever is
French in the room can pronounce

00:41:56.647 --> 00:42:02.587
that. That is -- good job. What
is it? Jenuo (ph.). Is that the

00:42:09.127 --> 00:42:15.133
same guy? >> No. >> Right. No
rag rats. Yeah. So one easy way

00:42:20.872 --> 00:42:26.044
to catch skids is leave VMC open
and open note pad. They will

00:42:26.044 --> 00:42:29.714
blindly shove whatever they have
into note pad and you can have

00:42:29.714 --> 00:42:37.021
it. Who knew that note pad could
be a honey pot. This is a no pad

00:42:37.021 --> 00:42:44.295
honey pot. Holy fuck. How much
do you have left? >> I can go

00:42:44.295 --> 00:42:48.733
faster. >> Go faster. >> Here is
a TV station that hasn't updated

00:42:48.733 --> 00:42:54.739
the team viewer license. A god
damn ATM. Why is there a camera

00:42:57.508 --> 00:43:00.478
there. A hydrogen fuel cell.
Mario is going to shit his pants

00:43:00.478 --> 00:43:04.182
when he sees this. Hes going
to confess to Luigi hes been

00:43:04.182 --> 00:43:07.051
taking shrooms the whole time.
He is going to turn off the --

00:43:07.051 --> 00:43:13.124
and the entire thing is going to
go down. The entire city of

00:43:13.124 --> 00:43:16.094
Downtown Copenhagen. The ice
rink is under there. Webcams,

00:43:16.094 --> 00:43:18.963
too expensive. Cheap cell
phones, better. Shady cops

00:43:18.963 --> 00:43:24.969
chasing you. Why. I found a
hydroelectric plant? >> Breathe.

00:43:42.620 --> 00:43:49.494
No, I dont need to breathe.
Too bad Anthony is not here. >>

00:43:49.494 --> 00:43:56.300
He was earlier. >> There is a
story with this picture. I'll

00:43:56.300 --> 00:43:58.870
try to tell it quickly. I found
this and put it on Twitter.

00:43:58.870 --> 00:44:04.809
Michael Toicker is like that is
totally legitimate. Look at that

00:44:09.113 --> 00:44:15.286
art. Now this is owned. You can
let the java run. You're java

00:44:15.286 --> 00:44:19.323
and want shells on my shit. No.
I promise it's okay. I spun the

00:44:19.323 --> 00:44:24.195
VM and I ran java and it said
megawatts and I said fuck. I put

00:44:24.195 --> 00:44:27.698
this picture on Twitter and the
next morning the DHS called me.

00:44:27.698 --> 00:44:33.704
It was like that. This guy is
like I'm going to have

00:44:33.704 --> 00:44:37.408
interesting people call you.
8:30 the next morning. My name

00:44:37.408 --> 00:44:44.282
is Anthony and I'm calling from
the DHS. It was bad. This plant

00:44:44.282 --> 00:44:48.486
stayed online for like a year. I
have a distinct memory of

00:44:48.486 --> 00:44:53.257
driving somewhere 6 months after
doing this presentation 3 or 4

00:44:53.257 --> 00:44:58.863
years ago and John is texts me
on Twitter and saying that plant

00:44:58.863 --> 00:45:04.435
is still up. What? Which one.
The FOMEL one. And he links me

00:45:04.435 --> 00:45:09.440
to it and it rendered on my
phone. We have a dam in your

00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:12.410
country that has flooded -- if
you Google barrage Damel it

00:45:12.410 --> 00:45:19.817
flooded people in the past.
They're like, we're on vacation,

00:45:19.817 --> 00:45:23.821
fuck off. No shit they were on
vacation and didn't want to fix

00:45:23.821 --> 00:45:28.459
it. Responsible disclosure kinda
works if they give a fuck and

00:45:28.459 --> 00:45:30.861
this place didn't give a fuck.
This place I didn't bother

00:45:34.398 --> 00:45:40.104
disclosing to. And neither did
this place. Up to three now. Now

00:45:40.104 --> 00:45:46.110
a switching station, so it's up
to four. And I give up. Fuck it,

00:45:48.412 --> 00:45:53.851
car washes. True. There is also
speakers which is really fun.

00:45:53.851 --> 00:45:56.187
Because you can send a rick roll
mp3 straight to them. It plays.

00:45:56.187 --> 00:45:59.790
That's good. How rich do you
have to be to have a fridge for

00:45:59.790 --> 00:46:04.295
the champagne and have the
champagne have an alarm. I want

00:46:04.295 --> 00:46:09.734
those problems, I dont want
these problems. That is CERN.

00:46:09.734 --> 00:46:16.774
They fixed it. I reported 200
something of these to their

00:46:16.774 --> 00:46:21.245
security department. At first
they said we're this big open

00:46:21.245 --> 00:46:26.484
system, and academics and
things. I said that's cool. But

00:46:26.484 --> 00:46:31.956
like, no. I shouldn't be able to
see this. Cool. That's fine.

00:46:31.956 --> 00:46:34.191
They fixed it and it was fine.
It was CERN and now I found

00:46:34.191 --> 00:46:41.766
these ski lifts. You can open
the doors and turn on the alarm,

00:46:41.766 --> 00:46:44.101
and I think, I can't remember,
shout at people through the PA.

00:46:44.101 --> 00:46:46.103
So you can send people up in a
gondola and stop the doors and

00:46:46.103 --> 00:46:52.109
shout get the fuck out. Right.
Why would you let me do this?

00:46:57.648 --> 00:47:05.256
Why? But this one is cool. I had
a personal interest in this one.

00:47:05.256 --> 00:47:10.328
I found a fishery in the oxford
covered market in England and I

00:47:10.328 --> 00:47:13.798
went and put my hand on it. It's
cool to find something on the

00:47:13.798 --> 00:47:17.068
internet and then touch it in
real space. Then I found

00:47:17.068 --> 00:47:19.437
something, lobsters. You can
fucking control the temperature

00:47:19.437 --> 00:47:25.443
of lobsters over the internet.
There is also swimming pools.

00:47:30.214 --> 00:47:36.053
That have acid tanks. That you
can control over the internet.

00:47:36.053 --> 00:47:42.226
What the -- why would you do
that? I'm going to take a

00:47:42.226 --> 00:47:47.698
breath, I will exercise George
Carlin and I want you all to

00:47:47.698 --> 00:47:51.302
consider the following. Stop
putting shit on the internet or

00:47:51.302 --> 00:47:57.007
at least count to ten before you
decide to do it. I'm out! >>

00:47:57.007 --> 00:48:03.080
Next. >> Ding. >> Ding. >> Holy
shit. >> You made me go first.

00:48:03.080 --> 00:48:07.985
>> I knew he should have gone
last. >> I look better in

00:48:07.985 --> 00:48:12.890
everything. Don't forget we have
hot sauce. We're at 300 bucks.

00:48:12.890 --> 00:48:17.795
>> Only 300. This room is not
really full. >> My name is

00:48:17.795 --> 00:48:22.700
Chris. If anybody could float I
think he could hover with all

00:48:22.700 --> 00:48:27.738
the energy he has. Chris is
drunk. Let's get cyber physical.

00:48:27.738 --> 00:48:33.744
If you don't recognize that guy,
that is Ralph Logner. Love you

00:49:00.271 --> 00:49:06.277
Ralph. If you read the report on
the reverse engineering of

00:49:20.324 --> 00:49:24.228
Sucksnet, he did it. Smart guy.
Let's talk about top ten cyber

00:49:24.228 --> 00:49:30.234
physical stunts first made
planes go sideways -- and then

00:49:36.207 --> 00:49:42.213
Charlie and Chris made a car go
sideways. What is next. Making

00:49:49.653 --> 00:49:55.659
elevators go sideways? >> It's
an elevator. Its a Wonkavator

00:50:11.742 --> 00:50:14.178
>> An elevator can only go up
and down but a Wonkavator can go

00:50:14.178 --> 00:50:17.581
sideways, and slant ways, and
long ways and back ways, and

00:50:17.581 --> 00:50:20.951
square ways. up ways and any
ways you can think of. It can

00:50:20.951 --> 00:50:25.055
take you to any room in the
factory by pressing one of these

00:50:25.055 --> 00:50:27.057
buttons. Any of these buttons.
Just press a button and zing

00:50:27.057 --> 00:50:33.063
you're off. Don't press this
one. Go ahead, Charlie. >> Me.

00:50:38.302 --> 00:50:44.308
>> Don't, Charlie. >> What the
fuck? No seriously there is an

00:50:53.117 --> 00:50:59.189
elevator that goes sideways.
Don't touch it if you find one.

00:50:59.189 --> 00:51:05.129
No. 9. Physical security fail.
This is at a substation. And

00:51:12.770 --> 00:51:19.043
this happens all over the place.
Also we -- I've seen where you

00:51:19.043 --> 00:51:22.880
have all the substations that
might have the same lock, well a

00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:26.383
substation had a homeless guy
living in it and he had a key.

00:51:33.157 --> 00:51:36.260
We have a relays and substations
and that's a picture of one. All

00:51:36.260 --> 00:51:41.732
around the world in America --
heres a picture of an attempt

00:51:41.732 --> 00:51:48.339
to do port security using a lead
meter seal. Yeah, that is real

00:51:48.339 --> 00:51:55.579
secure. There's a -- something
that got shot. In Arkansas that

00:51:55.579 --> 00:52:01.518
got set on fire, met calf. That
is a different one. That is Los

00:52:03.587 --> 00:52:10.694
Angeles. Yeah. Pretty serious
stuff. Physical security is a

00:52:10.694 --> 00:52:15.699
big fail. Pretty big fail. All
right. >> It's dangerous. Take

00:52:15.699 --> 00:52:20.938
this. >> All right. What is
this? Raspberry. That's fancy.

00:52:20.938 --> 00:52:26.944
Scams equals attacks. There is a
couple reports that came out on

00:52:30.314 --> 00:52:36.320
the news, scams from Iran to
these company's sensors and

00:52:39.990 --> 00:52:45.996
honey pots and they called them
attacks. And then a colleague of

00:52:59.410 --> 00:53:06.517
mine was scamming honey pots to
test the new NSE inmap script,

00:53:06.517 --> 00:53:11.655
and he was from Chattanooga and
there is a nation state there

00:53:11.655 --> 00:53:19.329
and it's called to the hilt.
There is an industrial control

00:53:19.329 --> 00:53:23.133
system with a serial port coming
out of it. No. 7. He kind of

00:53:23.133 --> 00:53:29.139
touched on this. Smartphone apps
that you can control systems

00:53:33.010 --> 00:53:38.916
with. >> What could possibly go
wrong? >> Well I have stories of

00:53:38.916 --> 00:53:44.922
things going wrong. A colleague
of mine, they had to go reimage

00:53:48.358 --> 00:53:52.996
all these machines at a glass
plant. What happened was the

00:53:52.996 --> 00:53:58.302
owner got a new iPad for
Christmas and put a Siemans app

00:53:58.302 --> 00:54:03.474
on there and optimize the
settings in the glass plant and

00:54:03.474 --> 00:54:09.480
everything quit working. She had
to go and reimage all of the may

00:54:13.417 --> 00:54:15.919
sheens back to three years ago
because that was the last image

00:54:15.919 --> 00:54:23.393
they had. And I've seen a
hospital, every hospital has a

00:54:23.393 --> 00:54:27.865
generator. They have a water
plant. And I've seen a hospital

00:54:27.865 --> 00:54:33.270
plant operator have control over
the water plant with a

00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:38.609
smartphone. Not a great idea at
all? >> What could possibly go

00:54:38.609 --> 00:54:46.083
wrong? >> Yeah. No. 6. Anonymous
FTP. First one, me and a couple

00:54:46.083 --> 00:54:49.319
other guys we do this in our
spare time. Research anonymous

00:54:49.319 --> 00:54:56.059
FTPs we found an engineer, maybe
not as dumb as me, maybe dumber.

00:54:56.059 --> 00:55:02.866
Power work laptop on his home
terra byte hard drive. We called

00:55:02.866 --> 00:55:09.339
him on an anonymous Google voice
number and said you have your

00:55:09.339 --> 00:55:11.708
work laptop backed up on the
internet. You should probably

00:55:11.708 --> 00:55:16.980
take it off. He was like what?
Who are you. You had one job.

00:55:20.584 --> 00:55:23.754
Don't bring it home and don't
put it on your anonymous FTP

00:55:23.754 --> 00:55:25.756
back up. We found a city in
Florida, backed up the entire

00:55:25.756 --> 00:55:32.362
Skata system for the electrical
grid and all of this on the

00:55:32.362 --> 00:55:35.199
grid. All of this is found on
Google. We called them and they

00:55:35.199 --> 00:55:38.235
finally took it down. It was
pretty serious. We found

00:55:38.235 --> 00:55:44.241
engineering companies had
schematic projects, all these

00:55:52.015 --> 00:55:55.519
different control systems,
prison control system where you

00:55:55.519 --> 00:56:01.358
could let the control system for
the doors open. We found the air

00:56:01.358 --> 00:56:05.729
force bases and found like the
Skiff. The top secret room where

00:56:05.729 --> 00:56:10.334
they meet. We found all the
plans for those and reported

00:56:10.334 --> 00:56:14.571
those in. That was wild. All
kind of thing that you can find

00:56:14.571 --> 00:56:20.510
on anonymous FTP. We had this
thing on Twitter called we are

00:56:20.510 --> 00:56:25.816
the artillery. We're finding
these on our own time and trying

00:56:25.816 --> 00:56:31.121
to get them taken down. Poor
architecture. Any rules,

00:56:31.121 --> 00:56:37.127
anybody? There's lots of those
-- >> CIS is precertified. >>

00:56:41.765 --> 00:56:46.770
Yes exactly right. We have lots
of problems in industrial

00:56:46.770 --> 00:56:50.107
control systems. Not in the
electric sector for these. They

00:56:50.107 --> 00:56:55.912
still have some failures, too.
Also Olan gas and water have

00:56:55.912 --> 00:57:01.852
flat networks. Not a very good
idea at all. And then No. 4.

00:57:04.621 --> 00:57:10.627
Squirrels. That's the No. 3
cause of power outages. No. 1 is

00:57:14.965 --> 00:57:20.971
acts of god like weather. Don't
listen to Jerico. Okay? Cyber

00:57:25.509 --> 00:57:29.112
squirrel one and mylar squirrel.
Follow those on Twitter and

00:57:29.112 --> 00:57:32.249
they'll tell you all the power
outages that is caused by

00:57:32.249 --> 00:57:34.985
squirrels, rabbits, snakes. >> I
have a picture of a nasty fried

00:57:34.985 --> 00:57:36.987
squirrel. >> Go faster. 30
minutes. >> Vendor excuses. A

00:57:36.987 --> 00:57:38.989
Twitter account that a friend
and me run. These are actual

00:57:38.989 --> 00:57:40.991
real excuses that we've gotten
from vendors after we found

00:57:40.991 --> 00:57:42.993
vulnerabilities in their stuff.
We decided the best course of

00:57:42.993 --> 00:57:44.995
action is to discontinue this
product. We reviewed the proof

00:57:44.995 --> 00:57:46.997
of conduct but the engineer says
the valid end point wouldn't

00:57:46.997 --> 00:57:48.999
send that. TVs an open source
project we use but do not fund

00:57:48.999 --> 00:57:51.001
or contribute to in any way. A
back door password was found, we

00:57:51.001 --> 00:57:53.003
changed it. Thank you. And
there's a whole treasure-trove

00:57:53.003 --> 00:57:55.005
of those that we put up on
vendor excuses. You can send

00:57:55.005 --> 00:58:00.944
your own vendor excuses. We have
the email set up. And this guy,

00:58:29.806 --> 00:58:33.076
ICS on the internet. When
somebody asks how you control

00:58:33.076 --> 00:58:39.082
system was breached. He found
this. >> Sorry but not sorry. >>

00:58:51.995 --> 00:58:58.001
Why I found more. But I'm not
going to go through all these. I

00:59:01.838 --> 00:59:05.342
have a few slides left. We found
-- wind turbines. I'm telling

00:59:05.342 --> 00:59:11.348
you. We found Houston's David
control center where you could

00:59:15.852 --> 00:59:21.992
look at their webcam and then
you could move and then someone

00:59:21.992 --> 00:59:28.732
moved it back. And -- >> Busted.
>> And then they had -- it's a

00:59:28.732 --> 00:59:33.303
real control system. And we
called them and told them to

00:59:33.303 --> 00:59:39.443
take that stuff offline. I don't
always connect my system to the

00:59:39.443 --> 00:59:45.449
internet but when I do I use ...
That is safe. And No. 1. That is

00:59:50.854 --> 00:59:54.257
Jack Daniel if you don't
recognize the guy. >> His bedder

00:59:54.257 --> 01:00:00.697
is in Iowa city. >> We had
15 --> 000 hackers at DEFCON last

01:00:00.697 --> 01:00:04.401
year and they went to the ICS
village. How many here have been

01:00:04.401 --> 01:00:10.073
there? Great. Awesome. We had a
bunch of people last year. What

01:00:10.073 --> 01:00:17.080
do they use to attack this
stuff. Birk, sweep. That means

01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:19.850
they're not using any of the
control system protocols at all.

01:00:19.850 --> 01:00:22.385
They were trying to attack
things that didn't really exist.

01:00:24.688 --> 01:00:28.191
Let's get them on the MOD bust.
We even have a cartoon. Robert

01:00:28.191 --> 01:00:35.265
Emily. We were teaching these
people about the protocols. We

01:00:35.265 --> 01:00:41.171
wrote a script called MOD turn
and it turns on the lights and

01:00:41.171 --> 01:00:47.177
turn up and turn down for what,
then you turn the lights off.

01:00:57.587 --> 01:01:03.660
That's all. I have some shout
outs to Adam Crain. Reverse ICS,

01:01:03.660 --> 01:01:11.001
Robert Emily, Mike tucker and my
SKATA brothers and my wife is

01:01:11.001 --> 01:01:16.273
somewhere here. There she is. I
love her. >> Anyways. Any time

01:01:16.273 --> 01:01:22.279
now. This is great. What the
hell, Larry. >> Anybody good

01:02:12.629 --> 01:02:18.635
with computers? >> There we go.
I fixed my shit. Anyways. I have

01:02:40.023 --> 01:02:46.029
to drink, again? Okay. That was
not my original drink. Okay. So

01:02:50.266 --> 01:02:55.605
as you can see, thanks to ill
will for making this slide for

01:02:55.605 --> 01:03:00.310
me. I appreciate it. It still
says Steven Spielberg and shit

01:03:00.310 --> 01:03:04.681
and I don't Photoshop at all.
There is my name. Along with my

01:03:04.681 --> 01:03:10.687
name, Chris -- that is really my
last name. I'm a technical

01:03:13.657 --> 01:03:20.797
adviser in Indiana. I have no --
I don't do anything really cool.

01:03:20.797 --> 01:03:24.701
But I love the profession that I
do. Certificates, I have none. I

01:03:24.701 --> 01:03:30.607
have no relation to Joe Blow or
Kurtis Blow I just want to get

01:03:30.607 --> 01:03:34.978
that out of the way now. Feel
free to follow me. You get to

01:03:34.978 --> 01:03:37.414
see stupid pictures of me
wearing wizard hat. Pictures of

01:03:37.414 --> 01:03:44.821
my dog or stuff that I make food
wise or see me drink. Usually

01:03:44.821 --> 01:03:50.827
drink. Follow me if you want.
Firewalls. Before I talk about

01:03:53.463 --> 01:03:57.567
that let's talk about Dan's
talk. It's a really good talk

01:03:57.567 --> 01:04:04.974
about failure. If you want to
see more failure after this. I

01:04:04.974 --> 01:04:07.610
don't think you can get more
than me talking up here. But I

01:04:07.610 --> 01:04:13.616
think it's another fail because
the link goes to a certain --

01:04:17.620 --> 01:04:19.622
[indiscernible] you get to see
this picture like this. More

01:04:19.622 --> 01:04:21.624
Dan, as if you didn't take up
enough fucking time up here? >>

01:04:21.624 --> 01:04:27.630
What do you want? I'm an
asshole. Didn't Dennis Leary do

01:04:31.968 --> 01:04:37.974
a song on this. >> Early 90s.
Let's get into some fails. I'm

01:04:41.444 --> 01:04:44.814
going to talk about a lot of
fails that I encountered myself

01:04:44.814 --> 01:04:48.384
over the past ten years or five.
A lot of these failures are ten

01:04:48.384 --> 01:04:55.692
plus years old. Going back to
Dan's bit. We're talking about

01:04:55.692 --> 01:04:58.161
international call center here.
Call centers all over the world.

01:04:58.161 --> 01:05:03.299
They wanted a typical pen test.
That means we want you to run

01:05:03.299 --> 01:05:11.241
end map and give a customer
report and make it look like you

01:05:11.241 --> 01:05:16.846
did more than you did. Scan our
stuff and give us a report and

01:05:16.846 --> 01:05:22.852
show us we're great and pass for
the year. As we continue on, I

01:05:25.088 --> 01:05:27.323
find out that these firewalls
are running over 90 percent

01:05:27.323 --> 01:05:30.727
saturation, and I don't feel
comfortable talking to these

01:05:30.727 --> 01:05:35.298
guys saying we're on a scoping
call. Do you really want me to

01:05:35.298 --> 01:05:41.471
do this during the day? Yes,
it's fine. We do this every

01:05:41.471 --> 01:05:46.576
year. I talk faster than ...
Okay. We got 90 percent

01:05:46.576 --> 01:05:51.114
saturation going on and I do a
firewall review and find out

01:05:51.114 --> 01:05:54.784
their operating system is 8
years old if not older. Between

01:05:54.784 --> 01:05:58.588
that, I took down an entire
international calling center by

01:05:58.588 --> 01:06:03.626
using M map. I dropped over
3 --> 000 calls and they were pissed

01:06:03.626 --> 01:06:06.763
off and they told me to scan
during the day. I'm on the phone

01:06:06.763 --> 01:06:10.867
with these executive people and
they're like what did you do. It

01:06:10.867 --> 01:06:16.406
was great. They had logging and
they had alerts that were set up

01:06:16.406 --> 01:06:21.077
to look at if a firewall was
running over 70 percent

01:06:21.077 --> 01:06:25.582
saturation, all of those were
disabled. And then we found open

01:06:25.582 --> 01:06:30.687
RDP. Also MS867 and absolutely
no DMZ. With all that said, and

01:06:30.687 --> 01:06:38.127
credentials were easy to find.
They are very angry with me

01:06:38.127 --> 01:06:40.597
still. Social engineering. When
I think of social engineering I

01:06:40.597 --> 01:06:43.967
think of the Social Engineering
Toolkit, thanks Dave Kennedy and

01:06:43.967 --> 01:06:47.570
all the folks at trusted sec. I
mean that wholeheartedly. I love

01:06:47.570 --> 01:06:53.309
that tool with all my heart and
love what Dave's done with it

01:06:53.309 --> 01:06:56.746
over the years. He is a great
guy. Awesome. When I think of

01:06:56.746 --> 01:07:00.216
Dave Kennedy I usually think of
clowns. I wish he was in the

01:07:00.216 --> 01:07:04.320
room but he is not. I need to
get that image of the box of

01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:07.357
social engineering tool kit from
him. So quick side note. This is

01:07:07.357 --> 01:07:14.063
what happens when I go and grab
that image from his site. If you

01:07:14.063 --> 01:07:18.001
want more detail. This stuff is
malicious and it comes from the

01:07:18.001 --> 01:07:20.003
site or whatever but I
downloaded anyway, because

01:07:20.003 --> 01:07:26.009
(audio blipped) and we needed to
do that anyway so? >> Were you

01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:38.621
using IE? >> Yes, what? Okay. So
for this next one, a financial

01:07:38.621 --> 01:07:41.291
institution. They bragged about
how they had InfoSec training

01:07:41.291 --> 01:07:47.297
and response training and set to
go and nothing was going to get

01:07:50.500 --> 01:07:57.206
past them. Say that I had you're
going to set up -- like a hey

01:07:57.206 --> 01:07:59.442
get a free iTunes gift card
email and stuff, they were like

01:07:59.442 --> 01:08:02.245
yea come at me, bro. By the time
we got to do I'm going to do,

01:08:02.245 --> 01:08:07.517
they were like holy shit you
can't do that. Do you want a

01:08:07.517 --> 01:08:11.554
real test or not? >> I feel
really sorry for the person

01:08:11.554 --> 01:08:16.025
transcribing that now. >> I'm
really sorry for whoever is it

01:08:16.025 --> 01:08:22.031
behind the keyboard (I'm real,
yes). >> Right there. I'm really

01:08:26.235 --> 01:08:32.241
sorry but I use the word shit
and fuck a lot. Keeping going.

01:08:40.750 --> 01:08:43.252
Do a little bit of research and
find out their VPN is out there

01:08:43.252 --> 01:08:45.788
in the open. Nothing special
about it. The place where this

01:08:45.788 --> 01:08:53.529
was happening, they had a bunch
of current weather events going

01:08:53.529 --> 01:08:57.834
on. Snowstorms and ice storms
and everything else. I put it in

01:08:57.834 --> 01:09:03.139
an email. Due to recent weather
events we're going to have more

01:09:03.139 --> 01:09:08.878
people work from home. Click on
this link. 78 percent, that was

01:09:08.878 --> 01:09:11.881
awesome. I got their entire
password history because people

01:09:11.881 --> 01:09:18.121
didn't think it worked right. >>
What could possibly go wrong. >>

01:09:18.121 --> 01:09:24.127
Nine slides left. So let's talk
about my favorite subject, PCI.

01:09:26.796 --> 01:09:29.465
PCI is great. I put this slide
together. It's a bunch of shit

01:09:29.465 --> 01:09:35.038
on the screen. Windows XP. And
apparently you can get this

01:09:35.038 --> 01:09:38.374
certificate of compliance with
PCI and that is fun, too. That's

01:09:38.374 --> 01:09:44.380
a -- keep hitting that button.
>> We have a winner. >> Top four

01:09:48.985 --> 01:09:53.723
responses to noncompliance. It's
too hard. I can't put that in

01:09:53.723 --> 01:09:58.161
your report. No. 2, write a
compensated control for it. I

01:09:58.161 --> 01:10:05.768
can't write that for a lock out
-- takes 28 fail attempts before

01:10:05.768 --> 01:10:09.005
it locks out your account. The
fact that you do that is really

01:10:09.005 --> 01:10:16.479
fucking stupid. The QSA last
year said it was good. I'm not

01:10:16.479 --> 01:10:20.917
that QSA. Whatever this mess of
a report that I'm reviewing

01:10:20.917 --> 01:10:26.889
didn't pass. Then they're like
we'll accept the risk. That's

01:10:26.889 --> 01:10:29.425
great but I can't do anything
about that. That's fun. Let's

01:10:29.425 --> 01:10:35.264
talk about -- can I help you? I
do not need to drink now. I'm

01:10:35.264 --> 01:10:38.901
talking a million miles a minute
now. Let's talk about a rental

01:10:38.901 --> 01:10:44.373
car company, a big one. I had to
be the technical QSA. Those

01:10:44.373 --> 01:10:48.244
don't really exist. I'm going
through all of the credit cards,

01:10:48.244 --> 01:10:52.682
credit card applications and one
is a terminal they have. That's

01:10:52.682 --> 01:11:00.189
cool. I need these T logs and
application logs, et cetera. So

01:11:00.189 --> 01:11:03.059
I find credit card numbers in
the logs. Hey, I have credit

01:11:03.059 --> 01:11:06.863
card numbers here. No, that
can't be right. We don't store

01:11:06.863 --> 01:11:12.902
credit card numbers. Great. I
have them here. By the way that

01:11:12.902 --> 01:11:17.840
is trap one data in your logs.
And I'm like this is a big

01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:21.410
problem. We don't store credit
card data. That can't be right.

01:11:21.410 --> 01:11:24.847
I don't know what to tell you
but you have them in there. Just

01:11:24.847 --> 01:11:29.218
to prove the point. I said how
recent are the logs. Two or

01:11:29.218 --> 01:11:32.789
three days. I get a credit card
scanner out of the bag and

01:11:32.789 --> 01:11:37.126
connect it to the laptop and
scan it. It was my tract data

01:11:37.126 --> 01:11:42.899
that I found in those logs. My
tract data was in the logs and

01:11:42.899 --> 01:11:47.436
there was this poor QA --
control process, and those had

01:11:47.436 --> 01:11:52.008
been storing track data for a
couple months before they shut

01:11:52.008 --> 01:11:56.546
it off. It took going to the
vice president before they

01:11:56.546 --> 01:11:59.749
admitted they stored data and it
was something where they

01:11:59.749 --> 01:12:03.085
implemented a new version and
forgot to turn off the debug log

01:12:03.085 --> 01:12:08.457
function. I'm going. Two more
things to talk about. Logistics

01:12:08.457 --> 01:12:14.163
company. Self-assessments. You
can just go through and take a

01:12:14.163 --> 01:12:21.237
checklist of 12 items, done,
done, done, good. They declined

01:12:21.237 --> 01:12:25.541
to do a PCI discovery data
workshop. They say we only have

01:12:25.541 --> 01:12:33.082
-- applications, OK great. 24
hours later they have at least

01:12:33.082 --> 01:12:37.286
15. And then they got angry. We
need to change this so we can

01:12:37.286 --> 01:12:44.560
assess your stuff. There was
credit card numbers for

01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:51.434
everybody. It was in note pad.
Red teaming is in quotes because

01:12:51.434 --> 01:12:54.003
when I do a red team engagement
it's never a true red team

01:12:54.003 --> 01:13:00.009
engagement. So we got a retail
chain. They want to perform it

01:13:02.745 --> 01:13:08.217
on the retail stores. Find out
they have this huge party list

01:13:08.217 --> 01:13:13.189
they do for the Christmas party
every year. Manager names, et

01:13:13.189 --> 01:13:18.661
cetera. A lot of that didn't
help because retail can be an

01:13:18.661 --> 01:13:21.731
employment revolving door. I
have no clue what to do. I'm

01:13:21.731 --> 01:13:26.936
going to be a veriphone guy. I'm
in polo and khakis and like I'm

01:13:26.936 --> 01:13:28.938
here to check the system. I have
a wonderful pony express power

01:13:28.938 --> 01:13:30.940
strip and other things in the
backpack. I need to replace the

01:13:30.940 --> 01:13:32.942
UPS under the desk, can I go in
and replace it. No problem. That

01:13:32.942 --> 01:13:34.944
problem is it was a cellular
dead spot in the mall. That was

01:13:34.944 --> 01:13:36.946
great. I couldnt a signal to
save my life. I found a mobile

01:13:36.946 --> 01:13:38.948
terminal. Even more fun when the
passcode is the store number. As

01:13:38.948 --> 01:13:40.950
I keep going back and changing
all the cellular cards,

01:13:40.950 --> 01:13:42.952
eventually the -- calls me, they
called the store and said all

01:13:42.952 --> 01:13:44.954
the P operating systems were
going down and coming back up,

01:13:44.954 --> 01:13:46.956
what is going on. They decided
to talk and said a Veriphone guy

01:13:46.956 --> 01:13:48.958
was very friendly and helping
out. This might be game over. I

01:13:48.958 --> 01:13:50.960
got out of there without showing
the get out of jail free card

01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:52.962
but that sucked. Last two
slides. I can't make this shit

01:13:52.962 --> 01:13:54.964
up. This is a failure on the
companies and on my own. I do a

01:13:54.964 --> 01:13:57.500
lot of stuff with memorabilia. I
couldn't get in the front door.

01:13:57.500 --> 01:13:59.802
I went in there as an
exterminator. Weve been using

01:13:59.802 --> 01:14:01.837
XYZ exterminator 30 years who
the hell are you. I was like

01:14:01.837 --> 01:14:04.106
shit. I failed before I was
expecting it. I made up this big

01:14:04.106 --> 01:14:06.375
story, I'm a contractor. And we
kept going on and on. And they

01:14:06.375 --> 01:14:08.811
never let me in. I went around
to the back door, that was open

01:14:08.811 --> 01:14:10.813
and went from there. All three
sites. PII was everywhere. I

01:14:10.813 --> 01:14:12.815
didn't have to plug a computer
in. They had photocopies of

01:14:12.815 --> 01:14:14.817
driver licenses, photocopies of
car registrations and people's

01:14:14.817 --> 01:14:16.819
credit and debit cards and
checks. Photocopies of anything

01:14:16.819 --> 01:14:18.821
you can imagine. I would have to
take a large duffel bag in to

01:14:18.821 --> 01:14:20.823
get this stuff out but it very
easily accessible. The bad part

01:14:20.823 --> 01:14:22.825
is when I got to the debrief.
That was the next week. Hay,

01:14:22.825 --> 01:14:26.829
look at this. I didn't have to
connect to a computer. Wait, go

01:14:26.829 --> 01:14:30.533
back to that first one. Did you
make it to the second floor. No,

01:14:30.533 --> 01:14:33.536
I just made it to the
receptionist's desk and she

01:14:33.536 --> 01:14:35.604
didn't let me in. Our office is
on the second floor. You just

01:14:35.604 --> 01:14:37.606
owned did one of our
competitor's companies. It took

01:14:37.606 --> 01:14:40.009
every ounce of me not to say the
word fuck on that phone call.

01:14:40.009 --> 01:14:44.547
That is a failure in InfoSec in
general. Getting off the stage

01:14:44.547 --> 01:14:48.351
here. If you want to follow me
on Twitter, go ahead. Thank you

01:14:48.351 --> 01:14:51.854
very much. >> We don't have to
dance, right? Is there an

01:14:51.854 --> 01:14:58.227
unventilated can of varnish
somewhere near Chris? >> No, he

01:14:58.227 --> 01:15:05.768
is always like that. >> How much
money have we raised? Not

01:15:05.768 --> 01:15:11.774
enough. Come on. >> $650. >>
Let's get it to 1 --> 000, come on.

01:15:15.611 --> 01:15:21.617
>> Why is everybody leaving?
What the fuck? Come back. >>

01:15:50.746 --> 01:15:56.752
Come on. >> I swear my part will
be way better than theirs. >>

01:16:07.530 --> 01:16:13.536
That's some hot stuff, I can
smell it all the way over here.

01:16:17.840 --> 01:16:21.844
>> Do I get some more animation
music. >> I'm tempted to make

01:16:21.844 --> 01:16:24.880
fart noises. >> Into the
microphone, remember. >> So

01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:29.552
originally when Larry got me to
do this talk, it was a no holds

01:16:29.552 --> 01:16:33.255
barred talk where we can talk
shit about everyone and then

01:16:33.255 --> 01:16:37.960
there were a couple snow flakes
that told me to tone it down. So

01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:42.965
I'm going to tone it down a bit.
Originally I was going to do an

01:16:42.965 --> 01:16:46.335
offshoot of the joke the
Aristocrats. >> Hear you can't

01:16:46.335 --> 01:16:50.339
speak unless you drop an Oday on
stage. >> Originally the first

01:16:50.339 --> 01:16:54.376
line of the joke is Kaitlyn
walks into the office and asks

01:16:54.376 --> 01:16:59.782
for a raise and I was going to
snowball it from there. Boom.

01:16:59.782 --> 01:17:07.556
I'm illwill. Professional IRC
Troll and I run a nonprofit

01:17:07.556 --> 01:17:13.562
hacker space. I don't have any
certs, fuck them and BlackHat is

01:17:16.999 --> 01:17:23.005
fuck. So when I started off with
computers I like to have fun. Me

01:17:27.977 --> 01:17:33.983
and my crew used to roll around.
We brought you the world of

01:17:38.187 --> 01:17:46.061
Paris Hilton and I'm sorry for
that. It's like opening

01:17:46.061 --> 01:17:53.903
Pandora's box if it smelled like
herpes. So unfortunately that

01:17:53.903 --> 01:17:59.909
brings a lot of attention to
yourself. I got in some trouble

01:18:03.245 --> 01:18:09.251
at some point. When you get in
trouble, you get arrested. Yeah.

01:18:12.688 --> 01:18:18.694
Fame and fortune and you can't
talk about bullshit stuff but

01:18:21.330 --> 01:18:27.336
you get a shitty movie made
after you. So basically this is

01:18:30.739 --> 01:18:36.745
going to talk about -- one of
the famous fuck ups is rust on

01:18:41.750 --> 01:18:47.756
silk road. He got caught because
he posted on bit porn forms with

01:18:51.961 --> 01:18:59.802
his own email address and
started up silk road. Everything

01:18:59.802 --> 01:19:07.443
that goes on the internet stays
on the internet. Another fuck

01:19:07.443 --> 01:19:13.449
up. Is this big snitch, he was
doing good until he logged on

01:19:19.989 --> 01:19:25.995
using his own IP address. And in
effect getting this guy in

01:19:33.102 --> 01:19:39.108
trouble. So he had pretty good
-- unfortunately he trusted a

01:19:45.114 --> 01:19:51.120
snitch. And his password for his
computer was chewy 1, 2, 3. You

01:19:59.328 --> 01:20:05.334
have all the encryption in the
world but if you fuck it up with

01:20:14.610 --> 01:20:20.616
an 8-character password you're
fucked. Raise your hand if you

01:20:23.686 --> 01:20:26.455
think your email address is in
this dump? How many of you

01:20:26.455 --> 01:20:29.758
people shit when you heard that
went out? Basically there's 50

01:20:29.758 --> 01:20:33.062
million users on there. You
break it down, there's a couple

01:20:33.062 --> 01:20:35.464
thousands federal and state
employees and employers that

01:20:35.464 --> 01:20:38.434
have nudes. All the girls
they're talking to. When that

01:20:38.434 --> 01:20:41.470
shit gets leaked you don't want
it to leak. I cloud was another

01:20:41.470 --> 01:20:43.472
big one over the past year. From
all the celebrities over the

01:20:43.472 --> 01:20:45.474
past years that were hacked
into, they still don't learn to

01:20:45.474 --> 01:20:47.476
trust the cloud with all their
nudes. Normal people fuck up,

01:20:47.476 --> 01:20:49.478
too. So this goes -- this is not
celebrity stuff. It's just from

01:20:49.478 --> 01:20:51.480
my day to day job. Let's see if
I can get this to play. >> Wait

01:20:51.480 --> 01:20:53.482
for the audio. >> How come it's
not playing? Oops. >> Tell it to

01:20:53.482 --> 01:20:55.484
us in braille. >> We can
probably ... >> Let's see. Let

01:20:55.484 --> 01:20:57.486
me get the audio. If any of you
can recognize the sound, please

01:20:57.486 --> 01:20:59.488
shout it out. (muffled)? >>
Maybe he is constipated. >> --

01:20:59.488 --> 01:21:01.423
this afternoon in the lobby. >>
That was -- I was working on a

01:21:01.423 --> 01:21:03.425
client's laptop, they brought it
into me. It was on stand by

01:21:03.425 --> 01:21:05.427
mode. It was locked and he
didn't give me a password. I'm

01:21:05.427 --> 01:21:07.429
in an office full of a bunch of
people and that went off. I had

01:21:07.429 --> 01:21:09.431
no way of shutting it down. When
you bring your computer into

01:21:09.431 --> 01:21:11.433
somebody to fix, don't have a
folder labeled my escort site on

01:21:11.433 --> 01:21:13.435
top. And in the other folder,
classroom material for kids. >>

01:21:13.435 --> 01:21:15.437
Hot. >> Fail. >> This other
lady's laptop. She brought it

01:21:15.437 --> 01:21:17.439
into me. How powder all over the
laptop, the keyboard and

01:21:17.439 --> 01:21:19.441
everything. She had a user
profile that was messed up. Said

01:21:19.441 --> 01:21:21.443
her kid messed it up. I will
turn on the guest account and

01:21:21.443 --> 01:21:23.445
that way the kid can't mess it
up. Two days later she brings it

01:21:23.445 --> 01:21:25.447
back. Fixed it. She is
complaining she shouldn't have

01:21:25.447 --> 01:21:27.449
to pay again, it was broken. A
few days later I get an ass dial

01:21:27.449 --> 01:21:29.451
from a phone number at 3 a.m.
The Google search pulled up her

01:21:29.451 --> 01:21:31.453
phone number which lead to an
adult baby service. It was her

01:21:31.453 --> 01:21:33.455
adult baby diaper guy. If you're
going to use the phone numbers

01:21:33.455 --> 01:21:35.457
for all that stuff, don't leave
it anybody. >> Adult baby diaper

01:21:35.457 --> 01:21:37.459
guy? >> It's a thing. Google
image that. >> So the last thing

01:21:37.459 --> 01:21:39.461
is health care. My wife's
mother-in-law bought a laptop at

01:21:39.461 --> 01:21:41.463
a flea market for 50 bucks. She
said I need a password removed

01:21:41.463 --> 01:21:43.465
from it. I bought this laptop. I
booted it up and it tried to log

01:21:43.465 --> 01:21:45.467
onto a major health care
provider. You can get the

01:21:45.467 --> 01:21:47.469
MSCache password. I decided to
crack it. That lead me to the

01:21:47.469 --> 01:21:49.471
Citrix framework for them to log
into their server. They were

01:21:49.471 --> 01:21:51.473
curious enough to basically let
me get onto their main

01:21:51.473 --> 01:21:53.475
controller from a link on the
desktop. So of course many being

01:21:53.475 --> 01:22:00.249
curious as I am ... I had done
my hacker math and started

01:22:00.249 --> 01:22:06.255
searching around. Not only were
they curious enough to leave the

01:22:21.670 --> 01:22:27.676
remote desktop link on the
desktop but they left an excel

01:22:32.014 --> 01:22:34.316
spread sheet, every Wi-Fi
password on the box. I did that

01:22:34.316 --> 01:22:40.322
in 2003 and checked in ten years
later and I was still able to

01:22:54.536 --> 01:22:58.574
login with the same user name
and password. I saw someone at

01:22:58.574 --> 01:23:02.845
-- Boston last year and I let
him know that I could get on his

01:23:02.845 --> 01:23:06.582
network and I gave him the
information and the card and I

01:23:06.582 --> 01:23:09.651
checked right before today, and
everything is still not changed.

01:23:09.651 --> 01:23:14.323
So this is just a shout out to
one of my buddies here. When I

01:23:14.323 --> 01:23:17.726
got in trouble, there was
somebody that got me into all

01:23:17.726 --> 01:23:22.698
this stuff. I want to say hi to
Dan, if he is in the audience?

01:23:22.698 --> 01:23:26.702
>> Crickets. >> If you're a CSSP
like Boris, last time I seen him

01:23:26.702 --> 01:23:30.739
at the queer con pool, but just
to let you know everything on

01:23:30.739 --> 01:23:34.142
the internet stays on the
internet and someone is going to

01:23:34.142 --> 01:23:37.546
find it eventually. I had to
rush through this because we

01:23:37.546 --> 01:23:40.949
only have ten minutes left. >>
They're supposed to just work,

01:23:40.949 --> 01:23:45.621
right? Can you see it? >> You
did better than me. >> I have 30

01:23:45.621 --> 01:23:49.024
seconds. This is going to be
awesome. First time speaking at

01:23:49.024 --> 01:23:53.362
DEFCON and I don't have a drink.
I'm not sure how that works. >>

01:23:53.362 --> 01:23:57.599
Chug it. >> No. I hate beer.
That's horrible. A little bit

01:23:57.599 --> 01:24:00.769
about myself. I'm going to talk
about a health care provider

01:24:00.769 --> 01:24:05.173
that I worked at and ISP that I
worked at and a (audio blipped)

01:24:05.173 --> 01:24:08.677
I'm sick. >> Not here. >>
Perfect. My name is Amanda

01:24:08.677 --> 01:24:11.747
Berlin. I have my fan club in
the first couple rows. Yes. I've

01:24:11.747 --> 01:24:17.753
been doing blue team stuff for a
long time. Worked in health care

01:24:29.932 --> 01:24:35.938
for a while. Windows admin, that
kind of stuff. Fixed a lot of

01:24:57.960 --> 01:25:03.899
shit. Next. So still doing some
hot sauce for charity. That

01:25:21.583 --> 01:25:27.589
isn't charity as far as I know.
Get up here and give some money?

01:25:48.744 --> 01:25:50.812
>> Thanks to those who've given
already. >> Supervision

01:25:50.812 --> 01:25:54.182
required. If you hung out with
me at any point in time these

01:25:54.182 --> 01:25:56.284
guys can probably vouch for
that. >> Run. >> Otherwise I

01:25:56.284 --> 01:26:01.823
wouldn't be up here on this
panel. This is one of my

01:26:01.823 --> 01:26:09.765
favorite kids movies. I have
three little boys at home and

01:26:09.765 --> 01:26:15.771
this explains blue team and red
team. Red team is cooler. But

01:26:18.440 --> 01:26:24.446
fuck it, I've been doing red
team for ten years, it's fun.

01:26:27.115 --> 01:26:34.322
Cover your eyes if your
squeamish. That's a thing. That

01:26:34.322 --> 01:26:40.328
is -- that's what you have to do
to get your CISSP I think. >>

01:26:45.133 --> 01:26:51.139
Describe the CIA ... >> He is
corked. A little bit of process.

01:26:54.543 --> 01:27:01.683
Everything that I mentioned has
been fixed already. Don't fuck

01:27:01.683 --> 01:27:08.590
up my previous employer because
I really still like them. I

01:27:08.590 --> 01:27:14.596
wouldn't be where I am today
without them. Imagine walking

01:27:17.399 --> 01:27:25.373
into an environment, there is
absolutely no help. The network

01:27:25.373 --> 01:27:31.646
engineer has been there for ten,
20 years, complete ass hole. He

01:27:31.646 --> 01:27:37.652
took an MCSE course just to get
up the ladder. They switched to

01:27:40.589 --> 01:27:46.795
EMR. Completely digitized
everything and he had no other

01:27:46.795 --> 01:27:52.801
knowledge than the one week boot
camp they took. And they knew

01:27:55.070 --> 01:28:01.109
things were bad. I'm a
self-proclaimed sexist. I was

01:28:01.109 --> 01:28:07.115
pregnant when I worked there and
this dude came up and said every

01:28:09.784 --> 01:28:15.791
time I see you, you're eating.
You must have an oral fixation

01:28:22.364 --> 01:28:28.370
with me. Fuck off. So he got
fired. Surprisingly. They

01:28:32.874 --> 01:28:38.880
actually were scared to fire him
because he knew, she supposedly

01:28:44.419 --> 01:28:50.425
knew so much about the
infrastructure they didn't want

01:28:54.596 --> 01:29:00.535
to fire him because they weren't
sure what would happen if he

01:31:04.359 --> 01:31:10.365
left. I got there. Everybody in
the entire department is a

01:31:59.013 --> 01:32:03.985
domain admin. 40 or so people,
anywhere from help desk to

01:32:03.985 --> 01:32:07.422
directors to software
administrators to the people

01:32:07.422 --> 01:32:12.594
that actually needed it and knew
what the fuck do main admins

01:32:12.594 --> 01:32:18.533
were. And we dove in and finally
realized what was happening. A

01:32:18.533 --> 01:32:23.605
couple things we didn't have. We
didn't have antivirus on

01:32:23.605 --> 01:32:29.010
anything. Servers, workstations,
nothing. What could possibly go

01:32:29.010 --> 01:32:36.484
wrong? No W sauce. Windows 2000
servers that weren't patched in

01:32:36.484 --> 01:32:41.823
four years. No big deal? >>
Doesn't that get into windows

01:32:41.823 --> 01:32:49.330
2003 territory? >> We had a
couple. This was 2008. No

01:32:49.330 --> 01:32:54.235
biggie. We had a decent data
center. Water lines piped above

01:32:54.235 --> 01:32:58.706
them for the fire suppression
system for the entire data

01:32:58.706 --> 01:33:04.646
center. Open ports everywhere in
the hospital. No idea what was

01:33:07.615 --> 01:33:15.490
in our environment. This was
after we spent 40 hours cleaning

01:33:15.490 --> 01:33:21.496
it up. We had InfoSec but holy
shit, fail. >> We're up to $700

01:33:26.868 --> 01:33:32.874
by the way, everybody. >> Nice.
>> Keep coming. >> I'm trying.

01:33:34.943 --> 01:33:41.015
>> Go faster. >> Sorry, I have
-- I'm half way done. >> 2

01:33:41.015 --> 01:33:46.621
minutes. >> Oh my god. >> We
know Larry can go in two

01:33:46.621 --> 01:33:50.358
minutes. >> We have no back ups
at all. Running a fucking

01:33:50.358 --> 01:33:56.364
hospital. 500 beds. 2 --> 000
employees. No back ups at all.

01:33:58.533 --> 01:34:04.839
Had no DMZ. Not only did we not
have a DMZ, our production

01:34:04.839 --> 01:34:12.380
website was on a windows 2003
box who was dual homed. One had

01:34:12.380 --> 01:34:15.884
an IP address straight to the
internet. The other was in an

01:34:15.884 --> 01:34:21.890
internal internet. The SQL was
on the backend domain

01:34:26.794 --> 01:34:32.800
controller. Who could possibly
go wrong? Not only was that on

01:34:35.703 --> 01:34:41.309
our domain controller, we had
the -- our public Wi-Fi and

01:34:41.309 --> 01:34:48.316
that's where the DHTP came from.
That Wi-Fi had no password.

01:34:48.316 --> 01:34:51.486
Actually had a lady call me up
when I worked at the help desk

01:34:51.486 --> 01:34:57.258
saying the internet wasn't
working. Down the road. So some

01:34:57.258 --> 01:35:00.895
old lady called, and thought for
some reason it was our help

01:35:00.895 --> 01:35:03.498
desk. We had a splash page to
call the help desk and she

01:35:03.498 --> 01:35:07.535
called to let us know the
internet wasn't working. It

01:35:07.535 --> 01:35:11.239
wasn't supposed to be your
internet by it was. She had no

01:35:11.239 --> 01:35:17.245
idea. If anybody is in health
care, this is a cath lab. One of

01:35:20.848 --> 01:35:28.089
my favorite stories. They do
some stuff with heart cath

01:35:28.089 --> 01:35:31.292
things where they open you up
and do certain things. Actually

01:35:31.292 --> 01:35:39.133
had -- are you going to pull me
off stage. Get the fuck out of

01:35:39.133 --> 01:35:45.273
here. Go. I'm almost done. I
swear to god. Next time I'm

01:35:45.273 --> 01:35:50.979
going first, fuck this. We had
our operator call about

01:35:50.979 --> 01:35:56.884
massively fast locking out after
directory accounts. We had to

01:35:56.884 --> 01:36:00.622
write a script that would
reunlock the active directory

01:36:00.622 --> 01:36:04.158
accounts because the cath lab
vendor shipped us something,

01:36:06.394 --> 01:36:12.767
guess what was on it? >>
Enterprise admin access. >> The

01:36:12.767 --> 01:36:18.773
porn that the COE watches. A
variety of colorful dicks. >>

01:36:23.077 --> 01:36:29.083
That's better than a bunch of
colorful dicks. >> So they

01:36:33.388 --> 01:36:39.694
shipped this with Conficker. We
got a really goodies count on

01:36:39.694 --> 01:36:44.999
this software because we swore
we would never say what their

01:36:44.999 --> 01:36:51.005
name was when they shipped it to
us a second time. Sorry. Okay.

01:36:56.010 --> 01:36:59.313
>> Whoever is transcribing this
-- >> I'm sorry. NSO867

01:36:59.313 --> 01:37:02.850
everywhere and windows 2000 and
XP. No big deal. This was a

01:37:02.850 --> 01:37:08.856
water fountain in -- wasn't
supposed to be a water fountain.

01:37:12.126 --> 01:37:15.196
It was attached to the boiler or
something happened with the

01:37:15.196 --> 01:37:21.736
power. The squirrel took out the
power to the entire data center.

01:37:21.736 --> 01:37:25.873
>> I told you. >> I'm really
scared this dude behind me is

01:37:25.873 --> 01:37:31.879
going to throw me off stage. >>
He is Canadian. >> Literally I

01:37:35.249 --> 01:37:38.886
walked in at 9 p.m. at night.
There was a five fucking foot

01:37:38.886 --> 01:37:45.993
water spout coming out where our
-- where our fiber terminated. I

01:37:45.993 --> 01:37:53.534
mean in the core switches. I had
to daisy chain a UPS and put it

01:37:53.534 --> 01:37:57.872
on the ladder so it didn't get
fried by the water spouting up

01:37:57.872 --> 01:38:03.277
in the corner. Best alerting
system ever. We had no

01:38:03.277 --> 01:38:08.316
monitoring. Best alerting system
ever was the APCs. When you did

01:38:08.316 --> 01:38:13.054
an end of map scan it would send
you an email for every fucking

01:38:13.054 --> 01:38:19.060
one. I'm going to skip that one.
I have some personal fails. Yes,

01:38:23.164 --> 01:38:26.401
sorry. I don't have any personal
-- that is a whole other talk.

01:38:28.569 --> 01:38:34.475
If you mask [indiscernible] it's
a really bad idea. It's very

01:38:34.475 --> 01:38:38.412
colorful. Takes down the entire
school system and everybody that

01:38:38.412 --> 01:38:41.749
you manage. And checkpoints
which I probably shouldn't say.

01:38:41.749 --> 01:38:45.920
Next generation, great. Last
slide, thank god. I did a

01:38:45.920 --> 01:38:52.493
phishing exercise to train the
users in the hospital where I

01:38:52.493 --> 01:38:58.099
was working at. Went really
well. This one was amazing. As

01:38:58.099 --> 01:39:03.538
soon as I set this out, later I
had a lady contact us and let us

01:39:03.538 --> 01:39:06.607
know that she didn't appreciate
it because she had to cancel her

01:39:06.607 --> 01:39:12.613
paypal and Kohl's card. I felt
really bad. I sent this out as a

01:39:16.651 --> 01:39:22.657
phish. I'm done. Great.
Applause.
