00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.203
 So my name is Ken Westin, so
today I'm going to be talking

00:00:03.203 --> 00:00:07.107
about being a professional cyber
stalker. I found a company

00:00:07.107 --> 00:00:11.044
called Gadget Track, kind of
fell into it. I was sort of a

00:00:11.044 --> 00:00:15.282
reluctant hacker and CEO, and I
actually learned quite a bit

00:00:15.282 --> 00:00:21.288
along the way. My basic -- I
basically started developing

00:00:28.862 --> 00:00:31.598
step recovery tools to help
recover stolen devices. Kind of

00:00:31.598 --> 00:00:34.034
got into also the investigation
side because law enforcement

00:00:34.034 --> 00:00:37.804
needed a lot of help, and I'll
kind of talk about some of those

00:00:37.804 --> 00:00:40.807
challenges and things I learned
along the way. So I've actually

00:00:40.807 --> 00:00:43.243
assisted law enforcement with a
number of investigations, not

00:00:43.243 --> 00:00:46.747
just with the tools I developed.
A lot of times, they would come

00:00:46.747 --> 00:00:50.284
to me for other debt recovery
tools, and -- or other data they

00:00:50.284 --> 00:00:53.787
may have, and I'll kind of talk
about that too, how to harvest

00:00:53.787 --> 00:00:56.790
information from social media on
other sources as well. I'm not

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.959
with -- currently senior
security analyst at Tripwire.

00:00:58.959 --> 00:01:01.328
Catching a different type of
criminal, dealing with different

00:01:01.328 --> 00:01:04.831
types of data, but I still --
still get to keep involved in

00:01:04.831 --> 00:01:08.869
some of this stuff with some of
the investigations. So for those

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:12.105
of you, hard core justice porn,
this is my wall of shame. These

00:01:12.105 --> 00:01:16.276
are actual cases I've been
involved with. You'll see a lot

00:01:16.276 --> 00:01:20.847
of photos taken by web cameras.
I blur their faces out to

00:01:20.847 --> 00:01:24.651
protect the guilty. And some of
these folks actually recovered

00:01:24.651 --> 00:01:29.222
devices for -- we didn't have
photos of them from the web

00:01:29.222 --> 00:01:33.393
camera. So it's interesting,
more than half the time, when I

00:01:33.393 --> 00:01:38.732
we want to go recover a device
the people would go in and they

00:01:38.732 --> 00:01:43.704
would -- the police would go in.
They would find other crimes. A

00:01:43.704 --> 00:01:47.507
lot of times fencing operations,
drugs, people had warrants for

00:01:47.507 --> 00:01:51.311
other crimes. Even got involved
with a very violent carjacking,

00:01:51.311 --> 00:01:56.249
laptop sort of served as trojan
to help us identify and find the

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:59.686
people involved. And also, you
know, by basically trojanizing

00:01:59.686 --> 00:02:03.056
devices, it becomes a trojan
providing visibility into these

00:02:03.056 --> 00:02:06.093
larger criminal enterprises.
I'll go into detail throughout

00:02:06.093 --> 00:02:09.296
the presentation. That being
said, you can probably imagine

00:02:09.296 --> 00:02:11.732
some of the work I do. It
doesn't have its critics. It's

00:02:11.732 --> 00:02:14.901
-- folks who don't quite
understand the intention or

00:02:14.901 --> 00:02:17.771
background of the tools. The
fact, incredibly -- tools that

00:02:17.771 --> 00:02:20.507
are much more invasive that are
available, nefarious things,

00:02:20.507 --> 00:02:23.644
rats, malware out there, that
people can use if they want to

00:02:23.644 --> 00:02:27.014
spy on someone. During the
process of developing the tools,

00:02:27.014 --> 00:02:31.118
I was very concerned how the
tools might be used, and also

00:02:31.118 --> 00:02:34.321
concerned about privacy.
Actually, investigating some of

00:02:34.321 --> 00:02:38.191
the other -- recovery tools that
were out there, a lot of them

00:02:38.191 --> 00:02:42.262
had back doors into the systems.
They would actually gather more

00:02:42.262 --> 00:02:47.034
data than they really needed.
And so I tried to develop a tool

00:02:47.034 --> 00:02:50.370
that was both useful for law
enforcement investigations but

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.041
also balance the privacy
implications as well. So I also

00:02:54.041 --> 00:02:56.610
found mobile devices in
particular that applications

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:01.348
gather a lot more information
than what I did, and I'll talk a

00:03:01.348 --> 00:03:05.018
little bit about that. A lot of
things that marketing

00:03:05.018 --> 00:03:09.089
applications do more scary than
some of the information I would

00:03:09.089 --> 00:03:12.392
gather for theft recovery
purposes. I got started with

00:03:12.392 --> 00:03:16.463
this when I -- when I was
working for a company.

00:03:16.463 --> 00:03:20.567
Specializing in blocking USB
devices, a long time ago, 2008,

00:03:20.567 --> 00:03:25.138
2008. Exposure security, server
administrator, trying to secure

00:03:25.138 --> 00:03:30.744
ebb with servers -- web servers
and managing websites and I got

00:03:30.744 --> 00:03:34.347
really interested in how these
USB-based tools were being used

00:03:34.347 --> 00:03:37.951
to compromise networks. You
know, hacking is hard. Trying to

00:03:37.951 --> 00:03:42.289
access a network from outside is
very difficult. But being a lazy

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:45.892
hacker, you know, using USB
devices to compromise a system

00:03:45.892 --> 00:03:50.597
or steal data a lot easier so I
started working with these tools

00:03:50.597 --> 00:03:54.568
and created a website called
USBhacks. Some of the cools the

00:03:54.568 --> 00:03:57.471
community was developing.
Started working with some of

00:03:57.471 --> 00:04:01.007
these myself and it was really
interesting. I started getting

00:04:01.007 --> 00:04:04.611
some interesting inquiries from
both sides of the law, first

00:04:04.611 --> 00:04:09.216
time the FBI gave me a little
call. But I think once they

00:04:09.216 --> 00:04:11.551
understood my intentions, that
this was more about raising

00:04:11.551 --> 00:04:13.954
awareness, but at that time
nobody was actually talking

00:04:13.954 --> 00:04:17.791
about this or providing these
tools, and now you know, they --

00:04:17.791 --> 00:04:20.327
at least they had those tools to
play with, so other

00:04:20.327 --> 00:04:23.430
administrators can actually test
their networks to see how it

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.033
would react to these particular
tools. A lot of researchers

00:04:27.033 --> 00:04:30.437
actually still ask for those
tools, so actually put the URL

00:04:30.437 --> 00:04:32.739
there just below the title, so
if you want to download those,

00:04:32.739 --> 00:04:36.910
just be careful. Those should be
picked up by antivirus, but you

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:41.081
can still modify some of the
scripts and it will still work.

00:04:41.081 --> 00:04:45.952
So you know, after I brought it
down, I thought about, what if I

00:04:45.952 --> 00:04:49.790
was able to utilize these tools
and actually make them more

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:53.593
friendly, right? So instead of
taking a trojan and -- damage,

00:04:53.593 --> 00:04:58.064
what if we turn that into a
happy trojan? Right? So you

00:04:58.064 --> 00:05:01.134
know, the idea, very similar, is
that, you know, you plug in a

00:05:01.134 --> 00:05:05.839
flash drive, utilize auto run
capability, you run a binary,

00:05:05.839 --> 00:05:09.676
and you're able to gather a lot
of information. And you know,

00:05:09.676 --> 00:05:12.479
you can do a lot where you can
grab -- you can grab all the

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:14.948
stuff but for theft recovery
purposes, I figure, IP address,

00:05:14.948 --> 00:05:18.518
internal network address. We can
do some geolocation, just off

00:05:18.518 --> 00:05:21.321
the IP, so we know what city
they're in. But the more useful

00:05:21.321 --> 00:05:23.990
information was the computer
name and then the username of

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.660
the person that actually is --
is using that system. And

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:30.630
through that, I launch this as a
free tool. It was actually part

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:34.901
of my master's degree, the
system I built, and I put it out

00:05:34.901 --> 00:05:38.805
there for free. I just kind of
curious if people would be

00:05:38.805 --> 00:05:43.743
interested in this. I got on the
home page of dig and it got dug

00:05:43.743 --> 00:05:46.680
to death, 20 --> 000 people
registered over the course of

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:51.284
two to three days and as you can
imagine, this was all coming to

00:05:51.284 --> 00:05:54.888
a central server, so it actually
-- you can actually activate

00:05:54.888 --> 00:05:57.824
tracking, remotely. And then
when the device gets connected,

00:05:57.824 --> 00:06:02.362
it will then send data to the
owner. So I was able to harvest

00:06:02.362 --> 00:06:05.966
a lot of information about the
devices that this was working

00:06:05.966 --> 00:06:09.569
with, and far beyond USB
devices. I found it was working

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:12.839
with external hard drives, GPS
devices, because that's how you

00:06:12.839 --> 00:06:17.110
update the maps at the time. It
worked with -- also the iPods,

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:20.714
so didn't have the right
software all the time and you

00:06:20.714 --> 00:06:24.951
plug in, one of these iPods and
you access it, it would get

00:06:24.951 --> 00:06:27.921
triggered as well, which was
pretty interesting. I've gone

00:06:27.921 --> 00:06:31.858
ahead, and put the actual USB
client source code, at least one

00:06:31.858 --> 00:06:36.429
version of it, up here, so you
guys get the slides or you want

00:06:36.429 --> 00:06:40.367
to download it, it's in C++. But
then here's the auto run

00:06:40.367 --> 00:06:43.003
capability, right? A massive
vulnerability that Microsoft put

00:06:43.003 --> 00:06:47.741
out there and it's still present
today. You know, you'll even see

00:06:47.741 --> 00:06:50.076
a systems that are vulnerable in
industrial environments on

00:06:50.076 --> 00:06:53.246
health care, still going to be
running Windows XP and still

00:06:53.246 --> 00:06:55.882
vulnerable to these types of
attacks and I'll kind of show

00:06:55.882 --> 00:07:00.253
examples of that too. You think
-- we would have learned by now

00:07:00.253 --> 00:07:05.292
that USB devices are -- are bad,
but even Black Hat this year, a

00:07:05.292 --> 00:07:07.794
lot of people they scattered a
bunch of flash drives out,

00:07:07.794 --> 00:07:11.431
hacked into it and had data
stolen from systems. I'm not

00:07:11.431 --> 00:07:13.633
sure innocent bystanders,
hopefully it wasn't any of you

00:07:13.633 --> 00:07:17.170
guys. If it was one of you, get
the hell out. The trouble with

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:20.106
getting the IP address, we talk
about attribution, this attack

00:07:20.106 --> 00:07:23.610
came from China. Well, you know,
IP address, you know, it's very,

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:27.113
very difficult to -- to use for
attribution. One thing I found,

00:07:27.113 --> 00:07:29.749
law enforcement don't like
paperwork, don't like doing a

00:07:29.749 --> 00:07:32.986
lot of work. So when you're
dealing with IP addresses, they

00:07:32.986 --> 00:07:37.357
have to do a lot of filing, they
have to go through to get a

00:07:37.357 --> 00:07:40.560
court order, to get that
information from an ISP. Some of

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:43.797
this process can take anywhere
from two weeks to three months,

00:07:43.797 --> 00:07:47.300
it depends on who you're dealing
with. It also doesn't -- it's

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:50.804
not identity. It doesn't put the
person in front of the computer.

00:07:50.804 --> 00:07:54.307
So you can go and you can
recover that, and it's, like,

00:07:54.307 --> 00:07:57.544
yeah, that wasn't me. I don't
know what you're talking about.

00:07:57.544 --> 00:08:00.680
Also, you know, it can help with
probable cause, but it's

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:03.316
increasingly becoming a
challenge to use IP address for

00:08:03.316 --> 00:08:05.952
probable cause. Not accurate as
well. Nowadays, mobile hot

00:08:05.952 --> 00:08:08.588
spots. People at Starbucks,
things like that. IP address

00:08:08.588 --> 00:08:11.791
really isn't working very well
and in general takes a really

00:08:11.791 --> 00:08:15.295
long time. When you're trying to
recover a stolen device, it's a

00:08:15.295 --> 00:08:18.231
major hassle because time is of
the essence, especially when

00:08:18.231 --> 00:08:21.167
these devices are getting
fenced. So with this, though, I

00:08:21.167 --> 00:08:24.671
had the first -- first that I
know, the first iPod recovery,

00:08:24.671 --> 00:08:28.475
it wasn't from IP address. I was
getting a lot of these things

00:08:28.475 --> 00:08:31.978
where a lot of kids were
installing on iPods and it was

00:08:31.978 --> 00:08:35.482
easy because a lot of times
these kids would still it and

00:08:35.482 --> 00:08:39.285
they would go home and they
would plug it in, and then it

00:08:39.285 --> 00:08:43.390
would be the -- like the family,
only one kid that had that last

00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:47.193
name. So the school was able to
actually get the iPod back for

00:08:47.193 --> 00:08:51.564
those kids, so -- it was kind of
fun. And I think it was cool

00:08:51.564 --> 00:08:55.068
too, this time we did this, is
this the idea you steal

00:08:55.068 --> 00:08:59.506
something it can be tracked. So
I like to think maybe that had a

00:08:59.506 --> 00:09:02.542
little bit of an impact on
people's wanting to steal these

00:09:02.542 --> 00:09:07.914
devices. And also through this
process, when I learned, all the

00:09:07.914 --> 00:09:10.850
devices working with, I found it
was working with these high end

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:14.954
thermal imaging cameras.
Approached by a company to

00:09:14.954 --> 00:09:18.658
develop a custom agent for them
where we actually would use this

00:09:18.658 --> 00:09:22.028
to protect these devices around
3 --> 000 to $300 --> 000 thermal

00:09:22.028 --> 00:09:26.099
imaging devices. So it was a
very similar process. The one

00:09:26.099 --> 00:09:30.203
thing with this was, they
actually wrote the images to an

00:09:30.203 --> 00:09:35.041
SD card, so, what if someone
takes out the SD card? We wrote

00:09:35.041 --> 00:09:39.512
some custom code in the
firmware, puts in a new SD card

00:09:39.512 --> 00:09:44.350
it will actually write a new
agent backed to the SD card, so

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:49.556
even if you put a new one in,
it's going to block it. What's

00:09:49.556 --> 00:09:52.892
really interesting too is that
they weren't just concerned

00:09:52.892 --> 00:09:56.229
about theft recovery but also
these devices, controlled, and

00:09:56.229 --> 00:10:00.333
they were finding some of these
devices in countries where they

00:10:00.333 --> 00:10:04.070
shouldn't be. That was another
sort of additional measures that

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:08.508
they wanted to take. So if one
of these cameras ended up

00:10:08.508 --> 00:10:12.245
somewhere, was connected to a
computer in Iran, for example,

00:10:12.245 --> 00:10:17.450
they would be able to map that
back to the resaler who sold it.

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:23.022
I -- who sold it. I disguised as
a thermal image of a cat. Meow.

00:10:23.022 --> 00:10:27.127
So this is actually some stuff I
was working. Never actually

00:10:27.127 --> 00:10:31.598
released it. I was looking how
to do similar things with --

00:10:31.598 --> 00:10:36.035
with OSX. You don't have the
auto run capability but you can

00:10:36.035 --> 00:10:40.139
still trick people. One of the
big vulnerabilities I like to

00:10:40.139 --> 00:10:44.244
exploit is greed and stupidity.
But I found some things that

00:10:44.244 --> 00:10:48.448
were really interesting, is that
you know using Apple script, why

00:10:48.448 --> 00:10:52.118
Apple script? Why not objective
C in first I'm a shitty

00:10:52.118 --> 00:10:56.589
programmer and two, Apple script
is trusted. It has a lot of

00:10:56.589 --> 00:10:59.926
interfaces with a lot of other
applications, so if you're

00:10:59.926 --> 00:11:03.563
targeting an Apple system, you
know it's going to have iTunes

00:11:03.563 --> 00:11:07.600
and interface with this, so I
can -- and that's -- leverage.

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:11.971
So one thing I found too was
that, you know, Apple is a

00:11:11.971 --> 00:11:16.009
little tricky. It's kind of
tiny, you guys can't see that. I

00:11:16.009 --> 00:11:19.712
disguise the trojan as MP3 file.
What's interesting with OSX, if

00:11:19.712 --> 00:11:25.418
you try to put like a .MP3 on an
app, it will throw a .app at the

00:11:25.418 --> 00:11:29.789
end of it. So they know it's an
application. The first rule was

00:11:29.789 --> 00:11:34.160
to try to trick that, and use
what's called a homo glip, looks

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:37.830
like a period and Turkish
character, if you put that in

00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:42.535
there instead, it won't throw on
the end and looks like a .MP3. I

00:11:42.535 --> 00:11:47.907
have a demo with this too, I'll
try to do at the end if I have

00:11:47.907 --> 00:11:51.277
time. Further, you can disguise
the icon, pretty simple. And

00:11:51.277 --> 00:11:55.648
I've actually put some of this
code up. I'm going to go through

00:11:55.648 --> 00:11:59.686
some bits of it. There's an
object where you can get system

00:11:59.686 --> 00:12:03.323
nervous. There's also another
one you can get where you can

00:12:03.323 --> 00:12:06.659
get all the applications that
are currently running, which is

00:12:06.659 --> 00:12:09.696
cool. You can then write
scripts. They will then

00:12:09.696 --> 00:12:12.398
interface with those
applications and try to steal

00:12:12.398 --> 00:12:16.402
data. The biggest one was, I was
trying to exfiltrate data. Sure

00:12:16.402 --> 00:12:20.106
you can do things with shell
scripts and what not, but

00:12:20.106 --> 00:12:24.811
sometimes that will throw errors
or alerts. So what I did, I just

00:12:24.811 --> 00:12:28.181
-- I found a way to actually
exfiltrate data through iTunes.

00:12:28.181 --> 00:12:32.885
So I will grab all that data I
want and coding I do. Included

00:12:32.885 --> 00:12:36.923
in the URL here, GitHub page.
Full script. And then I'll pass

00:12:36.923 --> 00:12:40.627
it out through iTunes. So -- and
then, iTunes, actually will

00:12:40.627 --> 00:12:44.697
stream MP3. So you think you're
listening to some music while in

00:12:44.697 --> 00:12:48.735
the background, we're doing some
bad stuff. What's neat too, you

00:12:48.735 --> 00:12:51.137
can actually do shell scripts
from Apple script, which is

00:12:51.137 --> 00:12:54.474
great. I'm not sure if you saw
the new -- vulnerability, I

00:12:54.474 --> 00:12:58.211
threw that in there. Be careful
if you run on your system. It's

00:12:58.211 --> 00:13:02.115
not on the one on GitHub but
still review the code, please. I

00:13:02.115 --> 00:13:08.287
don't want to get in trouble. So
-- so you know, USB is still --

00:13:08.287 --> 00:13:11.824
it's still an attack vector.
Still a threat. You know, we saw

00:13:11.824 --> 00:13:16.095
that with Stuxnet. We've seen
with USB malware. International

00:13:16.095 --> 00:13:20.833
Space Station. UP power plants
actually had -- were infiltrated

00:13:20.833 --> 00:13:25.938
with employee, accidentally
bringing USB sticks. A lot of

00:13:25.938 --> 00:13:30.643
those systems are still running
vulnerable versions of Window,

00:13:30.643 --> 00:13:37.984
pretty much all now. We saw this
again here a Black Hat. Still is

00:13:37.984 --> 00:13:43.322
a threat. So kind of moving on.
You know, IP address. You know,

00:13:43.322 --> 00:13:46.325
that's a one piece of
information, but a lot of times

00:13:46.325 --> 00:13:49.062
you're going to need a lot of
other data. This is a crazy

00:13:49.062 --> 00:13:52.432
wall, you've seen this in all
the CSI shows, trying to track a

00:13:52.432 --> 00:13:54.867
murder. They have all the
evidence and they put these

00:13:54.867 --> 00:13:57.870
lines, right? And that's kind of
the thought process that I

00:13:57.870 --> 00:14:01.808
follow as well. Tools that make
this a lot easier nowadays are

00:14:01.808 --> 00:14:06.045
Maltego, automates a lot of that
process. I'm not sure if you've

00:14:06.045 --> 00:14:10.616
used it, a pretty great tool and
you can actually write all the

00:14:10.616 --> 00:14:14.587
custom transforms to do all of
this work. But basically, I had

00:14:14.587 --> 00:14:17.590
a case where I was -- flash
drive, give you an example. We

00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:21.294
were able to get the initial IP
address, and it was a weird

00:14:21.294 --> 00:14:23.296
username too. It wasn't
something that would actually

00:14:23.296 --> 00:14:28.634
identify a person, and we mapped
the -- and AT & T subscriber. AT

00:14:28.634 --> 00:14:31.771
& T is going to take three
months to track it down and the

00:14:31.771 --> 00:14:35.475
flash drive, from a professor,
and he had some research data on

00:14:35.475 --> 00:14:38.144
it. But it was still hard to
convince law enforcement to use

00:14:38.144 --> 00:14:42.682
their resources to track the
down. But we did start getting

00:14:42.682 --> 00:14:46.419
connections from a university,
and specific computer lab. So

00:14:46.419 --> 00:14:50.556
that was useful. Because we also
get the internal network

00:14:50.556 --> 00:14:55.128
information, which is useful, so
we went to the university IT

00:14:55.128 --> 00:14:58.331
Department, their campus
security and we found that,

00:14:58.331 --> 00:15:00.967
yeah, so we got a time stamp. We
have an internal address, but

00:15:00.967 --> 00:15:05.304
these are guest computers, so
not a student ID when log in, so

00:15:05.304 --> 00:15:08.708
still not able to get the
specific person but I started

00:15:08.708 --> 00:15:11.778
asking questions, what other
data sources do we have here,

00:15:11.778 --> 00:15:16.115
and come to find out, you have
to swipe your student ID card to

00:15:16.115 --> 00:15:20.119
get in, and so they have logs
there, right? So we're able to

00:15:20.119 --> 00:15:24.457
access those logs. We -- time
stamp. Now we have a list of who

00:15:24.457 --> 00:15:27.827
is in the actual room. Also, a
year before, systems actually

00:15:27.827 --> 00:15:31.831
stolen out of that lab, and so
they actually had cameras as

00:15:31.831 --> 00:15:34.433
well. What's really cool a lot
of people don't realize, a lot

00:15:34.433 --> 00:15:37.603
of these cameras, when actually
store the data, also a log file

00:15:37.603 --> 00:15:40.339
that gets generated so able to
correlate that time stamp as

00:15:40.339 --> 00:15:42.575
well to identify who
specifically was in that room

00:15:42.575 --> 00:15:47.013
and they were able to use this
information, found out who it

00:15:47.013 --> 00:15:53.553
was. You know, had professor, as
well as the campus security

00:15:53.553 --> 00:15:57.089
outside of the guy's classroom
the next and he got his device

00:15:57.089 --> 00:16:03.963
back. All of his information was
still there. Yay. So after

00:16:03.963 --> 00:16:07.667
working with USB devices, I
wanted to find ways of, you

00:16:07.667 --> 00:16:10.069
know, looking how to recover
more expensive devices like

00:16:10.069 --> 00:16:14.207
laptops. I looked at a lot of
existing tools and relied

00:16:14.207 --> 00:16:18.744
heavily on the IP address. As I
mentioned before, it takes a lot

00:16:18.744 --> 00:16:21.514
of time. Some of them --
actually they'll utilize more

00:16:21.514 --> 00:16:25.184
invasive techniques as well,
open up back door to the system,

00:16:25.184 --> 00:16:30.022
recovery teams that can deploy
that. They can install key --

00:16:30.022 --> 00:16:35.394
and other things like that,
which I found not to be overly

00:16:35.394 --> 00:16:39.866
intrusive and makes the system
more vulnerable. Stuff in the

00:16:39.866 --> 00:16:44.470
firmware and muck with that, a
lot of risks. We don't need to

00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:47.039
go to that extreme. I think
there's other ways of going

00:16:47.039 --> 00:16:51.277
about it, recovering devices. So
I combined utilizing the web

00:16:51.277 --> 00:16:55.414
camera, and with Wi-Fi-based
location. A company already

00:16:55.414 --> 00:16:58.951
doing the web camera on the MAC,
but no one was utilizing Wi-Fi

00:16:58.951 --> 00:17:01.888
location, this is where I --
when the first iPhone came out,

00:17:01.888 --> 00:17:06.125
was using. I worked with
Skyhook, got that deployed for

00:17:06.125 --> 00:17:09.762
this. So able to get
geolocation, able to get camera

00:17:09.762 --> 00:17:13.366
information, so this was sort of
a game changer, especially for

00:17:13.366 --> 00:17:17.336
law enforcement. Some challenges
with it. The way it worked, you

00:17:17.336 --> 00:17:20.373
would activate tracking on a
remote server, the device would

00:17:20.373 --> 00:17:23.476
check in to see if it's been
stolen, if it's been flagged,

00:17:23.476 --> 00:17:27.480
supposed to start on gathering
evidence and a lot of things to

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:31.183
trigger. Moved to new network,
IP address changed, log in

00:17:31.183 --> 00:17:35.288
event. Pretty smart. Would know
if it changed location, that it

00:17:35.288 --> 00:17:39.191
would also check in. And so it
would then send information, and

00:17:39.191 --> 00:17:42.028
at the time I didn't want to
manage a server, especially with

00:17:42.028 --> 00:17:45.431
photos and things like that, so
we just had a -- had it go

00:17:45.431 --> 00:17:48.768
director into Flickr. You
register your Flickr account,

00:17:48.768 --> 00:17:51.237
that way you have control of all
your data. You don't have to

00:17:51.237 --> 00:17:54.140
worry about a third party
accessing your information. Or

00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:56.509
activating your camera and
spying on you. I don't trust

00:17:56.509 --> 00:18:01.380
myself. So laptop would connect,
it would get location from

00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:04.550
Wi-Fi, it would capture photos,
and it would do this every 30

00:18:04.550 --> 00:18:07.119
minutes and it would do it very
quickly, so the green light, it

00:18:07.119 --> 00:18:09.755
would be just like a blip. You
wouldn't even notice it was on.

00:18:12.825 --> 00:18:16.495
So for location, use Skyhook
wireless, a great service. But

00:18:16.495 --> 00:18:19.966
now geolocation is embedded in
all the operating systems, APIs

00:18:19.966 --> 00:18:24.737
for it, and pretty much every
major -- laptop as well as

00:18:24.737 --> 00:18:27.807
mobile operating systems. You
can also get location from the

00:18:27.807 --> 00:18:31.811
Google map API, here's kind of
-- how to go about doing that.

00:18:31.811 --> 00:18:35.815
So if you want to write your own
scripts to track your devices,

00:18:35.815 --> 00:18:39.819
that's a good way to go. So the
first recovery I had was

00:18:39.819 --> 00:18:44.123
actually with this tool was in
New York. A -- I had to work

00:18:44.123 --> 00:18:48.728
with a New York police officer
who was kind of an A hole. He --

00:18:48.728 --> 00:18:52.431
he was basically saying -- he
was really frustrated, he had to

00:18:52.431 --> 00:18:55.801
deal with these types of tools
before and all pissed off

00:18:55.801 --> 00:18:59.205
because he's going to have to
deal with paperwork. I'm, like,

00:18:59.205 --> 00:19:02.842
no, you're fine. The location is
within ten to 20 meters. He

00:19:02.842 --> 00:19:06.712
goes, okay, what's that mean?
Print out a photo of the guy, go

00:19:06.712 --> 00:19:09.882
to that location, ask around.
He's, like, don't tell me how to

00:19:09.882 --> 00:19:15.187
do my job, right? [ Laughter ]
But then -- and then he did.

00:19:15.187 --> 00:19:18.391
Right. And they go in, and it
was this owner of a tattoo

00:19:18.391 --> 00:19:21.527
parlor, and if you look at the
photo in the background, you're

00:19:21.527 --> 00:19:25.631
going to see a lot of cool toys.
So there's a nice big-screened

00:19:25.631 --> 00:19:29.235
TV, there's all sorts of cool
synthesizers, all kinds of audio

00:19:29.235 --> 00:19:33.272
equipment and when the police
finally went in there, they

00:19:33.272 --> 00:19:37.610
found the customers, it was an
iMac, and they also found three

00:19:37.610 --> 00:19:41.213
laptops from different cases,
and a lot of other stolen

00:19:41.213 --> 00:19:44.850
property. So this is one of
those examples where you

00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:49.922
trojanize an app and then the
trojan app is sort of -- sort of

00:19:49.922 --> 00:19:53.159
unveils all these different
crimes being committed. That one

00:19:53.159 --> 00:19:57.530
I said we had a 300% recovery
rate because the other laptops

00:19:57.530 --> 00:20:01.500
were recovered. So another case
we had was in Portland, Oregon,

00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:05.471
where I live, there was a group
that was repeatedly breaking

00:20:05.471 --> 00:20:09.108
into schools. So they were
targeting a bunch of Portland

00:20:09.108 --> 00:20:13.079
schools, they would go in and
kept stealing laptops. What was

00:20:13.079 --> 00:20:16.348
really frustrating, they would
do this continuously. They would

00:20:16.348 --> 00:20:20.319
go in, they would steal the
laptops. District go and replace

00:20:20.319 --> 00:20:24.657
laptops, a week later they would
come back this and steal again.

00:20:24.657 --> 00:20:29.729
It was really -- it was, like --
it was like four or five

00:20:29.729 --> 00:20:32.998
different schools this kept
happening to. I approached them,

00:20:32.998 --> 00:20:38.070
I said, hey, I got an idea. So
we deployed this software to a

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:42.408
bunch of date laptops and left
them out. We didn't put in

00:20:42.408 --> 00:20:46.378
locked cabinets, let them out
there. A week later, got ripped

00:20:46.378 --> 00:20:50.783
off. So we got the network
information, and this was a bit

00:20:50.783 --> 00:20:53.919
of a challenge. We're getting
some photos, and we actually got

00:20:53.919 --> 00:20:57.556
it to a house that was in
Vancouver, Washington, so that's

00:20:57.556 --> 00:21:01.460
the next state over, right next
to Portland. And we got the

00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:05.231
location to this one -- one
particular neighborhood. And

00:21:05.231 --> 00:21:08.667
again, the location is within
ten to 20 meters, so I told them

00:21:08.667 --> 00:21:11.871
about this, and gave the
information, and the detective

00:21:11.871 --> 00:21:14.707
working on it, he goes there and
he thinks it's an exact

00:21:14.707 --> 00:21:18.477
location. He goes to this one --
it's a duplex and he goes to one

00:21:18.477 --> 00:21:20.980
side of it and the guy that
answers the door, he knows him.

00:21:20.980 --> 00:21:23.349
It's the guy that works on his
roof. He's all pissed off at me,

00:21:23.349 --> 00:21:26.452
you guys don't know what the
hell you're doing. So I was

00:21:26.452 --> 00:21:30.489
pissed off so I drove out there,
and I started actually looking

00:21:30.489 --> 00:21:35.060
at the wireless. A little street
there, I pulled in. And pulled

00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:39.231
out my laptop and I started
looking at the wireless networks

00:21:39.231 --> 00:21:43.035
in area, make sure accurate.
Wireless network, Russia, and I

00:21:43.035 --> 00:21:48.374
look over and right next to --
on the other side of the duplex

00:21:48.374 --> 00:21:52.545
there's a car and there's this
big, like, Russian pride bumper

00:21:52.545 --> 00:21:57.116
sticker on the car. And then
look in there, girl comes out,

00:21:57.116 --> 00:22:02.021
starts watching the car. The guy
we have a photo of walks out.

00:22:02.021 --> 00:22:07.359
Oh, shit. He looks at me -- on
my laptop, right, like I'm lost.

00:22:07.359 --> 00:22:12.731
I called the detective and they
came out and then finally they

00:22:12.731 --> 00:22:15.901
-- they were able to continue
the investigation. What's

00:22:15.901 --> 00:22:18.571
interesting with this, they
never actually told software was

00:22:18.571 --> 00:22:23.075
involved in their case. I was an
anonymous source, and they ended

00:22:23.075 --> 00:22:27.346
up arresting six to seven people
that were in this case. It was

00:22:27.346 --> 00:22:30.182
an organized group. They were
stealing a lot of other property

00:22:30.182 --> 00:22:33.185
as well. Some of them were
pretty bad dudes, and they got

00:22:33.185 --> 00:22:36.388
them to think that they'd all
ratted on each other. So it was

00:22:36.388 --> 00:22:42.061
kind of cool. So for some
reason, there's a lot of sort of

00:22:42.061 --> 00:22:44.663
-- these Russian guys that are
involved in stealing property in

00:22:44.663 --> 00:22:48.500
Oregon. I was involved in
another case where the laptop

00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:50.502
was stolen and we didn't get
anything for like, two weeks.

00:22:50.502 --> 00:22:53.873
I'm, like, oh, man, they
reformatted the hard drive or

00:22:53.873 --> 00:22:57.109
something, right? I tracked --
starting getting -- in Missouri,

00:22:57.109 --> 00:23:02.047
of all places. I'm, like, how
the hell did that happen, right?

00:23:02.047 --> 00:23:07.453
We're getting this, and a guy
named Victor, and he -- who was

00:23:07.453 --> 00:23:12.024
nice enough to change the
username on the computer to his

00:23:12.024 --> 00:23:16.562
full name. Nice of him to do.
Really trying to help us out.

00:23:16.562 --> 00:23:18.831
But I had photos from
everywhere. The first one we

00:23:18.831 --> 00:23:21.634
had, McDonald's. And then at one
point he was in a hotel. That

00:23:21.634 --> 00:23:25.604
was really shady, a girl behind
him. Something going on there.

00:23:25.604 --> 00:23:31.610
But I was able to find -- yeah,
I found his Myspace profile, and

00:23:34.113 --> 00:23:37.016
I was really -- noticed he's
into Scion. Car nut. He has a

00:23:37.016 --> 00:23:39.318
bunch of posts on a lot of
different forums on Scion

00:23:39.318 --> 00:23:42.721
showing off car. He gave me his
license plate number. He was

00:23:42.721 --> 00:23:45.858
also a big eBay seller, he was
selling -- he had a store,

00:23:45.858 --> 00:23:50.529
selling all kinds of car parts.
Kind of tell what kind of

00:23:50.529 --> 00:23:56.835
business he was involved in. And
then he was nice too -- not so

00:23:56.835 --> 00:24:02.141
nice, he sold stolen laptop to
his friend, O'Mar, as well as

00:24:02.141 --> 00:24:07.079
stolen bike. What happened when
police went in, the first time

00:24:07.079 --> 00:24:11.583
we worked with district
attorney, he said you guys have

00:24:11.583 --> 00:24:16.822
given us enough evidence, even
if he doesn't have the laptop,

00:24:16.822 --> 00:24:19.591
we can bust him for possession
of stolen property. That was

00:24:19.591 --> 00:24:22.027
kind of interesting, start
making case law. But they --

00:24:22.027 --> 00:24:25.564
what was happening is that
there's a Russian group that was

00:24:25.564 --> 00:24:29.068
here in Portland. They would
steal a bunch of property. Load

00:24:29.068 --> 00:24:32.538
it into this big white van and
another Russian group in

00:24:32.538 --> 00:24:35.174
Missouri, and they would swap
stolen property. Where's the

00:24:35.174 --> 00:24:38.978
first place you're going to look
when your laptop gets stolen?

00:24:38.978 --> 00:24:42.481
Craigslist, right. So they're
kind of smart there. Not that

00:24:42.481 --> 00:24:48.120
smart. We got them. Oh, yeah,
and Victor too. It was actually

00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:52.091
his dad who was involved -- it
was a birthday present. So his

00:24:52.091 --> 00:24:57.529
dad, nice guy, gave him a stolen
laptop for his birthday. Now he

00:24:57.529 --> 00:25:02.401
has a criminal record. Thanks,
Dad. There was another case

00:25:02.401 --> 00:25:05.237
where we had -- I was in Brazil,
not just the U.S. A little bit

00:25:05.237 --> 00:25:08.006
of a challenge, working with the
Brazilian police, but there was

00:25:08.006 --> 00:25:12.277
a -- a couple guys that were in
their car. And these guys came

00:25:12.277 --> 00:25:19.918
out with guns, and you know,
said, get out of the car, and

00:25:19.918 --> 00:25:22.154
then the driver, they punched
him in the face, knocked him to

00:25:22.154 --> 00:25:24.890
the ground and kicked him. He
had like broken ribs and a

00:25:24.890 --> 00:25:29.762
broken nose, and then guy who
actually installed my software,

00:25:29.762 --> 00:25:33.599
he left his laptop, was still in
the back. So we started getting

00:25:33.599 --> 00:25:39.605
pings, and then the police were
actually really excited about

00:25:46.912 --> 00:25:50.182
this, but they were -- I guess
they did -- quite a bit, right?

00:25:50.182 --> 00:25:53.218
So they were assaulting a lot of
other people as well, stole a

00:25:53.218 --> 00:25:56.221
lot of vehicles. But just a good
example of how this can work

00:25:56.221 --> 00:25:58.557
internationally as well. It
doesn't have to be the U.S.

00:25:58.557 --> 00:26:00.559
Sometimes it depends on law
enforcement, how willing they

00:26:00.559 --> 00:26:03.362
are to help out. There's ways of
convincing them. And here's the

00:26:03.362 --> 00:26:05.464
customer with his laptop bag.
Veterinary student too. Just

00:26:05.464 --> 00:26:08.000
finished dissertation and didn't
have it backed up. So he was

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:11.870
really happy to get it back. So
then I also moved on to mobile.

00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:15.174
So mobile is a little
challenging, geolocation is

00:26:15.174 --> 00:26:19.311
easier, I'm in the device
itself. But IP addresses becomes

00:26:19.311 --> 00:26:22.981
much more problematic. We also
want to -- we found people

00:26:22.981 --> 00:26:26.251
really don't care so much about
the device as the data. So we

00:26:26.251 --> 00:26:30.522
built a system for backing up
photo and contact information.

00:26:30.522 --> 00:26:33.692
And I was really concerned about
actually doing that, like

00:26:33.692 --> 00:26:39.698
storing people's photos on a
server, you know, first of all,

00:26:44.136 --> 00:26:46.138
get hacked and someone accesses
all of customer's photos, really

00:26:46.138 --> 00:26:48.140
bad. Contact information as
well. We saw this with -- that

00:26:48.140 --> 00:26:50.142
the risks that are associated
with that. And so we built a

00:26:50.142 --> 00:26:53.712
system so that when you actually
install the app, you enter a

00:26:53.712 --> 00:26:57.149
key, a privacy key, so it will
-- it actually encrypts images

00:26:57.149 --> 00:27:00.652
and contact information before
it sends it to the server. I

00:27:00.652 --> 00:27:04.223
like this too because if we do
get hacked, we're -- data is

00:27:04.223 --> 00:27:07.426
still protected. Also if law
enforcement comes to us and they

00:27:07.426 --> 00:27:11.396
want information, yeah, here you
go. Big encrypted blob and they

00:27:11.396 --> 00:27:14.299
have to go to the customer to
get that key. So, umm -- and

00:27:14.299 --> 00:27:20.305
then you can also do the data
wipe and things like that. So I

00:27:25.844 --> 00:27:30.649
-- I built this tool, and -- and
I have a little bit of a video

00:27:30.649 --> 00:27:34.486
to walk through one of the
cases. So I'll -- hopefully the

00:27:34.486 --> 00:27:37.689
video works. >> Helping track

the stolen phones. >> Able not
to only find the GPS location

happens in the phone. >> That
activity turned out to be

00:28:29.875 --> 00:28:32.811
pictures. Someone took shortly
after the phones were stolen.

Admit it's a brave new world
when pictures taken on cell

00:28:36.515 --> 00:28:40.252

pictures once stolen. >> That

00:28:40.252 --> 00:28:44.790
has not only peaked the interest
of our investigators but in

00:28:44.790 --> 00:28:49.027

phone. Back to you. >> Thank
you, Ed. Teach out. The

00:29:58.030 --> 00:30:04.236

Thank you. So you know, helpful

00:30:04.236 --> 00:30:09.775
-- we had the footage, again,
kind of like I was talking about

00:30:09.775 --> 00:30:13.945
with the video camera footage
that's helpful. Actually see

00:30:13.945 --> 00:30:19.017
where you caught it. We have
some challenges with some of

00:30:19.017 --> 00:30:24.556
these devices because the -- the
-- for some reason, the GPS

00:30:24.556 --> 00:30:28.727
coordinates with software --
luckily the photos they were

00:30:28.727 --> 00:30:33.365
taking of themselves, embedded
in it. Time stamp as well.

00:30:33.365 --> 00:30:37.035
Stupidity one of the
vulnerabilities that helps us

00:30:37.035 --> 00:30:41.673
out. Location as well. The trip
permit, that's just ridiculous.

00:30:41.673 --> 00:30:47.212
But they ended up getting these
guys, and they -- again, they

00:30:47.212 --> 00:30:52.751
ended up -- five guys that were
involved in this, and actually

00:30:52.751 --> 00:30:55.787
stealing other property. One of
these guys actually had a

00:30:55.787 --> 00:30:58.757
warrant out for his arrest
already. And they also, in the

00:30:58.757 --> 00:31:01.159
process of investigating this,
they also recovered a stolen

00:31:01.159 --> 00:31:05.797
car, so -- and so what I learned
from this too, I started looking

00:31:05.797 --> 00:31:09.935
at the data that's actually
embedded in the images where

00:31:09.935 --> 00:31:13.171
it's really helpful, so there's
a lot of metadata actually

00:31:13.171 --> 00:31:16.575
embedded in it. You're probably
familiar with it. GPS

00:31:16.575 --> 00:31:20.011
coordinates, time stamp. High
digital cameras, embed model and

00:31:20.011 --> 00:31:24.549
serial number and really good
tool here, URL called -- if you

00:31:24.549 --> 00:31:29.855
want to mess with data and write
scripts to do this kind of work

00:31:29.855 --> 00:31:34.760
you think do that. I also have a
tool called -- scan.com, where

00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:40.065
you can upload an image and you
can see what -- if there's GPS

00:31:40.065 --> 00:31:44.236
coordinates or serial numbers
embedded in it. You can do that.

00:31:44.236 --> 00:31:48.406
And one thing I found is that
there's several camera brands

00:31:48.406 --> 00:31:52.577
that actually will embed that
serial number, and many of them

00:31:52.577 --> 00:31:57.883
are high end cameras, so I
wanted to go out and see if I

00:31:57.883 --> 00:32:01.920
could, you know, use this for
tracking stolen cameras, and one

00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:04.356
thing I found too, I had a
reporter that actually asked me,

00:32:04.356 --> 00:32:07.359
a thing about a celebrities
getting nude photos hacked. And

00:32:07.359 --> 00:32:11.196
the -- the media kept saying,
yeah, the phones were hacked,

00:32:11.196 --> 00:32:13.598
but in actuality, the data
revealed actually multiple

00:32:13.598 --> 00:32:16.935
phones over the course of
several years, so the odds of it

00:32:16.935 --> 00:32:21.373
being one device hacked was very
slim. The point of compromise

00:32:21.373 --> 00:32:24.509
was actually e-mail. Guy named
Chris Cheney, just guessing

00:32:24.509 --> 00:32:28.880
passwords, now serving ten years
in jail. So I looked at, like,

00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:33.185
how can I use this information?
There wasn't a way to actually

00:32:33.185 --> 00:32:38.623
search for it. You can search
for a serial number. Sometimes

00:32:38.623 --> 00:32:43.462
you'll see something on Flickr,
but I was, like, I want a

00:32:43.462 --> 00:32:46.431
database of this data where I
can actually go through. And

00:32:46.431 --> 00:32:49.835
identify that, so I worked an
experiment -- and experimented

00:32:49.835 --> 00:32:52.304
with something. I was actually
helping another startup friend

00:32:52.304 --> 00:32:55.373
of mine. They were doing a thing
called CP usage, where you can

00:32:55.373 --> 00:32:59.744
-- you give up your idle
computer time, and they'll give

00:32:59.744 --> 00:33:03.548
you money for utilizing that, so
a punch of computer labs,

00:33:03.548 --> 00:33:06.952
universities were using this.
Sort of like -- but for other

00:33:06.952 --> 00:33:11.823
projects, right? And then you as
researcher could harness the

00:33:11.823 --> 00:33:15.760
power of thousands. I wanted to
go through and mine Flickr. The

00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:19.030
way it works, wrote scripts that
go out and hit the Flickr API.

00:33:19.030 --> 00:33:24.803
It was very restrictive how many
calls you can make. Trying to do

00:33:24.803 --> 00:33:30.141
that from one system and trying
to do it quickly, they're going

00:33:30.141 --> 00:33:35.714
to block you. Actually talked
with a friend of mine who -- who

00:33:35.714 --> 00:33:38.717
they had some issues, they saw
the data and they saw the

00:33:38.717 --> 00:33:41.853
reports coming through, Yahoo
and trying to figure out who

00:33:41.853 --> 00:33:46.524
this was. And it was me. But we
-- so we -- we basically were

00:33:46.524 --> 00:33:50.095
allowed -- we had about 200
computers at our disposal and

00:33:50.095 --> 00:33:53.665
went through and mined all of
Flickr. It took about three

00:33:53.665 --> 00:33:58.203
weeks to a month, and it was
like 4 billion images, so we had

00:33:58.203 --> 00:34:02.374
this huge database. And then I
put it out there in the media

00:34:02.374 --> 00:34:06.578
that this was available, and the
way that it works, you know, I

00:34:06.578 --> 00:34:10.482
also mined 500 -- I found other
ones, Twitter, some other sites

00:34:10.482 --> 00:34:14.386
as well. Harvesting some data
from there. So the way it was

00:34:14.386 --> 00:34:17.622
working, we would harvest this
information and you can actually

00:34:17.622 --> 00:34:21.860
put in the serial number of your
camera, and then it will show

00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:26.398
back results all the images that
we found. So the idea is that if

00:34:26.398 --> 00:34:30.635
your camera was stolen and three
months later you see a photo get

00:34:30.635 --> 00:34:34.539
upload to Flickr, you can go
recover your camera and a proof

00:34:34.539 --> 00:34:38.443
of concept, but it worked. We
actually -- John Heller, he saw

00:34:38.443 --> 00:34:42.347
this service. He actually had a
camera that was stolen when he

00:34:42.347 --> 00:34:45.583
was on assignment for Getty
Images, $9 --> 000 worth of camera

00:34:45.583 --> 00:34:49.154
gear gone. A contractor, not
going to get that back. It's

00:34:49.154 --> 00:34:53.391
pretty hurtful here. But he did
a search. And then he found an

00:34:53.391 --> 00:34:56.962
image on Flickr, uploaded, well
after it was stolen, and that

00:34:56.962 --> 00:34:59.564
mapped to Facebook, to another
professional photographer, and

00:34:59.564 --> 00:35:03.868
he was -- had a photo of all of
his gear, and there, sure

00:35:03.868 --> 00:35:08.440
enough, was his camera. The LA
PD got involved and what

00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:12.110
happened was, the thief he stole
the camera from him, sold it on

00:35:12.110 --> 00:35:15.447
Craigslist, and then the guy
that bought it from him on

00:35:15.447 --> 00:35:19.150
Craigslist, sold it on eBay. The
person actually had it actually

00:35:19.150 --> 00:35:23.121
had no idea it was stolen. The
police went in, were able to

00:35:23.121 --> 00:35:27.659
recover it. The guy that got it
on eBay, he went to the seller

00:35:27.659 --> 00:35:32.197
and was able to get his money
back, yay, not the other guy --

00:35:32.197 --> 00:35:36.735
the other guy, not so much. The
year after it was stolen to the

00:35:36.735 --> 00:35:39.971
apartment, the guy bought on
Craigslist, the guy was still

00:35:39.971 --> 00:35:43.541
there, all kinds of other stolen
property. The first recovery of

00:35:43.541 --> 00:35:47.445
its kind I have ever seen about
that. Here's the report there.

00:35:47.445 --> 00:35:51.650
But, yeah, he got arrested. So
had another case where a guy,

00:35:51.650 --> 00:35:53.718
Craigslist, I'm going to start
calling it crime list or

00:35:53.718 --> 00:35:56.121
something, because that seems to
be where all this stuff

00:35:56.121 --> 00:35:59.624
happening. A bunch of camera
gear before he moved, and a guy

00:35:59.624 --> 00:36:04.262
came with cash in his hand. He
wanted to take a look at this

00:36:04.262 --> 00:36:08.933
camera he was selling. Takes him
out to the garage, shows him the

00:36:08.933 --> 00:36:13.605
box. The guy just pops him one,
knocks to the ground and runs

00:36:13.605 --> 00:36:17.942
off. So -- he actually found
images that were mapped to it.

00:36:17.942 --> 00:36:22.614
Help with this. We got a lot of
information about this guy. And

00:36:22.614 --> 00:36:26.584
all the other photos he was
uploading to other social media

00:36:26.584 --> 00:36:30.188
websites as well, and he was
doing some pretty interesting

00:36:30.188 --> 00:36:33.458
things, you know, taking photos
of themselves, speaking weed,

00:36:33.458 --> 00:36:37.395
driving down the freeway, photo
of himself with a gun, showing

00:36:37.395 --> 00:36:42.100
how hard core he is. And also
took a photo of his speedometer,

00:36:42.100 --> 00:36:46.404
going 110 miles an hour down the
freeway while smoking dope and

00:36:46.404 --> 00:36:49.841
we had the time stamp
geolocation and everything, so

00:36:49.841 --> 00:36:55.213
law enforcement really liked
that. [ Laughter ] >>

00:36:55.213 --> 00:36:59.017
Vulnerability stupidity. And
tool was actually used by ICE,

00:36:59.017 --> 00:37:02.020
really interested in using this
in trial exploitation

00:37:02.020 --> 00:37:06.591
investigations unit. So at the
do some really cool work where a

00:37:06.591 --> 00:37:10.028
lot of these guys that are
actually victimizing children,

00:37:10.028 --> 00:37:13.832
there's some sick forums out
there, actually be giving each

00:37:13.832 --> 00:37:18.036
other advice. Actually upload
photos, young girl, I have in my

00:37:18.036 --> 00:37:22.974
car, and they can actually look
at some of the images, the ICE

00:37:22.974 --> 00:37:27.178
guys, road sign or something
like that, to look for some

00:37:27.178 --> 00:37:31.349
indicators they can go and try
to stop this before anything

00:37:31.349 --> 00:37:35.186
happens. And so they were
actually utilizing this tool as

00:37:35.186 --> 00:37:39.357
well, so the idea is that, you
know, Joe Pervert, he's

00:37:39.357 --> 00:37:43.561
uploading child porn, and maybe
he's using the same camera when

00:37:43.561 --> 00:37:47.766
he goes to Disneyland, photos
with family. Image, and you map

00:37:47.766 --> 00:37:51.936
that and correlate that with a
camera on Flickr, for example,

00:37:51.936 --> 00:37:57.275
that can help them ID a suspect.
I'm not sure if it was ever

00:37:57.275 --> 00:38:01.045
used, caught anybody, they
couldn't tell me. I thought it

00:38:01.045 --> 00:38:05.617
was kind of a cool application
of it. So basically what I

00:38:05.617 --> 00:38:10.188
learned a lot, there's a lot of
pieces of information out there

00:38:10.188 --> 00:38:15.126
that can be used to identify a
suspect. This is -- he's the

00:38:15.126 --> 00:38:18.963
grandfather of forensic science
and he has this thing called

00:38:18.963 --> 00:38:22.000
Locard's exchange principle,
every contact leads a trace.

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:25.804
Physical crimes. I believe that
actually carries over into the

00:38:25.804 --> 00:38:30.608
digital world as well, from my
experience. We have all these

00:38:30.608 --> 00:38:34.179
pieces of data, IP addresses, I
get really worried about all

00:38:34.179 --> 00:38:38.049
these different breaches that
are happening. We have all these

00:38:38.049 --> 00:38:40.385
data points, and we start to
correlate them, we can actually

00:38:40.385 --> 00:38:43.421
start to create a rich profile
of an individual and then we

00:38:43.421 --> 00:38:47.025
talk about -- all the different
places where we can find those

00:38:47.025 --> 00:38:50.028
indicators from device IDs,
things that we may not even

00:38:50.028 --> 00:38:53.331
think about right now they can
identify. Technology can exist a

00:38:53.331 --> 00:38:57.202
year from now that will allow us
to mine that and identify us.

00:38:57.202 --> 00:39:00.138
And I talk about interaction of
things. There's data that's

00:39:00.138 --> 00:39:03.741
created by us that we're aware
of. There's data created for us,

00:39:03.741 --> 00:39:07.512
that we may not be aware of.
There's also data created about

00:39:07.512 --> 00:39:10.782
us, that correlates all of this
information. So I really worry

00:39:10.782 --> 00:39:14.519
about the marketing groups in
particular. And then what I call

00:39:14.519 --> 00:39:17.522
boogie data. So a lot of people
don't realize when you send an

00:39:17.522 --> 00:39:21.159
SNS message for example, the
other person deletes it, there's

00:39:21.159 --> 00:39:26.064
20 log files that get generated
at least through the carrier. So

00:39:26.064 --> 00:39:29.334
there's always a trace
somewhere, talk about Ashley

00:39:29.334 --> 00:39:33.438
Madison, things like that, our
privacy being protected when in

00:39:33.438 --> 00:39:37.942
actuality it's not. So I call
this boogie data because it's

00:39:37.942 --> 00:39:42.847
information that's out there,
and it's -- it can come back and

00:39:42.847 --> 00:39:48.586
haunt us later. It -- it's going
to hit us really hard. I've been

00:39:48.586 --> 00:39:51.856
working with a group, privacy
century, application, called

00:39:51.856 --> 00:39:54.726
spyware.b and looking at
applications accessing your

00:39:54.726 --> 00:39:57.996
location and sending that
information. We've been doing

00:39:57.996 --> 00:40:01.266
some really interesting research
here, identifying some very

00:40:01.266 --> 00:40:04.135
popular applications that are
actually gathering location,

00:40:04.135 --> 00:40:09.340
your IMEI -- sending to servers
in China, for example. And

00:40:09.340 --> 00:40:12.710
that's it for my talk here. If
you guys have questions, feel

00:40:12.710 --> 00:40:15.079
free to reach out to me on
Twitter or on my e-mail. Do we

00:40:15.079 --> 00:40:18.316
have more time? Five minutes.
Okay. I'm going to do a quick

00:40:18.316 --> 00:40:24.322
demo. See if this works. Demo
gods. Here's the Trojan. Dot

00:40:26.658 --> 00:40:32.597
app. Another one, MP3. Double
click on this, network

00:40:32.597 --> 00:40:38.603
connection works, we should see
it in action. [ Music playing ]

00:40:40.905 --> 00:40:43.708
Thanks a lot, guys. [ Inaudible
