00:00:00.334 --> 00:00:03.904
I want to say I come from Norway
and there is a lot of people. So

00:00:03.904 --> 00:00:09.910
coming all the way from Norway
to bring a touch of pin for you.

00:00:14.348 --> 00:00:21.822
I just completed my master
thesis at MITS. The

00:00:21.822 --> 00:00:27.961
administration just switched it
to last let's because someone

00:00:27.961 --> 00:00:33.967
created a lot of T-shirts so I
work at a company called -- and

00:00:36.537 --> 00:00:42.543
I am full time developer. So
let's get started. At first.

00:00:44.544 --> 00:00:50.550
Everyone knows that humans are
predictable and when you talk

00:00:54.054 --> 00:00:59.993
about security that is kind of
not a good thing. So when you

00:01:02.062 --> 00:01:08.068
look at -- lost audio -- and you
cannot use the same strategies

00:01:40.233 --> 00:01:46.239
and a passwords so just to give
a recap with pin codes there are

00:01:49.309 --> 00:01:55.315
10 --> 000 combinations how many pin
codes are patterns does the

00:01:58.952 --> 00:02:04.891
android pattern have? That is
bigger number than the pin code

00:02:10.464 --> 00:02:16.470
and the interesting thing is the
numbers for you -- when you go

00:02:26.513 --> 00:02:32.119
into -- when I started this
project, I started to think

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:38.125
about how people created their
pin codes and the passwords as a

00:02:41.495 --> 00:02:47.501
set of using names and names and
date of birth but the android

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:55.742
catalog you can't use those in.
So what do you do to predict

00:02:55.742 --> 00:03:03.517
people's patterns so I start add
data and additional data about

00:03:03.517 --> 00:03:09.523
the patterns or the users that
created the patterns. So created

00:03:14.461 --> 00:03:20.467
a pattern. If you look you can
guess I think it was kind of

00:03:28.341 --> 00:03:34.347
funny because the people that I
used the ALP that is dark color,

00:03:41.688 --> 00:03:44.925
and the light color is the
people that I have not used the

00:03:44.925 --> 00:03:51.932
ALP before. As you see the
numbers that the reaction time.

00:03:51.932 --> 00:03:58.805
How fast the response where
creating the patterns and as you

00:03:58.805 --> 00:04:02.109
see for the smart phone people
that created a patterns have

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:08.115
used the pattern lock before.
Responding very quickly. You can

00:04:10.117 --> 00:04:16.389
guess what's or why they were
giving the patterns. So

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:22.395
predictable. What factors can
you look at when you predict

00:04:27.267 --> 00:04:34.341
someone pattern? You have two
hands and you might be right or

00:04:34.341 --> 00:04:40.347
left handed. Writing direction.
And your phone has a screen

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:47.654
size. You have difference in
gender and age. I want to say

00:04:47.654 --> 00:04:53.660
something about the complexity
because the pattern lock is not

00:04:58.498 --> 00:05:04.437
the same as another other
pattern lock or pin code you

00:05:09.643 --> 00:05:14.080
cannot just code a pat learn
lock based on the number of

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:20.086
corrective notes. So I used the
math formula to give each

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:29.696
pattern a score just how visual
complex is the pattern. I will

00:05:29.696 --> 00:05:35.702
give you example. So the blue
ones bot are -- nine but if you

00:05:38.338 --> 00:05:44.511
are standing behind someone's
back it will be guessing the

00:05:44.511 --> 00:05:48.782
first one but the second one is
more complex but still the same

00:05:48.782 --> 00:05:54.321
number of connections, so what I
spot complexity score the smart

00:05:54.321 --> 00:05:58.725
phone had the lowest score.
Nobody that participated was

00:05:58.725 --> 00:06:04.531
above 850 people in the study.
And nobody managed to create a

00:06:04.531 --> 00:06:10.437
pattern of the maximum score. I
was kind of thinking that people

00:06:10.437 --> 00:06:16.576
would take it has a challenge
when I gave this survey and

00:06:16.576 --> 00:06:20.447
people would try to create the
most complex pattern. But nobody

00:06:20.447 --> 00:06:26.453
managed. So that is kind of the
same as with password and pin

00:06:35.195 --> 00:06:41.201
codes people are not able to
remember or create complex

00:06:51.878 --> 00:06:58.385
patterns or password. One of the
things that I told you about was

00:06:58.385 --> 00:07:04.891
that the pattern you cannot use
names and date of birth for

00:07:04.891 --> 00:07:10.263
example. But when I started
collecting the patterns people

00:07:10.263 --> 00:07:15.502
were coming up to me and told me
that you know, my mom used her

00:07:15.502 --> 00:07:21.775
first letter in her name as a
pin code and I was like okay. So

00:07:21.775 --> 00:07:27.647
I went through all the patterns
and that was possible that

00:07:27.647 --> 00:07:33.653
corresponds to a letter in the
alphabet and 10. 4 percent of

00:07:35.722 --> 00:07:43.129
the data were corresponding to
the letter in the alphabet. That

00:07:43.129 --> 00:07:48.601
is one in 10. If you pick up a
phone one in 10 will have a

00:07:48.601 --> 00:07:54.274
pattern corresponding to a
letter. That was interesting.

00:07:54.274 --> 00:08:00.213
One of the things with the
android pattern lock you can

00:08:05.352 --> 00:08:11.257
only select one note ones mean
that if you knew the starting

00:08:11.257 --> 00:08:17.263
point you can reduce the number
of possible patterns. I will

00:08:19.299 --> 00:08:25.305
give you time to look at that.
So in the data set 44 percent

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:41.020
were starting in the upper left
corner and if you look at the

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:47.027
green ones you get 73 percent.
And if you combine all corners

00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:57.704
there is 77 percent chance of
pattern starting in a corner.

00:08:57.704 --> 00:09:03.643
How predictable. But if you look
at everyone in the room there is

00:09:07.781 --> 00:09:13.520
only about 10 percent of you
that's likely to be left handed

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:19.826
and 90 percent of you are right
handed. So I was thinking that

00:09:19.826 --> 00:09:26.566
because I look at there is two
main ways of creating a pattern

00:09:26.566 --> 00:09:33.339
on the screen. You are seeing
using one hands or two hands so

00:09:33.339 --> 00:09:41.181
if you was one hand you use your
thumb to create a pattern or if

00:09:41.181 --> 00:09:46.386
you use two hands you use
forefingers to enterable with

00:09:46.386 --> 00:09:51.958
the screen so if I was left
handed, 10 percent of the

00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:56.996
population, would it be the
same, would I start in the same

00:09:56.996 --> 00:10:04.037
corner. So if I holding a left
handed person phone would the

00:10:04.037 --> 00:10:07.140
pattern or 44 percent of the
pattern started on the other

00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:14.981
corner on the other side. So for
right handed the two pictures

00:10:14.981 --> 00:10:20.320
are the starting point starting
with one hand and being right

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:26.192
handed and the number looks
similar to number I showed you

00:10:26.192 --> 00:10:32.198
in the other -- for all the
patterns. When looking at left

00:10:35.068 --> 00:10:41.074
handed I was disappointed those
were not the numbers I was

00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:49.849
predicting in the first place.
So I was like why, so either

00:10:49.849 --> 00:10:54.220
left hand or right hand using
one hand or two hands either way

00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:59.125
people start on the on the left
hand side and in the left hand

00:10:59.125 --> 00:11:05.532
corner at first I didn't
understand why but then I was

00:11:05.532 --> 00:11:10.270
thinking about the reading and
writing direction because

00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:17.877
research has found if you give a
person a set of imagines if you

00:11:17.877 --> 00:11:23.016
read from left to right you are
scanning the pictures from left

00:11:23.016 --> 00:11:27.921
to right so remember the picture
from left to right. But people

00:11:27.921 --> 00:11:33.927
have another reading and writing
direction so reading from left

00:11:36.362 --> 00:11:42.368
to right people started scanning
the pictures from right to left.

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:51.611
So I didn't get a lot people
having another reading and

00:11:51.611 --> 00:11:57.617
writing direction but I have a
strong belief the reading and

00:12:00.253 --> 00:12:04.257
writing direction it will
correspond to where you start to

00:12:04.257 --> 00:12:10.263
create a pattern. So I will not
give you a list of this top 10

00:12:16.869 --> 00:12:21.441
patterns and how -- it is more
interesting to look at how

00:12:21.441 --> 00:12:27.313
people behaver and where you
create your patterns. So these

00:12:27.313 --> 00:12:33.086
are what is called 3-gram. That
is set of three connecting nodes

00:12:33.086 --> 00:12:39.092
and in the blue one that is
commonly selected 3-grams people

00:12:42.061 --> 00:12:48.067
create the patterns sticking to
the engineer and it is hard to

00:12:50.837 --> 00:12:56.509
show here at this view but lines
such as you know you can go the

00:12:56.509 --> 00:13:02.448
upper left corner to the bottom.
Such lines are really few of the

00:13:08.821 --> 00:13:14.260
patterns having a line crossing
from the left to the middle of

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:20.266
the bottom. The lines are
straight and connected to the.

00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:30.076
Next node. So funny to look at
the length of the pattern. I

00:13:34.247 --> 00:13:40.253
collected the gender of the
participants. And I don't know

00:13:46.125 --> 00:13:51.164
if it is just you male
participants preferring length

00:13:51.164 --> 00:13:58.438
or woman being less thinking
less about security. I don't

00:13:58.438 --> 00:14:05.511
know. Just to show a average
length there is distribution of

00:14:05.511 --> 00:14:11.517
length selected and the upper --
the graph on the top is for male

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:20.526
and bottom is for female and as
you can see the bottom graph has

00:14:22.962 --> 00:14:30.169
a high percentage of select
patterns of lower lengths. You

00:14:30.169 --> 00:14:37.677
see that patterns of length
eight, there is really few

00:14:37.677 --> 00:14:43.683
patterns of length eight. In the
data set there was average 4

00:14:47.887 --> 00:14:53.893
percent of the patterns have a
length eight. If I show the

00:14:58.097 --> 00:15:04.036
calculation of how many patterns
of different lengths but there

00:15:06.539 --> 00:15:12.545
is 140 --> 000 patterns starting
with the length eight. And when

00:15:15.047 --> 00:15:21.053
looking at the age of the
participants, there were the

00:15:23.556 --> 00:15:31.197
younger person the stronger
pattern where created for all

00:15:31.197 --> 00:15:38.504
the free different patterns. So
for bot the shopping and bank

00:15:38.504 --> 00:15:44.510
account the younger the people
were the -- lost audio -- so by

00:15:49.782 --> 00:15:54.587
using this, this is kind of the
brief introduction to all the

00:15:54.587 --> 00:16:00.526
results that were found. I hope
in the future to use the data as

00:16:02.862 --> 00:16:08.868
far as I have know there is a
mold l because I only have 3400

00:16:14.373 --> 00:16:20.379
patterns and how can we be about
to predict every pattern first

00:16:24.884 --> 00:16:30.723
don't have the pattern in my
data set. So by using there is

00:16:30.723 --> 00:16:36.329
already -- I have a marker model
predicting that has been

00:16:36.329 --> 00:16:42.401
developed by a German
researcher. And that can predict

00:16:42.401 --> 00:16:45.605
the likelihood of the pattern
being selected based on the

00:16:45.605 --> 00:16:51.277
3-grams that I showed you. So
using the predictable ways of

00:16:51.277 --> 00:16:55.281
creating patterns likely hood of
selecting a pattern can be

00:16:55.281 --> 00:17:02.655
estimated and in the future, the
use this information that I had

00:17:02.655 --> 00:17:08.294
to reduce the number of
patterns, to be able the add the

00:17:08.294 --> 00:17:12.565
information about the creators
to see if we can kind of get a

00:17:12.565 --> 00:17:18.437
better model of being able to
predict a pattern based on the

00:17:18.437 --> 00:17:24.443
person or who the person is. So
for know there is about two or

00:17:32.184 --> 00:17:37.256
three minutes left so I might be
able to take a couple of

00:17:37.256 --> 00:17:43.262
questions before I leave. I will
stand here if someone want to

00:17:51.671 --> 00:17:57.176
talk and ask question.
