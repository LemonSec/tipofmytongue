00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.605
Hey, everyone. Thanks very much
for coming. God, this talk was

00:00:04.605 --> 00:00:07.975
fun to make and I'm glad it
follows up the last one. I have

00:00:07.975 --> 00:00:10.878
a few -- some of the stuff that
I present is a little different

00:00:10.878 --> 00:00:13.614
than the stuff that they talked
about, so just to get a few

00:00:13.614 --> 00:00:16.116
things out of the way, a couple
of shot-outs to some guys who

00:00:16.116 --> 00:00:19.419
helped me, some of them could be
here, some of them couldn't.

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:21.722
There's a few folks who wanted
to be nameless so their names

00:00:21.722 --> 00:00:25.058
are printed in black.
(Laughter.) So we're going to

00:00:25.058 --> 00:00:31.064
kick it off. My neighbor and his
kid are just annoying snots,

00:00:33.433 --> 00:00:39.540
right? Insert your own
four-letter word. And, God. And

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.610
the problem is way too much
discretionary spending, because

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:48.882
all of a sudden one day, this
thing showed up. And the kid is

00:00:48.882 --> 00:00:52.686
following it around all over the
neighborhood. And you can tell

00:00:52.686 --> 00:00:58.258
because he's crashing into every
car, every house, every tree,

00:00:58.258 --> 00:01:01.995
and he's running down the street
with it. And at night it's

00:01:01.995 --> 00:01:06.400
really obvious what he's doing.
Because it just shows up and

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.969
it's like really, dude? That's
what the Internet is for.

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:14.508
(Laughter.) And my initial
response of all that stuff is,

00:01:14.508 --> 00:01:20.514
hmm -- (Laughter.) Take that,
you little bastard. (Applause.)

00:01:26.086 --> 00:01:30.190
But if you were here in the last
presentation, they say shooting

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.292
down drones is a problem and
that's okay. I don't want

00:01:32.292 --> 00:01:36.697
someone shooting down mine. But
this got me to thinking. What if

00:01:36.697 --> 00:01:42.302
the following things were to
show up. Such as maybe this?

00:01:42.302 --> 00:01:48.475
(Laughter.) Not hard to do. It's
actually made the news. Some

00:01:48.475 --> 00:01:52.646
guys up in New England started
mounting semiautomatic pistols

00:01:52.646 --> 00:01:59.119
to their homemade drone.
Interesting. What if this showed

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:05.192
up? (Laughter.) I can see the
first shot being fairly

00:02:05.192 --> 00:02:11.565
accurate. After that, no one's
business. What would happen if

00:02:11.565 --> 00:02:17.137
this showed up? Yet, not as
cool. So I started looking

00:02:17.137 --> 00:02:20.507
around the line and it turns out
there are a bazillion

00:02:20.507 --> 00:02:25.112
regulations and everyone is
trying to regulate unmanned

00:02:25.112 --> 00:02:29.116
aircraft systems, UASs. And it
turns out most of the

00:02:29.116 --> 00:02:33.253
regulations that are out there
are not to restrict hobbyists.

00:02:33.253 --> 00:02:37.791
Most of them are there to
restrict the government's use of

00:02:37.791 --> 00:02:41.828
quad copters and drones and
there's a lot of attacking going

00:02:41.828 --> 00:02:45.499
on on the commercial space where
you have to get certain FAA

00:02:45.499 --> 00:02:52.439
approval to fly. It turns out I
was flying my DJI phantom 3

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:55.575
while testing for this
presentation over a parking lot

00:02:55.575 --> 00:02:58.845
and I was watching it and a guy
came up right behind me and he

00:02:58.845 --> 00:03:04.451
goes hi, I'm actually from DHS's
enforcement division for drones

00:03:04.451 --> 00:03:10.090
in the DC area and I'm like,
yeah. He goes do you know what

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.528
the rules are? Yeah. He goes,
are you doing this for

00:03:14.528 --> 00:03:18.432
commercial use. I said no. He
goes okay, see ya. (Laughter.)

00:03:18.432 --> 00:03:23.203
And I followed him and I
wouldn't let him be, I'm like

00:03:23.203 --> 00:03:25.439
hey, I've got questions. He's
like dude I've got so many

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:29.876
problems about guys flying those
things around. He said a guy

00:03:29.876 --> 00:03:36.683
flew his quad copter over
nationals stadium and lost it.

00:03:36.683 --> 00:03:42.022
And I said, well how did you
ever find the guy? And he said,

00:03:42.022 --> 00:03:45.425
easy. Most of the guys who lose
these things, you see them

00:03:45.425 --> 00:03:48.328
running over the hill with their
controller, have you seen my

00:03:48.328 --> 00:03:53.333
drone? Right? (Laughter.) And
I'm like really? He goes, yeah.

00:03:53.333 --> 00:03:58.605
At which point we were waiting
for him and we scooped him up.

00:03:58.605 --> 00:04:02.943
But it turns out that
noncommercial use, hobbyist use

00:04:02.943 --> 00:04:08.215
of drones is largely not
regulated. There are a few

00:04:08.215 --> 00:04:10.851
things that are out there,
right, there are no-fly zones

00:04:10.851 --> 00:04:15.288
around Washington, D.C. and it
centers around the White House

00:04:15.288 --> 00:04:18.091
and it goes out 15 miles.
There's actually supposed to be

00:04:18.091 --> 00:04:21.561
a no-fly zone of five miles
around the airports unless you

00:04:21.561 --> 00:04:24.798
get permission. Apparently the
ceiling is supposed to be

00:04:24.798 --> 00:04:29.703
graduated as you get closer the
ceiling goes down but FAA tries

00:04:29.703 --> 00:04:34.007
in some of their literature just
say five miles, that's it. It

00:04:34.007 --> 00:04:36.710
turns out you're not allowed to
fly on military bases. That's

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:41.281
considered bad. This came up in
the last presentation. You are

00:04:41.281 --> 00:04:46.419
not allowed to launch or land
from a national park. However,

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:49.689
you are allowed to fly in their
air space. It is not theirs to

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:55.228
regulate. However, they can cite
you for reckless endangerment if

00:04:55.228 --> 00:04:58.865
it potentially could crash on
someone. And they get people on

00:04:58.865 --> 00:05:01.935
that and they confiscate the
drone there. There was a guy out

00:05:01.935 --> 00:05:05.772
over the Grand Canyon filming
some sunset, people complained.

00:05:05.772 --> 00:05:10.277
The guy in the smokey the bear
hat showed up and took the guy

00:05:10.277 --> 00:05:13.713
away with his drone. There are
temporary flight restrictions

00:05:13.713 --> 00:05:18.718
that are issued for disaster
areas, wildfires, stadiums,

00:05:18.718 --> 00:05:21.154
large assemblies and whenever
there's going to be a

00:05:21.154 --> 00:05:24.257
presidential visit and they do
it several hours before and

00:05:24.257 --> 00:05:29.196
during the visit. You are not
allowed to mount a gun on a UAS

00:05:29.196 --> 00:05:32.432
because technically it becomes a
weapon system. There is a 400

00:05:32.432 --> 00:05:39.005
foot ceiling. Amazon is
petitioning to try to get 700

00:05:39.005 --> 00:05:43.143
feet for themselves to deliver
packages and they want a ban of

00:05:43.143 --> 00:05:48.081
100 feet from everyone. You have
to also fly it in line of sight

00:05:48.081 --> 00:05:51.918
and I have counted 16 states who
have enacted their own laws.

00:05:51.918 --> 00:05:57.090
Technically the guys I spoke to
who do enforcement, a lot of

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:02.162
that air space is not theirs to
restrict. The five-mile area

00:06:02.162 --> 00:06:05.465
around airports essentially
knocks out almost all of New

00:06:05.465 --> 00:06:09.569
York City, with the exception of
a few parks, you're not allowed

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:12.606
to fly above the sidewalks in
New York City because of the

00:06:12.606 --> 00:06:19.879
reckless endangerment and safety
issue. In the hobbyist area,

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:21.948
there's a whole bunch of
restrictions that come up.

00:06:21.948 --> 00:06:24.851
Right? If you don't do it for
commercial use, you're under 55

00:06:24.851 --> 00:06:28.688
pounds, you're not interfering
with any manned aircraft, you

00:06:28.688 --> 00:06:34.361
can be good to go. That's nice
and all, but most people don't

00:06:34.361 --> 00:06:36.563
know the rules because everyone
and their brother is trying to

00:06:36.563 --> 00:06:40.600
create them. This is a listing
of all the no-fly zones on the

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:46.473
eastern side of the U.S. And
damn, that's a lot of them. If

00:06:46.473 --> 00:06:50.710
you log into parrot's website,
this is a listing of all the

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:53.413
recordings that got
automatically updated to their

00:06:53.413 --> 00:06:57.050
website that shows everyone who
is flying on the eastern side of

00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:01.187
the U.S. Isn't that interesting?
Over 2 --> 000 flights in DC which

00:07:01.187 --> 00:07:04.224
is technically a no-fly area and
over 2 --> 000 flights in New York

00:07:04.224 --> 00:07:10.230
City. If you do a quick overlay
of the maps (Laughter.) Yeah, it

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:16.903
turns out people are flying in
areas they don't know about. And

00:07:16.903 --> 00:07:20.373
if they're smart, you know, I
say it's interesting. And that's

00:07:20.373 --> 00:07:25.979
nice and all that the rules are
all there. But my neighbor's kid

00:07:25.979 --> 00:07:29.182
is still annoying and I know he
doesn't read and he's not

00:07:29.182 --> 00:07:32.285
getting the appropriate parental
guidance. So that brings me to

00:07:32.285 --> 00:07:36.323
the bigger question, is there
any way to take that thing down?

00:07:36.323 --> 00:07:39.559
Graceful or ungraceful. I
thought there might be a couple

00:07:39.559 --> 00:07:43.930
of ways. There's a couple, I can
think of a few ways. (Laughter.)

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:47.467
But maybe something a little
more subtle would suit our

00:07:47.467 --> 00:07:51.204
needs. So maybe the next time
he's there, he doesn't capture

00:07:51.204 --> 00:07:54.541
video, maybe it knocks it down
and it flies away. And if you've

00:07:54.541 --> 00:07:59.512
ever seen this guy crash, he
actually bounces like that. So

00:07:59.512 --> 00:08:01.815
let's take a quick look. I'm
going to take a look at two

00:08:01.815 --> 00:08:05.085
different drones, two of the
more popular ones on the market.

00:08:05.085 --> 00:08:09.089
One is going to be the Parrot
which has a 1080 p lens on the

00:08:09.089 --> 00:08:11.958
front and the other one is
looking at the new DJI phantom

00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:16.129
3. If we start looking at the
Parrot drone we get a rough

00:08:16.129 --> 00:08:22.135
listing of the specs. We've got
a quad core, memory, a top

00:08:24.604 --> 00:08:29.576
horizontal speed of 45 miles an
hour, wow. Linux. But if you

00:08:29.576 --> 00:08:36.349
look carefully at the specs,
hmm. (Laughter.) The thing is

00:08:36.349 --> 00:08:43.490
its own flying router with DHCP
enabled. Awesome. (Applause.)

00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:49.496
There's something else I found
really interesting if you read

00:08:51.531 --> 00:08:56.369
the specs, it's got a really
interesting GPS chip in there,

00:08:56.369 --> 00:08:59.239
using American GPS and
Russian-based GPS. So what

00:08:59.239 --> 00:09:03.476
happens if I muck with that?
There's a couple of other things

00:09:03.476 --> 00:09:09.749
that kick in. The
free-flight-three app is

00:09:09.749 --> 00:09:13.686
installed on your android device
or your iOS device. You can get

00:09:13.686 --> 00:09:17.290
updates to that. If an update
comes that you don't have to

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:20.260
forcibly install that update.
You can ignore it. It doesn't

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.662
come through the app store. It
is just sitting there and it

00:09:22.662 --> 00:09:27.667
checks their website so you can
apply the update. A couple of

00:09:27.667 --> 00:09:29.869
other things that are
interesting. The return to home

00:09:29.869 --> 00:09:33.873
function. I'm sitting here
thinking if he's flying near me

00:09:33.873 --> 00:09:37.277
and I want to swat it and get it
away, maybe I can take advantage

00:09:37.277 --> 00:09:39.345
of the return to home function
and send that thing back to

00:09:39.345 --> 00:09:44.150
home. The height distance thing
is very interesting. If the

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:49.923
thing is flying above 10 meters,
it will fly back to its original

00:09:49.923 --> 00:09:53.893
return to home point. If it's
flying less than 10 meters, the

00:09:53.893 --> 00:09:58.965
thing will automatically shoot
up 30 feet, turn, face home and

00:09:58.965 --> 00:10:02.202
fly home in a straight line. So
if you have a house where you

00:10:02.202 --> 00:10:04.737
can pick up GPS and say you're
in your living room with a

00:10:04.737 --> 00:10:08.842
ceiling fan, you may not want to
hit the return to home feature

00:10:08.842 --> 00:10:15.782
because that gets very ugly
fast. That's how I lost my first

00:10:15.782 --> 00:10:19.252
drone. (Laughter.) There is
something else I wanted to take

00:10:19.252 --> 00:10:22.222
a look at, and I see this in
your documentation. If the bee

00:10:22.222 --> 00:10:25.258
bop drone loses connectivity
with the controller for 30

00:10:25.258 --> 00:10:31.264
seconds, this thing is supposed
to fly home. Hmm. That makes me

00:10:34.167 --> 00:10:37.370
want to say what would happen if
I screw with the wi-fi signal or

00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:40.807
what happens if I screw with GPS
or what happens if I introduce a

00:10:40.807 --> 00:10:44.444
magnetic field around the thing.
So let's go through it real

00:10:44.444 --> 00:10:48.314
quick. This thing actually flies
with it's own mac address, we

00:10:48.314 --> 00:10:53.119
can actually scan this with a
number of tools. I happy to have

00:10:53.119 --> 00:10:55.955
a pine apple router around. I
didn't use Darren kitchen's

00:10:55.955 --> 00:11:02.629
infusion which is really cool.
But it's neat. There's an

00:11:02.629 --> 00:11:05.798
underlying wi-fi connection that
gets established between the two

00:11:05.798 --> 00:11:09.202
devices and on top of that the
applications talk to one

00:11:09.202 --> 00:11:13.006
another. So let's introduce
ourselves a little mischief,

00:11:13.006 --> 00:11:19.445
shall we? What happens if we D
off our original connection for,

00:11:19.445 --> 00:11:24.050
say, 30 seconds? It turns out
the return to home function did

00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:26.886
not work direct correctly for
me. And I did this like five

00:11:26.886 --> 00:11:30.823
times. I lost like six
propellers at the time doing

00:11:30.823 --> 00:11:34.994
this test. Here's what it looks
like when this thing gets D off

00:11:34.994 --> 00:11:40.633
for 30 seconds. It sits there
and flies, it just landed. All

00:11:40.633 --> 00:11:43.069
of the rotors stopped at the
same time and got straight down.

00:11:43.069 --> 00:11:47.106
Maybe it got lost and thought
that was going to be home I

00:11:47.106 --> 00:11:50.376
don't know. But clearly that
didn't work so now I can walk

00:11:50.376 --> 00:11:54.547
out to my property and pick it
up. You want it kid, come and

00:11:54.547 --> 00:11:59.986
get it. Maybe there's something
else we can do. I got it. Let's

00:11:59.986 --> 00:12:04.290
give it a quick scan. And it
turns out when we scan it with M

00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:11.864
map -- (Laughter.) Yup, it's a
flying FTP server just floating

00:12:11.864 --> 00:12:17.870
around. Oh, that's awesome! I
have ten devices simultaneously

00:12:21.007 --> 00:12:25.678
connected to this guy all at
once. Only one app was talking

00:12:25.678 --> 00:12:28.615
but the other nine were sitting
there waiting. We'll get back to

00:12:28.615 --> 00:12:32.118
that in a second. It turns out
this thing is a flying FTP

00:12:32.118 --> 00:12:35.321
server and there are two
particular directories I found

00:12:35.321 --> 00:12:38.758
interesting. One was the media
directory, where the little

00:12:38.758 --> 00:12:42.095
monster next door was filming
videos. And the other was a

00:12:42.095 --> 00:12:47.934
thumb nail directory. No
authentication was required to

00:12:47.934 --> 00:12:55.274
connect over FTP. I think that's
fantastic. So I was sitting

00:12:55.274 --> 00:13:00.213
there thinking while it was in
flight (Laughter.) Maybe I can

00:13:00.213 --> 00:13:06.719
grab his pictures and replace
him with something like that.

00:13:06.719 --> 00:13:12.725
(Cheers and applause. ) That was
a fun day. That was cool. So

00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:21.801
dude, I'm taking videos you got
of the neighbors because maybe I

00:13:21.801 --> 00:13:27.473
want to see what they look like.
(Laughter.) But then there's

00:13:27.473 --> 00:13:32.045
this monstrosity. While the
thing is flying. So I telnet

00:13:32.045 --> 00:13:39.318
into the box and here is a
listing of the entire structure

00:13:39.318 --> 00:13:46.125
right there. It's running busy
box from like three years ago.

00:13:46.125 --> 00:13:48.394
This thing I purchased just a
couple of months ago for this

00:13:48.394 --> 00:13:51.898
presentation and they never
updated busy box. There have

00:13:51.898 --> 00:13:55.601
been ten updates to busy box
since this came out but they

00:13:55.601 --> 00:13:59.105
haven't updated it. But I want
you to look carefully at three

00:13:59.105 --> 00:14:02.809
things for me. Take a look at
those shell scripts sitting

00:14:02.809 --> 00:14:10.783
right there. So I took drone
number two, this gets to be a

00:14:10.783 --> 00:14:15.088
very expensive research project
soon. He was hovering in my

00:14:15.088 --> 00:14:20.493
kitchen. I telnet directly to
the box and all of a sudden I

00:14:20.493 --> 00:14:26.499
see that. (Laughter.)
(Applause.) I'm like that's

00:14:26.499 --> 00:14:32.505
pretty cool. So I wonder what
happens if I type in this and

00:14:35.708 --> 00:14:41.247
hit enter. I am suddenly greeted
with all of that. I was sitting

00:14:41.247 --> 00:14:45.051
there working in the kitchen, it
was hovering, and all of a

00:14:45.051 --> 00:14:51.057
sudden it took out my stove.
(Laughter.) I was thinking the

00:14:51.057 --> 00:14:54.494
shutdown feature would
gracefully shut down the rotors

00:14:54.494 --> 00:14:59.732
and down it would go. This
thing, there was no graceful

00:14:59.732 --> 00:15:06.939
shut down. It literally flew
right by. So if I was one of

00:15:06.939 --> 00:15:12.779
those cool dudes who got like
carbon fiber blades, this is

00:15:12.779 --> 00:15:17.450
what it looks like in the park.
Hit the command there, boink,

00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:23.556
and down it goes. There is no
restart from that. If you go

00:15:23.556 --> 00:15:26.058
look at some of the software
exploits that are out there,

00:15:26.058 --> 00:15:33.199
this thing is off. It's done. By
the way, in case you missed it,

00:15:33.199 --> 00:15:39.405
because it always looks better
in slow motion. If it's running

00:15:39.405 --> 00:15:44.710
near a wall it gets updraft and
there's no telling where it is

00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:50.783
going to go. I was going to do
that in here today. I fired this

00:15:50.783 --> 00:15:54.487
up this morning and six
wonderful conference attendees

00:15:54.487 --> 00:16:01.828
had connected to my open telnet
connection. (Applause.) I'm not

00:16:01.828 --> 00:16:09.001
bitter, but you did steal my
thunder. So there's another

00:16:09.001 --> 00:16:12.605
thought. I mean, shutting that
thing down, great. So I had a

00:16:12.605 --> 00:16:16.309
coworker who looked at it and
says that's not really epic. You

00:16:16.309 --> 00:16:18.644
should launch that thing like
400 feet in the air and crash

00:16:18.644 --> 00:16:23.115
it. And I'm like well give me
your drone. (Laughter.) So why

00:16:23.115 --> 00:16:28.354
don't we just take the damn
thing, right? Kid, you knocked

00:16:28.354 --> 00:16:32.258
your ball into my yard, I'm
going to take it. So we actually

00:16:32.258 --> 00:16:35.161
have two simultaneous
connections to the same drone at

00:16:35.161 --> 00:16:39.498
the same time. If I am sitting
there and again, remember, I

00:16:39.498 --> 00:16:44.203
have like ten devices all
connected to it simultaneously.

00:16:44.203 --> 00:16:47.607
This is what it looks like from
the iPad that is currently

00:16:47.607 --> 00:16:52.411
controlling the beebop drone. It
has access, it's hovering at 1

00:16:52.411 --> 00:16:58.484
meter. I ran this inside a hotel
lobby, they were not happy. This

00:16:58.484 --> 00:17:05.691
is what my iPhone sees. Okay.
I'm connected to the network,

00:17:05.691 --> 00:17:10.463
but my app's not connecting.
This is what we have. Hey, wait

00:17:10.463 --> 00:17:14.867
a second. Why don't I just send
a quick D off. The moment that D

00:17:14.867 --> 00:17:18.804
off kicks in, the controller
automatically says I'm

00:17:18.804 --> 00:17:23.576
disconnecting. Right away. He is
automatically having a bad day.

00:17:23.576 --> 00:17:28.114
So the question I have for you
is, in this race condition,

00:17:28.114 --> 00:17:33.920
who's going to win? If he is
running an iPad anywhere near

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:37.056
indoors, he is going to pick up
his home network or any other

00:17:37.056 --> 00:17:40.793
network before he picks up his
beebop drone connector, which I

00:17:40.793 --> 00:17:44.664
think is great. Which means he
is going to sit there and try

00:17:44.664 --> 00:17:49.302
and reconnect, even though his
underlying connection is not

00:17:49.302 --> 00:17:55.975
there and it's going to freeze.
Meanwhile on my iPhone, I've

00:17:55.975 --> 00:17:58.911
connected. I'm there. And I was
sitting there and I connected.

00:17:58.911 --> 00:18:02.848
My wi-fi connection was good.
Note the altitude on this. It

00:18:02.848 --> 00:18:08.220
now things it was zero. Thing
was 3 feet in the air so it

00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:12.591
didn't get an update for that.
Which means I'm off and running

00:18:12.591 --> 00:18:15.628
and now I'm the guy who is in
charge of that drone and he

00:18:15.628 --> 00:18:22.368
can't do anything about it. If I
click the button at the top that

00:18:22.368 --> 00:18:24.637
says emergency, that thing just
falls from the sky and away it

00:18:24.637 --> 00:18:27.907
goes. Which I think is great.
One of the other thing that

00:18:27.907 --> 00:18:31.310
kicks in with the free flight
app that runs on top of the

00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:35.514
network connection, again, it's
going to pair to any other

00:18:35.514 --> 00:18:38.484
network before it comes back to
this particular drone and I

00:18:38.484 --> 00:18:41.754
think that's fantastic. Now for
those little enthusiasts who

00:18:41.754 --> 00:18:44.490
have more money, the bee bop
drone comes with an optional sky

00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:47.360
controller that looks like this.
It's supposed to be a range

00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:53.633
extender. It turns out that that
is its own wireless access point

00:18:53.633 --> 00:19:00.373
too. And it's wide open. Which
means we can D off in one of two

00:19:00.373 --> 00:19:06.879
spots. If we D off between the
iPad, which is literally just

00:19:06.879 --> 00:19:10.216
sitting in the cradle, it is not
tethered, it's just sitting

00:19:10.216 --> 00:19:15.321
there connecting wirelessly. If
I D off that, and I connect my

00:19:15.321 --> 00:19:18.858
iPhone or my iPad to it, all of
a sudden I get these little

00:19:18.858 --> 00:19:21.861
controller icons sitting right
there. Which means I have

00:19:21.861 --> 00:19:25.965
control of you. If I'm nice I
will temporarily send control

00:19:25.965 --> 00:19:29.035
back to your controller and I
will steal it away from you and

00:19:29.035 --> 00:19:32.338
I can go back and forth. Which
means he's going to respond all

00:19:32.338 --> 00:19:37.109
over the place. Which means he's
mine. I don't have to worry

00:19:37.109 --> 00:19:40.579
about it. I think coding would
be great, writing an exploit

00:19:40.579 --> 00:19:43.849
would be great, but the app is
free. It's already been

00:19:43.849 --> 00:19:48.587
developed and telnet is wide
open What happens if we start

00:19:48.587 --> 00:19:54.827
looking at other areas like GPS.
This is interesting because if

00:19:54.827 --> 00:19:57.797
you pull up the specs there are
several specific frequency

00:19:57.797 --> 00:20:01.767
ranges used in the U.S. and
several frequency ranges used

00:20:01.767 --> 00:20:06.072
with the Russian GPS system.
What if we screw with those

00:20:06.072 --> 00:20:11.610
signals? Now, there's one tiny
little problem with that. It's

00:20:11.610 --> 00:20:15.614
illegal. Like 18 different ways
of illegal. Like you are

00:20:15.614 --> 00:20:20.352
currently fined $16 --> 000 for
every day that you do this, up

00:20:20.352 --> 00:20:25.057
to $112 --> 000. And if you go to
the FCC's website they have a

00:20:25.057 --> 00:20:27.793
spot where they report people
and a list of all people they

00:20:27.793 --> 00:20:33.799
send notice to and fined. So
what to do? I talked to the DHS

00:20:36.268 --> 00:20:40.139
guy. I said hey, I was thinking
about doing research and his

00:20:40.139 --> 00:20:43.375
flat answer was are you going to
cite my name? I go of course

00:20:43.375 --> 00:20:46.278
not. He goes they would never
catch you if you do it just

00:20:46.278 --> 00:20:52.485
once. They can't. Okay. So I
spoke to an attorney, an

00:20:52.485 --> 00:20:55.988
attorney said yeah, it's still
illegal no matter what. They

00:20:55.988 --> 00:20:58.924
could still come get you. I'm
like you're no fun. I was

00:20:58.924 --> 00:21:04.396
speaking to a cop, and he said
you know, if you go back and

00:21:04.396 --> 00:21:08.901
read the specific intention that
shows up on the FCC's site, they

00:21:08.901 --> 00:21:14.440
don't want you to put anyone in
danger. You can't disrupt anyone

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:18.010
else's signal. If you showed up
here 20 miles away from

00:21:18.010 --> 00:21:23.883
everything in the woods and you
were being supervised,

00:21:23.883 --> 00:21:30.789
hypothetically you could test
and no one would know. I'd like

00:21:30.789 --> 00:21:35.161
to introduce you to my new
friend. Selling and

00:21:35.161 --> 00:21:38.664
manufacturing and importing and
all that good stuff related to

00:21:38.664 --> 00:21:44.537
GPS jammers is illegal. This is
a test jammer and hypothetically

00:21:44.537 --> 00:21:48.607
one could pick this up online
for a very reasonable price of

00:21:48.607 --> 00:21:54.013
$25. (Laughter.) He is
specifically designed to block

00:21:54.013 --> 00:21:58.317
these particular frequency
ranges. He also has an effective

00:21:58.317 --> 00:22:04.523
range of about 20 meters. Which
is kind of creepy. So I go out,

00:22:04.523 --> 00:22:07.693
hypothetically, with some people
to do a test and I'm sitting

00:22:07.693 --> 00:22:12.131
there observing. We do the test,
at which point the police

00:22:12.131 --> 00:22:15.201
officer says I'm going to take
your equipment now. I'm like,

00:22:15.201 --> 00:22:19.138
really? He goes, yes. There's no
way I can let you walk away with

00:22:19.138 --> 00:22:23.309
that and it's gone. So it's been
confiscated in history. But if

00:22:23.309 --> 00:22:26.045
we were to run that type of
generator on the bee bop drone

00:22:26.045 --> 00:22:29.715
while he was flying, the return
to home feature automatically

00:22:29.715 --> 00:22:35.221
fails instantly. From the point
of view of the drone it is

00:22:35.221 --> 00:22:39.491
currently flying, it has GPS and
all of a sudden everything

00:22:39.491 --> 00:22:43.395
stops. He automatically goes to
hover mode. He doesn't move

00:22:43.395 --> 00:22:47.700
forward, he doesn't move back.
He just freezes. And if he gets

00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:50.502
GPS signal again, he doesn't
resume his take-home function,

00:22:50.502 --> 00:22:55.007
he just stands there. I'm lost,
just looking around. Which I

00:22:55.007 --> 00:22:58.077
think is an interesting thing.
It doesn't interrupt what the

00:22:58.077 --> 00:23:01.080
home position is, it just
interrupts the flight home. The

00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:06.218
same thing if you flew under a
bridge or under some dense trees

00:23:06.218 --> 00:23:11.724
all of a sudden this thing stops
in place which can be a problem.

00:23:11.724 --> 00:23:14.526
Introducing a magnetic field
around the device, say magnets

00:23:14.526 --> 00:23:18.897
from hard drives actually have
no observable effect on the guy

00:23:18.897 --> 00:23:22.801
which was a little disappointing
for me. If you're thinking about

00:23:22.801 --> 00:23:26.472
taking over someone's drone, say
at the hotel at 6:00 in the

00:23:26.472 --> 00:23:30.376
morning you bastard, there's
going to be references on your

00:23:30.376 --> 00:23:33.412
devices that you've made
connections to the device. Very

00:23:33.412 --> 00:23:37.950
specifically you want to take a
look at 9 file from your iOS

00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:40.686
devices and delete that because
that will have the date stamps

00:23:40.686 --> 00:23:43.355
and time stamps and the serial
numbers of your drone and my

00:23:43.355 --> 00:23:47.927
phone and you might want to
smudge them out if you can. This

00:23:47.927 --> 00:23:52.264
thing, I would never fly it
around any of you ever. What if

00:23:52.264 --> 00:23:56.035
we took a look at something
bigger though. Something bigger

00:23:56.035 --> 00:24:02.007
than the bee bop drone. Okay,
not that big. Maybe if we took a

00:24:02.007 --> 00:24:05.844
look at the phantom 3 that just
came out this past June. What

00:24:05.844 --> 00:24:10.683
can we do there? If we look
specifically at these specs,

00:24:10.683 --> 00:24:13.419
this thing is designed to have
certain geofencing in place

00:24:13.419 --> 00:24:18.023
because of incidents that
occurred earlier this year. It

00:24:18.023 --> 00:24:21.593
can fly up to several hundred
meters away without an issue.

00:24:21.593 --> 00:24:24.797
The top horizontal speed is
about 35 miles per hour on that.

00:24:26.865 --> 00:24:32.671
It uses both GPS systems as
well. In some geofenced areas it

00:24:32.671 --> 00:24:35.240
will give you a warning that
says you're in a bad spot and

00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:38.277
others you're supposed to take
it down where it uses an

00:24:38.277 --> 00:24:44.283
automatic landing sequence. This
thing is very freaky with

00:24:46.518 --> 00:24:49.555
respect to magnetic fields
though. It requires constant

00:24:49.555 --> 00:24:51.824
calibration if you're going to
take off anywhere near a

00:24:51.824 --> 00:24:56.061
magnetic field and I find that
interesting. Electro magnetic

00:24:56.061 --> 00:25:00.833
field interference, I think
that's pretty cool. DJI phantom

00:25:00.833 --> 00:25:04.169
3 updates, I've heard this from
other presenters and I

00:25:04.169 --> 00:25:09.641
respectfully disagree. Whenever
an update comes out from DJI for

00:25:09.641 --> 00:25:14.380
my phantom 3, I get a warning
message right before I take off

00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:17.549
and it says sorry dude, you
cannot take off until you apply

00:25:17.549 --> 00:25:21.120
that update. And I'm like
really? It's like uh-huh. I

00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:24.022
contacted their tech support on
three different occasions to get

00:25:24.022 --> 00:25:28.627
three different guys and I said
hey, what's the deal with your

00:25:28.627 --> 00:25:30.829
updates and they're like sorry
man, that's the way it is. We

00:25:30.829 --> 00:25:33.332
have an update, you have to
apply it to your device. There's

00:25:33.332 --> 00:25:36.335
no way around it. What if I want
to roll back. They're like dude

00:25:36.335 --> 00:25:43.308
you're screwed. I'm like that's
your answer? He goes, pretty

00:25:43.308 --> 00:25:50.682
much. Insert the micro SD card,
try again. So let's kick it off.

00:25:50.682 --> 00:25:54.119
What happens if we disrupt the
wi-fi signal going through a

00:25:54.119 --> 00:25:56.855
phantom 3? It turns out it
doesn't do anything because it

00:25:56.855 --> 00:26:00.726
doesn't operate over wi-fi.
Which is kind of cool. But it

00:26:00.726 --> 00:26:05.697
brings up the other question of
what happens if we start to

00:26:05.697 --> 00:26:11.103
disrupt the GPS signal. Now if
you look carefully at the GPS

00:26:11.103 --> 00:26:14.072
app, I'm not talking about
what's installed on the device

00:26:14.072 --> 00:26:16.875
itself, I'm talking about the
app itself, it turns out there's

00:26:16.875 --> 00:26:22.614
a little tiny database called
fly safe places. And it's very

00:26:22.614 --> 00:26:28.887
interesting. As of July 24th,
that database had 10,914

00:26:28.887 --> 00:26:32.991
entries. It contained the
latitude and longitude of all of

00:26:32.991 --> 00:26:36.628
the no-fly places that were
listed in it, contained the

00:26:36.628 --> 00:26:40.766
country ID, the city, the name
of the location, what type of

00:26:40.766 --> 00:26:43.368
shape was around it, what the
radius was, whether or not it

00:26:43.368 --> 00:26:45.604
was going to issue an warning to
the user, whether or not it was

00:26:45.604 --> 00:26:48.774
going to issue a disable and
there was a time stamp as to

00:26:48.774 --> 00:26:52.611
whether it was added to their
database. I very easily

00:26:52.611 --> 00:26:56.248
downloaded this database and
started changing entries which I

00:26:56.248 --> 00:27:01.620
found to be interesting. So when
the DJI phantom 3 is flying, you

00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:05.157
get something that looks like
this in a very nondescript area.

00:27:05.157 --> 00:27:10.829
At the very top it shows a safe
to fly GPS indicator. No

00:27:10.829 --> 00:27:13.398
problem. There's a map in the
lower right corner.

00:27:13.398 --> 00:27:19.071
Hypothetically if someone were
to turn on a GPS test signal

00:27:19.071 --> 00:27:24.343
generator, all of a sudden
everything goes to this. It

00:27:24.343 --> 00:27:27.779
automatically loses GPS. If I am
flying the device and I start to

00:27:27.779 --> 00:27:30.749
look at its own diagnostics, it
comes back and tells me what

00:27:30.749 --> 00:27:36.255
frequencies it is using to send
video signals back to my iPad.

00:27:38.891 --> 00:27:42.194
When GPS is disrupted, all of a
sudden things start getting

00:27:42.194 --> 00:27:46.098
squirrelly. It turns out my
video started to become choppy.

00:27:46.098 --> 00:27:49.535
It had a lot of latency. It also
turns out when the return to

00:27:49.535 --> 00:27:54.106
home feature was working, it
lost GPS. The thing was flying

00:27:54.106 --> 00:27:58.677
home could be right here and
here it comes and here it goes.

00:27:58.677 --> 00:28:02.848
Hey, there it goes. It missed
its home point completely. Flew

00:28:02.848 --> 00:28:09.821
by it. If you've flown a DJI
phantom 3? Aren't they awesome?

00:28:09.821 --> 00:28:15.327
Lots of finesse to it, right?
All of my finesse was completely

00:28:15.327 --> 00:28:19.998
gone. It's like I was flying
this thing all over again. So I

00:28:19.998 --> 00:28:23.168
was sitting there and
controlling it. It turns out it

00:28:23.168 --> 00:28:28.674
almost hit someone and they got
a little upset. So in slightly

00:28:28.674 --> 00:28:32.711
windy conditions or if you're
near a building, there's a

00:28:32.711 --> 00:28:38.650
downdraft and he becomes
unstable and he crashes. So it's

00:28:38.650 --> 00:28:40.719
a combination of the windy
conditions and where it is

00:28:40.719 --> 00:28:44.756
flying along with losing GPS if
it started with GPS which I

00:28:44.756 --> 00:28:47.859
think is an interesting thing.
There's something else I also

00:28:47.859 --> 00:28:52.197
noticed. What happens if we play
around with the magnetic field

00:28:52.197 --> 00:28:58.170
around our DJI phantom 3? It
turns out whenever it launches,

00:28:58.170 --> 00:29:01.807
if it can't get a good magnetic
compass reading, it's going to

00:29:01.807 --> 00:29:06.211
say hey dude, I can't fly until
I get calibrated. It says I'm

00:29:06.211 --> 00:29:11.883
calibrated. You set it back
down. If it loses that magnetic

00:29:11.883 --> 00:29:15.354
field, guess what happens? Sorry
dude I've got to recalibrate

00:29:15.354 --> 00:29:20.726
again. You pick it up, you twist
it, roll it and you're good to

00:29:20.726 --> 00:29:26.531
go. So if you were to take a
couple of hard drives,

00:29:26.531 --> 00:29:29.301
hypothetically you left them in
the area, this thing is not

00:29:29.301 --> 00:29:32.838
taking off. It will never get
off the ground which I found to

00:29:32.838 --> 00:29:37.376
be interesting. It is very
sensitive in that area. A lot of

00:29:37.376 --> 00:29:42.514
things going on. D off on the
bee bop drones and any of the

00:29:42.514 --> 00:29:46.551
Parrot series, very quickly
disassociates the controller

00:29:46.551 --> 00:29:50.489
with the device. Yeah, you got
to that bottom line, did you.

00:29:50.489 --> 00:29:55.193
GPS interference definitely
screws up the return to home

00:29:55.193 --> 00:29:58.196
function it causes the device to
stop and the other one it misses

00:29:58.196 --> 00:30:01.466
its home sequence. If you take a
look at the magnetic field you

00:30:01.466 --> 00:30:05.037
can't launch with the DGI 3 it
has a lot of performance issues.

00:30:05.037 --> 00:30:09.274
And lastly the physical things
you can throw things just to

00:30:09.274 --> 00:30:14.780
kind of shoot it down to mess
with people. There are tons of

00:30:14.780 --> 00:30:17.749
references in this space on
looking up what people are

00:30:17.749 --> 00:30:20.919
doing, what regulations are
there. They are constantly

00:30:20.919 --> 00:30:26.091
changing. People are passing
laws, regulations and all sorts

00:30:26.091 --> 00:30:30.228
of jurisdictions based just on
personal opinion. I just don't

00:30:30.228 --> 00:30:33.231
want them in my space because it
will annoy my quiet time at the

00:30:33.231 --> 00:30:37.336
beach. Okay. Well, your
screaming kid annoys me at the

00:30:37.336 --> 00:30:40.305
beach. I'm not disbanding him
and sending him away so leave my

00:30:40.305 --> 00:30:43.775
drone alone. So there are all
sorts of rules. You can go

00:30:43.775 --> 00:30:47.279
through and see which types of
frequencies are allowed in which

00:30:47.279 --> 00:30:50.449
types of regions and which ones
aren't. So it's going to vary

00:30:50.449 --> 00:30:54.553
from country to country. It was
a fun research project. I

00:30:54.553 --> 00:30:59.391
knocked my neighbor's kid and
his drone offline. Thanks.

00:30:59.391 --> 00:31:05.330
(Applause.) I'm almost afraid to
do this. Do you have any

00:31:11.336 --> 00:31:15.207
questions? >> I have a question.
>> Yes, sir. You in the front.

00:31:17.709 --> 00:31:25.150
>> Anybody have any questions?
I'm going to see my friend over

00:31:25.150 --> 00:31:31.156
there. I'll be right back. >> So
you mention interfering with the

00:31:33.225 --> 00:31:39.197
GPS signal. How about modifying
or sending it a GPS signal with

00:31:39.197 --> 00:31:42.701
different coordinates. >>
Theoretically you can do that --

00:31:42.701 --> 00:31:48.707
GPS is not encrypted. You can
send a signal provided your

00:31:52.611 --> 00:31:54.613
signal is stronger than that of
the official signal. You could

00:31:54.613 --> 00:31:56.848
very easily tell it it's
somewhere else without a

00:31:56.848 --> 00:32:01.586
problem. No problem. Easy to do
that. >> All right. If you have

00:32:01.586 --> 00:32:03.922
questions, come up here and
queue up so I don't have to walk

00:32:03.922 --> 00:32:06.491
my fat ass around the room.
Cool, thanks very much.

00:32:06.491 --> 00:32:12.497
(Applause.) >> All right. I
think Siemens is in New Jersey

00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:19.404
or Maryland. >> Where you teach?
>> Maryland. >> I thought it was

00:32:19.404 --> 00:32:25.076
in New Jersey. Anyway. >> The
university, not the institute.

00:32:25.076 --> 00:32:28.880
>> Okay, there you go. >>
Anyway, in the New York area in

00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:32.584
the past couple of weeks there's
been a couple of drones buzzing

00:32:32.584 --> 00:32:37.989
commercial aircraft coming in
and that's like 4 --> 000 feet. But

00:32:37.989 --> 00:32:40.992
what happened to the, you know,
the geofencing and the 400 foot

00:32:40.992 --> 00:32:44.296
ceiling and everything? >> In.
DJI phantom 3 you can actually

00:32:44.296 --> 00:32:49.601
turn off that ceiling limit and
it will prompt the pilot to say

00:32:49.601 --> 00:32:53.805
hey the FAA says 400 feet and it
will go yeah whatever. The thing

00:32:53.805 --> 00:32:58.677
can go up to about 1,500 meters.
There is a video of a guy in

00:32:58.677 --> 00:33:03.148
Sweden who decided it would be a
great idea to take his phantom

00:33:03.148 --> 00:33:08.854
drone, fly it up 1 --> 000 meters
above the clouds, to sit there

00:33:08.854 --> 00:33:13.058
to get some views, and then all
of a sudden, oh crap, I lost

00:33:13.058 --> 00:33:16.361
control of it, I can't bring it
down. It will come down

00:33:16.361 --> 00:33:20.532
eventually and it crashed 500
meters away. He got ridiculed

00:33:20.532 --> 00:33:27.205
online and he was like I was
good. No, dude you're an idiot.

00:33:27.205 --> 00:33:30.041
So you can turn off that feature
and you can go into autonomous

00:33:30.041 --> 00:33:36.047
mode and fly. >> Why is that
possible. >> He wants to know

00:33:36.047 --> 00:33:42.087
why is that even possible and
the idea is you can very easily

00:33:42.087 --> 00:33:45.657
turn that off. Theoretically you
could get permission from FAA

00:33:45.657 --> 00:33:48.526
and the air traffic control
tower to fly in an area provided

00:33:48.526 --> 00:33:51.296
you registered with them for
commercial reasons so you could

00:33:51.296 --> 00:33:55.300
have a reason to fly that high
so you could turn it off. It's

00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:58.870
up to the flyer to take control,
at least right now. Probably

00:33:58.870 --> 00:34:05.377
not. >> Michael, in your
research you mention that the

00:34:05.377 --> 00:34:08.680
phantom 3 controller was not
using wi-fi. Were you ever able

00:34:08.680 --> 00:34:11.483
to figure out how that
controller worked? >> I was

00:34:11.483 --> 00:34:13.818
looking -- I know it's doing
communication over some RC

00:34:13.818 --> 00:34:17.022
channels, traditional RC
channels and I haven't had time

00:34:17.022 --> 00:34:21.393
to intercept that traffic. >> To
find the light bridge. >>

00:34:21.393 --> 00:34:26.364
Something other than the 2.4 to
2.5 gig Hertz range. Typical RC

00:34:26.364 --> 00:34:30.168
controllers I couldn't get that.
The video comes back. >> Have

00:34:30.168 --> 00:34:32.570
you played around with the 3 DR
solo at all? >> I have not

00:34:32.570 --> 00:34:36.841
played around with that yet.
Yet. >> So you mentioned that

00:34:36.841 --> 00:34:39.477
you were able to pull down the
database and look around inside

00:34:39.477 --> 00:34:42.380
it for the no-fly zones. Did you
experiment at all with making

00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:45.183
your house a no-fly zone? >>
Technically there are certain

00:34:45.183 --> 00:34:47.819
websites where you can register
your property as a no-fly zone.

00:34:47.819 --> 00:34:53.558
I added a database entry real
quick but I hadn't had a chance

00:34:53.558 --> 00:34:56.995
to finish everything. I took out
several entries and went back

00:34:56.995 --> 00:34:59.831
and forth. >> So is there any
authorization required to

00:34:59.831 --> 00:35:02.367
connect to that and download it
or were you able to openly

00:35:02.367 --> 00:35:04.703
connect to that and download it
would you be able to do that to

00:35:04.703 --> 00:35:08.807
your kids DJI phantom 3. >> The
DJI 3 phantom app and the bee

00:35:08.807 --> 00:35:13.144
bop app are all free for anyone
to download. So you can download

00:35:13.144 --> 00:35:18.249
it to your device and pop out
the database and start messing

00:35:18.249 --> 00:35:21.453
with it and look around. >> But
what I'm thinking is your

00:35:21.453 --> 00:35:23.922
neighbor's drown, can you
connect to that and download the

00:35:23.922 --> 00:35:28.093
database and send it back to his
drone so he doesn't know why but

00:35:28.093 --> 00:35:30.428
all of a sudden he can't fly
around your backyard. >> I like

00:35:30.428 --> 00:35:34.366
your thinking, but the database
is stored on his controller, not

00:35:34.366 --> 00:35:37.502
on the drone itself. >> So
question about the, I guess the

00:35:37.502 --> 00:35:41.673
database and the GPS in relation
to the regulatory structure for

00:35:41.673 --> 00:35:45.477
drones. My understanding is the
FAA has a regulation around

00:35:45.477 --> 00:35:49.280
no-fly zones that's on the
database and the GPS being

00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:53.818
accurate. Is there anything that
you know of, either that the FAA

00:35:53.818 --> 00:35:59.257
is doing to require stronger
authentication or inhibit GPS

00:35:59.257 --> 00:36:02.460
jamming in that regard? >> No,
I'm not familiar with what FAA

00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:05.030
is trying to do. >> So the
follow-up is if I go in and I

00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:11.036
spoof GPS, not turn it off,
would I be able to technically

00:36:13.371 --> 00:36:17.075
fly the device in a no-fly zone.
>> Technically the bee bop drone

00:36:17.075 --> 00:36:23.481
I could fly anywhere. The
phantom 3 drone I could put it

00:36:23.481 --> 00:36:30.555
in A mode, technically I could
fly that anywhere. Which is kind

00:36:30.555 --> 00:36:33.992
of crazy. Right? And people are
doing DJI drones wouldn't have

00:36:33.992 --> 00:36:37.128
any of that stuff and they can
fly their stuff anywhere. So

00:36:37.128 --> 00:36:41.499
crazy stuff. >> One comment, one
question. I fly model planes,

00:36:41.499 --> 00:36:44.936
I'm also a hang glider pilot so
very familiar with the FAA and

00:36:44.936 --> 00:36:48.273
what they like and don't like.
So one comment would be number

00:36:48.273 --> 00:36:51.876
one it needs an organization
privately for somebody to say

00:36:51.876 --> 00:36:53.878
hey listen, we don't like the
regulations that you're running

00:36:53.878 --> 00:36:57.582
so there's the United States
hang glider association, of

00:36:57.582 --> 00:37:01.286
course the MA is the association
for RC modelers. I would think

00:37:01.286 --> 00:37:04.022
that's one area we need to go in
if we don't like what everybody

00:37:04.022 --> 00:37:07.325
else is going to come up and
write for us. I loved the way

00:37:07.325 --> 00:37:10.895
that was on there. That was
awesome. What I was curious

00:37:10.895 --> 00:37:14.666
about were you able to turn that
into it while the person was

00:37:14.666 --> 00:37:20.705
still in control? >> Yes. >> My
next step is why didn't you just

00:37:20.705 --> 00:37:23.875
go into the kid's app. >> The
app is on his device. >> Were

00:37:23.875 --> 00:37:27.178
you able to then traverse back
down to him possibly? >> I

00:37:27.178 --> 00:37:30.682
didn't bother. I just stayed on
the device itself and I knocked

00:37:30.682 --> 00:37:34.686
it down. While someone else was
flying that drone, I telnetted

00:37:34.686 --> 00:37:39.924
directly into that drone while
it was running. I had three

00:37:39.924 --> 00:37:43.928
other devices acquired DHCP
addresses. And then with the

00:37:43.928 --> 00:37:47.098
telnet connection I just issued
the shutdown script and boom,

00:37:47.098 --> 00:37:54.105
down he went. >> How about R and
minus R? >> Theoretically I can

00:37:54.105 --> 00:37:58.243
play in there all day. >> You
said that you were able to

00:37:58.243 --> 00:38:04.182
disrupt the flight by jamming
the GPS signal -- >> Jamming

00:38:11.923 --> 00:38:14.392
would be illegal. >> Were you
able to regain control of it

00:38:14.392 --> 00:38:17.061
just by switching to attitude
mode in that case? >> On the bee

00:38:17.061 --> 00:38:19.330
bop drone, once a GPS signal
that was being interfered with

00:38:19.330 --> 00:38:21.699
went away, he eventually
reclaimed his own GPS and the

00:38:21.699 --> 00:38:26.905
return to home feature worked
again. On the other one, the

00:38:26.905 --> 00:38:30.708
moment that that signal was
disrupted when it reclaimed GPS

00:38:30.708 --> 00:38:33.745
and it was much faster then it
was fine and away it goes and

00:38:33.745 --> 00:38:36.247
finesse came back. The
interesting thing on the phantom

00:38:36.247 --> 00:38:40.451
3 is if you also take a 2-inch
by 2-inch square of aluminum

00:38:40.451 --> 00:38:44.989
foil and put it directly over
the top, it completely

00:38:44.989 --> 00:38:48.960
interferes with all of the GPS
signal reception. All of it.

00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:55.900
Just like that. >> Thanks.
Tucker with defense one. Thanks

00:38:55.900 --> 00:39:00.939
for a great presentation. A few
of the issues that you mentioned

00:39:00.939 --> 00:39:04.342
aren't entirely though many of
them are. Did you approach

00:39:04.342 --> 00:39:07.912
either manufacturer with any of
these things that you found and

00:39:07.912 --> 00:39:10.582
follow up to that, if you were
to make a recommendation to

00:39:10.582 --> 00:39:13.351
policy makers or FAA people
about how to deal with some of

00:39:13.351 --> 00:39:16.254
these vulnerabilities, what
would that recommendation be? >>

00:39:16.254 --> 00:39:20.458
My recommendation quickly back
to Parrot would be dude, would

00:39:20.458 --> 00:39:22.927
you please shut down the
services while the damn thing is

00:39:22.927 --> 00:39:27.732
in flight. Please. At least for
mine. The other ones, it would

00:39:27.732 --> 00:39:31.236
be nice if there was some
database that was reliable and I

00:39:31.236 --> 00:39:34.172
couldn't get to and muck with
and that sort of thing. I don't

00:39:34.172 --> 00:39:37.075
think they can fix anything
about GPS interference. Fly

00:39:37.075 --> 00:39:39.510
under a bridge and all of a
sudden you have interference

00:39:39.510 --> 00:39:43.348
sitting right there. Respect to
policy makers, I would like to

00:39:43.348 --> 00:39:46.517
see policy makers get informed
before they start making

00:39:46.517 --> 00:39:50.588
decisions. That's a nice way to
go. (Applause.) >> Did you

00:39:54.893 --> 00:39:57.629
approach the manufacturers with
any of the vulnerabilities that

00:39:57.629 --> 00:40:02.100
you found? >> I spoke to several
people who wouldn't speak to me

00:40:02.100 --> 00:40:04.936
officially from Parrot and
they're like we're designed to

00:40:04.936 --> 00:40:09.207
be open so people can do
development. Both products came

00:40:09.207 --> 00:40:13.177
out on the market saying we have
weigh point capability where you

00:40:13.177 --> 00:40:18.783
can program it for the phantom 3
and for the bee bop. No, you

00:40:18.783 --> 00:40:21.252
don't, actually. It turns out
it's not there. They market it

00:40:21.252 --> 00:40:24.389
that they had it and I'm like
this is going to be awesome. I

00:40:24.389 --> 00:40:27.725
get it. Wait a second, it's not
there. I kind find it. I go to

00:40:27.725 --> 00:40:30.595
their forums and people have
been complaining for months that

00:40:30.595 --> 00:40:32.730
Parrot says we're going to get
to it, we're going to rely on

00:40:32.730 --> 00:40:36.868
third-party vendors to help us
solve this problem. That's

00:40:36.868 --> 00:40:40.538
disappointed. The phantom 2 has
weigh points that you can

00:40:40.538 --> 00:40:44.475
program, the phantom 3 does not.
So it would be nice if they got

00:40:44.475 --> 00:40:48.613
that moving along, which would
be helpful. I haven't talked to

00:40:48.613 --> 00:40:51.649
anyone at DJI. I did speak to
someone who gave a presentation

00:40:51.649 --> 00:40:55.620
maybe an hour ago. I said I kind
of disagree with your statement

00:40:55.620 --> 00:40:59.257
that I don't have to accept to
an update to a DJI phantom 3 and

00:40:59.257 --> 00:41:05.196
he goes oh, really? I'll have to
check on that. Bad answer, dude.

00:41:08.866 --> 00:41:12.003
>> Suppose you got access with
the FTP and then download the

00:41:12.003 --> 00:41:14.072
images and it turns out he
actually has been taking

00:41:14.072 --> 00:41:16.074
pictures of your daughter in the
shower where do you go with

00:41:16.074 --> 00:41:19.877
that? >> Thank God I don't have
a daughter. >> Suppose you did.

00:41:19.877 --> 00:41:23.848
>> So he's taking a picture of
me. >> I don't care who he takes

00:41:23.848 --> 00:41:27.185
it. You've downloaded a picture,
it's obviously an inappropriate

00:41:27.185 --> 00:41:30.488
photograph that he's taken,
invasion of privacy. Do you take

00:41:30.488 --> 00:41:34.058
that picture to somebody, what
are your options legally? >>

00:41:34.058 --> 00:41:39.897
What are my options legally? So
one, I'm not an attorney.

00:41:39.897 --> 00:41:42.734
Legally if someone were to
peeping Tom rules would apply at

00:41:42.734 --> 00:41:46.637
this point. Certain states are
issuing privacy laws on drones,

00:41:46.637 --> 00:41:49.240
it depends from jurisdiction to
jurisdiction as to what's

00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:52.510
happening. So the idea at that
point you go to the police and

00:41:52.510 --> 00:41:55.680
say hey dude my neighbor took a
picture of me in the shower

00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:58.883
through his drone and you let
them handle it. >> What do they

00:41:58.883 --> 00:42:03.454
say to you that you got the
picture or do they care about

00:42:03.454 --> 00:42:07.191
that? Or they made it open
anyway -- >> I mean this in a

00:42:07.191 --> 00:42:11.029
very nice respectful way of our
law enforcement brethren.

00:42:11.029 --> 00:42:13.464
Usually when I tell them
something like that, they never

00:42:13.464 --> 00:42:18.035
get to that question. They're
off following the kid. They

00:42:18.035 --> 00:42:20.338
would never come back to me and
say well, how have you gotten

00:42:20.338 --> 00:42:24.509
that picture. Well, it was right
there and I just took it, here.

00:42:24.509 --> 00:42:28.646
>> Thanks. >> I notice that a
lot of the new manufacturers

00:42:28.646 --> 00:42:31.482
have imbedded the app in the
controller and they're running

00:42:31.482 --> 00:42:34.719
on android. Have you checked any
of that out. Do you have any

00:42:34.719 --> 00:42:38.022
future plans to see what their
vulnerabilities. >> I would love

00:42:38.022 --> 00:42:40.958
to play with android. I was
focusing on the drone itself,

00:42:40.958 --> 00:42:44.629
not necessarily the controller.
I just happened to peek into my

00:42:44.629 --> 00:42:49.100
iPad and iPhone to see if it was
there. I think android is going

00:42:49.100 --> 00:42:55.039
to be similar. When he's flying
I'm not looking to disrupt his

00:42:55.039 --> 00:42:57.775
controller, I want to look at
the drone itself. >> Just

00:42:57.775 --> 00:43:02.613
curious. >> I like the idea and
I haven't gotten to it yet and

00:43:02.613 --> 00:43:05.516
it's become a very expensive
research project crashing

00:43:05.516 --> 00:43:11.155
drones. >> I found it quite
interesting with both the bee

00:43:11.155 --> 00:43:15.226
bop and the DJI you were able to
connect another thing in flight.

00:43:15.226 --> 00:43:21.065
>> I could not do that to the
DJI phantom 3. I could do to the

00:43:21.065 --> 00:43:24.402
Parrot drone. >> That is
actually pretty good. I've

00:43:24.402 --> 00:43:27.939
noticed that a lot of drones
have had availability of

00:43:27.939 --> 00:43:33.077
connecting and flying over
security. It's true with the bee

00:43:33.077 --> 00:43:38.649
bop there and even with some of
the open source stuff if you're

00:43:38.649 --> 00:43:43.387
not using an AES encrypted
radio. What do you think are the

00:43:43.387 --> 00:43:47.258
next steps for manufacturers to
take in terms of securing their

00:43:47.258 --> 00:43:50.027
drones so that they can't be
taken over mid flight? >> It

00:43:50.027 --> 00:43:52.597
depends what it's being used
for, right? If you're going to

00:43:52.597 --> 00:43:55.600
do hobbyist work and you're
flying indoors, I think it would

00:43:55.600 --> 00:43:58.769
be great if we hung a couple of
nets here and did drum races.

00:43:58.769 --> 00:44:01.339
That would be fantastic.
Everybody show up with your own

00:44:01.339 --> 00:44:08.412
drone we'll zip around and see
who takes out the goons. In that

00:44:08.412 --> 00:44:11.349
situation I'm not really
concerned outside. But I mean

00:44:11.349 --> 00:44:15.353
you can apply the same logic to
other things in our society,

00:44:15.353 --> 00:44:18.556
right? Oh, my God, someone has a
gun, he would use the gun to do

00:44:18.556 --> 00:44:21.158
anything. What are the gun
manufacturers going to do to

00:44:21.158 --> 00:44:26.163
prevent some guy from using it
irresponsibly. So we have the

00:44:26.163 --> 00:44:29.567
same sort of thing here. If
we're not careful and if the

00:44:29.567 --> 00:44:32.069
community doesn't put in the
appropriate self-guidance,

00:44:32.069 --> 00:44:37.174
right, you know congress is
going to legislate the hell out

00:44:37.174 --> 00:44:42.680
of it. If it moves, congress
will attack it. I think there's

00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:46.017
a limit as to how far we should
go. Otherwise we'll completely

00:44:46.017 --> 00:44:52.890
kill the market and it won't be
fun anymore. >> Thank you for

00:44:52.890 --> 00:44:56.027
the talk. >> You're welcome.
Thanks for coming. >> Thank you.

00:44:56.027 --> 00:44:59.463
I was wondering. I see that your
presentation was focused on

00:44:59.463 --> 00:45:02.066
vulnerabilities and
exploitation. As far as the

00:45:02.066 --> 00:45:07.471
wifi-based devices, have you
researched anything to do with

00:45:07.471 --> 00:45:13.277
securing your own personal
drone? >> You know, my first

00:45:13.277 --> 00:45:15.379
thing to do was to see what I
can do to knock it down. The

00:45:15.379 --> 00:45:18.216
next thing will be to see what I
can do to shut down particular

00:45:18.216 --> 00:45:21.953
services while it flies to make
it a little more bulletproof. I

00:45:21.953 --> 00:45:28.559
just haven't gotten to that yet.
>> To add on to that, would you

00:45:28.559 --> 00:45:33.864
be interested in finding out by
chance afterwards? >> Sure, man.

00:45:33.864 --> 00:45:36.400
E-mail address on the end of the
last slide in the presentation.

00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:39.036
Drop me a line. If you want a
copy of the presentation, drop

00:45:39.036 --> 00:45:45.810
me a line. >> Cool. Thank you
very much. >> I just have one

00:45:45.810 --> 00:45:50.648
more question regarding have you
played around at all with ADSV?

00:45:50.648 --> 00:45:54.619
>> I have not. >> Are you
familiar with that? >> Not so I

00:45:54.619 --> 00:46:02.159
can speak intelligently on it.
>> Okay. >> What happens if you

00:46:02.159 --> 00:46:07.598
fly the phantom through a
magnetic field instead of having

00:46:07.598 --> 00:46:13.204
one around it so it can't take
off, if it flies through a

00:46:13.204 --> 00:46:16.607
strong magnetic field, what
happens? >> I haven't tried it

00:46:16.607 --> 00:46:21.679
yet, but if interference to GPS
is similar to the magnetic

00:46:21.679 --> 00:46:25.316
field, I imagine it loses a lot
of its finesse. The DJI phantom

00:46:25.316 --> 00:46:30.454
3 has a lot going for it. It is
not a lightweight product. It

00:46:30.454 --> 00:46:34.358
has a ground sensor, it has a
ground-facing camera, it has a

00:46:34.358 --> 00:46:41.298
barometer, it's got GPS. So if I
take out just one of them, I

00:46:41.298 --> 00:46:43.801
assume that whole thing is still
going to be flyable without any

00:46:43.801 --> 00:46:48.406
issue. Or with minor issues. The
problem is what happens when you

00:46:48.406 --> 00:46:51.308
get close to another object or a
wall. And you have the extra air

00:46:51.308 --> 00:46:53.344
and then you lose that
stability. That's when I think

00:46:53.344 --> 00:46:58.249
you're going to run into
problems. I just haven't found a

00:46:58.249 --> 00:47:02.987
way to take a magnetic field and
project it to this thing while

00:47:02.987 --> 00:47:07.091
it's in flight. I'll get to it,
right after I do my DeLorean and

00:47:07.091 --> 00:47:10.294
get it up to 88 miles per hour,
I'm going to find a way to

00:47:10.294 --> 00:47:12.930
project a magnetic field to
project it to a spot around his

00:47:12.930 --> 00:47:16.467
head and take care of that. >> I
would prefer you don't project a

00:47:16.467 --> 00:47:19.437
magnetic field around my head
but thank you. All right. So if

00:47:19.437 --> 00:47:21.439
anyone else has any questions,
we will take Michael out into

00:47:21.439 --> 00:47:24.041
the chaos that is the hallway. I
want to thank you, that was

00:47:24.041 --> 00:47:27.078
awesome. And on behalf of
speaker operations, I want to

00:47:27.078 --> 00:47:29.080
present you with that badge.
