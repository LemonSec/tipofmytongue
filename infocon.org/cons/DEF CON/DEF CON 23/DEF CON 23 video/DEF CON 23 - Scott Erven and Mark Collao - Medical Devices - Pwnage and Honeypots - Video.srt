00:00:00.167 --> 00:00:02.703
Thanks everybody for coming out.
Are you having a good time? [

00:00:02.703 --> 00:00:08.709
APPLAUSE ] Awesome. I appreciate
you coming out tonight. My name

00:00:11.211 --> 00:00:15.983
is Scott Erven and I focus on
medical security. I have ran IT

00:00:15.983 --> 00:00:20.921
working directly for health care
o organizations and some of you

00:00:20.921 --> 00:00:25.225
have that background, as well. I
spent a couple years researching

00:00:25.225 --> 00:00:31.231
medical devices. We are going to
recap it. >> I'm Mark Collao.

00:00:33.734 --> 00:00:39.106
Senior consultant and I do
anything security and I have a

00:00:39.106 --> 00:00:42.075
pretty good interest in all kind
of power shell stuff. I like

00:00:42.075 --> 00:00:45.045
botnets and I have been in
botnets for the past five years

00:00:45.045 --> 00:00:48.282
and this is my first talk ever.
>> Interesting. Come to DEF CON

00:00:48.282 --> 00:00:51.518
for the first time. Do it right!
Yeah! Really quick, this is what

00:00:51.518 --> 00:00:54.488
we are going to cover. First
off, why are we looking at

00:00:54.488 --> 00:00:57.457
medical devices and why does it
matter and why are we passionate

00:00:57.457 --> 00:01:00.127
about it? And the hygiene
vulnerability issues that we are

00:01:00.127 --> 00:01:03.830
seeing and then to recap on the
health care organizations that

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:09.836
are vulnerable to cyber-attack
and the medical devices and

00:01:44.638 --> 00:01:47.140
second, how to get access to
these devices. Mark is going to

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.544
talk about the research that we
have done and how the honeypot

00:01:50.544 --> 00:01:52.546
are vulnerable and how to
mitigate the attack if you work

00:01:52.546 --> 00:01:56.883
in the medical industry. Who in
here is relying on a medical

00:01:56.883 --> 00:02:02.823
device every day? Yeah, if you
are a diabetic and that's a very

00:02:29.216 --> 00:02:36.223
personal impact for folks and
many of you probably know a

00:02:36.223 --> 00:02:39.726
family member that is reliant on
them and you have been to the

00:02:39.726 --> 00:02:46.033
hospital every day of your life
and because of my background in

00:02:46.033 --> 00:02:49.669
health care, that's when I kind
of got a passion about this. I

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:53.740
started to see medical devices
becoming connected and not from

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:57.644
a patient privacy aspect, but
looking at it from a patient

00:02:57.644 --> 00:03:01.481
safety aspect. I'm going to
touch on some patient privacy

00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:03.483
stuff that I will call out
independently. To set the stage,

00:03:03.483 --> 00:03:05.485
I often get challenged or asked
the question of what type of

00:03:05.485 --> 00:03:07.487
person is going to attack these
devices? I think that it is

00:03:07.487 --> 00:03:13.493
important to address that up
front and a good story and

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:32.245
Shawn, who is in the audience
and he found the story. Two

00:03:32.245 --> 00:03:36.116
individuals were treated in
Austria for gunshot wounds and

00:03:36.116 --> 00:03:38.285
they were hooked up to the
self-controlled clicker. They

00:03:38.285 --> 00:03:44.091
didn't feel their pain
management was under control.

00:03:44.091 --> 00:03:51.331
The nursing staff thought
otherwise and they got online

00:03:51.331 --> 00:03:58.872
and found the credentials and
suffered a heart attack. We are

00:03:58.872 --> 00:04:04.811
going to show that when we get
into the honeypot aspect too.

00:04:15.722 --> 00:04:21.495
The public defenders and it is
important for us to give you the

00:04:21.495 --> 00:04:26.299
information that is meaningful,
so you can go and protect your

00:04:26.299 --> 00:04:29.102
organizations and secondly,
alert affected parties. We have

00:04:29.102 --> 00:04:36.343
been working with the FDA.
Anyone on B sites? We did an

00:04:36.343 --> 00:04:44.050
update on the security of
medical devices. They have been

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:50.056
great and last Friday, the FDA
put an advisory out on some

00:04:53.326 --> 00:05:00.967
research that Billy on pumps and
they alerted the organizations

00:05:00.967 --> 00:05:06.973
and pulled it off. This is
precedent setting and the FDA

00:05:09.476 --> 00:05:15.482
usually doesn't do that until a
fatality occurs. Big round of

00:05:17.984 --> 00:05:23.990
applause. The FDA has been
really great to work with. What

00:05:26.459 --> 00:05:33.400
do we see high-level? Was it all
of these crazy attacks?

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:37.571
Absolutely not. Here's what we
are looking at the big three

00:05:37.571 --> 00:05:43.577
that we like to call them. Those
folks that are working on this

00:05:46.446 --> 00:05:50.383
security and issue. Knowing
software vulnerabilities and the

00:05:50.383 --> 00:05:55.822
ability to update devices an
linked-in systems and heavily

00:05:55.822 --> 00:06:01.761
used in health care and the S
2000 boxes and those types of

00:06:12.706 --> 00:06:18.712
things that are not patched and
then, data encryption and you

00:06:21.081 --> 00:06:24.317
may say this is one of these
patient privacy things. As they

00:06:24.317 --> 00:06:27.454
become connected, we are using
what is called medical device

00:06:27.454 --> 00:06:29.456
encryption and we are pushing
the data for the critical

00:06:29.456 --> 00:06:31.524
systems down into the medical
record. A lot of times, it

00:06:31.524 --> 00:06:34.861
doesn't use encryption. You can
see the HTML file and alter it

00:06:34.861 --> 00:06:39.599
and replay it and ultimately
alter what happens in the

00:06:39.599 --> 00:06:45.305
medical record. It ultimately
becomes a safety issue and

00:06:45.305 --> 00:06:51.645
individuals that are presenting
on you, for example. And the

00:06:51.645 --> 00:06:56.716
high probability of misdiagnosis
and mistreatment and prescribing

00:06:56.716 --> 00:07:04.257
the wrong drugs and this is what
Shawn and I presented and

00:07:04.257 --> 00:07:11.865
covered last year. And if you
are not familiar, Joe runs this

00:07:11.865 --> 00:07:19.773
and it is an awesome tool to
find things. I was sitting on

00:07:19.773 --> 00:07:24.444
the phone with Shawn and said,
check this out, I did a search

00:07:24.444 --> 00:07:29.416
for anesthesia and got all of
these returns and it is not a

00:07:29.416 --> 00:07:34.621
medical device, I know that. The
only indication that it was a

00:07:34.621 --> 00:07:39.793
medical device is that it was
running XP. We found that it has

00:07:39.793 --> 00:07:47.534
a misconfiguration on the system
and leaking the intelligence on

00:07:47.534 --> 00:07:53.540
all of the hosts and gave us
stuff that the a treasure-trove

00:07:57.477 --> 00:08:03.717
for an attacker. We saw this
huge health care organization

00:08:03.717 --> 00:08:08.655
and it was not just medical
devices, it was their entire

00:08:08.655 --> 00:08:14.661
network. Shawn and I said we
want to look at medical devices,

00:08:18.231 --> 00:08:24.237
so we scraped that out. But it
was everything. And services

00:08:27.006 --> 00:08:32.379
such as laboratory services and
imaging services. Did we just

00:08:32.379 --> 00:08:39.486
find that one organization? No,
we found hundreds. Once you

00:08:39.486 --> 00:08:45.492
start to change that to specific
stuff like podiatry, pediatrics,

00:08:58.138 --> 00:09:04.077
hematology and you found all of
these organizations. It ended up

00:09:09.115 --> 00:09:15.121
being XP 2 and Windows 7 and all
of the doctor's names that are

00:09:21.027 --> 00:09:28.868
associated with them and the
floor and this is associated

00:09:28.868 --> 00:09:35.608
with an anesthesia card. Very
specific information. This is a

00:09:35.608 --> 00:09:40.380
recap (Indiscernible) that you
can direct pivot from this

00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:46.686
direct system into it. This
particular system had a

00:09:46.686 --> 00:09:52.692
cardiology institute. MRI and we
are going to talk about this a

00:09:55.094 --> 00:10:01.367
little bit later. This is a good
one that a lot of attackers are

00:10:01.367 --> 00:10:04.771
actually going into these
systems that have pretty poor

00:10:04.771 --> 00:10:08.141
security on the backend to the
application and you always get

00:10:08.141 --> 00:10:12.011
prompted for a user name and a
password and on the backend,

00:10:12.011 --> 00:10:18.918
very rarely do they have system
passwords set-up. This is how a

00:10:18.918 --> 00:10:24.924
lot of the PHI is getting leaked
out of the organizations. >>

00:10:31.798 --> 00:10:35.401
Awesome. How can someone for
example, take advantage of this?

00:10:35.401 --> 00:10:37.804
The first attack would be
physical. Through the example

00:10:37.804 --> 00:10:43.810
before with SMB and we can start
pulling information on users and

00:10:52.919 --> 00:10:54.954
their roles in the organization
and all of that fun stuff,

00:10:54.954 --> 00:11:01.094
computers, where they sit, and
most importantly, blackout

00:11:01.094 --> 00:11:08.535
policy. You get a badge and you
are pretty much free to roam

00:11:08.535 --> 00:11:12.872
anywhere. Pretty trivial for an
attacker. You know what floor it

00:11:12.872 --> 00:11:16.809
is on, the doctor's name and you
know there is no lockout policy

00:11:16.809 --> 00:11:20.446
and hack away. Next thing you
know, you are in the doctor's

00:11:20.446 --> 00:11:23.049
console and have loads of
information. The second attack

00:11:23.049 --> 00:11:29.055
is Phishing and Excel attacks
and go from there. The next

00:11:31.624 --> 00:11:37.630
thing is pivots and let's go for
the easy one. Nine times out of

00:12:06.759 --> 00:12:13.032
10, it is going to crash. You
have to put a hole in the

00:12:13.032 --> 00:12:19.005
organization or whatever
research facility it may be and

00:12:19.005 --> 00:12:25.645
you can start pivoting from
there and take over the

00:12:25.645 --> 00:12:30.583
organization that way. >> All
right, let's get into the super

00:12:30.583 --> 00:12:34.120
awesome credentials that are
super crack that you want to

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:39.592
see. Stage 3. Now, we know the
vulnerabilities in the system.

00:12:39.592 --> 00:12:45.031
You can reach them from the
Internet. What would it take for

00:12:45.031 --> 00:12:50.436
the hacker to get access on the
medical devices? I want to go

00:12:50.436 --> 00:12:54.474
over the disclosure time line
and all of this information is

00:12:54.474 --> 00:12:58.144
publicly available on the
website. I choose to be

00:12:58.144 --> 00:13:01.347
responsible about it. We
contacted SERT and GE. You can

00:13:01.347 --> 00:13:08.421
see back in September last year,
this was disclosed. In August,

00:13:08.421 --> 00:13:15.695
disclosure of 100 sets of
credentials and administrative

00:13:15.695 --> 00:13:21.701
access and September 16th had
more time on my hands and

00:13:24.037 --> 00:13:30.043
decided to send in another 30.
This is when we got conformation

00:13:39.152 --> 00:13:42.522
that GE had closed their assert
and the investigation. I want

00:13:42.522 --> 00:13:47.994
you to know they are doing a
good job and very mature and

00:13:47.994 --> 00:13:54.000
they have put a lot of resources
in currently. If anyone knows

00:13:56.335 --> 00:14:00.673
Mike Murray, he is putting
together a team over there. This

00:14:00.673 --> 00:14:06.679
is across the board and we can
grab any medical device

00:14:08.715 --> 00:14:15.855
manufacturer and this is not
just a GE issue and they have

00:14:15.855 --> 00:14:20.526
been very proactive about it. GE
after the investigation, their

00:14:20.526 --> 00:14:25.631
response is that all of these
decodes are not hard credited

00:14:25.631 --> 00:14:32.438
around there are contradictions
through their documentation. Sit

00:14:32.438 --> 00:14:38.444
back and enjoy the show. It is
going to take a while. A really

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:45.251
good idea to drop 30 CB's in one
talk and I realized that we have

00:14:45.251 --> 00:14:50.890
to go Through 40 slides real
quick, so stay with me. I'm

00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:56.062
going to point out the
highlights. Up top, you are

00:14:56.062 --> 00:15:00.666
going to see a CBE. Since 2006?
Scott, you have been sitting on

00:15:00.666 --> 00:15:06.672
these things for nine years? No,
how it works, they are publicly

00:15:12.912 --> 00:15:18.918
available. Some of these are
legacy; I started at 2000 and

00:15:24.957 --> 00:15:32.899
newer. Some are newer. The next
one is 2014 and it is updated

00:15:32.899 --> 00:15:36.903
documentation a month prior to
me coming across this

00:15:36.903 --> 00:15:42.909
information. [ NO AUDIO ]
Credentials and access. >> All

00:15:58.791 --> 00:16:04.530
right, now nuclear imaging
system and you get into some

00:16:04.530 --> 00:16:10.536
pretty interesting stuff. They
are pretty super passwords. [

00:16:38.731 --> 00:16:44.737
LAUGHTER ] Yeah. So, wow. >>
Look at the passwords and like

00:16:50.576 --> 00:16:53.579
pound big guy one and see how
they are cross implemented on

00:16:53.579 --> 00:16:55.581
different platforms and the
imaging system and service

00:16:55.581 --> 00:16:58.351
logons and the service admin
accounts. >> The bottom one is

00:16:58.351 --> 00:17:00.519
really awesome. From a clinical
perspective, these systems are

00:17:00.519 --> 00:17:02.889
heavily supported and because
the hospital staff don't

00:17:02.889 --> 00:17:05.791
certainly know every single
product, it is out scoured to

00:17:05.791 --> 00:17:08.794
the vendor for support and they
have to be able to know how to

00:17:08.794 --> 00:17:14.800
get into them. (Indiscernible).
Here's some more stuff. More

00:17:25.011 --> 00:17:29.649
link imaging systems. CT
scanners and we are getting the

00:17:29.649 --> 00:17:35.121
SU logons on these types of
systems. And same thing, repeats

00:17:35.121 --> 00:17:41.127
on passwords. More x-ray
systems. More x-ray systems.

00:17:45.665 --> 00:17:51.037
Centricity. This is where it
starts to get interesting. Never

00:17:51.037 --> 00:17:57.043
mind this. I was talking about
packs before and this is a

00:17:59.946 --> 00:18:02.448
system that does patient
monitoring and pack storage and

00:18:02.448 --> 00:18:08.454
that's what we are getting into.
The system imaging vault and a

00:18:13.459 --> 00:18:19.365
super awesome password of
nothing. Admin logins and

00:18:19.365 --> 00:18:25.338
license server if you don't want
to pay for it. Archive audit

00:18:25.338 --> 00:18:29.075
trail. This is really good. SSL.
Hey, encryption. Made a good

00:18:29.075 --> 00:18:35.081
decision, oh, wait the key
manager server have really bad

00:18:39.018 --> 00:18:46.759
passwords. Logins for the
analytic servers and that's

00:18:46.759 --> 00:18:52.765
where all of the data is dumping
and taking all of the data out

00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:08.347
from the data warehouse. More
packs. And here is what I was

00:19:08.347 --> 00:19:11.317
talking about on the backend and
not through the application, but

00:19:11.317 --> 00:19:17.323
able to get into the actual
storage server and if you want,

00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:27.066
read only, put in RO. If you
want read/write, please end with

00:19:35.808 --> 00:19:41.814
RW. And more packs and some IAS.
Gamma cameras. CT scanners.

00:19:49.689 --> 00:19:52.858
Emergency logins and obviously,
there is a reason for that. Even

00:19:52.858 --> 00:19:55.961
if we don't solve the problem,
we should be trying something

00:19:55.961 --> 00:20:00.366
that is not known failure.
That's a big message going

00:20:00.366 --> 00:20:06.372
forward; we cannot continue to
use failed systems. If you want

00:20:09.575 --> 00:20:15.581
user accounts, just run the
script. The tech dot badge is

00:20:29.528 --> 00:20:35.534
going to create the user
accounts in the hundreds. What

00:20:46.378 --> 00:20:50.182
do you do when you have all
kinds of credentials? You create

00:20:50.182 --> 00:20:56.188
a word cloud. Yeah. [ LAUGHTER ]
[ APPLAUSE ] So, there's a bit

00:21:03.028 --> 00:21:09.535
of a -- I don't know if it is
funny. You guys will probably

00:21:09.535 --> 00:21:13.606
think it is funny. When I went
to these word cloud sites and

00:21:13.606 --> 00:21:16.475
putting all of the information
in the word cloud site and they

00:21:16.475 --> 00:21:20.613
all came out and said big guy.
If you look at it, it is pound

00:21:20.613 --> 00:21:26.619
big guy one, so apparently, word
cloud sites sanitize input much

00:21:30.789 --> 00:21:35.161
better than medical software.
Again, this initial response is

00:21:35.161 --> 00:21:41.167
these are default. I want to
make the case, are there still

00:21:43.736 --> 00:21:48.174
issues? We are going to go
through a couple examples of

00:21:48.174 --> 00:21:55.281
that. Some of them do not change
the credentials and do not allow

00:21:55.281 --> 00:22:00.085
resets on the accounts. Do not
change the password to that

00:22:00.085 --> 00:22:03.322
account or we cannot support
that application. Many of them

00:22:03.322 --> 00:22:09.762
don't have instructions on how
to change the accounts. The

00:22:09.762 --> 00:22:13.432
segmented secure documentation
is severely lacking. The

00:22:13.432 --> 00:22:20.773
organization that is
implementing it itself are going

00:22:20.773 --> 00:22:28.113
off of this documentation. It is
heavily utilized in the

00:22:28.113 --> 00:22:34.119
industry. And massive success
rates using default and

00:22:36.455 --> 00:22:42.261
hard-coded credentials. Password
never expires. Make sure you

00:22:42.261 --> 00:22:48.267
check it. Big, important flag
for the person using, you will

00:22:51.971 --> 00:22:58.510
be disabled for support if this
password is changed. If you are

00:22:58.510 --> 00:23:01.413
saying it is default, it is a
little contradictory in my

00:23:01.413 --> 00:23:07.419
opinion. If you are an
organization doing this, in big,

00:23:10.923 --> 00:23:16.929
bold letters go not change this
password. They would never

00:23:23.168 --> 00:23:29.174
click, yes, remember this
password forever. This is a

00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:44.156
clinical perspective and remote
support, what we would call a

00:23:44.156 --> 00:23:50.162
back door. Call the operator up
and they are going to go ahead

00:23:53.032 --> 00:23:59.571
and reset that password too.
This last one, I want to be very

00:23:59.571 --> 00:24:02.775
clear. What I want to show you.
This is theoretical. I have not

00:24:02.775 --> 00:24:06.078
done anything on this device. I
have done stuff on other

00:24:06.078 --> 00:24:10.949
devices, obviously. I want to
give you the mindset of an

00:24:10.949 --> 00:24:14.820
attacker or researcher and
looking at the documentation if

00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:18.357
there are potential issues and
getting this system to do

00:24:18.357 --> 00:24:20.592
something unintentional. You
see, to follow this support, you

00:24:20.592 --> 00:24:22.594
must know radiation. There are
probably good controls in that

00:24:22.594 --> 00:24:24.930
system that under intended use,
it is at a low level. If you can

00:24:24.930 --> 00:24:27.099
get access and you are following
this and they are not using

00:24:27.099 --> 00:24:29.101
encryption and have these
services and can you

00:24:29.101 --> 00:24:31.103
potentially, as an attacker, sit
in on there and change the

00:24:31.103 --> 00:24:33.105
volume dozing levels? As an
attacker, can you potentially,

00:24:33.105 --> 00:24:35.107
change that parameter and replay
that. That's how the researchers

00:24:35.107 --> 00:24:37.109
or attackers dig through this
documentation and look at

00:24:37.109 --> 00:24:39.111
different attackers. A little
bit, it gets into the liability

00:24:39.111 --> 00:24:45.117
space and in the documentation
it says, adhere strictly to the

00:25:09.708 --> 00:25:15.714
procedures in this manual, but
warning the producers claim no

00:25:31.597 --> 00:25:39.104
responsibility for its accuracy.
>> Of course, there is not a

00:25:39.104 --> 00:25:45.177
liability case to set precedence
yet. But these are the type of

00:25:45.177 --> 00:25:52.584
contradictions that you see
happening. This is systemic in

00:25:52.584 --> 00:25:57.389
the industry and across vendors.
I'm going to turn it over to

00:25:57.389 --> 00:26:02.461
Mark. We have this info and we
know they are accessible and

00:26:02.461 --> 00:26:07.366
what we wanted to do in the past
couple of months is set-up

00:26:07.366 --> 00:26:10.135
honeypot and see if there is
random noise. Mark is going to

00:26:10.135 --> 00:26:16.875
talk high-level about the data
that we are seeing and give you

00:26:16.875 --> 00:26:24.750
an idea. >> We have all of this
data and the passwords and we

00:26:24.750 --> 00:26:29.488
know all of this information
about the data and all of that

00:26:29.488 --> 00:26:33.492
stuff. Let's figure out if it is
actually (Indiscernible). What

00:26:33.492 --> 00:26:38.263
we wanted to get out of this
research and if someone is using

00:26:38.263 --> 00:26:41.500
this data and any other default
website is looking for these

00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:44.336
devices on the net log in and if
they are, looking for other S &

00:26:44.336 --> 00:26:46.939
B attacks and try and exploit
those? Are they developing

00:26:46.939 --> 00:26:50.008
malware and if they got access
is there malicious attempt or an

00:26:50.008 --> 00:26:55.881
attack on certain vendors and it
could be political or whatever

00:26:55.881 --> 00:27:01.820
to attack vendors for certain
reasons. I know there are a

00:27:16.835 --> 00:27:22.841
bunch of popular ones out there
that have high/low interaction

00:27:48.567 --> 00:27:54.573
and we used some of them. To
include, we got a bunch of

00:28:01.046 --> 00:28:07.052
information on the vendor
devices and that's the HP

00:28:12.691 --> 00:28:16.762
streams and the different
protocols they use. If an

00:28:16.762 --> 00:28:20.065
attacker hits it, it gives the
right error message back in case

00:28:20.065 --> 00:28:22.067
someone was doing any type of
fingerprinting. OS 6 or 7 and

00:28:22.067 --> 00:28:24.069
any of those application levels
and also the fall credits and

00:28:24.069 --> 00:28:26.071
the services and the script and
we had to emulate the whole

00:28:26.071 --> 00:28:28.073
stack on the honeypot to make
sure that when they are

00:28:28.073 --> 00:28:30.075
communicating with each other on
the operating system and if

00:28:30.075 --> 00:28:32.077
there is a pretty sophisticated
factor, this is not looking at

00:28:32.077 --> 00:28:34.079
the honeypot they found, but it
is potentially juicy

00:28:34.079 --> 00:28:36.081
information. Internet presence
and obviously, Google is your

00:28:36.081 --> 00:28:38.083
go-to. We are setting it up six
months ago and we wanted quicker

00:28:38.083 --> 00:28:43.989
results. We were organizing the
talks and the vendor credits and

00:28:43.989 --> 00:28:49.995
they are all there. We did a
bunch of fake Twitter and

00:28:53.465 --> 00:28:57.336
Facebook dumps and we set-up a
bunch of credential that are

00:28:57.336 --> 00:28:59.438
unique for these systems and let
it reign and someone who hates

00:28:59.438 --> 00:29:05.377
vendors and it made no sense,
but someone is like, yeah, I

00:29:10.549 --> 00:29:16.555
want to hit that. [ LAUGHTER ] I
would. The data. We set-up ten

00:29:19.157 --> 00:29:26.965
different honeypots from the MRI
machines and spread them over

00:29:26.965 --> 00:29:32.971
the whole world and there were
55 successful logins and a lot

00:29:35.307 --> 00:29:38.777
of it includes your typical
admin, even though those credits

00:29:38.777 --> 00:29:42.447
are probably valid somewhere.
The default password, as you

00:29:42.447 --> 00:29:45.550
saw, are pretty terrible. You
might get a bunch of root

00:29:45.550 --> 00:29:51.556
traffic in there. And how to
exploit? There were 229 unique

00:29:55.293 --> 00:30:01.299
malware drops and some of them
are specific malware script and

00:30:10.942 --> 00:30:13.111
established some sort of
persistence and had a call back

00:30:13.111 --> 00:30:18.583
to an RC somewhere. And out of
the fake Twitter and Facebook

00:30:18.583 --> 00:30:25.590
drops that we did and eight of
them came back to us and they

00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:32.564
are successful logins. We had an
alert set-up and it is like 4:00

00:30:32.564 --> 00:30:34.666
a.m. and I got out of bed and
who are those people? They are

00:30:34.666 --> 00:30:36.668
obviously trying to attack and
there for a reason. >> The

00:30:36.668 --> 00:30:38.670
source countries and who would
have thought who is the top

00:30:38.670 --> 00:30:40.672
country and the ISP they are
hopping to? >> Yeah, we have the

00:30:40.672 --> 00:30:42.674
sources in Korea. The latter two
and if anyone owns honeypots and

00:30:42.674 --> 00:30:44.676
the traffic is coming from those
countries and then, one web host

00:30:44.676 --> 00:30:46.678
provider. Why that is in there?
I don't know. Probably

00:30:46.678 --> 00:30:48.680
definitely going to follow-up on
that. >> We were going to follow

00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:50.682
the attribution dye, but the
Netherlands are not on the

00:30:50.682 --> 00:30:52.684
attribution dye yet, so we have
to get them added. >> What are

00:30:52.684 --> 00:30:54.686
they doing once they log in?
Absolutely nothing. One ran a

00:30:54.686 --> 00:30:56.688
ping to 999.999. I was like you
suck. >> How did your logs fill

00:30:56.688 --> 00:30:58.690
up? >> Logs, yeah, I had to get
more space. Really saddening and

00:30:58.690 --> 00:31:00.625
when we were doing honeypot
research unrelated to this, this

00:31:00.625 --> 00:31:02.627
is what we saw. Any device that
is copied to a typical Linux box

00:31:02.627 --> 00:31:04.629
and they are similar type
attacks. Did the attacker know

00:31:04.629 --> 00:31:06.631
they had a MRI machine? No,
because they didn't do their

00:31:06.631 --> 00:31:08.633
homework and know this is an MRI
machine, what can I do? These

00:31:08.633 --> 00:31:10.635
honeypots were actively talking
back-and-forth to the C 2

00:31:10.635 --> 00:31:12.637
server. Are there medical
devices that are owned that are

00:31:12.637 --> 00:31:14.639
talking back to the C 2? Yeah.
If you log in, you can see a

00:31:14.639 --> 00:31:20.645
defibrillator late or. That's
interesting. Once they figure it

00:31:54.913 --> 00:31:59.084
out, what can they do with it?
Obviously, there is an

00:31:59.084 --> 00:32:02.721
intentional attack. What happens
when the news hits that

00:32:02.721 --> 00:32:06.424
someone's defibrillator starts
going crazy? Oh, this MRI is

00:32:06.424 --> 00:32:11.730
owned. Once it gets in the news,
it is high-profile and once it

00:32:11.730 --> 00:32:16.368
is high-profile, people are
going to look. This is a typical

00:32:16.368 --> 00:32:22.374
Linux box and now, interact with
it. If you are a bad guy. Can I

00:32:24.609 --> 00:32:29.848
sell that? Can I do malicious
things with that? That's what we

00:32:29.848 --> 00:32:35.854
are trying to conclude. Our next
step is to go on the hunt and

00:32:35.854 --> 00:32:41.026
figure out which bots are
talking to what? >> A quick wrap

00:32:41.026 --> 00:32:46.631
up. We know there are vulnerable
systems out there and we are not

00:32:46.631 --> 00:32:53.071
going to reduce it to zero.
That's not our goal. Massive

00:32:53.071 --> 00:32:59.077
attack surface, but very simple
things and you don't need to

00:33:07.152 --> 00:33:13.158
drop ODEC's to get into their
devices. That exposed vulnerable

00:33:19.564 --> 00:33:24.436
system that we are looking at.
Health care organizations

00:33:24.436 --> 00:33:30.442
overall are heavily focused on
patient privacy and those type

00:33:33.712 --> 00:33:39.718
of things. Problem awareness and
increasingly accessible. Once

00:33:46.858 --> 00:33:52.864
the activity increases and the
susceptibility to that

00:33:55.333 --> 00:34:01.273
interaction and it does not
focus on safety. We need to

00:34:05.277 --> 00:34:11.283
change our mindset and focus on
real safety. The FDA has been

00:34:19.491 --> 00:34:25.497
working with us over the last
year and having some of these

00:35:17.782 --> 00:35:23.788
landmark things happen. They do
not validate cyber controls or

00:36:00.658 --> 00:36:07.432
safety controls at all. And just
to recap, malicious intent is

00:36:07.432 --> 00:36:14.639
not a prerequisite quit. In the
honeypot, it gets malware and

00:36:14.639 --> 00:36:21.179
that malware is designed to
corrupt forensic data. If you

00:36:21.179 --> 00:36:26.985
work for a health care
organization, I highly recommend

00:36:26.985 --> 00:36:34.292
you get your credentials and run
them in your environment and see

00:36:34.292 --> 00:36:38.496
if they are being utilized and
contact the manufacturer and ask

00:36:38.496 --> 00:36:45.203
how they are going to get fixed.
Secondly, working in health

00:36:45.203 --> 00:36:51.643
care, many organizations want to
solely put it on sometimes

00:36:51.643 --> 00:36:54.079
(Indiscernible) on the
manufacturer and they will ask

00:36:54.079 --> 00:36:56.214
the manufacturer and saying that
we have these credentials and

00:36:56.214 --> 00:37:01.086
the manufacturer says that we
cannot do that and they don't

00:37:01.086 --> 00:37:04.823
press them. This is not a
spectator sport. You need to get

00:37:04.823 --> 00:37:08.660
involved. If you work for a
health care organization, I can

00:37:08.660 --> 00:37:12.397
guarantee you that patient
health care is in your

00:37:12.397 --> 00:37:15.233
organization's values. If it
isn't, you shouldn't work for

00:37:15.233 --> 00:37:21.239
that health care organization.
Engaging consultants and if you

00:37:30.415 --> 00:37:34.919
are on the software side or in
the industry, you need to reach

00:37:34.919 --> 00:37:40.925
out to the legal contracting and
prior to cutting that check, to

00:37:43.228 --> 00:37:45.697
put requirements in place for
certain security controls and

00:37:45.697 --> 00:37:51.069
penalties in the contract and
come up with service level

00:37:51.069 --> 00:37:54.973
contracts for vulnerability and
the coordinated disclosure. We

00:37:54.973 --> 00:38:00.912
had that formal statement from
Phillips health care. That's the

00:38:03.748 --> 00:38:09.754
first medical device
manufacturer that released

00:38:14.559 --> 00:38:17.829
formal statement disclosure and
it is a very good one. Round of

00:38:17.829 --> 00:38:20.965
applause for them. [ APPLAUSE ]
And Medtronic is another one.

00:38:20.965 --> 00:38:24.969
They now have a dedicated way if
you go to their website how to

00:38:24.969 --> 00:38:28.406
contact the person to get ahold
of us. Besides Las Vegas, two

00:38:28.406 --> 00:38:32.110
days ago, when we did the update
and a very big medical device

00:38:32.110 --> 00:38:35.813
manufacturer in Germany and they
came on, he got on a phone call

00:38:35.813 --> 00:38:39.450
with us, and they have committed
to come out with a formulated

00:38:39.450 --> 00:38:42.487
disclosure policy. It is not a
spectator sport. You have to

00:38:42.487 --> 00:38:45.590
reach out and collaborate with
the allies to solve this

00:38:45.590 --> 00:38:49.661
problem. If we continue down
this road that we are in, right

00:38:49.661 --> 00:38:53.364
now, it is interesting; the FDA
receives tens of thousands of

00:38:53.364 --> 00:38:56.701
related disclosure events. It
could be just an adverse event.

00:38:56.701 --> 00:39:00.004
Right now, we can't do forensic
information's very easily. When

00:39:00.004 --> 00:39:03.374
there is an event, it is
adjudicated clinically. Oh, no,

00:39:03.374 --> 00:39:06.744
he died from pneumonia. So,
clinical cause of death instead

00:39:06.744 --> 00:39:10.515
of medical device malfunction.
When it goes into the clinical

00:39:10.515 --> 00:39:13.251
cause of death, it goes into a
bucket and goes nowhere. We need

00:39:13.251 --> 00:39:19.257
to get better at that. Going
forward and we have to treat

00:39:35.206 --> 00:39:41.212
this. Patient safety has to be
the overriding objective and if

00:39:57.095 --> 00:40:03.101
not, it has to be addressed. I
think that we have to look at

00:40:41.572 --> 00:40:45.977
patient safety more than patient
privacy. We need to avoid failed

00:40:45.977 --> 00:40:48.346
practices. We continue to see
it. We know they are failed

00:40:48.346 --> 00:40:54.352
practices and continue to use
it. We need to integrate the

00:40:58.589 --> 00:41:04.529
safety consents into existing
security practices and

00:41:18.142 --> 00:41:21.679
government structures. If we do
that, we are going to have more

00:41:21.679 --> 00:41:24.315
reliable medical devices coming
to market. We shouldn't have

00:41:24.315 --> 00:41:28.019
undue or delayed cost. We are
going to have better

00:41:28.019 --> 00:41:34.025
coordination and they are going
to be more resilient and lastly,

00:41:41.432 --> 00:41:45.436
how do you get involved? If you
are a researcher or work at a

00:41:45.436 --> 00:41:49.774
health care organization, or you
want to test the device and test

00:41:49.774 --> 00:41:53.711
them? My wife hasn't let me buy
a medical device and put it in

00:41:53.711 --> 00:41:59.717
the basement yet; you can go on
eBay and buy one. If you are in

00:42:06.691 --> 00:42:08.860
the industry, get involved in
the industry-coordinated groups.

00:42:08.860 --> 00:42:16.467
There is a handful of them. The
FDA for the first time ever this

00:42:16.467 --> 00:42:21.439
year brought in security
developers and released guidance

00:42:21.439 --> 00:42:27.445
and an IEEE for the medical
device software and it was held

00:42:30.248 --> 00:42:37.889
in New Orleans and another
followed in December. If you do

00:42:37.889 --> 00:42:41.592
this stuff, speak at industry
conferences and not just

00:42:41.592 --> 00:42:45.396
security conferences like DEF
CON. I spend a large majority of

00:42:45.396 --> 00:42:50.835
my time going to health care
conferences and speaking to the

00:42:50.835 --> 00:42:55.706
C level and the security and
privacy events and I did a talk

00:42:55.706 --> 00:42:57.842
at the health procurement guides
and this is what you can do

00:42:57.842 --> 00:43:01.979
during procurement to reduce
this risk in your organization

00:43:01.979 --> 00:43:09.053
and if you have not heard eye on
the Calvary and this is a grass

00:43:09.053 --> 00:43:13.758
roots organization that is
focused on safety and focuses on

00:43:13.758 --> 00:43:19.397
human life. Get in involved if
you are not involved. Guys, it

00:43:19.397 --> 00:43:24.101
is really good. If anything
else, the collaboration and meet

00:43:24.101 --> 00:43:29.740
new people who are interested in
doing what you are doing and

00:43:29.740 --> 00:43:36.147
being part of the solution and
not just coming up here at DEF

00:43:36.147 --> 00:43:40.017
CON and dropping a lot of
research and walking away from

00:43:40.017 --> 00:43:43.321
the problem, but getting
involved to solve the problem.

00:43:43.321 --> 00:43:48.526
The people in this room, the
ones that are uniquely qualified

00:43:48.526 --> 00:43:54.132
can fix what they can find. Do
your best. Thank you for coming

00:43:54.132 --> 00:43:58.503
out. I know that we had a
miscommunication about time.

00:43:58.503 --> 00:44:03.641
Twenty-minute talk. We said, no,
we are going 45. We are getting

00:44:03.641 --> 00:44:09.280
kicked out of here. But we will
be outside if anyone wants to

00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:13.618
talk. Thank you so much. Have a
good DEF CON.
