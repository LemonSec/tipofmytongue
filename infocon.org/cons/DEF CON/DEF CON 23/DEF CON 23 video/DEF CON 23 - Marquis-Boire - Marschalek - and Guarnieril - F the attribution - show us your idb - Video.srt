00:00:00.367 --> 00:00:03.804
 >> Good afternoon, how's
everyone doing? Let's talk about

00:00:03.804 --> 00:00:09.810
attribution now. Nation state
stuff is a big deal. The other

00:00:15.716 --> 00:00:21.188
night I went to bed and turn on
television in my hotel room. I

00:00:21.188 --> 00:00:27.394
see Ted Crew talking about
national security and nation

00:00:27.394 --> 00:00:33.400
state to nation state hacking.
Let's give our next speakers a

00:00:38.772 --> 00:00:44.778
big round of applause. >>
Welcome to big game hunting.

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:55.255
Actually the title is fuck your
attribution shows us your .idb.

00:00:58.759 --> 00:01:04.698
I'm currently the directly of
security at media. Test. Test.

00:01:13.407 --> 00:01:18.378
Sorry. I also am a senior
researcher at University of

00:01:18.378 --> 00:01:24.384
Toronto and I advise bunch of
organization for security. >>

00:01:27.754 --> 00:01:34.528
Hello, I'm not as busy as Morgan
is. I occasionally do reverse

00:01:34.528 --> 00:01:36.530
engineering malware. Spare time
I give classes and hang out

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.532
conferences like this one. I'm
happy to be part of the most

00:01:38.532 --> 00:01:40.534
diverse group here. >> I was
advice that the panel was more

00:01:40.534 --> 00:01:42.536
diverse but that's not true. We
are starting a claudio hashtag.

00:01:42.536 --> 00:01:48.542
We got a lot to get through.
Today we are going to cover a

00:02:27.347 --> 00:02:33.387
little bit about how antivirus
move to antivirus 2.0 circle

00:02:33.387 --> 00:02:39.526
rise intelligence. We will talk
about how that's made. Discuss

00:02:39.526 --> 00:02:45.532
the industry's fans nation,
attribution. We will discuss a

00:02:47.534 --> 00:02:53.140
novel approach to binary
attribution. I'll do some

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:59.546
hacking team as oppose to and at
the end we will have just by

00:02:59.546 --> 00:03:06.286
stage you will all be experts
and have choose your own venture

00:03:06.286 --> 00:03:14.261
malware where the audience will
help us out, set of nation state

00:03:14.261 --> 00:03:20.267
malware. I will start at at
least the beginner of the modern

00:03:24.504 --> 00:03:31.144
era in terms that realizing that
this game was going on. I worked

00:03:31.144 --> 00:03:35.682
at google when google was hacked
by china in 2009. It was

00:03:35.682 --> 00:03:40.253
publically announced in 2010.
And reaction was interesting. It

00:03:40.253 --> 00:03:46.259
lead to finger pointing. How can
you hack our beloved silicon

00:03:51.431 --> 00:03:57.771
valley. And we've learned that
silicon valley was owned by

00:03:57.771 --> 00:04:00.006
china and also everything is
owned by china. And chess

00:04:00.006 --> 00:04:05.946
beating on china. And we learned
that it wasn't just china. It

00:04:16.957 --> 00:04:22.395
was everything was hacking
everything. And another the

00:04:22.395 --> 00:04:27.801
things life's big stage you
probably know about net, the

00:04:27.801 --> 00:04:33.807
first world digital side web. It
was a joint effort by U.S. and

00:04:46.153 --> 00:04:52.159
Israel to sabotage Iran's
program. This is called the

00:04:59.232 --> 00:05:05.172
tidbit platform. More recently I
did a bunch of work with claudio

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:13.446
who isn't here, and malware
called rigid. And this was

00:05:15.482 --> 00:05:21.488
attributed to the hack. >> On
the other side funnier.

00:05:24.891 --> 00:05:31.198
Beginning of 2015 we uncovered
not only the British government

00:05:31.198 --> 00:05:35.802
is interested in operating their
own spyware and also the French

00:05:35.802 --> 00:05:41.808
had their fingers around Iran
and certain institutions. And

00:05:50.116 --> 00:05:56.122
spying in the middle east. >> So
earlier this year I expressed

00:06:01.027 --> 00:06:07.033
the NASA network. So what we
actually see is basically all

00:06:09.069 --> 00:06:15.675
states using hacking, at least
the larger ones are and the

00:06:15.675 --> 00:06:21.681
smaller ones probably want to be
doing this. Around 2012 we

00:06:24.884 --> 00:06:28.054
learned there was commercial
companies that were selling this

00:06:28.054 --> 00:06:34.494
capability to nation states. So
bunch of commercial material

00:06:34.494 --> 00:06:39.866
from a conference surveillance
conference. Bunch of people that

00:06:39.866 --> 00:06:43.703
went there to sell this
capability to various nation

00:06:43.703 --> 00:06:49.709
states. So we learned about
finfisher hacking team boot pin.

00:06:52.779 --> 00:06:56.883
They were selling implants and
exploits and stuff, which lead

00:06:56.883 --> 00:06:59.920
to finger wracking. In these
days everyone is selling

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:05.458
implants and exploits. There are
probably someone in distance

00:07:05.458 --> 00:07:11.464
black and wearing black hat who
will offer to sell you these

00:07:13.767 --> 00:07:19.773
things. So there's a commercial
scene, rigorous public debate to

00:07:24.344 --> 00:07:28.448
cover people actually selling
commercial capability in this

00:07:28.448 --> 00:07:34.454
area. Right. So this is actually
lead to corresponding change to

00:07:40.026 --> 00:07:44.764
industry. Ad 2.0. A lot of
people might be similar to this

00:07:44.764 --> 00:07:46.766
if you are not playing for the
software then you are the

00:07:46.766 --> 00:07:52.772
product. With a/v 2.0 you are
the product and you are still

00:07:57.277 --> 00:08:01.781
paying for the software. So you
actually manage, they do one

00:08:01.781 --> 00:08:07.787
better. >> The question is how,
so I try to find the definition.

00:08:14.194 --> 00:08:21.935
And I didn't find anything that
would fit one slide. So for

00:08:21.935 --> 00:08:23.937
intelligence we understand
malware watching. When threat

00:08:23.937 --> 00:08:25.939
detection industry it's all
about detecting threats and now

00:08:25.939 --> 00:08:31.945
it's watching threat. This is
interesting is where is the

00:08:39.085 --> 00:08:43.256
malware, where did it come from,
who is operating it, and what

00:08:43.256 --> 00:08:49.162
does the guy want to do with
malware. Lots has been written

00:08:49.162 --> 00:08:55.168
on this. A lot of money flowing
depending on the threat intel.

00:08:59.973 --> 00:09:01.908
You can imagine it's like, you
can imagine a robbery, someone

00:09:01.908 --> 00:09:03.910
breaks into your house and steal
the stuff in your house. And you

00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:05.912
hire the security company. The
security company say don't stop

00:09:05.912 --> 00:09:07.914
him and watch what he wants to
steal and try to find out

00:09:07.914 --> 00:09:09.916
because we have to figure out
where he came from and where

00:09:09.916 --> 00:09:12.018
he's going. And watching this
guy stealing the stuff from your

00:09:12.018 --> 00:09:18.024
house and security company is
watching what the thief is

00:09:22.462 --> 00:09:28.468
doing. This is what we are
seeing today with antivirus

00:09:32.305 --> 00:09:34.307
intelligence. This lead to
industry working on tracking.

00:09:34.307 --> 00:09:36.309
Who operating the threat. Having
interesting threat, interesting

00:09:36.309 --> 00:09:38.311
operator is actually worth
revenue and gain market value.

00:09:38.311 --> 00:09:40.313
What's even more interesting to
me is the numbering a/v ts for

00:09:40.313 --> 00:09:42.348
the sake of publicity. With
revenue, when nation malware

00:09:42.348 --> 00:09:44.350
it's interesting it causes, it
has a lot of public interest on

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:46.352
the cyber warfare scene and
number of targets are small.

00:09:46.352 --> 00:09:48.354
Security company can be fairly
sure by holding the information

00:09:48.354 --> 00:09:54.360
back but not publishing soon and
watching the actor for a long

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:06.706
time, actually smaller customers
at risk. How do we find these?

00:10:24.691 --> 00:10:30.697
Let's think about this as a
needle, in a haystack problem. A

00:10:34.167 --> 00:10:40.173
problem in a big malware
process. These are automatically

00:10:43.309 --> 00:10:49.315
processed and traded. Company
exchange samples, scans, send on

00:10:52.452 --> 00:10:58.458
to other vendors or whatever.
All these big hay sack might or

00:11:04.564 --> 00:11:10.570
might not contain interesting
samples or our precious

00:11:12.705 --> 00:11:20.113
treasures. How do we find these
treasures? So as you might know

00:11:20.113 --> 00:11:26.119
we are both here worked on
malware. That is very specific

00:11:28.254 --> 00:11:34.260
problem that we have is massive
haystack and have to find the

00:11:52.612 --> 00:11:58.618
needle. With the different
needle signing is what you want

00:12:18.137 --> 00:12:24.143
to do is use the indicator, you
know the malware you are

00:12:26.646 --> 00:12:32.085
searching for and request
certain malware from data and if

00:12:32.085 --> 00:12:35.021
you find your indicator and data
already there. This is one way.

00:12:35.021 --> 00:12:41.027
By the way the same problem, in
data, you don't find much of

00:12:45.198 --> 00:12:52.739
that data. Another interesting
source is leaked document. This

00:12:52.739 --> 00:12:59.412
is recent phenomenon. We have
documents actually describing

00:12:59.412 --> 00:13:05.351
these precious needles. The
infected machines. If you are

00:13:08.388 --> 00:13:14.394
not at all have big haystack to
dig for, ask people what they

00:13:16.763 --> 00:13:18.965
have in their machines. Last
point, is gossip. You wouldn't

00:13:18.965 --> 00:13:24.971
think how much information is
exchanged at the bar after a

00:13:30.643 --> 00:13:36.649
couple drinks. This doesn't
seize to amaze me. So what we

00:13:38.685 --> 00:13:44.691
have today is endpoint wars. I
started my career at an

00:13:48.928 --> 00:13:54.867
antivirus company. Antivirus
company some years ago what they

00:13:54.867 --> 00:14:00.006
actually do is not writing
antivirus engine but security

00:14:00.006 --> 00:14:07.246
points product. So they have
endpoint agents. They are out

00:14:07.246 --> 00:14:11.150
endpoints to scan for indicator
compromise or threat indicator

00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:17.156
searched for and antivirus input
agent through mitigation

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:27.433
tactics. Endpoint data to the
company operating the product.

00:14:27.433 --> 00:14:33.439
So this is the data. How does it
work? Here's our endpoint agent,

00:14:35.441 --> 00:14:41.447
effect infection and mitigation.
This is the signature and

00:14:46.085 --> 00:14:51.324
detection patterns of the
security company produces. This

00:14:51.324 --> 00:14:55.528
is being sent out frequently so
they are up to date. Depend on

00:14:55.528 --> 00:14:58.798
the threat caters. So what agent
send data to security company to

00:14:58.798 --> 00:15:00.733
threat indicator. This quality
insurance data. It could be the

00:15:00.733 --> 00:15:02.802
binary itself. So security
company can check to see if it's

00:15:02.802 --> 00:15:08.808
a real threat or positive. And
hit frequency. So actually these

00:15:16.015 --> 00:15:20.753
security company know what their
agents do. This data is the

00:15:20.753 --> 00:15:24.290
precious data being used for the
security vendors, we have

00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:28.227
detection for this here and we
assume, the government in India.

00:15:28.227 --> 00:15:32.498
How does it work back stage? We
do signature testing. So the

00:15:32.498 --> 00:15:36.068
threat security company send
endpoint and see how the threat

00:15:36.068 --> 00:15:39.639
data works. At the data search
for blood post. Another

00:15:39.639 --> 00:15:43.176
phenomenon is silent signatures.
They are detection send out to

00:15:43.176 --> 00:15:47.814
the end point to work silently
and generate qa data to see if

00:15:47.814 --> 00:15:51.751
the signature works or if it
might produce a massive false

00:15:51.751 --> 00:15:55.288
positive. The signature is not
activate at the beginning. These

00:15:55.288 --> 00:15:59.592
can be known to use occasionally
but do well searching for well

00:15:59.592 --> 00:16:02.361
without indicating to the
customer that there's something

00:16:02.361 --> 00:16:06.632
wrong in the machine. This is a
theory. Binaries are sent back

00:16:06.632 --> 00:16:09.502
to the threat detection
companies to check signatures.

00:16:09.502 --> 00:16:15.508
Look at binary and sneak some
binary out of the machine with

00:16:18.744 --> 00:16:20.746
their endpoint. And data
produced and summing it up if

00:16:20.746 --> 00:16:22.748
you install free security
product be there they are

00:16:22.748 --> 00:16:24.750
produce data. The free security
product are actually

00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:26.752
contributing to the a tela
machine. Another phenomenon

00:16:26.752 --> 00:16:28.754
while digging through our
haystacks and searching for our

00:16:28.754 --> 00:16:34.760
needles you get to talk to other
people interested. Occasionally

00:16:45.838 --> 00:16:51.844
the same malware you are
searching for, you will find

00:16:55.781 --> 00:16:58.651
yourself in very interesting
conversation for people you

00:16:58.651 --> 00:17:03.155
never thought would talk to you
all of a sudden very friendly or

00:17:03.155 --> 00:17:08.160
the opposite. Oh, no. I saw your
e-mail and I just didn't have

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:10.730
time. These things happen. >>
Yeah. So the issue frequently

00:17:10.730 --> 00:17:13.466
when you are actually looking
for a particularly, maybe you

00:17:13.466 --> 00:17:16.435
are hunting a country. Maybe you
know New Zealand is doing

00:17:16.435 --> 00:17:19.171
interesting openings. >> Never
happened. >> So in the real

00:17:19.171 --> 00:17:22.708
world example of this is malware
that I worked on for with a

00:17:22.708 --> 00:17:25.177
variety of people for a
significant period is attributed

00:17:25.177 --> 00:17:29.248
to the 5 is. We will get to
that. The gcsq and that sort of

00:17:29.248 --> 00:17:32.518
thing. It was allegedly used on
the hack European. Now when I

00:17:32.518 --> 00:17:35.521
was working on this it became
apparently that it's the worst

00:17:35.521 --> 00:17:38.257
antivirus. Because people had
known about it for quite some

00:17:38.257 --> 00:17:40.426
time. So somewhat naively. I
suspected they wouldn't

00:17:40.426 --> 00:17:42.895
published and then somehow it's
published that week. Semantic

00:17:42.895 --> 00:17:45.865
published Sunday night. And
another a few hours later and my

00:17:45.865 --> 00:17:48.601
report came out the next
morning. >> Imagine getting your

00:17:48.601 --> 00:17:51.604
market team working on Sunday
night. >> I'm not bitter about

00:17:51.604 --> 00:17:54.874
this. But actually this happen
when you are doing this type of

00:17:54.874 --> 00:17:58.511
work. And then all of a sudden
five or 6 different people in

00:17:58.511 --> 00:18:00.446
the antivirus searching for the
same thing and you are all

00:18:00.446 --> 00:18:02.481
working on it but yet who is
actually releasing it. It gets

00:18:02.481 --> 00:18:04.584
tricky very fast. >> All right.
Before we actually get to our

00:18:04.584 --> 00:18:06.686
big game hunting, we want to
speak out to our friends in

00:18:06.686 --> 00:18:08.688
Africa. I want to tell you
there's no harm during the

00:18:08.688 --> 00:18:10.690
presentation. >> Sisl. We sort
of forget about actually

00:18:10.690 --> 00:18:12.692
victim/targets really, really
fast. There's this kind of

00:18:12.692 --> 00:18:14.694
position with sophistication and
attribution fuel reports on

00:18:14.694 --> 00:18:16.696
this. So I notice this
perspective really illustrated

00:18:16.696 --> 00:18:18.698
when I went to an antivirus
company. I want to do a small

00:18:18.698 --> 00:18:20.700
test. Google does this state
sponsored warning. They will

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:22.702
stick a banner on your gmail. We
think you have been targeted.

00:18:22.702 --> 00:18:24.704
Are you guys familiar with this?
How many people here actually

00:18:24.704 --> 00:18:26.706
received that warning? Not too
bad. A couple. So I went to this

00:18:26.706 --> 00:18:32.311
conference in the middle east.
Primarily people who had done a

00:18:32.311 --> 00:18:38.317
lot of political writing. Fair,
balance reporting how the

00:19:10.816 --> 00:19:16.822
government were not very keen on
freedom of the press. And I

00:20:02.268 --> 00:20:08.274
asked this question and half the
audience put their hand up. So I

00:20:42.975 --> 00:20:47.346
was at this a/v company
recently. And this guy says to

00:20:47.346 --> 00:20:51.884
me. Hey, where did you find
interesting sample it the other

00:20:51.884 --> 00:20:57.256
day. We it was sent to me. The
guy said, that's cheating. If

00:20:57.256 --> 00:21:00.392
I'm not obsessing about malware.
I'm obsessing about

00:21:00.392 --> 00:21:05.498
sophistication. This is
cheating. So this industry is

00:21:05.498 --> 00:21:11.504
kind of missed up. What's
interesting and what you should

00:22:00.653 --> 00:22:06.659
be doing in this research.
Malware is used espionage in

00:23:28.073 --> 00:23:31.043
some places that policy is
draconian. This guy, I spent

00:23:31.043 --> 00:23:37.049
couple of years tracking the
digital campaign going on in

00:23:50.462 --> 00:23:56.468
Syria. This guy was talking to
the aid worker a lot. His

00:24:05.878 --> 00:24:11.350
computer was, actually their
computers were compromise. It

00:24:11.350 --> 00:24:17.356
only Syria police have all the
records of his skype

00:24:21.126 --> 00:24:25.698
conversation, e-mails so on and
so forth and this stuck with me.

00:24:25.698 --> 00:24:30.336
That's actually a hard drive. It
got smuggled out and Fedex to

00:24:30.336 --> 00:24:36.342
U.S. with me. I actually have it
onstage with me because no one

00:24:42.448 --> 00:24:50.322
leaves anything interesting in
the hotel at Defcon. This

00:24:50.322 --> 00:24:57.329
woman's name is Alasha and the
guy, her name is actually

00:24:57.329 --> 00:25:03.268
finfisher zero. It's a sweet
governmental intrusion solved by

00:25:09.541 --> 00:25:17.116
a German company and they did a
bunch of interesting thing. Sell

00:25:17.116 --> 00:25:21.253
it to Egyptian during the
revolution. When I did the

00:25:21.253 --> 00:25:27.259
publication a few ago, she was
the first person who sent me a

00:25:29.395 --> 00:25:33.065
sample. She's a London economic
professor. Her husband was

00:25:33.065 --> 00:25:39.071
seized and they got no word of
what happened to him for 48 days

00:25:44.176 --> 00:25:50.416
for spreading information about
the government largely on the

00:25:50.416 --> 00:25:56.422
comments he made on Facebook.
This guy I believe he's also an

00:26:00.092 --> 00:26:04.530
advisor of human rights watch.
His official charge was

00:26:04.530 --> 00:26:10.536
insulting an officer. He had no
idea how they were tracking him.

00:26:20.112 --> 00:26:25.551
So I did something on his
machine and I found malware by

00:26:25.551 --> 00:26:31.557
these guys. Anyone here from
hacking team? But in this case,

00:26:36.728 --> 00:26:42.734
attribution was in that. For
brief malware targeted that

00:26:46.105 --> 00:26:52.478
address. So in this case it was
recently easy to find out who

00:26:52.478 --> 00:26:57.316
was doing the spying. Which
brings us to this guy. Some of

00:26:57.316 --> 00:27:03.255
you might be familiar with this
case. He was argentine attorney

00:27:06.692 --> 00:27:12.431
who was about to bring charges
prisoner of Argentina and high

00:27:12.431 --> 00:27:19.605
level partition for a cover up
terrorist attack which killed

00:27:19.605 --> 00:27:25.611
people. Four days before, he was
found dead. There were, it was

00:27:31.683 --> 00:27:37.689
ruled as suicide, apparently he
shot himself in his head with

00:27:39.691 --> 00:27:45.697
powder left on his hands. His
death lead to protest in

00:27:49.768 --> 00:27:55.774
Argentina. It was actually
published in a small Argentina

00:27:58.010 --> 00:28:03.949
news out let. And they found one
that was. And it's called [ on

00:28:12.591 --> 00:28:18.597
screen ] that. >> [speaking in
Spanish] Happy to help. >> And

00:28:21.767 --> 00:28:27.940
it was a bit confusing. The
malware was actually for

00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:33.946
windows. It turns out the
conditions around the forensics

00:28:36.315 --> 00:28:42.321
of devices gets murkier and
murkier. What can we do? We can

00:28:46.391 --> 00:28:52.331
extrapolate a bunch of
targeting. The way you do this

00:28:52.331 --> 00:28:58.337
is you search for the sample.
One hit, one up, Argentina. It

00:29:02.474 --> 00:29:08.480
is related. Control remain, the
people targeting him, using

00:29:11.083 --> 00:29:17.022
political bait, network based
indicator suggest to us the

00:29:17.022 --> 00:29:23.395
actor were based in Argentina.
The actual malware itself was

00:29:23.395 --> 00:29:29.401
interesting. It started as proof
of concept. Someone actually

00:29:33.905 --> 00:29:40.345
wrote a proof of concept for
android and it's called fruit

00:29:40.345 --> 00:29:46.351
tus. And someone selling them.
And popped up as reasonably

00:29:58.030 --> 00:30:01.933
cheap. Another piece of for sale
malware and recently seen it

00:30:01.933 --> 00:30:05.637
doing around attack as alien
spy. As you can see on seen it's

00:30:05.637 --> 00:30:12.377
mostly Spanish language and does
a variety of stuff. Turn off the

00:30:12.377 --> 00:30:17.516
microphone on your laptop or
cell phone so you can listen to

00:30:17.516 --> 00:30:28.326
ambient noises around the device
and that sort of thing. This is

00:30:28.326 --> 00:30:37.569
the similar targeting the same
group is doing. I can't tell if

00:30:37.569 --> 00:30:45.944
the document is real or not. The
document is supposed to give the

00:30:45.944 --> 00:30:56.788
implant it looks like from the
embassy from one to brazil.

00:30:56.788 --> 00:31:10.068
Indicators point to people in
Argentina, well actor based in

00:31:10.068 --> 00:31:16.775
Argentina. However we also see
the use of hosting services in

00:31:16.775 --> 00:31:24.583
the U.S., German, Sweden, go
daddy. So it could have been

00:31:24.583 --> 00:31:28.787
anybody. Right? >> It was
definitely a suicide. >> You

00:31:28.787 --> 00:31:34.926
said about attribution sometimes
it's tricky sometimes it's easy

00:31:34.926 --> 00:31:38.130
depends. In that case,
attribution was semi tricky.

00:31:38.130 --> 00:31:52.911
Because I didn't actually when
working on malware not do any

00:31:52.911 --> 00:31:57.582
attribution because attribution
had already been done. In the

00:31:57.582 --> 00:32:01.119
case of barbar, which is
allegedly written by French

00:32:01.119 --> 00:32:08.393
intelligence and the attribution
actually was made through a

00:32:08.393 --> 00:32:13.298
leaked document published
earlier this year saying that

00:32:13.298 --> 00:32:17.869
Canadian intelligence services
found Canada and attributed to

00:32:17.869 --> 00:32:24.376
the French. Canadian did a good
job and I totally agree with

00:32:24.376 --> 00:32:31.116
them. But, of course, in real
life we don't have this

00:32:31.116 --> 00:32:34.719
opportunity. Furthermore, barbar
wasn't the only user used they

00:32:34.719 --> 00:32:42.594
came with brothers and sisters.
Downloading script partially

00:32:42.594 --> 00:32:57.676
change. But more. They were
other family namely casper and

00:32:57.676 --> 00:33:06.518
deno. And we research these
samples and yeah. These look

00:33:06.518 --> 00:33:11.756
like the same author. People
were like why are you so sure

00:33:11.756 --> 00:33:18.463
that they run together.
Especially for the end bot we

00:33:18.463 --> 00:33:23.268
had a serious issue with
actually proving our statement.

00:33:23.268 --> 00:33:27.873
Okay. These are operated
allegedly by French

00:33:27.873 --> 00:33:36.982
intelligence. So what do we do
and help with this problem? You

00:33:36.982 --> 00:33:41.286
might have seen a lot of these
posts oh, my god we found more

00:33:41.286 --> 00:33:55.066
sample. And duku 2 related to
duku 1. All these statements

00:33:55.066 --> 00:34:01.773
they never came with any
understandable prove how the

00:34:01.773 --> 00:34:08.480
analyst got to their resource.
So pretty how to transparently

00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:12.117
prove how two binary is related
or not related. One can do a

00:34:12.117 --> 00:34:22.060
suitable conclusion who the
actor was. The bar was mentioned

00:34:22.060 --> 00:34:26.564
in the document. The document
said it was false then we know

00:34:26.564 --> 00:34:30.235
the family members were related
to barbar. How did we do this?

00:34:30.235 --> 00:34:42.180
Malware attribution is who wrote
the malware, control it, the

00:34:42.180 --> 00:34:48.787
victims, the problem is if you
have ever done in the binary, it

00:34:48.787 --> 00:34:57.228
doesn't tell you any of this.
The time when the names written

00:34:57.228 --> 00:35:00.098
into the malware, that was back
in the '90s. So with this the

00:35:00.098 --> 00:35:07.739
people who wrote the malware
were not the same people.

00:35:07.739 --> 00:35:21.820
Someone bought it and used it
later on. We want the binary and

00:35:21.820 --> 00:35:28.460
put it into a context but we
can't get to it through binary.

00:35:28.460 --> 00:35:33.531
So what we want to do is linking
binaries together. And we have

00:35:33.531 --> 00:35:41.706
this set of binaries and they
look like they are related to

00:35:41.706 --> 00:35:49.214
the malware. And we conclude
that it the same. So how?

00:35:49.214 --> 00:35:59.991
There's already research being
done how source code can be

00:35:59.991 --> 00:36:06.665
attributed to an author. With
that if you have a certain set

00:36:06.665 --> 00:36:12.971
of samples for machine learning
and attributes extract samples

00:36:12.971 --> 00:36:17.976
to determine who the author for
the source code was. This works

00:36:17.976 --> 00:36:24.082
on source code if you have one
author writing hundreds of

00:36:24.082 --> 00:36:29.988
samples to train machine. The
problem with binary is you don't

00:36:29.988 --> 00:36:35.593
have any more handwriting left.
You don't see white spaces

00:36:35.593 --> 00:36:43.368
variable names, comma, nothing
but binary have massive

00:36:43.368 --> 00:36:50.375
influence on the compiler
itself. Another problem in this

00:36:50.375 --> 00:36:55.380
is there's a team of author and
this team of author might change

00:36:55.380 --> 00:37:04.589
over time. So the same person
who wrote this malware won't be

00:37:04.589 --> 00:37:16.568
able to help to find the writers
for this. So how can we tell if

00:37:16.568 --> 00:37:27.979
the same author wrote this? Very
important the attribute that we

00:37:27.979 --> 00:37:33.184
get for describing our binary
get from different domains.

00:37:33.184 --> 00:37:39.390
Which means we not only look at
the technique of malware uses,

00:37:39.390 --> 00:37:44.496
overlapping source code. Because
source code can be copy/paste by

00:37:44.496 --> 00:37:54.305
anyone. So we try to grab
attributes from others to spread

00:37:54.305 --> 00:37:59.844
the probability to even out
human comparison so we try to

00:37:59.844 --> 00:38:04.783
get as many attributes we can
get our hands on. And another

00:38:04.783 --> 00:38:11.389
reason is attributes can be
fake. If you are malware author

00:38:11.389 --> 00:38:16.060
you don't want people to
recognize and attribute to

00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:22.167
binary. You can even out fake
attributes and link to the

00:38:22.167 --> 00:38:29.340
binary. The assumption is that
it's impossible to random the

00:38:29.340 --> 00:38:38.983
attribute. You can even out
human influence. You are not

00:38:38.983 --> 00:38:46.925
interested in individual guy the
code but who operator it and

00:38:46.925 --> 00:38:52.130
stole the data. Here's how the
attribute that we propose in our

00:38:52.130 --> 00:38:56.067
paper. I'm sure you can read it
very well. But memorize them

00:38:56.067 --> 00:39:01.372
all, I'm kidding. These are the
four I was talking about. The

00:39:01.372 --> 00:39:04.943
string constant in the binary we
found very helpful. The

00:39:04.943 --> 00:39:10.281
implementation trait, how
specific activity performed,

00:39:10.281 --> 00:39:14.886
memory, construct and
deconstructor implemented, et

00:39:14.886 --> 00:39:21.426
cetera. The third column is
feature in malware. Malware

00:39:21.426 --> 00:39:30.335
constantly does the same things.
If you are someone writing

00:39:30.335 --> 00:39:36.908
malware, you generate do not
implement these several times

00:39:36.908 --> 00:39:40.645
over. Just erase it. Because
these are usually expensive.

00:39:40.645 --> 00:39:45.483
It's hard to find people who are
able to implement these traits.

00:39:45.483 --> 00:39:50.188
First column is infrastructure
to raise the bar even higher.

00:39:50.188 --> 00:39:57.295
And infrastructure as cnc server
and location are helpful in [

00:39:57.295 --> 00:40:01.099
inaudible ] binaries. Here's our
proof of concept and I'm sure

00:40:01.099 --> 00:40:07.205
you can read more later. Proof
of concept on malware when we

00:40:07.205 --> 00:40:13.111
try attribute linking, the
yellow lines indicate that

00:40:13.111 --> 00:40:17.148
attributes overlap. The
overlapping in the eye of the

00:40:17.148 --> 00:40:25.590
analyst. I want to grab the
attributing describing the

00:40:25.590 --> 00:40:36.968
dynamic api loading and all
these things. These look similar

00:40:36.968 --> 00:40:43.174
and yes it does. What does this
tell me? The binary on barbar

00:40:43.174 --> 00:40:50.181
helped us linked the other
different family to that. [ on

00:40:50.181 --> 00:40:59.123
screen ] linked with each other.
Actually by doing so we were

00:40:59.123 --> 00:41:02.327
able to create much bigger
picture than we have that our

00:41:02.327 --> 00:41:07.699
operators would do espionage
that they would do that in Syria

00:41:07.699 --> 00:41:20.378
because that's where they found
the machine and iran and given

00:41:20.378 --> 00:41:27.485
this might be the French
government. They ran partners in

00:41:27.485 --> 00:41:34.192
2010. Now we didn't figure out
why French would need service

00:41:34.192 --> 00:41:40.264
button. There are several
problems not to get in details.

00:41:40.264 --> 00:41:45.970
But we were also to do
attribution by linking binary we

00:41:45.970 --> 00:41:49.107
still didn't know. We need to
reverse engineering a lot.

00:41:49.107 --> 00:41:57.081
There's very few automation and
machine learning is always in

00:41:57.081 --> 00:42:04.322
the eyes of the analyst. >> So
we are going to talk a little

00:42:04.322 --> 00:42:09.894
bit, I guess, attribution in our
industry have done in a number

00:42:09.894 --> 00:42:13.331
of ways. There's soft
attribution. Malware family is

00:42:13.331 --> 00:42:23.374
linked together because they
have attempt files. This malware

00:42:23.374 --> 00:42:29.580
family was written by dino. So a
good example on soft

00:42:29.580 --> 00:42:35.486
attribution. When we look at
complex of malware, lots of

00:42:35.486 --> 00:42:39.791
moving parts and looking at it
for a long period of time maybe

00:42:39.791 --> 00:42:44.695
a year. And it starts off
mailing list, someone posted,

00:42:44.695 --> 00:42:48.766
people talking about difficult
to reverse sample of Chinese

00:42:48.766 --> 00:42:53.404
binary and someone post this and
look at this stuff. Crickets

00:42:53.404 --> 00:43:01.379
chirping. And then someone said
wait that's from china. This is

00:43:01.379 --> 00:43:09.287
as you can see it's an
underscore sample this looks

00:43:09.287 --> 00:43:19.664
like a forensics sample from a
compromise machine. Forensics

00:43:19.664 --> 00:43:27.839
tool which bits the frost it
imprint. There's a process log,

00:43:27.839 --> 00:43:32.109
and this actually gives us the
name of the system analyze and

00:43:32.109 --> 00:43:45.456
where it was. What we get is the
name. Britain ghq hack Belgium

00:43:45.456 --> 00:43:53.231
teleconference. The timing is
right. And so on. So I mean you

00:43:53.231 --> 00:43:59.170
kind of know. But I call it soft
attribute. You don't have hard

00:43:59.170 --> 00:44:02.673
prove. You don't have someone
standing up and saying this is

00:44:02.673 --> 00:44:11.682
me. However we did end up
getting this. It turns out

00:44:11.682 --> 00:44:20.525
looking at this code closely
this code identical to blah.

00:44:20.525 --> 00:44:25.196
Blah. Plug in. A friend of mine
said it better even blamed him

00:44:25.196 --> 00:44:32.870
as the original. That's what I
call hard binary. The evidence

00:44:32.870 --> 00:44:45.650
you are producing in research in
these areas legal spies are

00:44:45.650 --> 00:44:54.959
obliged to lie. Dnr was caught
in a difficult position in front

00:44:54.959 --> 00:45:01.465
of the government and tv whether
NASA was spying on millions of

00:45:01.465 --> 00:45:16.414
Americans. Once it came out that
he lied, he said he said least

00:45:16.414 --> 00:45:31.395
deceitful things. This has gone
on. As any of you look at the

00:45:31.395 --> 00:45:42.173
hacking team there's stack and
stack of sketchy lies. And

00:45:42.173 --> 00:45:48.045
pointed to the sale of malware
to another government. After a

00:45:48.045 --> 00:45:53.651
while they were asked if it was
sold, and they said no. Not us.

00:45:53.651 --> 00:45:59.624
But they showed money wired
millions to Sudan. So you

00:45:59.624 --> 00:46:10.601
actually can't expect when you
produce report about government

00:46:10.601 --> 00:46:18.309
espionage you got us good on
you. That's not how it works.

00:46:18.309 --> 00:46:25.483
Hacking team is an interesting
case. They listed out, this is a

00:46:25.483 --> 00:46:29.086
slide from intel presentation
there about the people they were

00:46:29.086 --> 00:46:32.923
worried about. They were worried
about citizen lab, and variety

00:46:32.923 --> 00:46:42.199
of other things. If you are
worried about democracy activist

00:46:42.199 --> 00:46:50.007
worldwide you should probably
change your business model. Now

00:46:50.007 --> 00:46:52.276
the lies actually continued
actually to the point of the

00:46:52.276 --> 00:46:59.650
leak where this segment said
there's attack and not true the

00:46:59.650 --> 00:47:10.328
leak contain virus. Note contain
virus which you sell. Hacking

00:47:10.328 --> 00:47:18.102
team don't particularly like me
and they issue a statement about

00:47:18.102 --> 00:47:21.105
me that I've been on a wolf
cry...which I found it was quite

00:47:21.105 --> 00:47:33.417
hurtful actually. [ applause ]
But I'm sure it wasn't personal.

00:47:33.417 --> 00:47:42.660
They named me by name and
there's the photo and audio

00:47:42.660 --> 00:47:45.830
recordings of me. This just gets
weirder and weirder. And this is

00:47:45.830 --> 00:47:50.000
the most bazaar one. In great
opsec they have a link on this.

00:47:50.000 --> 00:48:00.845
FBI quietly formed security
unit. It turns out they actually

00:48:00.845 --> 00:48:08.352
say meeting with these people
with anything good came out of

00:48:08.352 --> 00:48:13.290
citizen lab article is it
brought us them contact. So the

00:48:13.290 --> 00:48:21.832
FBI read the report. This
malware is good. Maybe we should

00:48:21.832 --> 00:48:28.038
buy it. So hacking team I want
my 15% sales cut. That's weird.

00:48:28.038 --> 00:48:36.781
We are getting harass so we got
to skip to the fun bit. Choose

00:48:36.781 --> 00:48:43.654
your malware story. Something
new. We have difficulty naming

00:48:43.654 --> 00:48:56.133
this. >> Stick to industry
standard on naming stuff. We

00:48:56.133 --> 00:49:02.840
went through the numbering. >>
You are going to silence us and

00:49:02.840 --> 00:49:08.379
stopping releasing. >> If you
could do it in 7 seconds, I will

00:49:08.379 --> 00:49:13.017
not stop. >> This is really
funny. This is the tool that the

00:49:13.017 --> 00:49:23.594
government we are about the out.
This is pretty neat. >> I am not

00:49:23.594 --> 00:49:27.865
a tool of the government. >> We
are trying to speak the truth. [

00:49:27.865 --> 00:49:58.162
applause ] >> Sorry. Guys. >>
Don't blame me. Blame the man. [

00:49:58.162 --> 00:50:32.529
applause ] >> Want to give them
3 minutes? >> All right. Joking

00:50:32.529 --> 00:50:36.300
aside. It doesn't have anything
to do with the character. We

00:50:36.300 --> 00:50:44.341
found interesting sample. Being
active from 2002 to 2011. Choose

00:50:44.341 --> 00:50:49.013
your own adventure. So we have
an actor being one for almost

00:50:49.013 --> 00:50:54.818
ten years. >> Another malware
family being around this long.

00:50:54.818 --> 00:51:03.394
In 2009 years is a long time to
be actually writing this family

00:51:03.394 --> 00:51:12.803
of knowledge. >> So check the
security process whatever. >>

00:51:12.803 --> 00:51:22.613
Talk about the 16-bit stuff. >>
Cool stuff on the machine. I was

00:51:22.613 --> 00:51:32.122
prepare to run the windows 95.
And actually had a check built

00:51:32.122 --> 00:51:41.098
in. Research for ne value. I
don't know I'm young engineering

00:51:41.098 --> 00:51:46.537
that was before my time. It was
built for Microsoft 16-bit

00:51:46.537 --> 00:51:59.016
system. >> The next malware
related we found modern era

00:51:59.016 --> 00:52:04.421
2007, 2009 suggested that it was
used and it's pretty old. It

00:52:04.421 --> 00:52:11.729
might be a good time to know
that government are awesome at

00:52:11.729 --> 00:52:16.600
updating their system and try to
get prepared for linux p for

00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:29.413
example. >> To be running it was
a window 4. The program manager

00:52:29.413 --> 00:52:32.616
which was introduced to be
window vista. So we were doing

00:52:32.616 --> 00:52:45.963
archaeology, grave digging site.
So we knew these belonged

00:52:45.963 --> 00:53:01.345
together. >> Lots of cnc
service. Pulling. Very stealthy

00:53:01.345 --> 00:53:14.858
communication infiltration. >>
Faster. Here's another sample.

00:53:14.858 --> 00:53:24.835
It doesn't try to enumerate
others. So the author knew where

00:53:24.835 --> 00:53:29.406
it was. Summing up. Learn very
well how to work through the

00:53:29.406 --> 00:53:33.544
work. The de-assembling work ten
pulse drop on the machine and

00:53:33.544 --> 00:53:50.461
these will start with a d.
Remember our introduction. >> So

00:53:50.461 --> 00:53:55.732
people at Defcon love to see
Blackhat. When we did this then,

00:53:55.732 --> 00:54:01.071
we ran out of time. So we did
that and it did what it did

00:54:01.071 --> 00:54:16.954
which is attribute it to china.
[ applause ] So who actually

00:54:16.954 --> 00:54:21.758
thinks this is actually -- (no
audio) -- before we go off

00:54:21.758 --> 00:54:25.229
stage. The first person who gets
it right I will buy them a

00:54:25.229 --> 00:54:31.668
drink. I can't comment on that.
All right. We are out of here.

00:54:31.668 --> 00:00:00.000
>> Thank you. [ applause ].
