00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.106
Welcome. I'm going to get up
here and talk a little about

00:00:06.106 --> 00:00:10.811
some research I've been doing
about LTE emissions, not so much

00:00:10.811 --> 00:00:14.848
looking at protocol or data but
just what can we see flying

00:00:14.848 --> 00:00:22.556
around in the air and I'm going
to do it with RTLSDRs. A couple

00:00:22.556 --> 00:00:29.129
of people who have made this
talk happen. A few years ago

00:00:29.129 --> 00:00:31.899
Melissa Elliot did a talk and
when I saw that talk, that

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:33.901
inspired me to take up that
research. This guy has done --

00:00:33.901 --> 00:00:36.169
>> I'm going to give you a quick
primer time of arrival,

00:00:36.169 --> 00:00:42.175
direction finding and then I'm
going to talk about why the

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:33.427
RTLSDR is a terrible radio. And
then go over some of the

00:01:33.427 --> 00:01:39.433
processes I'm using to do
direction finding with RTLs. So

00:01:44.705 --> 00:01:47.407
here we are. We have a boat in
the water that's really hard to

00:01:47.407 --> 00:01:53.380
see. You're 1940, battle of the
Atlantic, World War II, how do

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.552
we find the U-boats? They have
these antenna masts on the top

00:01:58.552 --> 00:02:04.391
that occasionally when they pop
out of the water emit signals.

00:02:04.391 --> 00:02:08.028
Those signals are encoded
messages, encrypted messages,

00:02:08.028 --> 00:02:12.099
but they are still RF emissions.
Anyone can pick them up. You

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:15.235
don't have to be able to decrypt
them to be able to put up your

00:02:15.235 --> 00:02:20.140
antenna and receive that data.
So then we get a whole lot of

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.343
these guys. They put cans on
their heads and turn a whole

00:02:23.343 --> 00:02:27.247
bunch of knobs and try to figure
out what the position of that

00:02:27.247 --> 00:02:31.551
signal is through a few
different kinds of techniques

00:02:31.551 --> 00:02:36.857
using very expensive, very large
equipment. The wavelengths on

00:02:36.857 --> 00:02:40.494
these transmissions were huge,
so to do direction finding you

00:02:40.494 --> 00:02:46.266
need national infrastructure or
at least real estate to park

00:02:46.266 --> 00:02:51.438
lots and lots of antennas. This
guy is on the Wikipedia page for

00:02:51.438 --> 00:02:55.342
fox hunting, which has become
the modern approach to direction

00:02:55.342 --> 00:02:58.712
funding. It's a really fun thing
where somebody goes and puts a

00:02:58.712 --> 00:03:03.216
radio out in a state park and
you get your antenna and your

00:03:03.216 --> 00:03:08.055
headphones and you go and try
and find it. I guess you need a

00:03:08.055 --> 00:03:15.429
trendy head band. So it's going
to get a little technical. This

00:03:15.429 --> 00:03:20.100
is how direction finding
happens. The principle here,

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:26.106
like the main piece of math, two
antennas are going to receive

00:03:29.843 --> 00:03:33.780
the same signal and we're going
to compare the time difference

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:41.088
to get a line of bearing to the
transmitter. So basically what

00:03:41.088 --> 00:03:43.890
happens is the transmitter fires
off a signal. This is something

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.259
you have to have a bursty or
discreet signal. Receiver B has

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:48.662
a later time stamp. We have an
identical signal traveling at or

00:03:48.662 --> 00:03:50.864
the same signal traveling at the
same speed through a constant

00:03:50.864 --> 00:03:52.866
atmosphere. So a lot of
assumptions here. To arrive at

00:03:52.866 --> 00:03:54.868
two known positions. Based on
the distance between the

00:03:54.868 --> 00:03:57.437
receiver and the distance and
the time of arrival or the

00:03:57.437 --> 00:04:02.776
difference and the time of
arrival, you can create a

00:04:02.776 --> 00:04:08.782
hyperbola. We don't care about
modeling the hyperbola. I just

00:04:19.726 --> 00:04:25.732
want to know what the assets
are. So if you dig back into

00:04:42.415 --> 00:04:48.522
your high school trig, if you
take the cosine of the angle of

00:04:48.522 --> 00:04:52.526
the attack or line of bearing,
it's going to be the time of

00:04:52.526 --> 00:04:56.997
arrival divided by the distance
between the two points. So using

00:04:56.997 --> 00:05:02.135
that we can draw two possible
lines that this transmitter can

00:05:02.135 --> 00:05:05.872
be from. If you only have two
receivers, you're always going

00:05:05.872 --> 00:05:10.110
to have two different places to
guess and go look for it. So how

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:17.250
do we solve that problem and get
to position? This is classic try

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.252
angulation. When people say I'm
going to triangulate your

00:05:19.252 --> 00:05:25.258
signal. We have three receivers,
we're going to take those same

00:05:34.301 --> 00:05:37.537
cosines of the angles to get six
lines. Three of the lines are

00:05:37.537 --> 00:05:40.774
going to diverge off into space,
hopefully three of the lines are

00:05:40.774 --> 00:05:46.780
going to converge. If you've got
clock drift in your radios,

00:05:49.416 --> 00:05:54.721
terrible RSTRs, sometimes all
six lines diverge and you just

00:05:54.721 --> 00:06:01.795
have to wait for everything to
sync up. So we talked about the

00:06:01.795 --> 00:06:04.164
history of direction finding.
I'm giving you a little bit on

00:06:04.164 --> 00:06:08.335
the math that's behind time of
arrival. How many of you guys

00:06:08.335 --> 00:06:15.275
have heard of an RTLSDR?
Awesome. Okay. They're cheap.

00:06:15.275 --> 00:06:17.277
That's something that I really
like about playing with them.

00:06:17.277 --> 00:06:19.279
Especially if I need three of
them, I'm not going to go out

00:06:19.279 --> 00:06:23.917
and get 3 RLFs. It's a lot of
budget for an entry level

00:06:23.917 --> 00:06:30.890
exercise. But the RTLSDRs it's
like all right they're like $16

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:36.963
on the Internet. How bad can
they be? I'm using the E 4000s

00:06:36.963 --> 00:06:40.634
because I was interested in
tracking LTE signals and I had

00:06:40.634 --> 00:06:44.304
to get up into the higher band.
If you buy a brand new LTSDR,

00:06:44.304 --> 00:06:51.044
it's a new chip that doesn't
tune all the way up to LTE 1900

00:06:51.044 --> 00:06:55.715
which is what we have here in
Las Vegas. So this product with

00:06:55.715 --> 00:06:59.419
newer radios, you've got to find
the newer band. This is the E

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:05.358
4000 on the right. On the left
is the stock terrible antenna

00:07:07.694 --> 00:07:13.700
that comes with the E 4000. But
that stock terrible antenna and

00:07:16.269 --> 00:07:21.875
the E4000 are able to pick up
clean ADSB signals that are

00:07:21.875 --> 00:07:24.878
coming off the airplanes, flight
identifiers, that kind of

00:07:24.878 --> 00:07:30.884
information. If you go on Reddit
and say I want to pick up ADSB,

00:07:34.788 --> 00:07:39.092
everyone is going to tell you
you've got to get a better

00:07:39.092 --> 00:07:43.396
antenna and run wires up to your
house and throw away the antenna

00:07:43.396 --> 00:07:48.368
that comes with your chip. Don't
do any of that. Just use the

00:07:48.368 --> 00:07:51.571
stock antenna when you're
getting started playing, it

00:07:51.571 --> 00:07:54.708
lowers that initial investment
and it works. I mean, this was

00:07:54.708 --> 00:08:02.082
live data from actually from
here this morning. Yeah. It's

00:08:02.082 --> 00:08:08.054
not garbage. It's terrible, but
it's not garbage. (Laughter.)

00:08:08.054 --> 00:08:14.728
You want to get started, it will
work. So this is my disclaimer.

00:08:14.728 --> 00:08:19.132
I am not a radio guy by trade.
I've definitely done a lot of

00:08:19.132 --> 00:08:21.901
analysis of precollected
signals, but digital signal

00:08:21.901 --> 00:08:27.407
processing is not my formal
education. So I'm about to do a

00:08:27.407 --> 00:08:32.712
lot of terrible things. Let's do
direction finding with the

00:08:32.712 --> 00:08:40.620
RTLSDR. So we said before we
that need to have three antennas

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:44.524
to do position direction
findings. So I'm going to buy

00:08:44.524 --> 00:08:47.827
three of these $16 things and
hook them up to my PC and it's

00:08:47.827 --> 00:08:54.367
going to work, right? There's my
RTLSDR. I'm going to replace

00:08:54.367 --> 00:08:57.170
each of the transmitters, each
of the receivers with RTLs and

00:08:57.170 --> 00:09:04.511
it's just going to work. It's
not going to work. One of the

00:09:04.511 --> 00:09:10.083
major problems with these is the
oscillator is extremely

00:09:10.083 --> 00:09:14.187
sensitive to temperature. If you
have like a fan blowing near

00:09:14.187 --> 00:09:17.357
your computer and you have two
RTLs sitting next to each other

00:09:17.357 --> 00:09:19.859
and one is getting the fan more
directly than the other, your

00:09:19.859 --> 00:09:24.064
center of frequency is going to
drift frequently which breaks

00:09:24.064 --> 00:09:29.502
time of arrival. There's also
issues with the clock. Because

00:09:29.502 --> 00:09:32.305
they're coming in over USB, if
you try to synch two of these

00:09:32.305 --> 00:09:36.276
devices on the system with the
CPU, there's bus lag from the

00:09:36.276 --> 00:09:42.115
USB, the temperature sensitive
oscillator is going to break

00:09:42.115 --> 00:09:44.684
down all your calculations. You
are going to attempt to geo

00:09:44.684 --> 00:09:48.154
locate something and it's going
to tell you it's 25 --> 000 miles

00:09:48.154 --> 00:09:53.460
away and doesn't make any sense.
So what do we do about clock

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:59.466
synchronization. It turns out
the reference has a pin that you

00:10:09.008 --> 00:10:12.712
can use for clock in. So all
you've got to do is crack open

00:10:12.712 --> 00:10:16.282
your $16 radio and solder on the
clock out from one of them on to

00:10:16.282 --> 00:10:18.685
the other two and now you're
using the same system clock for

00:10:18.685 --> 00:10:24.691
all three devices. You're not
trying to sync on the CPU and

00:10:27.127 --> 00:10:29.195
you can do a little bit of
direction finding if you get a

00:10:29.195 --> 00:10:36.903
good signal. And there's a rig
with three RTLs sharing a single

00:10:36.903 --> 00:10:44.444
clock. So like I said before, it
doesn't make the RTL a great

00:10:44.444 --> 00:10:49.048
radio. It's still bad. But with
a little bit of clock sync and

00:10:49.048 --> 00:10:53.253
math and good signals, you can
go and direction find devices

00:10:53.253 --> 00:10:59.259
using a couple of RTLs. Three
RTLs. Bursty digital columns.

00:11:05.198 --> 00:11:08.768
This is where it works. This is
where we get into why I chose

00:11:08.768 --> 00:11:15.008
LTE. When I was surveying the
space around where I live, there

00:11:15.008 --> 00:11:18.444
were a lot of LTE up links I
thought it would be really cool

00:11:18.444 --> 00:11:25.151
to track all of the cell phones
and some of them are cars and

00:11:25.151 --> 00:11:30.490
other devices but I'm assuming
if it's LTE and uplink, it's

00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:35.929
probably a phone. GSM is also
good, it's pretty wide. It's not

00:11:35.929 --> 00:11:43.169
as loud. It's closer to the
noise floor and the RTLs really

00:11:43.169 --> 00:11:45.939
struggle with that because
everything looks like noise on

00:11:45.939 --> 00:11:50.143
one with the stock antenna. CB
radio is pretty good too just

00:11:50.143 --> 00:11:54.480
because it's super loud. A very
clear signal when you're trying

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:56.983
to play with this.
Walkie-talkies are the same way.

00:11:56.983 --> 00:12:00.453
A lot of construction guys
around us that I've been able to

00:12:00.453 --> 00:12:04.857
put very precise dots on where
they're sitting in their yellow

00:12:04.857 --> 00:12:10.430
iron. One of the other things
that's kind of exciting, this is

00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:13.466
a signal that I collected in the
U.S., and you'll see that it's

00:12:13.466 --> 00:12:17.537
in the 900 uplink, or maybe you
can see. There's some numbers

00:12:17.537 --> 00:12:23.610
right there. That's not a
licensed band for GSM in the

00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:27.747
U.S. That's a European channel.
So this was a signal I was

00:12:27.747 --> 00:12:30.016
interested in geolocating
because obviously somebody is

00:12:30.016 --> 00:12:35.788
using a system that is either
completely undocumented or they

00:12:35.788 --> 00:12:41.294
shouldn't be. And because the
width of the signal is fairly

00:12:41.294 --> 00:12:45.965
wide, unlike kind of the
walkie-talkie CB stuff that gets

00:12:45.965 --> 00:12:49.435
narrow, if the clocks drift on
the RTLs and my center

00:12:49.435 --> 00:12:53.339
frequencies get off, my time of
arrival is still the same. And

00:12:53.339 --> 00:12:57.076
I'm going to show you if I had
one RTL where the true center of

00:12:57.076 --> 00:13:00.246
frequency is slightly to the
left of where I'm trying to tune

00:13:00.246 --> 00:13:02.915
it and another slightly to the
right, I'm still going to get

00:13:02.915 --> 00:13:09.289
the same time of arrival. So
that's why LTE is easy to track

00:13:09.289 --> 00:13:15.295
with three RTLs. And that's my
research so far. I'm going to be

00:13:18.531 --> 00:13:21.067
hanging out at the wireless
village tomorrow if anybody

00:13:21.067 --> 00:13:26.172
wants to see this thing fly. My
Kibana box does not plug into a

00:13:26.172 --> 00:13:32.812
VGA so I'm not going to show it
live in here. Thanks for coming

00:13:32.812 --> 00:13:38.484
out. (Applause.)
