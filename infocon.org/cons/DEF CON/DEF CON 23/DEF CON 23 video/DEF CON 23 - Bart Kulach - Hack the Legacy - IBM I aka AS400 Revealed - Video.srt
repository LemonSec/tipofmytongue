00:00:00.834 --> 00:00:06.840
>> Welcome folks. may name is
bart, I will be talking about

00:00:10.177 --> 00:00:17.751
the legacy or the AS400. IBM
system whatever you call it the

00:00:17.751 --> 00:00:24.157
guys at IBM get nice bonuses for
changing the names every few

00:00:24.157 --> 00:00:31.331
years. I will call it AS4
hundred. Short introduction, I'm

00:00:31.331 --> 00:00:39.273
google able so you can check my
twitter and Polish national

00:00:39.273 --> 00:00:47.180
living in the Netherlands and
what I present here is my

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:53.186
personal views and not always or
necessarily -- so why should we

00:00:55.822 --> 00:01:03.697
care about legacy or AS4
hundred? It is legacy which is

00:01:03.697 --> 00:01:09.703
hard to get rid of if you work
in a in institution you will see

00:01:14.474 --> 00:01:20.480
a lot of customer data, a lot of
old programs and it is very

00:01:24.551 --> 00:01:30.023
difficult with all the history
and for example if you have

00:01:30.023 --> 00:01:33.260
insurance policies or bank
accounts very difficult to

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:38.498
migrate to new environments so
what you see often is that you

00:01:38.498 --> 00:01:45.973
have knew shiny front end a back
end you have still mainframe

00:01:45.973 --> 00:01:53.347
systems running because just
good for what they do. So many

00:01:53.347 --> 00:01:59.353
times we do care about the front
end but not the back end and

00:02:02.656 --> 00:02:08.996
that leads to situation that
back ends are somewhat less

00:02:08.996 --> 00:02:16.470
secure than the front end. Still
to my surprise the systems are

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:23.110
accessible while even by
internet SM2P servers or if you

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:29.116
go tore tailer you can see a 50
to 50 screen and you can find

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:40.460
them every where. I mean all
banks, insurance if you google

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:46.466
that you will find a lot of as
400 systems and there was a

00:02:48.835 --> 00:02:54.975
great talk back in 2006 by --
talking about security system

00:02:54.975 --> 00:03:02.015
but not touch has change from
the IBM perspective. They are

00:03:02.015 --> 00:03:08.021
still say -- they are still like
this 90s mentality we have a

00:03:11.058 --> 00:03:17.064
green screen and it is secure
enough. There is not too much

00:03:19.366 --> 00:03:25.372
new things from IBM. There is
some patching but I will say not

00:03:28.408 --> 00:03:34.414
too much from my perspective. So
if you want to start your --

00:03:37.417 --> 00:03:43.423
well, some joy with as 400 you
can buy one. I recently bought

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:52.466
one for just 60 bucks on E-bay.
I could not find a cheap one now

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:02.809
but every now and then you can
find a cheap AS4 hundred system

00:04:05.812 --> 00:04:11.818
so start or you can just hack
one. If you go to Sheldon I you

00:04:16.223 --> 00:04:22.229
will find a lot of systems open.
Just example from last week, I

00:04:25.265 --> 00:04:32.906
would say about get access to
Italian coffee maker which was

00:04:32.906 --> 00:04:40.514
just fully exposed to the
internet for default spas so you

00:04:40.514 --> 00:04:46.520
could log in and enjoy the
system. They just put it on the

00:04:49.556 --> 00:04:55.562
web and forget it. So going to
security of these systems, there

00:04:57.898 --> 00:05:03.837
was a talk from (indiscernible)
about the 50 to 50 security, I

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:12.145
want to talk about something
else. I want to focus on Java.

00:05:14.481 --> 00:05:21.421
Why because, it comes together
with AS4 hundred access and

00:05:21.421 --> 00:05:27.427
gives you pretty much a lot of
access to the system and if you

00:05:31.131 --> 00:05:37.137
look at the IBM toking box for
Java allows for remote system

00:05:39.472 --> 00:05:45.478
IMI calls or use of comments so
you can compile your programs in

00:05:49.216 --> 00:05:53.453
Java externally you don't have
to write your programs in CO or

00:05:53.453 --> 00:05:57.924
RPG so you can. It bypasses
50/50 limitations so gets access

00:05:57.924 --> 00:06:04.664
to the common lines and by a
passes the navigation

00:06:04.664 --> 00:06:10.670
restriction so if you have set
up navigator so the user cannot

00:06:12.873 --> 00:06:20.347
download files or access LDBS
you can bypass with your own

00:06:20.347 --> 00:06:27.187
Java functions. And gives you
flexible of working with AS4

00:06:27.187 --> 00:06:34.661
hundred outside of system so no
need to access development tools

00:06:34.661 --> 00:06:40.667
on the box itself. If you
decompile the JT400 given by IBM

00:06:42.836 --> 00:06:50.477
it is generally poorly written
it is inconsistent. So sometimes

00:06:50.477 --> 00:06:56.483
they just use CLCL in the
background. So I found that I

00:07:10.964 --> 00:07:16.970
had to write my own functions.
So I encourage you to decompile.

00:07:31.418 --> 00:07:37.424
I will give you a short demo
about the visibility. So first

00:07:51.905 --> 00:07:57.911
we are going to connect to the
system so that user does not

00:08:13.993 --> 00:08:19.999
have access to the comments. I
have four profiles on the

00:08:32.779 --> 00:08:38.885
system. That one has signed off
is you cannot log in.

00:08:38.885 --> 00:08:42.856
Administrator I have talked to
say if you sign off you cannot

00:08:42.856 --> 00:08:48.862
connect directly into the
system. Bullshit. So this one

00:08:59.639 --> 00:09:06.146
gives you already more rights.
We have access to comment lines

00:09:06.146 --> 00:09:09.682
that is all the profiles that I
can see with that system, with

00:09:09.682 --> 00:09:15.688
that user profile. I will also
go to -- so these are library

00:09:27.033 --> 00:09:33.039
that we can see. It mostly the
system libraries. So let's

00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:49.956
switch to Java tool. This takes
a while. So when we go to work

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:19.486
with objects and we want the see
all objects uses and the user

00:10:30.396 --> 00:10:36.402
profiles. You can see more
profiles 50/50 so Java handles

00:10:43.409 --> 00:10:49.415
the authorization in a different
way but you are not authorized

00:10:57.724 --> 00:11:03.663
(indiscernible) you can
enumerate for the use. You will

00:11:07.734 --> 00:11:11.971
see there are some additional
libraries which were not vise

00:11:11.971 --> 00:11:17.977
able. So as you can see the
difference in authorization

00:11:17.977 --> 00:11:23.983
handling between Jay and 50 to
50. If connect with -- (lost

00:11:44.504 --> 00:11:50.510
audio) -- so don't believe your
administrator if they say sign

00:12:08.728 --> 00:12:15.635
off you cannot use the
(indiscernible). That is only

00:12:15.635 --> 00:12:21.641
visible but we want to do
something more. We want to

00:12:30.183 --> 00:12:36.189
escalate the privileges and say
in the old times you have to

00:12:38.858 --> 00:12:44.864
have a program -- or you have to
use the AMI and still compile on

00:12:51.371 --> 00:12:57.377
the system to be able to
(indiscernible) the thing is

00:12:59.746 --> 00:13:05.084
that, if you use group profiles
which is difficult for every

00:13:05.084 --> 00:13:11.891
larger application, we have like
one common profile which is used

00:13:11.891 --> 00:13:17.897
for all the business accounts so
to say and many times you add

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:27.840
privileges by adding group
profiles. I have seen these in

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:32.645
both business applications and
banking and insurance

00:13:32.645 --> 00:13:40.153
applications and many times you
see the ownership for the user

00:13:40.153 --> 00:13:46.159
is set to group profile. For one
reason, you don't want to have a

00:13:49.729 --> 00:13:55.735
situation if one user leaves and
the account is deleted that is

00:13:57.970 --> 00:14:03.910
lot of problems so sometimes you
see a default is set up and the

00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:15.188
ownership is set up in the group
profile. So if you use that set

00:14:15.188 --> 00:14:21.994
up and you have a lot of users,
it is likely that you will have

00:14:21.994 --> 00:14:27.533
some administrator users and you
will have some users that switch

00:14:27.533 --> 00:14:33.106
between departments and they
might have some extra rights

00:14:33.106 --> 00:14:39.112
that you would not expect and it
is also likely that you not

00:14:41.748 --> 00:14:49.422
(indiscernible) it is quite
challenging to monitor and again

00:14:49.422 --> 00:14:56.129
using Java there is no need to
write and compile problems with

00:14:56.129 --> 00:15:02.435
the AS4 hundred so can use the
profile handle IMIs, grab the

00:15:02.435 --> 00:15:08.441
profile handle and repeat. We
have one common group which the

00:15:33.599 --> 00:15:39.605
Def con23 and one group for hot
chicks and we have bots which

00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:47.480
are the administrator on the
system. So what we're going to

00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:50.750
do -- we also have hot chicks
S69 which is not administrator.

00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:56.756
(indiscernible) so let's try
escalate the privileges and I

00:16:13.706 --> 00:16:19.712
like one click solutions so I
made some extra implementation.

00:16:36.596 --> 00:16:42.602
So let me log in chick perhaps
to show the -- just to show you

00:17:05.992 --> 00:17:11.998
there is no fake authorities
here. That is hot chick -- no

00:17:18.137 --> 00:17:24.143
special authorities and hot
chick profiles cannot create any

00:17:26.412 --> 00:17:32.418
other profiles so the just add
in with any of the hot chicks

00:17:41.827 --> 00:17:47.833
three, user profile. I will get
the error message. So let's log

00:17:53.839 --> 00:17:59.845
in with the same chick L3. We
can connect again. Let's

00:18:17.763 --> 00:18:23.769
generate the list that we can
see. Let me switch to hot chick

00:18:44.557 --> 00:18:50.563
69. So I just click and hot
chick 69 and as you can see I

00:18:56.936 --> 00:19:02.875
escalated privileges so if I go
now the system um -- let me

00:19:46.352 --> 00:19:52.358
escalate from hot chicks 69 or
let me generate the user list so

00:20:00.666 --> 00:20:06.672
I have access to much longer
list of users. So let's click

00:20:15.214 --> 00:20:21.220
once again and we escalated user
offer. Can you see the whole

00:20:26.959 --> 00:20:32.965
screen now? Now? So I just run a
comment and now using the offer

00:21:56.949 --> 00:22:02.888
I created the user profile. You
can see there is one button on

00:22:04.890 --> 00:22:10.896
the right side. So if I get back
to system you can see the new

00:22:16.001 --> 00:22:21.407
created system user profile. So
that is something knew with

00:22:21.407 --> 00:22:27.413
Java. You don't have extra
problem. All right. What is also

00:22:30.783 --> 00:22:36.789
interesting I don't have a demo
for that but you can try on your

00:22:44.763 --> 00:22:50.536
systems by the way, this already
available online at the end of

00:22:50.536 --> 00:22:56.542
the presentation will be a link
and you can find a link to where

00:22:58.911 --> 00:23:04.850
the tool link is and up load it.
I will make some updates in the

00:23:07.853 --> 00:23:15.060
coming weeks but you can contact
me if you have questions. For

00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:21.667
part two (indiscernible) using
Java gives you a lot of possible

00:23:21.667 --> 00:23:29.441
options. You can run CL comments
or queries you can run system C

00:23:29.441 --> 00:23:37.249
MI and you can combine all of
those. So many times what you

00:23:37.249 --> 00:23:42.988
see is you use commercial
programs to block access to RBC

00:23:42.988 --> 00:23:48.994
using exit points or you use
your own exit points. Usually,

00:23:53.132 --> 00:23:59.138
there is a lot of focus for
external connections. But if you

00:24:01.774 --> 00:24:07.780
connect by Java and if you try
say run a query from a system it

00:24:12.685 --> 00:24:18.691
will not defect there is any
outcoming -- because it will be

00:24:21.427 --> 00:24:28.667
rerouted internally from the
system and then outside. So in

00:24:28.667 --> 00:24:35.941
that way you can circumvent the
RBC limitation connections. I

00:24:35.941 --> 00:24:41.947
put here a small example that is
query by Java so what you do is

00:24:46.852 --> 00:24:53.392
round the well-known comment
(indiscernible) in that you go

00:24:53.392 --> 00:24:59.398
to (indiscernible) so you insert
Q comment and inside that you do

00:25:02.034 --> 00:25:08.040
DB2 and then select and then you
put R to get some out your

00:25:12.211 --> 00:25:20.219
principle device and the will
connect to local host. So will

00:25:20.219 --> 00:25:27.459
check is there external
connection from host to DB2. No,

00:25:27.459 --> 00:25:33.465
there is not only one log on
host. So go. So that way you can

00:25:38.370 --> 00:25:45.644
(indiscernible) you circumvent
the some of the exit points if

00:25:45.644 --> 00:25:52.184
they are poorly written. And to
be honest, I checked a number of

00:25:52.184 --> 00:25:59.958
exit points and or sorry exit
program software and like

00:25:59.958 --> 00:26:05.898
(indiscernible) for example, if
that is not for you and this

00:26:09.968 --> 00:26:15.974
program many times have some
unknown vulnerabilities like the

00:26:18.210 --> 00:26:25.517
error case for example. So I
would say use the tools to try

00:26:25.517 --> 00:26:28.687
to necessary -- and dependent on
what is protection you used for

00:26:28.687 --> 00:26:34.693
exit points you may be able to
test whether you can circumvent

00:26:42.134 --> 00:26:47.806
the exit points. Then the next
-- and I think interesting part

00:26:47.806 --> 00:26:53.812
the security and hash grabbing
and that is something I did not

00:26:56.548 --> 00:27:02.488
know before. There is 1IPI
offered by IBM called Q

00:27:04.790 --> 00:27:12.297
(indiscernible) to grab the
hashes. It is used for

00:27:12.297 --> 00:27:18.804
synchronizing hashes or spas
between systems and basically

00:27:18.804 --> 00:27:25.177
using the API but also using
from version six and common to

00:27:25.177 --> 00:27:31.183
dump user profile, you can get
hashes from a particular user.

00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:40.726
The output format that was me
published and I talked to IBM

00:27:43.028 --> 00:27:49.935
and that say said IBM
(indiscernible) nor do we plan

00:27:49.935 --> 00:27:56.174
to document output format.
Obviously. So after a long

00:27:56.174 --> 00:28:02.314
exchange of e-mails from
Rochester and there was no

00:28:02.314 --> 00:28:09.421
denial from their side to
publish it, so no word on the

00:28:09.421 --> 00:28:15.427
whether they will fix it or
change anything. And if you go

00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:24.736
to API, depending on your spas
level system value may be able

00:28:24.736 --> 00:28:30.742
to retrieve different hash words
from the system. If you look at

00:28:33.679 --> 00:28:37.849
security guide from IBM some how
they still don't enforce

00:28:37.849 --> 00:28:44.723
password level (indiscernible)
so password left zero, one, two

00:28:44.723 --> 00:28:50.729
you will still be able the get
the dash or hashes or LM hashes.

00:28:55.367 --> 00:29:01.306
So take the lesson and escalate
the privileges first but then

00:29:03.675 --> 00:29:11.283
after words you can grab the
hashes using the (indiscernible)

00:29:11.283 --> 00:29:15.287
basically, if you look at the
IBM documentation they only

00:29:15.287 --> 00:29:21.293
state what you get is output is
encrypted user password data.

00:29:25.697 --> 00:29:31.703
That is it. I looked closer into
that format and what you can see

00:29:40.979 --> 00:29:46.985
is the first (indiscernible) 56
bits password substitute. So you

00:29:51.890 --> 00:29:57.896
can look at RBC 2877 to see how
it is created. Then the third

00:30:07.139 --> 00:30:13.145
position is LM hash which is
interesting for us. And then

00:30:19.151 --> 00:30:25.157
there is bunch of other hashes.
So grab some hashes and we will

00:30:33.331 --> 00:30:39.337
try to do it now. Let me just
for the sake of time saving --

00:30:44.076 --> 00:30:50.082
so let's generate the user list
and say let's pick one profile.

00:31:02.461 --> 00:31:08.467
Up with quick solution grab the
hash. See all the hashes I was

00:31:45.404 --> 00:31:51.410
talking about. I cannot move the
screen. So what I can do is just

00:32:14.299 --> 00:32:20.305
move that to LM hash. Just save
it and I run my favorite 400. So

00:32:36.888 --> 00:32:42.894
that is where the password is
2015 and we are locked. I just

00:33:02.814 --> 00:33:08.820
finished a demo. It 5:00
somewhere. So again we talked to

00:33:24.803 --> 00:33:30.809
IBM on that and IBM was not
reactive so I if there is any

00:33:46.424 --> 00:33:50.362
IBM representatives here perhaps
you want to talk after the talk.

00:33:50.362 --> 00:33:56.368
Okay. So I also have some other
research. Focusing on the

00:34:02.407 --> 00:34:08.413
isolation. >> Now, stop talking.
I'm kidding. Go back. You guys

00:34:17.589 --> 00:34:22.294
know the drill what are we going
to do. This is called shop a

00:34:22.294 --> 00:34:28.300
new. It is tough to be a speak
at Def Con listen anyway we want

00:34:38.276 --> 00:34:42.547
to thank you for making it and
as a speaker and we have our

00:34:42.547 --> 00:34:48.553
little tradition. So to Def Con.
(CLAPPING) when I came in here

00:35:06.638 --> 00:35:11.042
he did not have a accent. >> My
accent it getting better with

00:35:11.042 --> 00:35:17.048
every shot. So I still have some
research going on and look caps

00:35:19.618 --> 00:35:27.559
standing at -- there is some
changes inversion seven

00:35:27.559 --> 00:35:34.265
basically IBM decided to put the
GVM elsewhere. Still I run some

00:35:34.265 --> 00:35:39.904
test with the same tools on
version release and I can see

00:35:39.904 --> 00:35:45.310
the same box. So there is not
too much lesson learned on the

00:35:45.310 --> 00:35:50.715
Java isolation so I still want
to look at inside and at the

00:35:50.715 --> 00:35:55.353
moment I am analyzing the server
site of DVM to look whether

00:35:55.353 --> 00:35:58.857
there is still possibility to
get more access to the system.

00:35:58.857 --> 00:36:04.796
What I also created is a common
shelf for AS4 00 so if you

00:36:08.833 --> 00:36:14.839
happen to have un-security web
sphere you can up load that file

00:36:18.176 --> 00:36:24.182
and you will get comment line
allowing you for running some

00:36:26.718 --> 00:36:32.724
comments on AS4 00 and creating
and account and I am doing some

00:36:36.828 --> 00:36:44.602
work in MI security and so
isolation between the more

00:36:44.602 --> 00:36:50.608
virtual part of the system and
the hardware layer. The last

00:36:53.178 --> 00:37:00.885
three versus 50 to 50LTP and
sometimes I am testing

00:37:00.885 --> 00:37:08.660
environments that behind a
firewall. So you only get access

00:37:08.660 --> 00:37:14.666
to FTP which let's you run
comments and other stuff so what

00:37:18.002 --> 00:37:24.008
I was thinking it would be handy
to make 50/50 proxy. So that is

00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:34.886
something I am working on and in
a few months you will see some

00:37:39.757 --> 00:37:47.565
tool links on the website. Just
short summary. Fifty/50 security

00:37:47.565 --> 00:37:53.571
measures don't trust them. There
is a lot of information on the

00:37:56.875 --> 00:38:02.814
hardening of say green screen.
You can also look at the book of

00:38:06.918 --> 00:38:13.925
Shaun (indiscernible) but don't
trust these measures only. Also

00:38:13.925 --> 00:38:21.032
look and Java and be sceptical
for IBM reps they promote

00:38:21.032 --> 00:38:26.638
(indiscernible) so take it with
common sense and have this

00:38:26.638 --> 00:38:32.644
presentation look at whether you
need to improve your security

00:38:35.346 --> 00:38:41.352
measures. And visit hack legacy.
I up loaded the tool. You are

00:38:45.790 --> 00:38:51.796
free the change it. The whole
project is encode there had and

00:38:56.234 --> 00:39:02.173
I included it already compiled
(indiscernible) so you can click

00:39:04.842 --> 00:39:10.848
and open and enjoy. You can find
me on twitter and you can also

00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:21.726
approach me by the hack legacy
website. And now it is time for

00:39:36.174 --> 00:39:42.180
questions. Can you repeat the
question? The public authority

00:40:00.531 --> 00:40:06.537
is excluded? I think that is
group profile if you use the

00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:15.146
ownership, if you use one common
profile and if you use -- I will

00:40:20.118 --> 00:40:25.323
just show you. The question is
what is object authority of

00:40:25.323 --> 00:40:31.329
profile I was swiping to. So the
problem is if you use the

00:40:40.371 --> 00:40:46.377
ownership for the profile as
group profile, it will still

00:40:57.121 --> 00:41:03.061
have axis by the group from file
and as long as you don't have

00:41:21.045 --> 00:41:25.249
exclude on the list to the
profile object, you are not able

00:41:25.249 --> 00:41:31.255
to mitigate it. It's not a
emulator it is (indiscernible)

00:41:37.161 --> 00:41:43.167
the question was, whether I am
running am emulator? It is just

00:41:48.473 --> 00:41:54.479
(indiscernible) port forwarding
to the Netherlands. The question

00:41:57.548 --> 00:42:03.488
was whether Java is installed by
default? Yes. If you install

00:42:09.961 --> 00:42:15.967
client access you get the JT400
you can use and the problem is

00:42:24.709 --> 00:42:30.715
all the tools used by the IBM so
the alcohol client access pack

00:42:39.457 --> 00:42:45.463
is Java based so has to be
enabled because other -- (lost

00:42:53.071 --> 00:42:59.077
audio) I write only Java. If
there are no other questions --

00:43:16.861 --> 00:43:22.867
the question is what ports Java
is using there is number of

00:43:26.971 --> 00:43:32.977
ports so refer to IBM website. I
don't know them by heart. There

00:43:37.949 --> 00:43:43.955
are like three ports starting
with 2000 depend on will you use

00:43:48.092 --> 00:43:54.098
SSL there are also different
ports. Question was if I found

00:43:57.368 --> 00:44:03.307
mitigation for those types of
hacks it is difficult you have

00:44:06.577 --> 00:44:12.583
to have good object security
with a lot of excludes, the u

00:44:16.721 --> 00:44:22.727
you have legacy environment with
group profiles you should just

00:44:25.162 --> 00:44:31.169
limit access to the Java part
because most of the time that

00:44:35.306 --> 00:44:42.880
user don't need access to
regulator and dependent on

00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:48.886
whether you use I pH which
requires extra ports for the

00:44:52.190 --> 00:44:58.196
sign on server or use external
tooling like 50 to 50 you can

00:45:03.067 --> 00:45:09.073
limit the ports like 992 for
secure connection. I am

00:45:11.509 --> 00:45:17.515
available the whole conference,
so if you have questions feel

00:45:19.951 --> 00:45:25.957
free to approach me. I will be
around here. You can just sent

00:45:30.928 --> 00:45:36.934
me e-mail or twitter. just look
up on the website, alright,

00:45:40.237 --> 00:45:42.740
thanks alot. (CLAPPING)
