00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.771
Welcome to DEF CON 23. I'm Russ,
chief the operations for the

00:00:04.771 --> 00:00:13.113
conference here for 17 years,
which is why I'm standing here

00:00:13.113 --> 00:00:17.417
today instead of hung over in my
room. How many of you are

00:00:17.417 --> 00:00:23.190
feeling okay this morning?
That's not too bad. How many of

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:24.524
you are new to DEF CON? That's
not bad eater. I got to tell

00:00:24.524 --> 00:00:28.462
you, after all these years,
still can't predict what you

00:00:28.462 --> 00:00:32.533
guys are going to do. We are
almost out of the badges even

00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:40.540
though we upped the numbers. I
do my damnedest and you surprise

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.142
me every year. I which you would
stop that. So we're going to

00:00:42.142 --> 00:00:47.414
queue off this year and show you
the trailer. How many already

00:00:47.414 --> 00:00:50.984
seen the trailer online? So not
many. So this is going to be

00:00:50.984 --> 00:00:54.354
really cool. The theme this year
is kind of this film thing.

00:00:54.354 --> 00:00:56.390
That's why we are walking around
with the albums, all the art

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.160
work reflects it. It's very
cool. If you haven't already

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.063
started getting involved in lost
badge challenge and that sort of

00:01:03.063 --> 00:01:08.535
thing, please do. We have a ton
of stuff going on in the

00:01:08.535 --> 00:01:12.272
villages, in the event center in
ballies. We have kind of divided

00:01:12.272 --> 00:01:18.445
everything up. Hopefully
everyone of you is wearing a fit

00:01:18.445 --> 00:01:22.182
bit because there is a lot of --
yes, me! Go over there. All the

00:01:22.182 --> 00:01:24.318
action is over there. We have
the speakers and the information

00:01:24.318 --> 00:01:26.820
and the vendors and stuff over
here. We tried to separate out a

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.691
little bit. The parties are
going to be in ballies tonight

00:01:30.691 --> 00:01:35.195
for the most part. If you have
questions, ask somebody in a red

00:01:35.195 --> 00:01:45.939
shirt. Be safe, have a good time
and let's role the demo so they

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:50.711
can see that, please. There it
was again this must be some kind

00:01:50.711 --> 00:01:55.949
of prophetic truth masked in
coincidence, certainly, but

00:01:55.949 --> 00:02:00.887
couldn't be. No, these were not
imagined patterns, the mind

00:02:00.887 --> 00:02:06.360
seeking to connect accidental
dots with blurred lines. This

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.965
was something real. (Music
Playing) Something elegant in

00:02:11.965 --> 00:02:23.610
its simplicity. Dangerous in its
manic complexity, deniable in

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:30.851
all its obscured perfection. Are
there others who observed this

00:02:30.851 --> 00:02:32.853
covert conspicuousness? Able to
untangle this perplexity,

00:02:32.853 --> 00:02:50.537
understood this decipher that
surrounds this key. >> WooHoo!

00:02:50.537 --> 00:02:57.744
All right! (Applause) So we are
here! So we are going to kick

00:02:57.744 --> 00:03:01.882
things off this morning with our
Keynote Speaker. He's got a very

00:03:01.882 --> 00:03:06.887
long and rich history in
security and also in research

00:03:06.887 --> 00:03:11.825
areas, so -- and in legal. So I
hope you'll listen to what he

00:03:11.825 --> 00:03:17.964
has to say. This is Alejandro
Mayorkas. He is our deputy 60 of

00:03:17.964 --> 00:03:20.734
Homeland Security. He was
confirmed 2013. You can hear

00:03:20.734 --> 00:03:26.740
lost boy over there starting
their video too. He comes from

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:32.345
University California-Berkeley.
We have anyone from that area? I

00:03:32.345 --> 00:03:34.848
heard somebody hoot and holler.
He's got a law degree, all sorts

00:03:34.848 --> 00:03:38.819
of education, and he's got a lot
of insight into what the

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:40.754
government is thinking about,
information security,

00:03:40.754 --> 00:03:45.058
cybersecurity, right now. So if
you help me welcome the Deputy

00:03:45.058 --> 00:03:54.167
Secretary. (Applause) >>
ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: Good

00:03:54.167 --> 00:04:04.311
morning. Thank you very much for
taking a little bit of time to

00:04:04.311 --> 00:04:09.816
hear me out and hopefully you
will share your concerns or

00:04:09.816 --> 00:04:12.919
thoughts with me and we can have
more of a conversation more of a

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:19.693
conversation than me just giving
a speech. At the outset, I was

00:04:19.693 --> 00:04:26.933
instructed by my colleagues not
to bring my government phone

00:04:26.933 --> 00:04:34.341
with me this morning because it
might suffer intrusion. And I

00:04:34.341 --> 00:04:39.379
said, I don't believe it. Let
them take their best shot. And I

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:45.385
challenge any of you to make my
phone ring during my remarks,

00:04:45.385 --> 00:04:55.462
and if you do, you'll get a free
job with the government (Laughs)

00:04:55.462 --> 00:05:04.771
so give it a shot. Give it a
shot. You know, I have to tell

00:05:04.771 --> 00:05:07.841
you, I tend to be retrospective
when I experience new things. I

00:05:07.841 --> 00:05:15.115
tend to reflect my own past, and
my own life in the decisions

00:05:15.115 --> 00:05:19.019
that I made. And the as I walk
through the lobby area and I

00:05:19.019 --> 00:05:25.692
went into the DEF CON swag room
and then the vendor swag room, I

00:05:25.692 --> 00:05:32.799
thought quite frankly, of my
high school years, and I thought

00:05:32.799 --> 00:05:39.606
about 1974-1977. And it's hard
for me to believe that I walked

00:05:39.606 --> 00:05:43.910
by what was then a very nascent
computer room and walked by the

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:48.715
future. But we are the decisions
that we make, and there is

00:05:48.715 --> 00:05:53.453
always days ahead as well as
days behind. So, I look forward

00:05:53.453 --> 00:06:01.895
to developing greater skills in
this arena than I have now.

00:06:01.895 --> 00:06:06.733
Yesterday I had the privilege
and experience of sharing some

00:06:06.733 --> 00:06:13.573
thoughts at BlackHat. And I have
been looking forward to this as

00:06:13.573 --> 00:06:18.912
well. And I have to tell you, I
find the talent that is resident

00:06:18.912 --> 00:06:31.157
here to be stunning. It is, in
my view, a combination of

00:06:31.157 --> 00:06:37.130
brilliance, expertise, ingenuity
and creativity and also just a

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:43.169
risk tolerance. A tolerance or
appetite to experiment and to

00:06:43.169 --> 00:06:48.174
see what happens. And I want to
talk a little bit more about

00:06:48.174 --> 00:06:56.283
what that means or could mean in
the Department of Homeland

00:06:56.283 --> 00:07:00.053
Security in a minute. But I also
want to also express the fact

00:07:00.053 --> 00:07:08.928
that we have in the Department
of Homeland Security, in my

00:07:08.928 --> 00:07:14.134
opinion, that same level of
brilliance, expertise, ingenuity

00:07:14.134 --> 00:07:17.437
and risk tolerance. Perhaps not
in me, but certainly and for

00:07:17.437 --> 00:07:21.741
example, the three members of
our U.S. team, computer

00:07:21.741 --> 00:07:25.211
emergency readiness team, that I
interacted with yesterday at

00:07:25.211 --> 00:07:32.953
BlackHat. Our ICS team, our
industrial control team that is

00:07:32.953 --> 00:07:38.591
resident in DC. These teams fly
all over the country responding

00:07:38.591 --> 00:07:46.199
to intrusions, not just in the
public sector, not just that the

00:07:46.199 --> 00:07:50.270
government suffers but also the
experiences in the companies and

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:53.940
entities and institutions in
identifying the intruder,

00:07:53.940 --> 00:08:04.084
expelling the intruder and
remediating the system. It's a

00:08:04.084 --> 00:08:06.886
tremendous core of individuals.
What troubles me a great deal

00:08:06.886 --> 00:08:11.191
and it is something that was
quite frankly, underscored

00:08:11.191 --> 00:08:15.729
yesterday and the questions and
comments I received during and

00:08:15.729 --> 00:08:23.303
following my remarks at
BlackHat, is that there is a

00:08:23.303 --> 00:08:29.609
divide between the two groups,
the two collection or

00:08:29.609 --> 00:08:35.281
communities of individuals. And
it's a divide of mistrust that

00:08:35.281 --> 00:08:42.789
there is a trust deficit, as I
called it yesterday between all

00:08:42.789 --> 00:08:49.329
of you and us in the government.
And I know that it is born of

00:08:49.329 --> 00:08:56.469
quite a number of things over
the years, and of course in

00:08:56.469 --> 00:09:02.008
recent past. Whether it's an
intrusion that we suffered that

00:09:02.008 --> 00:09:08.014
speaks to the state of our own
network security, whether it's

00:09:08.014 --> 00:09:18.491
some of the practices or
principles that we execute, or a

00:09:18.491 --> 00:09:28.768
spouse. But I'm very dedicated
to doing what we can to bridge

00:09:28.768 --> 00:09:35.208
that divide. You know, it should
be, after all, a more unified

00:09:35.208 --> 00:09:41.314
community if we speak about the
Internet as a global commons,

00:09:41.314 --> 00:09:47.654
then I think we have to have a
common purpose and a common

00:09:47.654 --> 00:09:52.358
understanding to achieve at
least those things about which

00:09:52.358 --> 00:09:55.328
we agree and hopefully reconcile
more effectively our

00:09:55.328 --> 00:09:58.731
differences. I think that is the
only way, quite frankly, that we

00:09:58.731 --> 00:10:02.936
in the Department of Homeland
Security, at least will achieve,

00:10:02.936 --> 00:10:13.880
I think, our primary goal of
building an ecosystem of

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:20.820
information sharing. This is
quite troubling to me (Laughs) I

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:29.562
never seen Nyquil in that bottle
before. That's probably not

00:10:29.562 --> 00:10:31.564
going to happen, by the way. >>
I'm sorry. May I interrupt? >>

00:10:31.564 --> 00:10:38.404
ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: You did. >>
well played, sir. We have a

00:10:38.404 --> 00:10:43.510
little tradition here at DEF
CON. Is this live? We have a

00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:53.086
little tradition here at DEF
CON. Do you all know what it is?

00:10:53.086 --> 00:10:59.192
(Cheers) we have a first time
speaker! >> ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS:

00:10:59.192 --> 00:11:01.961
Let me share a thought with you
(Laughs) I'm going share two

00:11:01.961 --> 00:11:07.534
things with you. First of all,
I'm going to share a story about

00:11:07.534 --> 00:11:14.340
my landlord. I was a Federal
prosecutor. His name was Jack

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:20.413
Daniels. ( Laughs ) It's true.
And every morning he was -- he

00:11:20.413 --> 00:11:27.921
was 94 years old. He had a
beautiful many of hair. His skin

00:11:27.921 --> 00:11:32.859
looked as though he was 27, and
he lamented the fact that he had

00:11:32.859 --> 00:11:36.062
to wear reading glasses to read
the paper and read novels in the

00:11:36.062 --> 00:11:41.100
morning and in the evening. And
every morning, I left my office

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:45.104
-- I left my apartment early. I
lived above him. I left my

00:11:45.104 --> 00:11:49.943
apartment early to go to work to
the smell of frying bacon, every

00:11:49.943 --> 00:11:53.446
single morning. And every single
evening I came home late and had

00:11:53.446 --> 00:11:57.317
to pick Jack out of the bushes
as he used to have a couple of

00:11:57.317 --> 00:12:01.254
very tall vodka tumblers to end
each day. Just goes to show you

00:12:01.254 --> 00:12:08.628
what the key of life is T has
something to do with Jack

00:12:08.628 --> 00:12:16.970
Daniels. It is very difficult to
talk about a trust deficit and

00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:20.473
how to bridge that deficit and
really build trust when -- and

00:12:20.473 --> 00:12:23.343
this is actually water. >>
That's the official story and

00:12:23.343 --> 00:12:26.646
he's sticking with it! >>
ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: So I'll tell

00:12:26.646 --> 00:12:35.655
you what. As long as you promise
to make it small, I'll take a

00:12:35.655 --> 00:12:40.159
shot of the real stuff.
(Applause) And it's got to be

00:12:40.159 --> 00:12:45.498
small because after this, I'm
actually meeting with TSA

00:12:45.498 --> 00:13:02.782
colleagues and -- (Laughs) >>
you're a trooper, man. >>

00:13:02.782 --> 00:13:09.455
ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: Cheers. >>
cheers! DEF CON! (Applause) >>

00:13:09.455 --> 00:13:14.927
ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: That's my
way of saluting all of you. I'm

00:13:14.927 --> 00:13:19.332
captivated. I'm really
captivated by the talent that is

00:13:19.332 --> 00:13:31.377
here and the potential that it
represents for the world. >> can

00:13:31.377 --> 00:13:34.280
we get a round of applause. He
is a real trooper! (Applause) >>

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:43.122
ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: That was my
first of the day, by the way. It

00:13:43.122 --> 00:13:50.630
might not be my last. So, what
we aspire to is an environment

00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:57.670
where the cyberthreat indicator
is not of proprietary value but

00:13:57.670 --> 00:14:05.745
is actually something that is
exchanged publicly. What we feel

00:14:05.745 --> 00:14:12.018
we can do more ably than anyone
else in the government, because

00:14:12.018 --> 00:14:13.853
of our unique position as a
civilian agency, we are also

00:14:13.853 --> 00:14:18.257
uniquely-positioned at the
intersection of the private

00:14:18.257 --> 00:14:22.929
sector. Our responsibility as
really the chief network

00:14:22.929 --> 00:14:27.734
security agency within the
Federal Government, critical

00:14:27.734 --> 00:14:35.842
infrastructure and other equity
holders in this environment, is

00:14:35.842 --> 00:14:41.848
really received a threat
indicators and we are building a

00:14:41.848 --> 00:14:47.687
system in the capacity in
automated form to then

00:14:47.687 --> 00:14:53.659
disseminate those threat
indicators out to the community

00:14:53.659 --> 00:14:59.265
so we raise the level of network
security. We raise the baseline

00:14:59.265 --> 00:15:05.171
more ably and we at the very
least, avoid replication of

00:15:05.171 --> 00:15:10.943
intrusion that one institution
or one enterprise suffered. And

00:15:10.943 --> 00:15:18.117
the only way that we are going
to be in a position to receive

00:15:18.117 --> 00:15:22.755
those threat indicators, is if
you trust us. If you trust us in

00:15:22.755 --> 00:15:30.797
terms of our capabilities also
trust us with respect to the

00:15:30.797 --> 00:15:34.667
integrity of our actions. And we
are also uniquely positioned in

00:15:34.667 --> 00:15:38.871
the Federal Government because
we are the only department that

00:15:38.871 --> 00:15:41.808
has a statutorily created Office
of Privacy and a

00:15:41.808 --> 00:15:45.678
statutorily-created Office of
Civil Rights and civil

00:15:45.678 --> 00:15:49.382
liberties. And those equities
are brought to bear in

00:15:49.382 --> 00:15:51.784
everything that we do in the
network security arena and in

00:15:51.784 --> 00:16:02.929
fact, everything that we do as a
Department of Homeland Security.

00:16:02.929 --> 00:16:07.466
Yesterday, somebody said, look,
you know, if I have got a threat

00:16:07.466 --> 00:16:10.670
indicator, if I have the keys to
the kingdom, quite frankly, I'm

00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:17.243
not going to, in my risk
tolerance might be high but I'm

00:16:17.243 --> 00:16:21.914
not going to experiment and turn
that over to you to find out

00:16:21.914 --> 00:16:29.055
whether you are worthy of our
trust or not. And I understand

00:16:29.055 --> 00:16:36.529
that. And I appreciate it. What
I said was, trust is not built

00:16:36.529 --> 00:16:44.370
or rebuilt or regained overnight
T takes time. And what I would

00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:51.978
ask, if it is fair of me to do
so, is that you start somewhere.

00:16:51.978 --> 00:16:58.651
Start somewhere where you're
willingness to risk with us is

00:16:58.651 --> 00:17:01.921
manageable to you and let us
prove to you what our

00:17:01.921 --> 00:17:09.795
capabilities are and let us
prove to you what the integrity

00:17:09.795 --> 00:17:16.669
of our actions and our
intentions are. That is what I

00:17:16.669 --> 00:17:22.441
would ask of you. And let's see
what we can do and what we can

00:17:22.441 --> 00:17:27.847
do together. It's interesting. I
heard -- and it's very important

00:17:27.847 --> 00:17:33.152
for you to give us that chance.
At least it's important to us in

00:17:33.152 --> 00:17:40.559
terms of what we are doing.
Another comment they heard

00:17:40.559 --> 00:17:43.896
yesterday was, you know what?
We'd like to validate what you

00:17:43.896 --> 00:17:52.571
do it's very difficult sometimes
to validate from the outside.

00:17:52.571 --> 00:17:58.577
And maybe you can have a hacker
validate your capabilities and

00:17:58.577 --> 00:18:02.381
validate the integrity of your
actions. And I think that say

00:18:02.381 --> 00:18:06.352
terrific idea. So I have got a
couple of thoughts. I thought

00:18:06.352 --> 00:18:11.590
about it a lot overnight. I
thought a lot about the day I

00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:15.595
had at BlackHat and the people I
met and the ideas that we

00:18:15.595 --> 00:18:21.200
exchanged. I thought of two
things and I'll take them back

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:28.174
to DC and I'll share them with
you now and see if they fly. And

00:18:28.174 --> 00:18:32.011
I'd be curious to hear if they
fly with you. One is, drawn from

00:18:32.011 --> 00:18:36.115
my experience when I was leading
the immigration agency in the

00:18:36.115 --> 00:18:40.152
government, the agency U.S.
Citizenship and Immigration

00:18:40.152 --> 00:18:46.392
Services that administers the
legal immigration system in our

00:18:46.392 --> 00:18:50.096
country, we administered Visas
for individuals that wanted to

00:18:50.096 --> 00:18:58.237
come and join businesses here in
the United States from a broad.

00:18:58.237 --> 00:19:03.743
And it was remarkable how out of
touch we were as an agency, out

00:19:03.743 --> 00:19:07.346
of touch we were with the
start-up community. Some of the

00:19:07.346 --> 00:19:10.983
questions and policies that we
had would ask questions of

00:19:10.983 --> 00:19:14.220
individuals like, how many
employees does the business

00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:18.290
have? Can we have the
organizational chart? What is

00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:25.498
the floor plan? How much space
do you lease? And the like. And

00:19:25.498 --> 00:19:31.437
it did not take into account
that the next generation of

00:19:31.437 --> 00:19:38.177
businesses that will reinvent
the world, could be developing

00:19:38.177 --> 00:19:42.715
in a cubicle somewhere or in a
garage, a basement, or

00:19:42.715 --> 00:19:50.022
unfurnished room. So what we
did, what I did was, I said we

00:19:50.022 --> 00:19:53.526
don't have a Monopoly on good
ideas. We have slow ideas but

00:19:53.526 --> 00:20:00.166
not necessarily on very good
ideas. But you know what? Let's

00:20:00.166 --> 00:20:05.337
bring in the talent into the
agency. And what we did was, we

00:20:05.337 --> 00:20:09.875
brought in a number of
entrepreneurs who were willing

00:20:09.875 --> 00:20:13.212
to take their time -- they done
well enough, or they were

00:20:13.212 --> 00:20:18.350
supported by the entities for
whom they worked at that time.

00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:21.487
They came in and joined us
full-time for six months, and

00:20:21.487 --> 00:20:28.627
then they extended so ended up
staying a year. So, that was an

00:20:28.627 --> 00:20:33.999
entrepreneurs and residents
program. And what I would ask

00:20:33.999 --> 00:20:37.903
is, how about doing a hacker
in-residents program in the

00:20:37.903 --> 00:20:47.513
Department of Homeland Security?
And people who are willing to

00:20:47.513 --> 00:20:54.253
devote their time, come in and
lend us your talent, your

00:20:54.253 --> 00:20:59.759
skills, your expertise, your
creative ways of looking at

00:20:59.759 --> 00:21:06.265
things, and not only necessarily
validating what we do but

00:21:06.265 --> 00:21:13.139
actually helping us improve it.
The second idea I had was to

00:21:13.139 --> 00:21:20.613
create an Advisory Council of
hackers, individuals who may not

00:21:20.613 --> 00:21:28.888
have the flexibility to join us
on a full-time basis but can

00:21:28.888 --> 00:21:34.693
take a slice of their time here
and again to provide us advice,

00:21:34.693 --> 00:21:39.832
to take a look at what we are
doing, and to essentially

00:21:39.832 --> 00:21:49.341
achieve the same goal of
validating or improving that

00:21:49.341 --> 00:21:55.614
skill. I am tremendously proud
of being in the Federal

00:21:55.614 --> 00:22:00.886
Government. I'm now in my 18th
year. I have been in and out of

00:22:00.886 --> 00:22:06.959
government and the private
sector, and I think there is an

00:22:06.959 --> 00:22:12.031
incredible opportunity to impact
the life of people just as I

00:22:12.031 --> 00:22:18.070
think you understand and
appreciate and execute that very

00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:25.678
opportunity. And I'd like to
partner with you. We would like

00:22:25.678 --> 00:22:32.885
to partner with you and see if
we can build a bridge of trust

00:22:32.885 --> 00:22:38.958
and actually develop a community
of interest and a commonalty of

00:22:38.958 --> 00:22:44.797
purpose. You know, yesterday, I
heard audio - I was in a couple

00:22:44.797 --> 00:23:00.779
of meetings with individuals who
shared with me their perspective

00:23:00.779 --> 00:23:05.885
of how Wassenaar a train wreck
in their view. And they shared a

00:23:05.885 --> 00:23:09.421
perspective with me, to which I
had not previously been exposed.

00:23:09.421 --> 00:23:13.425
I had a few thoughts. Number 1,
I have to take those

00:23:13.425 --> 00:23:19.465
perspectives back home and we
have got to take a look at what

00:23:19.465 --> 00:23:27.172
Wassenaar is and what it means.
It was -- good morning. Katie is

00:23:27.172 --> 00:23:33.312
one of the individuals who
provided me with tremendous

00:23:33.312 --> 00:23:38.984
insights into Wassenaar, and
while it has its noble

00:23:38.984 --> 00:23:45.190
intentions of protecting Human
Rights and fundamental human

00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:56.268
values, certainly I heard a
chorus of views that it did not

00:23:56.268 --> 00:24:05.744
accomplish that goal at a price
that proved worthy. I did note

00:24:05.744 --> 00:24:10.549
that Wassenaar received 270
comments and there were

00:24:10.549 --> 00:24:15.120
thousands and thousands of
people at BlackHat and there are

00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:23.729
thousands and thousands and
thousands of people at DEF CON.

00:24:23.729 --> 00:24:30.369
And adhering to adage that the
keystroke is mightier than the

00:24:30.369 --> 00:24:34.973
sword, if you have a voice that
you choose to express with

00:24:34.973 --> 00:24:38.444
respect to very important
government policies and

00:24:38.444 --> 00:24:42.414
initiatives, I hope you will
exercise that voice through the

00:24:42.414 --> 00:24:46.185
channels that we have available
and the channels that will you

00:24:46.185 --> 00:24:49.355
yourself can create. But I do
very much want to build a

00:24:49.355 --> 00:24:52.691
community, and I'm very
dedicated to building that

00:24:52.691 --> 00:24:58.464
community of trust, and I really
appreciate the opportunity to

00:24:58.464 --> 00:25:02.101
share some comments and thoughts
with you, and I'd love to open

00:25:02.101 --> 00:25:13.045
it up to questions and comments
and hear what you have to say

00:25:13.045 --> 00:25:17.182
and what you think. So thank you
very much. (Applause) Anyone

00:25:17.182 --> 00:25:51.917
give it a shot? Not this shot. I
mean a shot at a question. And

00:25:51.917 --> 00:25:57.489
I'll repeat -- if you shout it
at me, I can repeat it. So the

00:25:57.489 --> 00:26:03.929
question was, do I think that we
should -- and tell me if I

00:26:03.929 --> 00:26:09.868
capture this correctly. Do I
think that we should be required

00:26:09.868 --> 00:26:16.275
to demonstrate the effectiveness
of the security measures that we

00:26:16.275 --> 00:26:22.481
take and essentially impose upon
the public, before we actually

00:26:22.481 --> 00:26:28.454
impose them? For example, the
security measures that we take

00:26:28.454 --> 00:26:38.831
at the airports. His buddy
waited an hour in line because

00:26:38.831 --> 00:26:48.106
of our TSA processes. Let me say
that it's not an all or nothing

00:26:48.106 --> 00:26:54.213
proposition. I think that with
respect to some we do and we can

00:26:54.213 --> 00:27:03.122
and maybe we should do more and
I'll take a look at that. With

00:27:03.122 --> 00:27:08.160
respect to some, I'm not sure
that we are able to, by virtue

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:12.831
of the fact that some of those
security measures are seen in

00:27:12.831 --> 00:27:18.203
unseen by necessity. But I think
it raises a very important point

00:27:18.203 --> 00:27:23.108
that trust very difficult to
build if we are not open and

00:27:23.108 --> 00:27:29.414
transparent. So I think your
point is well taken and we'll

00:27:29.414 --> 00:27:34.953
take a look at what measures we
have and the effectiveness that

00:27:34.953 --> 00:27:40.826
we can demonstrate publicly. I
will tell you that certainly the

00:27:40.826 --> 00:27:45.297
infectiveness of some of our
measures was demonstrated

00:27:45.297 --> 00:27:52.437
publicly in a report that was
published by our inspector

00:27:52.437 --> 00:27:55.807
general. And I think that there
are reports available that shed

00:27:55.807 --> 00:27:59.845
some light on the effectiveness
or lack of effectiveness of some

00:27:59.845 --> 00:28:09.821
of the things we do, whether it
is inspector general reports or

00:28:09.821 --> 00:29:00.472
GAO reports. That's a fair
point. And I appreciate the

00:29:00.472 --> 00:29:06.211
question and openness and
transparency. Thank you. So the

00:29:06.211 --> 00:29:11.683
question centers on the OPM
breach. There are individuals

00:29:11.683 --> 00:29:15.754
who have provided to the
government the most intimate

00:29:15.754 --> 00:29:24.396
information, the most
confidential and private

00:29:24.396 --> 00:29:36.274
information. I have, on multiple
occasions, in anticipation of

00:29:36.274 --> 00:29:41.146
nominations and confirmations --
should people do that if -- what

00:29:41.146 --> 00:29:45.684
is the condition of the
government's capability to

00:29:45.684 --> 00:29:52.524
protect that information? You
mentioned -- you termed it a

00:29:52.524 --> 00:30:00.766
leak, which it isn't. A leak is
when an individual in the

00:30:00.766 --> 00:30:07.472
government voluntarily provides
information externally. This was

00:30:07.472 --> 00:30:11.677
an intrusion. And what is --
what is the government doing

00:30:11.677 --> 00:30:19.251
about securing its networks and
what is our role in the

00:30:19.251 --> 00:30:27.092
Department of Homeland Security?
>> AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Off mic) >>

00:30:27.092 --> 00:30:33.532
ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: And also,
the contractual arrangements

00:30:33.532 --> 00:30:41.373
that -- with other companies.
Okay. So, a compound question.

00:30:41.373 --> 00:30:46.678
The network security of some
government agencies and

00:30:46.678 --> 00:30:54.219
departments is not where it
needs to be. Subsequent to the

00:30:54.219 --> 00:31:01.326
OPM breach, the government
embarked upon a 30-day Sprint to

00:31:01.326 --> 00:31:06.364
address some of the more
easily-accessible remedies that

00:31:06.364 --> 00:31:10.235
could be instituted. There are,
as you know, better than do I,

00:31:10.235 --> 00:31:14.673
there are immediate fixes. There
are short-term, medium and

00:31:14.673 --> 00:31:19.611
long-term. And all of those
efforts are well underway, not

00:31:19.611 --> 00:31:24.282
just the Sprint, which is a
blocking and tackling exercise,

00:31:24.282 --> 00:31:28.453
but medium and long-term
exercises. We are taking a look

00:31:28.453 --> 00:31:32.524
at our contractual
relationships. We are or have

00:31:32.524 --> 00:31:37.195
placed in our contractual
language, requirements with

00:31:37.195 --> 00:31:41.733
respect to network security of
the entities with which we

00:31:41.733 --> 00:31:51.243
contract The Department of
Homeland Security is one of the

00:31:51.243 --> 00:31:54.346
leaders in the government in
ensuring that other government

00:31:54.346 --> 00:31:58.083
departments and agencies raise
the level of their network

00:31:58.083 --> 00:32:03.388
security. We have a pivotal role
in that. The Secretary of

00:32:03.388 --> 00:32:08.760
Homeland Security was empowered
with the capacity to issue

00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:14.032
operational directives to other
department and agency heads. He

00:32:14.032 --> 00:32:17.869
issued the first one subsequent
to the OPM breach and we are

00:32:17.869 --> 00:32:23.375
exercising our authority in that
regard. So, the future is

00:32:23.375 --> 00:32:51.236
brighter than the mast. Thank
you. -- brighter than the past.

00:32:51.236 --> 00:33:25.971
Thank you. >> AUDIENCE MEMBER:
(Off mic) >> ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS:

00:33:25.971 --> 00:33:30.876
What should be disclosed? >>
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Off mic) >>

00:33:30.876 --> 00:33:34.579
ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: So the
question -- I'm going to

00:33:34.579 --> 00:33:44.756
paraphrase it and shorten it if
you don't mind and tell me if I

00:33:44.756 --> 00:33:52.998
captured it in spirit. In terms
of voluntary disclosures. Are we

00:33:52.998 --> 00:33:58.270
planning to aggregate
information about intrusions the

00:33:58.270 --> 00:34:03.942
government has suffered or
intrusions about which we learn

00:34:03.942 --> 00:34:10.115
and disseminate that information
broadly so that in the service,

00:34:10.115 --> 00:34:17.822
I think of raising the level of
awareness. And yes, we are. Yes

00:34:17.822 --> 00:34:22.594
we are. I was going to share
some remarks about the

00:34:22.594 --> 00:34:29.367
disclosure regime and quite
frankly, candidly, yesterday, I

00:34:29.367 --> 00:34:44.783
learned that I'm ankle to knee
deep in my facility with that

00:34:44.783 --> 00:34:48.153
issue. I know it's a very
sensitive and wish they are

00:34:48.153 --> 00:34:52.924
strongly held in competing views
and I thought you know what? I'm

00:34:52.924 --> 00:34:57.629
going to refrain from commenting
until I build a greater facility

00:34:57.629 --> 00:35:05.403
with that particular issue. I
will say this if I may, just a

00:35:05.403 --> 00:35:15.180
quick other note of admiration.
I also found it extraordinarily

00:35:15.180 --> 00:35:24.823
impressive, while there are
competing views about some very

00:35:24.823 --> 00:35:34.099
core issues with respect to the
Internet behavioral patterns and

00:35:34.099 --> 00:35:41.373
the like. It is extremely
important and profound that the

00:35:41.373 --> 00:35:45.043
competing views are so grounded
in ethical principles about the

00:35:45.043 --> 00:35:51.816
meaning of the conduct and
issues and the ramifications for

00:35:51.816 --> 00:35:56.021
the creation of opportunities
and the ability to exploit in

00:35:56.021 --> 00:36:48.840
the best sense of the term, to
exploit capabilities and

00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:51.709
talents. It's a very
profound discourse. >>
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Off mic)

00:36:51.709 --> 00:37:02.120
>> ALEJANDRO
MAYORKAS: I appreciate
that. So, the

00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:07.358
pointed made was that
there are -- and I'm very
eager to capture

00:37:07.358 --> 00:37:14.132
this fairly. That there are two
things in play. There is trust

00:37:14.132 --> 00:37:19.370
and there is respect. And it's
very important that our

00:37:19.370 --> 00:37:26.177
department, if we seek to
achieve both, engage with this

00:37:26.177 --> 00:37:32.784
community and appear at DEF CON,
and I think, interact with this

00:37:32.784 --> 00:37:44.963
community more fully. And that's
why I'm here. And I'm very

00:37:44.963 --> 00:37:51.703
grateful for the opportunity.
And I agree. Sir? >> AUDIENCE

00:37:51.703 --> 00:37:55.106
MEMBER: (Off mic) >> ALEJANDRO
MAYORKAS: It's not going to be

00:37:55.106 --> 00:38:04.282
on my watch but on the run up to
the Fourth of July, the Visa

00:38:04.282 --> 00:38:06.784
system went down. >> AUDIENCE
MEMBER: (Off mic)

00:38:06.784 --> 00:38:12.690
>> ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: Was
it a system failure or
intentional effort to

00:38:12.690 --> 00:40:11.643
reduce the inbound flow of
individuals? My understanding is

00:40:11.643 --> 00:40:20.551
that it was a system
failure. Thank you >>
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Off mic)

00:40:20.551 --> 00:40:26.424
>> ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: So, the
gentleman summarized and

00:40:26.424 --> 00:40:33.164
said you know, the trust
quotient is not increasing with

00:40:33.164 --> 00:40:38.002
our articulation of our position
with respect to encryption, and

00:40:38.002 --> 00:40:54.218
the request for a backdoor. And
while he thanked me for being

00:40:54.218 --> 00:40:56.921
here, he challenged me to
say that a backdoor is a
bad idea. (Applause)

00:40:56.921 --> 00:41:08.499
The
only thing that got an
applause so far. I do

00:41:08.499 --> 00:41:15.840
take note of that ( Laughs ) let
me say this. I know what the

00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:27.952
problem is and I don't know what
the solution is. There are

00:41:27.952 --> 00:41:31.823
individuals who wished to do us
harm on small scales and by

00:41:31.823 --> 00:41:39.163
small scale, I don't think the
victimized family would consider

00:41:39.163 --> 00:41:46.170
it to be small. A small scale a
large-scale. And what happens is

00:41:46.170 --> 00:41:53.644
we lose track of critical
communications that enable us to

00:41:53.644 --> 00:41:58.616
interdict a violent act before
it wreaks damage and that does

00:41:58.616 --> 00:42:05.323
happen, and there have been
public examples in the last 60

00:42:05.323 --> 00:42:11.929
days, and we lose the ability to
do that. And that is the

00:42:11.929 --> 00:42:18.536
problem. And I heard certainly
not only yesterday and today,

00:42:18.536 --> 00:42:22.040
but before this week, the
concerns about a backdoor, and I

00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:27.512
understand and appreciate that.
And so, what I can say is that

00:42:27.512 --> 00:42:31.816
I'm well aware of the problem.
I'm reminded of it every morning

00:42:31.816 --> 00:42:37.588
in an information brief that I
receive with respect to the

00:42:37.588 --> 00:42:48.266
terrorist threat, domestically
and a broad. And I do not know

00:42:48.266 --> 00:42:59.477
what the answer is. I can't say
yes and I can't say no. And I'm

00:42:59.477 --> 00:43:04.682
just being honest with you. I
understand the opposition to a

00:43:04.682 --> 00:43:11.389
backdoor. That it compromises
security to a greater degree

00:43:11.389 --> 00:43:17.495
than our concerns would dictate.
That is one of the concerns. I'm

00:43:17.495 --> 00:43:19.297
just not an expert in
encryption. I'm not an expert in

00:43:19.297 --> 00:43:24.268
the ramifications. I well
understand the concerns and I

00:43:24.268 --> 00:44:01.539
don't know -- all I can say is,
I don't know what the solution

00:44:01.539 --> 00:44:04.375
is. And I'm just being candid.
>> AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Off mic) >>

00:44:04.375 --> 00:44:11.516
ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: So companies
are suffering intrusions. They

00:44:11.516 --> 00:44:17.788
are becoming increasingly
frustrated with the fact that

00:44:17.788 --> 00:44:25.363
the risks or the threat remains.
And they are considering

00:44:25.363 --> 00:44:31.702
offensive conduct and what do I
think about that sort of

00:44:31.702 --> 00:44:39.911
vigilante act which runs afoul
of the law? So if it runs afoul

00:44:39.911 --> 00:44:47.418
of the law, I'm not going to
support it. At least not to say

00:44:47.418 --> 00:44:51.722
that I agree with every law. But
I did not n this area, I think

00:44:51.722 --> 00:44:59.297
vigilantism is far more
destructive than constructive

00:44:59.297 --> 00:45:05.536
and I would strongly urge
companies not to engage in that

00:45:05.536 --> 00:45:12.977
conduct and the fact of the
matter is it underscores the

00:45:12.977 --> 00:45:20.184
need for us to work together to
strengthen network security. You

00:45:20.184 --> 00:45:22.353
know, when I travel around the
country and I speak to companies

00:45:22.353 --> 00:45:29.427
and when I travel around the
world, and I speak to companies

00:45:29.427 --> 00:45:34.065
internationally and Governments,
it seems that it is increasingly

00:45:34.065 --> 00:45:39.570
a given that an intrusion will
occur. The question is, how

00:45:39.570 --> 00:45:47.712
quickly can it be detected,
expelled, and remediated? And

00:45:47.712 --> 00:45:52.316
what I think we can do is defend
against the replication of

00:45:52.316 --> 00:45:56.387
intrusions so if one company
suffers it, another should not.

00:45:56.387 --> 00:46:01.626
And that is premised upon the
sharing and circulation and

00:46:01.626 --> 00:46:06.764
dissemination of information.
And then, sharing best practices

00:46:06.764 --> 00:46:10.001
and the expertise and talent in
this room. I'm getting the hook.

00:46:10.001 --> 00:46:17.475
I want to thank you all very
much for giving me some time

00:46:17.475 --> 00:49:14.318
this morning and for everything
you do. I hope I come back

00:49:14.318 --> 00:49:20.324
again. Thanks again. (Applause)
