00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:04.538
So this is closing ceremonies.
If you are called up on stage

00:00:04.538 --> 00:00:08.108
for some reason, like you one a
contest or something, you are

00:00:08.108 --> 00:00:11.678
going to enter from this side of
the stage and exit. You're going

00:00:11.678 --> 00:00:15.782
to walk all the way around and
sit back down. Everybody clear

00:00:15.782 --> 00:00:20.787
with that situation? Very simple
traffic pattern of entrance.

00:00:20.787 --> 00:00:26.793
Exit. Victory lap. Sit down.
Thank you. >> If you ever do

00:00:34.635 --> 00:00:40.641
that again I'll smack you. >>
Hi, everybody my name is Ross my

00:00:50.484 --> 00:00:53.820
partner in crime over here is, I
don't drive cars we're the guys

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.692
organizers and creators of the
TVXL film contest. This is our

00:00:58.692 --> 00:01:04.031
second year. This year we had
eight teams register. And four

00:01:04.031 --> 00:01:08.835
teams were able to submit
entries. When I say submit

00:01:08.835 --> 00:01:15.542
entries that means they had to
write, create, film, produce, a

00:01:15.542 --> 00:01:21.281
film from 6 a.m. as early as 6
a.m. Thursday turn it in by 5:00

00:01:21.281 --> 00:01:27.154
p.m. on Saturday. So we had five
-- correction four great

00:01:27.154 --> 00:01:32.225
entries. And my partner, I don't
drive cars, is going to start

00:01:32.225 --> 00:01:38.231
showing them now. Thank you. >>
Hope you had a good -- all right

00:01:50.677 --> 00:01:53.380
so I got another issue that
security system you set up for

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.350
me isn't working so can you call
me back when you get a chance.

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:02.622
All right. >> Hey, man, it's
Robert. Las Vegas, more

00:02:02.622 --> 00:02:08.628
importantly how is that -- has
been a mess. Seriously. >> I

00:02:24.177 --> 00:02:30.183
heard you just got back. Call me
back. [ inaudible ] >> Andrew,

00:02:47.567 --> 00:02:55.175
where are you? How many more
days are you going to be away?

00:02:55.175 --> 00:03:00.280
We have clients trying to stay
online. Seriously, call me

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:06.286
immediately! >> Your boss just
called me what's going on? What

00:03:10.691 --> 00:03:16.697
are you even doing? You need to
call me right now or we're

00:03:24.571 --> 00:03:30.577
through. >> Hey, man, I haven't
heard of you since Vegas. What

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:43.356
is going on? I'm having a party
this weekend, my security system

00:03:50.163 --> 00:03:56.169
is down, I need you over here as
soon as possible. >> It's fair

00:04:05.011 --> 00:04:11.017
for me to wonder if you are
honest operator, operate in good

00:04:17.824 --> 00:04:23.830
faith with me when you have not
turned up for work in three

00:04:31.671 --> 00:04:37.677
weeks. I don't know what you
think you're doing because it's

00:04:43.416 --> 00:04:49.422
not working here any more. >>
It's been almost a month. I

00:04:56.229 --> 00:05:02.169
don't know what is going on with
you but I'm not putting up with

00:05:11.077 --> 00:05:17.083
your shit any more. I'm done.
I'm fucking done. I hope she's

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:29.896
worth it. >> Meanwhile, no
unheard messages. Press one to

00:05:34.534 --> 00:05:42.309
replay messages. [Applause] >>
What do you mean he's not there?

00:05:42.309 --> 00:05:45.946
It's the damnest thing. The
whole thing was one big hoax

00:05:45.946 --> 00:05:51.117
that son of a bitch has been on
the run over 70 years now. >>

00:05:51.117 --> 00:05:56.456
But you'd think that -- >>
That's the thing. The CIA knew

00:05:56.456 --> 00:06:01.361
there was ex Nazis for years.
They hadn't expected the whole

00:06:01.361 --> 00:06:04.798
thing was a diversion, a ruse to
distract them while the big man

00:06:04.798 --> 00:06:09.569
himself set up shop in the
strip. Find out only a few

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:14.407
things. >> What is he doing at
DEF CON? >> Sources tell me he

00:06:14.407 --> 00:06:17.310
plans to release massive zero
data in one of the presentations

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:21.181
tomorrow. What I heard make back
office look like child's play.

00:06:21.181 --> 00:06:28.755
>> What are you going to do
about it? >> Well -- [ phone

00:06:28.755 --> 00:06:32.325
ringing ] >> Shit. Take this. >>
Is this red hat the right

00:06:32.325 --> 00:06:37.631
detective? >> Yeah, who the hell
are you? >> This moment for a

00:06:37.631 --> 00:06:43.637
long time. >> of course I'm
okay. All seriousness my life

00:06:49.376 --> 00:06:55.382
flashed before my eyes. I think
I know ho I can stop him. >> How

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:01.154
can we stop him? >> Chances are
he'll be signing up for the

00:07:01.154 --> 00:07:08.595
beard and mustache competition
tomorrow. If we can get to him

00:07:08.595 --> 00:07:14.601
before he starts his talk we'll
have a chance. >> That sounds

00:07:19.839 --> 00:07:25.845
like a plan. I'll go there. >>
We'll leave in the morning.

00:07:31.084 --> 00:07:37.090
First, make it -- >> the contest
isn't open yet but I think he's

00:07:44.197 --> 00:07:50.203
going to show up to it early.
He's trying to -- >> Is that him

00:07:58.278 --> 00:08:04.217
over there? >> That's the worst
-- we've been looking for. >> I

00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:16.396
don't think, definitely not -- [
inaudible ] >> I'll go to the

00:08:22.569 --> 00:08:29.008
lounge. >> 999 how the hell am I
supposed to release the zero day

00:08:29.008 --> 00:08:32.812
when all these pineapples
shitting up the network. I've

00:08:32.812 --> 00:08:35.648
been running all around this
place for 20 minutes. I've been

00:08:35.648 --> 00:08:41.988
pawned twice still can't get a
good connection. Ruined. Will be

00:08:41.988 --> 00:08:47.994
over before it begins. Got him
now. >> RX modulator. Back door

00:08:51.498 --> 00:08:58.705
to the GSM system. Initiate a
SQL injection. Might end his

00:08:58.705 --> 00:09:04.644
miserable life once and for all.
What the fuck, this is a burner

00:09:14.888 --> 00:09:20.894
phone. Nobody has -- and that's
why you don't try to take over

00:09:23.396 --> 00:09:29.402
the world at DEF CON. >> Nobody
actually lives in Las Vegas. The

00:10:10.977 --> 00:10:14.013
suckers at the blackjack table
are just visiting passing

00:10:14.013 --> 00:10:17.317
through town on way back to
their real lives. For us poor

00:10:17.317 --> 00:10:21.621
saps, these are our real lives.
We're passing through to

00:10:21.621 --> 00:10:25.492
somewhere else. Move to Vegas to
start a new life, to create a

00:10:25.492 --> 00:10:27.994
new identity and get on my feet
before heading somewhere better,

00:10:27.994 --> 00:10:32.899
some where permanent. 23 years
I'm still not sure where that

00:10:32.899 --> 00:10:37.070
place is. I decided to head into
the office, at least that's

00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:40.773
highway I thought of Joe's bar
combination of bar, gin joint

00:10:40.773 --> 00:10:48.047
and waiting room. Waiting. So
Vegas detectives was outside the

00:10:48.047 --> 00:10:54.754
alley that he was waiting for
CSI. The conversation was short,

00:10:54.754 --> 00:10:58.291
got a glimpse of a body. Joe's
has always been like a second

00:10:58.291 --> 00:11:01.461
home to me, someone bumped off
in my back yard I take it

00:11:01.461 --> 00:11:06.533
personally I decided to duck
through, just like me. 23 years,

00:11:06.533 --> 00:11:08.535
the last thing I said to my old
man before I had to fake my own

00:11:08.535 --> 00:11:14.541
death to get out of the agency,
projects didn't scare me it's

00:11:17.477 --> 00:11:19.646
what they were doing with that
information. I'm sorry you feel

00:11:19.646 --> 00:11:27.153
that way, just another way of
saying, whatever. I grabbed some

00:11:27.153 --> 00:11:30.223
pain killers headed out, I got
this little man he lives in my

00:11:30.223 --> 00:11:35.261
chest, that let's me started to
squeeze looked like the corpse

00:11:35.261 --> 00:11:37.330
developed an interest. I wonder
if he was dead. Victor working

00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:43.002
project like bull run possible,
when they decided he'd out grown

00:11:43.002 --> 00:11:49.409
American intelligence agencies.
I knew he had a plan. I didn't

00:11:49.409 --> 00:11:52.946
have any idea what he was up to
these days. Nobody knew. Victor

00:11:52.946 --> 00:11:57.116
played the long game, something
bad happened on the Internet,

00:11:57.116 --> 00:12:02.121
odds are he was behind it. But
type the hold a grudge and

00:12:02.121 --> 00:12:06.593
Victor could profit from it,
chances are 'require new tools,

00:12:06.593 --> 00:12:09.629
another time you realize who you
can damage with them and

00:12:09.629 --> 00:12:13.533
convince them in corpse had been
a writer, hard boil detective

00:12:13.533 --> 00:12:18.504
stories, maybe 60 years ago that
might earned him some scratch.

00:12:18.504 --> 00:12:21.341
Come to Vegas after a failed
marriage somehow ended up with a

00:12:21.341 --> 00:12:26.579
bar with small group of packers
decided to go modern. Sounded

00:12:26.579 --> 00:12:29.616
like he managed to worm his way
into their crowd I doubt he ever

00:12:29.616 --> 00:12:32.952
really earned confidence, get
enough liquor in anyone they

00:12:32.952 --> 00:12:39.025
start to talk. The corpse had
been taking notes. But after 2

00:12:39.025 --> 00:12:46.299
years of notes, come together,
DEF CON 7, tells story about a

00:12:46.299 --> 00:12:51.404
guy who DEF CON 11 early bird
and wizards speculate on just --

00:12:51.404 --> 00:12:57.410
DEF CON 13, amidst the alcohol
haze. These guys were smart,

00:12:59.912 --> 00:13:01.848
they probably never realized
they were talking about the same

00:13:01.848 --> 00:13:06.286
guy, Victor. 23 years of careful
notes started to look like a

00:13:06.286 --> 00:13:10.390
different bird's egg. It was
right there in the Corp's book.

00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:14.127
He had tried to make that
blackmailing Victor. On the

00:13:14.127 --> 00:13:18.598
laptop that story had Victor
behind bars. Probably back

00:13:18.598 --> 00:13:21.567
behind Joe's bar. Is to one
starting to smell. Seemed like

00:13:21.567 --> 00:13:27.573
open and shut case. The little
man wasn't buying it. Popped a

00:13:30.977 --> 00:13:36.215
couple more pills. 23 years. The
novel DEF CON. Drinking

00:13:36.215 --> 00:13:38.351
contests, 2 years at the same
bar. Then -- [Applause] >> It

00:13:38.351 --> 00:13:41.821
was my first time in Vegas. The
city was great. It was all I

00:13:41.821 --> 00:13:44.624
expected and more. It's just
another day. Or so I thought.

00:13:44.624 --> 00:13:49.562
Did you get a badge? >> I was
just down there. The line -- >>

00:13:49.562 --> 00:13:55.568
I know. Want mine I'll sell it
for a hundred. I just got it. >>

00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:56.796
Yeah, sure. I think I got
enough. >> Perfect. >> Thanks.

00:16:03.629 --> 00:16:09.635
>> By the way, don't count your
chickens before your eggs hatch,

00:17:10.496 --> 00:17:16.502
all right? >> I know what it
does. >> We're going to be super

00:18:47.326 --> 00:18:53.332
quick here. Winner of this
year's contest is the 23rd badge

00:19:16.455 --> 00:19:20.526
the film you just saw by lake
state studios, like to thank the

00:19:20.526 --> 00:19:23.562
Seattle film institute for their
generous prize of $5 --> 000

00:19:23.562 --> 00:19:29.568
scholarship. Scholarships. It's
huge. Video maker magazine for

00:19:32.171 --> 00:19:36.242
giving everyone who participate
a subscription, like to thank

00:19:36.242 --> 00:19:40.012
DT, DEF CON and we hope to see
you guys next year and make a

00:19:40.012 --> 00:19:46.018
movie with us. [Applause] >> the
videos will all be online. >>

00:20:03.636 --> 00:20:06.205
Okay. Our problem is we don't
use any wireless microphones for

00:20:06.205 --> 00:20:11.277
obvious reasons. [ laughter ]
Let's get this hooked up. All

00:20:11.277 --> 00:20:17.283
right. Thank you. This is our
official closing ceremonies as

00:20:27.927 --> 00:20:33.933
if you hadn't guessed. I'm the
dark tangent we are here for a

00:20:46.312 --> 00:20:49.582
journey for the next about an
hour to tell you what happened,

00:20:49.582 --> 00:20:52.418
what you missed, who the winners
are of all the contests and

00:20:52.418 --> 00:20:55.888
villages. Make some special
announcements of what to expect

00:20:55.888 --> 00:21:01.827
for next year. Yeah! That's me.
And to my right with the great

00:21:04.663 --> 00:21:10.669
full Mo is Russ Rogers.
[Applause] >> Awesome. Russ

00:21:12.738 --> 00:21:16.976
really made things happen this
year. As you know the first year

00:21:16.976 --> 00:21:20.579
in a new hotel is always
exciting so I want to thank

00:21:20.579 --> 00:21:24.517
everybody for putting up with
the chaos of that first day. And

00:21:24.517 --> 00:21:27.586
we really tried to make some
changes. Next year obviously

00:21:27.586 --> 00:21:32.925
we'll make some more changes
and, you know, what is this,

00:21:32.925 --> 00:21:37.997
we're huge in Norway? What's
that all about? >> That was

00:21:37.997 --> 00:21:44.003
voted the best thing left in
lost and found. >> Every year we

00:21:46.438 --> 00:21:51.277
end up with a big -- it's yours?
Who does it belong to, render

00:21:51.277 --> 00:21:55.548
man? I think you just trolling
us. What we're going to do we're

00:21:55.548 --> 00:21:59.485
going to go through and give you
a little report from what

00:21:59.485 --> 00:22:02.688
happened at the networking
teams, some of the other teams,

00:22:02.688 --> 00:22:05.491
some of the contests, the
villages. Going to make some

00:22:05.491 --> 00:22:08.727
pretty cool announcements. But I
am going to tell you ahead of

00:22:08.727 --> 00:22:11.864
time, yes, we're back at this
hotel next year we're not

00:22:11.864 --> 00:22:17.670
masochist not changing hotels
next year. On DEF CON forms,

00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:20.105
we're looking for your feedback
for what worked, what didn't

00:22:20.105 --> 00:22:23.008
work. The stuff that was really
painful obviously we figured

00:22:23.008 --> 00:22:26.812
that out. I remember I was
speaking at the opening session

00:22:26.812 --> 00:22:30.749
I came out for the first talk,
first day, opened up the doors

00:22:30.749 --> 00:22:36.121
it was just packed with people
and I'm like, he's mad at me,

00:22:36.121 --> 00:22:40.292
he's mad at me. She's mad at me.
I could tell this is not

00:22:40.292 --> 00:22:43.395
working. Then by lunch time we
got a bunch of it sorted out and

00:22:43.395 --> 00:22:46.498
so, yeah, that stuff is obvious.
But all the non-obvious stuff

00:22:46.498 --> 00:22:49.134
really let us know like we
really want to try to improve

00:22:49.134 --> 00:22:55.474
it. Also, by show of hands who
thought having a theme was cool?

00:22:55.474 --> 00:22:58.510
We don't ever really announce
themes. You like the theme?

00:22:58.510 --> 00:23:03.015
Theme is okay? [Applause] I mean
we're doing a convention anyway

00:23:03.015 --> 00:23:07.119
we may as well have some
organizing principle, so next

00:23:07.119 --> 00:23:11.123
year we're running with a new
theme "Rise of the machines".

00:23:11.123 --> 00:23:17.129
Yeah! [Applause] One of the new
overlords is here next to me in

00:23:20.132 --> 00:23:23.369
the cyber-grand challenge box.
Just getting ready to look at

00:23:23.369 --> 00:23:27.573
it's new territory. Next year
we'll have more of those. So I

00:23:27.573 --> 00:23:32.044
figured it's pretty appropriate
next year. You can expect movies

00:23:32.044 --> 00:23:35.047
and short story contests and
imagery to be around. And

00:23:35.047 --> 00:23:41.620
badges. Think about the number
24. And think about "Rise of the

00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:45.924
machines" and you'll have really
cool idea on how to maybe if you

00:23:45.924 --> 00:23:48.527
are organizing a contest or
making art. I wanted to give

00:23:48.527 --> 00:23:53.365
that I heads up. Also give you
quick heads up if you like

00:23:53.365 --> 00:23:56.268
staying at the Paris or Bali's
any of the other hotels we

00:23:56.268 --> 00:24:02.007
already have registration open
for next year. That's online. If

00:24:02.007 --> 00:24:05.644
you go to the tab in the upper
left hand corner DEF CON 24, you

00:24:05.644 --> 00:24:09.281
can start grabbing a block or
getting rooms you want now. And

00:24:09.281 --> 00:24:12.518
we've never managed to do that
before it took us 23 years. So

00:24:12.518 --> 00:24:20.025
for those my administrative
announcements I want to move on

00:24:20.025 --> 00:24:22.628
to the first team that keeps us
all connected that's the

00:24:22.628 --> 00:24:26.532
infrastructure team. Or the the
NOC team. You'll see wearing on

00:24:26.532 --> 00:24:30.402
the back of the shirts we have
the teams. EFFFFN here

00:24:30.402 --> 00:24:34.106
represents the NOC team I'll
pass it off to him for making us

00:24:34.106 --> 00:24:40.112
-- helping us stay connected.
EFFFFN. [Applause] >> Hello DEF

00:24:42.581 --> 00:24:48.587
CON. Is everyone alive still? A
little bit? So, I have five

00:24:51.256 --> 00:24:54.326
minutes so let's do this very
quick, this slides will be

00:24:54.326 --> 00:24:58.230
online on the URL that we have
at the end of the presentation.

00:24:58.230 --> 00:25:05.037
What do we do? We keep you all
-- connected so the wired

00:25:05.037 --> 00:25:09.742
network for everything that you
see on the slide can barely see

00:25:09.742 --> 00:25:13.879
that, but you can see on your
computer later. The DCTV who

00:25:13.879 --> 00:25:18.050
watched on their hotel rooms in
Bally's. The video man and

00:25:22.087 --> 00:25:26.959
Morgan. And the wireless
infrastructure our ugly child of

00:25:26.959 --> 00:25:32.698
all the time. It worked. We did
a lot of planning as DT said

00:25:32.698 --> 00:25:36.468
it's always fun changing venues
especially for us. Having two

00:25:36.468 --> 00:25:40.706
hotels was very awesome. And it
worked out really well, the

00:25:40.706 --> 00:25:46.712
hotel staff was awesome. We had
a few concerns as you can see

00:25:49.248 --> 00:25:51.784
there, the DC-TV streaming to
both hotels was a little bit of

00:25:51.784 --> 00:25:59.291
a challenge but our team, so
that's good. Not everything goes

00:25:59.291 --> 00:26:04.863
as planned, right? We got some
new gear this year so we got

00:26:04.863 --> 00:26:10.869
some new access points, a little
faster, got more powerful

00:26:13.238 --> 00:26:17.176
controller to run everything
from there. And some new

00:26:17.176 --> 00:26:23.515
raspberry Pis for big shout out
for the sound of knowledge

00:26:23.515 --> 00:26:29.388
people. For actually being able
to put the slides, I don't know

00:26:29.388 --> 00:26:33.859
what's happening here. It's not
me. We're being Dos'd again.

00:26:33.859 --> 00:26:38.597
Upgrade is blue. Anyhow, again
shout out for sound of knowledge

00:26:38.597 --> 00:26:44.603
for putting the slides, when on
DC-TV you're not only looking at

00:26:50.909 --> 00:26:54.012
the speaker or speakers. I'm not
going to go through this. This

00:26:54.012 --> 00:26:59.952
is the timeline for the set up
since Monday. We got here, we'll

00:27:02.721 --> 00:27:09.561
be here for a week, trust me
it's fun. Challenges that we

00:27:09.561 --> 00:27:11.563
have is like mapping the boards,
all the connections right, we

00:27:11.563 --> 00:27:15.801
have a lot of V-Lans. That have
IOS and Windows instructions was

00:27:15.801 --> 00:27:20.906
enough for you. Sorry. Next year
we will -- including for Linux

00:27:20.906 --> 00:27:26.912
but if you run Linux and Wi-Fi
you have -- [ laughter ] And we

00:27:37.823 --> 00:27:41.193
obviously didn't get
requirements some time and we

00:27:41.193 --> 00:27:45.030
have to work through the
last-minute changes. More

00:27:45.030 --> 00:27:49.668
challenges, there's a lot of
those here. And when vendor area

00:27:49.668 --> 00:27:55.974
opens we get a lot of those. And
that's always awesome. Major

00:27:55.974 --> 00:27:59.244
issues that we have again, port
mapping, we plugged something in

00:27:59.244 --> 00:28:03.148
-- we expect people to see one
thing they see other things,

00:28:03.148 --> 00:28:09.087
thanks for letting us know so we
can fix it quickly. The debacle

00:28:09.087 --> 00:28:14.092
was fun. And hopefully it's
going to be fixed next year,

00:28:14.092 --> 00:28:18.530
it's not our fault. And we
couldn't get any of the devices

00:28:18.530 --> 00:28:24.469
to authenticate the server side
certificate. And there was

00:28:24.469 --> 00:28:28.307
another small glitch that I'll
talk about in a little bit.

00:28:28.307 --> 00:28:32.778
Numbers, not going to go through
this. You can download and see

00:28:32.778 --> 00:28:39.751
that. These are some key numbers
that we have, how many terabytes

00:28:39.751 --> 00:28:45.591
of data we streamed or you guys
downloaded or uploaded. But the

00:28:45.591 --> 00:28:49.861
little red thing there that's
when the Wi-Fi got very tired

00:28:49.861 --> 00:28:56.134
and we put it to sleep, right?
The Xanax and it went away but

00:28:56.134 --> 00:29:02.808
this morning it was up again. We
had a little issue there. And

00:29:02.808 --> 00:29:06.078
you guys are very creative. When
you pick your passwords for the

00:29:06.078 --> 00:29:12.084
Wi-Fi Reg these are the kind of
PG ones. More stats, you guys

00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:19.491
like graphs, stats, what kind of
devices we have. You can look

00:29:19.491 --> 00:29:24.863
this online. And one of the most
important things is give it up

00:29:24.863 --> 00:29:27.633
for my team these guys are
awesome. [ Applause ] They're

00:29:27.633 --> 00:29:34.272
here all week. I cannot see
anyone but if they're here,

00:29:34.272 --> 00:29:40.245
thank you. They're probably
working. And also thank Jeff,

00:29:40.245 --> 00:29:44.716
Russ. The Caesar staff, Encore
always helping us with the

00:29:44.716 --> 00:29:50.222
network drops and everything
else. Big shout out. If he

00:29:50.222 --> 00:29:57.396
couldn't fix wireless nobody
else could he was my default out

00:29:57.396 --> 00:30:02.234
there. Thanks thanks for all of
you for this year behaving as

00:30:02.234 --> 00:30:07.506
much as you could on the
network. Thank you. [Applause]

00:30:07.506 --> 00:30:13.512
>> All right. So, see if we can
get started here. I do want to

00:30:23.021 --> 00:30:26.358
take a minute thank all of the
departments that worked within

00:30:26.358 --> 00:30:31.763
DEF CON. It takes about 300
people to put that on, if you

00:30:31.763 --> 00:30:38.203
add up all the hours we put in
just at con it's about four

00:30:38.203 --> 00:30:41.940
years of full-time work, that's
just for this weekend. I can

00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:44.743
assure you I worked about that
much over this year with Jeff

00:30:44.743 --> 00:30:48.246
and Sheryl and the rest of the
team trying to get this planned

00:30:48.246 --> 00:30:51.283
throughout the year as well. So,
thank you to all of the

00:30:51.283 --> 00:30:54.519
departments, all of the Goons
all of the volunteers, all the

00:30:54.519 --> 00:30:58.457
contest POCs, the hotel,
everybody that really helped us

00:30:58.457 --> 00:31:01.259
out with. This I really
appreciate it. You made my life

00:31:01.259 --> 00:31:08.900
much easier this year.
[Applause] So, next call Agent X

00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:15.540
here for speakers. >> I'm going
to use that wireless mic. It is

00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:20.579
now. Quick. Own him. We had 218
speakers speak this year. 132

00:31:20.579 --> 00:31:27.886
talks. 28 hours of content all
compressed in. I'm abley

00:31:27.886 --> 00:31:33.892
assisted by 21 speaker Goons who
just work like 18 hours a day

00:31:44.436 --> 00:31:47.672
for me then party like rock
stars every night. We did

00:31:47.672 --> 00:31:52.177
something new this year, Nikita
organized workshops we had seven

00:31:52.177 --> 00:31:57.849
of them running for total of 24
workshops and 104 hours of

00:31:57.849 --> 00:32:01.920
workshops. People went in there
all day long and basically

00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:09.795
learned a ton of stuff. Who went
to workshops? >> Yeah! >> Do you

00:32:09.795 --> 00:32:11.797
want more workshops? [ Cheers
and applause ] So, yeah, that's

00:32:11.797 --> 00:32:18.904
the quick one. One of the things
I was enlightened to this year

00:32:18.904 --> 00:32:23.675
was our closed captioning system
is amazing. And you know, you're

00:32:23.675 --> 00:32:28.113
like, we feed them audio they
type really fast. No, they take

00:32:28.113 --> 00:32:32.317
last year's talks, they do
frequency analysis on the words

00:32:32.317 --> 00:32:36.988
so they know what we talk about
this year. Every year they do

00:32:36.988 --> 00:32:42.260
that. And they unlike the
speaker operations staff read

00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:45.297
the bio and know what the person
is going to talk about ahead of

00:32:45.297 --> 00:32:51.303
time so let's give it up for our
closed captioning people spread

00:32:58.510 --> 00:33:04.449
out all over the world.
[Applause] They're real. This is

00:33:10.155 --> 00:33:16.161
not a test. [ laughter ] >>
Thank you. [Applause] All right.

00:33:24.603 --> 00:33:28.440
So, one of the best parts of DEF
CON every year are the badges

00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:31.276
and all the hidden clues and
everything else around the

00:33:31.276 --> 00:33:34.913
conference that includes all of
our artwork, our floor stickers,

00:33:34.913 --> 00:33:38.750
our program, the badges,
everything at this conference is

00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:42.888
now been tied into his master
plan. Like to introduce lost boy

00:33:42.888 --> 00:33:47.425
to talk about his badges and his
badge challenge. >> We had

00:33:47.425 --> 00:33:55.033
really good year this year, I
was really happy with the

00:33:55.033 --> 00:33:58.336
camaraderie and participation,
actually seeing teams help out

00:33:58.336 --> 00:34:02.274
other teams. There were teams
that camped out before us even

00:34:02.274 --> 00:34:04.309
starting the conference this
year when I tweeted out a

00:34:04.309 --> 00:34:06.811
certain -- people actually --
where we were on the conference

00:34:06.811 --> 00:34:09.214
floor we were like on top of me
within the space of like a

00:34:09.214 --> 00:34:13.652
minute and a half. Russ looked
at me like they just already

00:34:13.652 --> 00:34:17.322
found you dude what's going on?
Another couple quick things

00:34:17.322 --> 00:34:20.258
looking at the lanyards thought
you might find it interesting

00:34:20.258 --> 00:34:23.895
that the lanyards were both
based on current literary works

00:34:23.895 --> 00:34:29.935
you had Edgar Allen Poe and
Charles Dodson. It looked like

00:34:29.935 --> 00:34:33.271
it was two separate ciphers but
it took all six lanyards to

00:34:33.271 --> 00:34:36.875
solve, it took 12 hours to get
just past the part that involved

00:34:36.875 --> 00:34:39.010
the lanyards. I get all
energetic. I get excited when I

00:34:39.010 --> 00:34:44.282
talk about this stuff. You
actually had to take and realize

00:34:44.282 --> 00:34:50.288
that each of the codes had a
similar number of pieces and you

00:34:53.325 --> 00:34:58.129
formed a core -- that mapped out
physically on a keyboard which

00:34:58.129 --> 00:35:02.100
letters it was that it popped
out. So it's actually coordinate

00:35:02.100 --> 00:35:05.870
system based on keyboard that's
what the -- side story that we

00:35:05.870 --> 00:35:10.842
didn't give out in the opening
ceremonies, people keep asking

00:35:10.842 --> 00:35:14.980
me about flying with these. As
an experiment, I put six of

00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:19.551
these in my bag, the uber badge,
the radioactive badge flew here

00:35:19.551 --> 00:35:23.788
with them. So as we're going
through the check out, TSA pulls

00:35:23.788 --> 00:35:26.825
my bag. I was like, here it goes
I'm going to have the story to

00:35:26.825 --> 00:35:31.529
tell at DEF CON but they pulled
me aside they go right past the

00:35:31.529 --> 00:35:35.900
six uber badges that are in my
bag two vials of uranium and

00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:42.941
other -- no, it didn't. Which is
-- maybe I shouldn't say that

00:35:42.941 --> 00:35:47.512
out loud. [ laughter ] One of
the vials actually had a sticker

00:35:47.512 --> 00:35:52.183
on it that said radioactive with
the little symbol on, they

00:35:52.183 --> 00:35:55.387
didn't. Reason they pulled me
aside is for part of the

00:35:55.387 --> 00:35:58.790
challenge this year they had to
-- you had your team had to

00:35:58.790 --> 00:36:03.461
present me with a $2 bill. And I
had gone around was collecting

00:36:03.461 --> 00:36:06.064
all of the $2 bills I could get
my hands on, I did that around

00:36:06.064 --> 00:36:10.669
the hotel as well, too, to try
to make it -- so the thing that

00:36:10.669 --> 00:36:12.871
they thought was interesting I
had this fat stack of cash

00:36:12.871 --> 00:36:15.206
because it was $2 bills it
looked like a whole lot of money

00:36:15.206 --> 00:36:18.043
when they pulled my bag out
they're like, radioactive,

00:36:18.043 --> 00:36:21.679
radioactive, okay, why do you
have this stack of money? [

00:36:26.184 --> 00:36:29.154
laughter ] So I just gave the
lady a dead pan look and I said,

00:36:29.154 --> 00:36:33.692
I'm going to Vegas. They said,
go ahead. Get through. I guess

00:36:33.692 --> 00:36:40.498
they had been collecting these,
you can see. I'd like to -- >>

00:36:40.498 --> 00:36:46.104
Tell them about the -- >> The
tritium vials. Those were in the

00:36:46.104 --> 00:36:51.242
other talk how you can actually
buy tritium in U.K. but you

00:36:51.242 --> 00:36:56.815
captain in the United States. I
found a guy in Singapore who had

00:36:56.815 --> 00:37:00.752
a machine for packaging coffee
and when I ordered the tritium

00:37:00.752 --> 00:37:03.354
vials from him they would ship
them over hidden inside packets

00:37:03.354 --> 00:37:07.325
of coffee. When they first -- I
was like, crap, I'm going to

00:37:07.325 --> 00:37:13.465
have to tell Jeff I wasted a
bunch of 1999 guy totally

00:37:13.465 --> 00:37:17.335
fleeced me on the Internet. But
he sent them, you rip open the

00:37:17.335 --> 00:37:21.806
coffee packet, there is all your
tritium. Good to the last drop,

00:37:21.806 --> 00:37:25.443
I guess. >> Not really sure what
that is all about but it's

00:37:25.443 --> 00:37:29.581
probably not legit. >> Wait,
sorry. That was hypothetical

00:37:29.581 --> 00:37:35.253
story. [ laughter ] That didn't
actually happen. Nor would I

00:37:35.253 --> 00:37:41.593
advocate that. Anyway -- [
laughter ] They're like, what is

00:37:41.593 --> 00:37:46.064
the URL of this individual? The
only other thing like I said you

00:37:46.064 --> 00:37:49.100
all heard me, this badge was my
homage to Richard fineman this

00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:55.106
year. [Applause] The only other
point that I'd really like to

00:38:01.446 --> 00:38:04.249
beat you over the head with is I
asked in opening ceremonies how

00:38:04.249 --> 00:38:10.555
many heard of -- I pronounced it
wrong, Wassinar that is sad and

00:38:10.555 --> 00:38:14.125
scary, the reason we did the
record this year now you all

00:38:14.125 --> 00:38:17.428
have a recording having to come
to DEF CON. Important for those

00:38:17.428 --> 00:38:23.067
of you that are security
researchers are hackers these

00:38:23.067 --> 00:38:25.603
laws are going to affect us
going forward, it's really

00:38:25.603 --> 00:38:28.273
important that you know all know
about that go home, look this

00:38:28.273 --> 00:38:31.042
up. The guys that are on the
winning team, where is the

00:38:31.042 --> 00:38:37.382
council of -- come on up. Send
someone up. Everyone is tired.

00:38:37.382 --> 00:38:41.352
These guys were like a
well-oiled machine. They had

00:38:41.352 --> 00:38:44.489
like covert operatives from
their team hiding in my room in

00:38:44.489 --> 00:38:47.725
the corner like acting all quiet
and listening to everything that

00:38:47.725 --> 00:38:51.229
was happening. So at one point I
actually turned to one of them I

00:38:51.229 --> 00:38:54.532
said, don't think I don't know
what you're doing. Because

00:38:54.532 --> 00:38:58.536
there's guy back there, every
time -- sees a phone come out

00:38:58.536 --> 00:39:02.273
somebody whispering into the
phone they had actually also set

00:39:02.273 --> 00:39:07.645
up an -- teams that set up an
auto -- had hacked one of the

00:39:07.645 --> 00:39:11.082
badges from previous years to
flash L.E.D. whenever I sent out

00:39:11.082 --> 00:39:14.652
a tweet they used a badge from
previous year as an alarm for

00:39:14.652 --> 00:39:17.922
whenever I tweeted out. Anyway,
I want to -- got very limited

00:39:17.922 --> 00:39:20.592
time if you have -- they
apparently they have pair of

00:39:20.592 --> 00:39:26.931
grifter shoes. Do you have a
spokesperson from your team that

00:39:26.931 --> 00:39:29.267
would like to say a few words
about what it was like going

00:39:29.267 --> 00:39:34.172
through this? Hurry, hurry,
doesn't matter. >> So there's a

00:39:34.172 --> 00:39:37.809
part when we were about half way
through the challenge you put up

00:39:37.809 --> 00:39:42.714
-- we thought it was part of the
challenge it had two coordinates

00:39:42.714 --> 00:39:45.984
on it. We went to one of those
coordinates and there was a land

00:39:45.984 --> 00:39:48.620
cable hanging from the ceiling
that wasn't connected to

00:39:48.620 --> 00:39:51.990
anything at one end. That's all
I'm going to say about that.

00:39:51.990 --> 00:39:55.326
[Laughter] >> To explain that a
little puzzle pieces actually

00:39:55.326 --> 00:40:02.166
was a sequence that they found
in the online integer sequence

00:40:02.166 --> 00:40:05.270
database that was submitted by
person who had the last name of

00:40:05.270 --> 00:40:11.276
herring. So, anyway, I'd like to
present the first black uber

00:40:14.712 --> 00:40:20.718
badge to the council of nine for
winning this challenge. [

00:40:26.624 --> 00:40:28.660
Applause ] So we're doing this
-- did you want to talk about

00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:30.662
this real quick. Going to do
actually a book next year we'll

00:40:30.662 --> 00:40:32.664
have much larger presentation.
But so we are actually

00:40:32.664 --> 00:40:35.199
registering all of the ubers
that go out from this point

00:40:35.199 --> 00:40:39.671
forward but I would just like to
say I encourage all of you every

00:40:39.671 --> 00:40:45.677
year to play with the puzzles. I
put very easy puzzles in as well

00:40:48.579 --> 00:40:50.948
as some very difficult you might
have noticed there were some in

00:40:50.948 --> 00:40:54.218
the program for when you're
bored standing in line. But also

00:40:54.218 --> 00:40:58.089
may be coding about half way
through. Play as much as you're

00:40:58.089 --> 00:41:01.426
comfortable. I encourage to you
talk to each other, get to know

00:41:01.426 --> 00:41:03.428
each other that's why I put
stuff on the lanyards so you

00:41:03.428 --> 00:41:06.698
have to talk to other people. My
favorite part about this year

00:41:06.698 --> 00:41:09.734
was the team that, some that
have team said, I was new last

00:41:09.734 --> 00:41:13.137
year, I met these guys, we
worked together and they stayed

00:41:13.137 --> 00:41:17.108
in contact all year long. And
that kind of stuff is what makes

00:41:17.108 --> 00:41:20.545
it worthwhile to me. I'd like to
thank Jeff and DT for letting me

00:41:20.545 --> 00:41:22.647
continue to do this because
apparently you guys like the

00:41:22.647 --> 00:41:28.653
abuse. [ Applause ] As you saw
this year was non-electronic

00:41:32.824 --> 00:41:35.727
badge we're going to continue
with our tick-tock cycle.

00:41:35.727 --> 00:41:41.733
Electronic badge next year. [
Cheers and applause ] That's it,

00:41:45.903 --> 00:41:51.542
thank you. >> I'm looking for
uranium vials under the podium

00:41:51.542 --> 00:41:57.548
here. Okay, so, one of the
things with DEF CON is that over

00:41:59.751 --> 00:42:04.355
time people come and go. They
get tired of doing certain

00:42:04.355 --> 00:42:08.025
things, if you have been here
more than 15 years you've seen

00:42:08.025 --> 00:42:11.396
me in about five different job
functions. >> Well, you retired

00:42:11.396 --> 00:42:15.433
last year I thought. >> Three
years. It has worked out well as

00:42:15.433 --> 00:42:19.771
you can all tell. So, these
aren't the only two people that

00:42:19.771 --> 00:42:22.573
are retiring. I know we point
them out specifically because

00:42:22.573 --> 00:42:26.911
they're department heads or
seconds, Agent X who has been

00:42:26.911 --> 00:42:31.549
running our speakers for well
over a decade. 15 years. [

00:42:31.549 --> 00:42:37.555
Applause ] He thought it was 15.
So, he's -- then we have flea,

00:42:41.192 --> 00:42:47.498
where's flea? He's at the Goon
swim. He has actually retired.

00:42:47.498 --> 00:42:50.835
Yeah, he's been here for a long
time so if we can give a round

00:42:50.835 --> 00:42:58.009
of applause for him as well. [
Applause ] So, we're going to

00:42:58.009 --> 00:43:02.647
give this uber badge to both of
them hoping that since leaving

00:43:02.647 --> 00:43:05.983
us hanging the radioactive
components will take care of

00:43:05.983 --> 00:43:11.989
them for us. Thank you. [
Applause ] Just to add on to

00:43:17.361 --> 00:43:20.898
that there are -- quite a few
other Goons that are either

00:43:20.898 --> 00:43:23.401
transitioning to other
departments, want to do

00:43:23.401 --> 00:43:27.038
something else or moving on
because you've beat the crap out

00:43:27.038 --> 00:43:31.242
of them for 20-plus years. So,
we've got this strategy that

00:43:31.242 --> 00:43:34.579
because we're so community
driven that you shouldn't do

00:43:34.579 --> 00:43:38.116
something you're not interested
in and people are creative they

00:43:38.116 --> 00:43:41.886
want to -- try to create an
environment at DEF CON where you

00:43:41.886 --> 00:43:45.122
come and you can do stuff, get
burned out, you leave, you can

00:43:45.122 --> 00:43:49.160
always come like family you can
rotate through. So, I am not

00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:52.230
convinced that we won't see the
last of X. Might see you again,

00:43:52.230 --> 00:43:58.169
maybe. And so that is the
environment we want to create.

00:43:58.169 --> 00:44:01.472
So, like you guys, sometimes you
come to DEF CON, sometimes you

00:44:01.472 --> 00:44:04.609
don't. But we really try to
create an awesome environment

00:44:04.609 --> 00:44:11.949
where you can come and do -- and
so, I think for the next slide

00:44:11.949 --> 00:44:18.356
want to talk about all --
grifter. Contest, who stepped up

00:44:18.356 --> 00:44:21.626
now, right, grifter used to do
one thing now grifter is running

00:44:21.626 --> 00:44:25.730
our contents events and villages
a new role for him he came in

00:44:25.730 --> 00:44:28.799
sort of at the last minute and
really did a fantastic job.

00:44:28.799 --> 00:44:34.805
Let's give round of applause to
grifter for stepping up. [

00:44:38.209 --> 00:44:43.281
Applause ] >> Somehow ended up
being the contests, villages,

00:44:43.281 --> 00:44:48.853
parties and the penthouses and
demo labs. >> No pressure, I've

00:44:48.853 --> 00:44:55.593
lost my mind. We were trying to
come up with something for the

00:44:55.593 --> 00:45:01.766
eye but we were saying pelvic.
Events. Labs. Anyway.

00:45:01.766 --> 00:45:05.369
Fundraisers. We have obviously
every year we have lot of people

00:45:05.369 --> 00:45:08.739
who put a lot of time and effort
into just doing something for

00:45:08.739 --> 00:45:13.411
others. These people stepped up
in that regard we have Eddie

00:45:15.646 --> 00:45:17.648
raised $2,590 for the EFS.
Awesome. [ Applause ] He raised

00:45:17.648 --> 00:45:25.189
$4,590 for hackers for charity.
[Applause] Then we also have Mo,

00:45:25.189 --> 00:45:31.195
there's quite a few Mohawks
running around out here, thanks

00:45:39.103 --> 00:45:45.109
to Ed and her crew. Mohawk the
EFF raised $2,434. [Applause]

00:45:48.412 --> 00:45:54.418
And for hackers for charity
additional. $995. What's that?

00:46:06.964 --> 00:46:12.570
1 --> 070. There's an additional
donation there. Then crash and

00:46:12.570 --> 00:46:16.140
compile while they're doing the
contest they raised money for

00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:22.146
the EFF as well they raised $700
for the EFF. One thing we also

00:46:27.385 --> 00:46:32.223
do the blood code is out there
again. There were 84 donations

00:46:32.223 --> 00:46:38.329
given. People out there giving
blood which is awesome.

00:46:38.329 --> 00:46:45.703
[Applause] And that's for the
match. Awesome guys. I have an

00:46:45.703 --> 00:46:53.077
interesting moment where some
attendees came up in the contest

00:46:53.077 --> 00:46:58.215
area they saw the blood code
stuff out there, if you saw

00:46:58.215 --> 00:47:01.886
everything they were like, holy
crap. Is that where people go

00:47:01.886 --> 00:47:07.091
and they get hurt, why are all
those people laying down? It's a

00:47:07.091 --> 00:47:12.496
blood bath in here, get out.
Then also just two quick things

00:47:12.496 --> 00:47:17.535
that we have hackers for
charity, we have a misprint

00:47:17.535 --> 00:47:22.473
badge that will be -- yes, only
one of these. And it has some

00:47:22.473 --> 00:47:26.344
artwork by Eddie Mize on here
after we're done with the

00:47:26.344 --> 00:47:29.914
closing ceremony we'll be
auctioning it off for hackers

00:47:29.914 --> 00:47:35.920
for charity. I'll show you
something. It's black. It's not

00:47:41.092 --> 00:47:47.865
a Black Badge. It just happens
to be a badge that's black.

00:47:47.865 --> 00:47:54.505
Anyway, then also I want to talk
about the EFF. At their booth

00:47:54.505 --> 00:47:57.074
with everybody raising money all
over the place, parties were

00:47:57.074 --> 00:48:01.946
raising money, different things,
they have raised over $80 --> 000

00:48:01.946 --> 00:48:07.017
and climbing this weekend. [
Applause ] So thank you all. We

00:48:07.017 --> 00:48:13.023
have somebody from the EFF here
just with a few quick comments.

00:48:17.862 --> 00:48:20.931
>> So, thanks everybody, thanks
for your support. Your support

00:48:20.931 --> 00:48:23.734
like yours let's us do our work,
this year we followed more than

00:48:23.734 --> 00:48:28.272
15 new lawsuits, major progress
and 11 more, something like

00:48:28.272 --> 00:48:31.208
amicus briefs all over the
country at every level that's

00:48:31.208 --> 00:48:34.979
tens of thousands of hours of
work. Just this week in -- told

00:48:34.979 --> 00:48:38.115
more than ten security
researchers representing,

00:48:38.115 --> 00:48:43.420
hopefully kept everybody out of
jail, so thanks a lot guys. DT

00:48:43.420 --> 00:48:47.558
and the Goons thanks so much and
to our supporters who raised

00:48:47.558 --> 00:48:50.194
money for us, waffle Con, wall
of sheep, mohawk, hacker

00:48:50.194 --> 00:48:54.165
jeapordy de. The DEF CON
parties, check marks and crash

00:48:54.165 --> 00:49:00.805
and compile. >> Thank you
everybody. >> And he lost his

00:49:00.805 --> 00:49:06.310
voice, thanks for that.
[Applause] Is that it? All

00:49:06.310 --> 00:49:12.316
right, so moving on. We have a
lot of villages around here, we

00:49:22.626 --> 00:49:26.330
had 12 villages this year all
different venues kicking off

00:49:26.330 --> 00:49:29.900
everywhere. Something we started
at DEF CON 14 it's just grown

00:49:29.900 --> 00:49:33.571
and grown. It's fantastic. We
always say you can make this con

00:49:33.571 --> 00:49:38.776
your own and these folks help us
do that please give round of

00:49:38.776 --> 00:49:40.845
applause to all of our villages
for helping. [ Applause ] So we

00:49:40.845 --> 00:49:45.115
have something for the
organizers, they don't have a

00:49:45.115 --> 00:49:50.888
lot of contests and things for
the villages but for the effort.

00:49:50.888 --> 00:49:54.725
We have really cool custom
T-shirt that we're going to give

00:49:54.725 --> 00:49:57.127
three of them to each one of the
villages. Agent, hand sewn and

00:49:57.127 --> 00:50:03.133
Agent X will be modeling it for
us. Give him a turn. I don't

00:50:15.212 --> 00:50:19.016
care if there's nothing on the
back. Turn anyway. >> So this is

00:50:19.016 --> 00:50:26.023
a limited edition shirt that Mar
made with a Daisy running, she

00:50:26.023 --> 00:50:31.328
hand stitched every shirt with
conductive thread that ties it

00:50:31.328 --> 00:50:34.632
all together and so we're going
to give the organizers of the

00:50:34.632 --> 00:50:38.335
village -- they can do with what
they want but relegally want to

00:50:38.335 --> 00:50:41.605
give them something special and
limited because they don't run

00:50:41.605 --> 00:50:44.642
contests, they never really get
recognized with Black Badges or

00:50:44.642 --> 00:50:48.045
anything. They really do awesome
work. We want to recognize the

00:50:48.045 --> 00:50:55.886
village organizers. [ Applause ]
>> If you are one of the

00:50:55.886 --> 00:50:59.790
organizers of the village,
please come over here to this

00:50:59.790 --> 00:51:07.398
side of the stage and we'll get
you guys set up. This slide

00:51:07.398 --> 00:51:11.168
says, other contests and events.
You can imagine what it's like

00:51:11.168 --> 00:51:15.973
for us going into planning this.
Like Jeff said, myself and

00:51:15.973 --> 00:51:22.179
Panadarro who is running --
there he is, he's waving giving

00:51:22.179 --> 00:51:26.483
out those shirts. We put quite a
number of hours, I didn't

00:51:26.483 --> 00:51:29.019
realize quite how many it would
be when I got the phone call

00:51:29.019 --> 00:51:35.025
from Jeff and Russ. It's all
good. This is all that stuff out

00:51:37.995 --> 00:51:43.801
there. Please, give a huge round
of applause to all the

00:51:43.801 --> 00:51:49.673
organizers of all this content.
[Applause] Also if you're

00:51:49.673 --> 00:51:56.146
interested in doing something
like running a contest, hit me

00:51:56.146 --> 00:52:02.586
up at grifter@Defcon.org. Once
we are moving forward on a

00:52:02.586 --> 00:52:08.592
contest we put together stuff on
the forums, get on DEF CON forum

00:52:11.362 --> 00:52:14.498
say this is what I want to do.
If I don't see it somebody will

00:52:14.498 --> 00:52:18.836
let me know and we'll get
planning. The sooner the better,

00:52:18.836 --> 00:52:21.472
the more activity the better.
Moving right along. Our uber

00:52:21.472 --> 00:52:27.478
contest. So we have a number of
badges up here, we're just going

00:52:34.385 --> 00:52:37.388
to start running through them.
We have our social engineering

00:52:37.388 --> 00:52:43.394
CTF guys up here? He's coming.
He's very sneaky. >> I came up

00:52:53.837 --> 00:53:01.478
the exit. >> These guys are
incredible. They grew this year,

00:53:01.478 --> 00:53:05.049
we gave them double the space,
we thought that that would be

00:53:05.049 --> 00:53:07.851
enough and it wasn't so we'll
have to discuss that for next

00:53:07.851 --> 00:53:10.988
year. But it was nuts. You guys
absolutely loved this village.

00:53:10.988 --> 00:53:15.726
Thank you. >> Thank you. I think
we need this room for next year,

00:53:15.726 --> 00:53:22.499
right? You think? It's been
great this year, I tell you the

00:53:22.499 --> 00:53:26.704
communication with grifter and
his team, if you guys had any

00:53:26.704 --> 00:53:29.273
that have it was really awesome.
They were just so on top of

00:53:29.273 --> 00:53:33.477
stuff. So thank you grifter.
Russ, Sheryl, reason we got

00:53:33.477 --> 00:53:37.915
stuff done so CTF we had first
and second place winner our

00:53:37.915 --> 00:53:43.587
second place winner was John
Sherpa came win over a thousand

00:53:43.587 --> 00:53:49.593
points between the report and
the calls. >> We're on the

00:53:52.930 --> 00:53:58.469
screen if you can see this one.
We made some really cool awards.

00:53:58.469 --> 00:54:04.408
I'm blocking it. Really cool.
For you, John. Whole bunch of

00:54:07.678 --> 00:54:11.181
cool hacking stuff. We had
Raytheon came in, I don't know

00:54:11.181 --> 00:54:14.384
if you're going to trust us,
Raytheon came in they gave us

00:54:14.384 --> 00:54:22.092
some devices and said, this is a
puzzle. If you would like to

00:54:22.092 --> 00:54:24.795
solve it you can plug it in your
computer I went I'm going to

00:54:24.795 --> 00:54:26.830
give it to the winners of the
contest. [ laughter ] They're

00:54:26.830 --> 00:54:34.271
both getting one. Thank you,
great job. Great job. Now we

00:54:34.271 --> 00:54:41.145
have real serious thing, guys,
this is the third year in a row

00:54:41.145 --> 00:54:47.151
a woman has won the SECTF. Third
year in a row! It's awesomely

00:54:51.054 --> 00:54:56.226
beautiful. Come up here, Jen.
You also get a clipboard full of

00:54:56.226 --> 00:54:58.829
awesome hacker stuff. You get a
Wi-Fi pineapple-like device.

00:54:58.829 --> 00:55:04.835
Bigger thing you can hit someone
with and hurt them. But now here

00:55:04.835 --> 00:55:12.209
is the -- look at this thing. If
from what I understand this

00:55:12.209 --> 00:55:15.379
thing is like radioactive I'd be
careful where you hang it on

00:55:15.379 --> 00:55:19.550
your body. Depending if you want
children or not but there you

00:55:19.550 --> 00:55:27.257
are. Congratulations. [ Applause
] Guys, next year we got to step

00:55:27.257 --> 00:55:34.898
it up. Got to step it up guys,
three years in a row, come on,

00:55:34.898 --> 00:55:41.104
you got to represent again. Back
to you grifty. Grifter. >>

00:55:41.104 --> 00:55:47.110
That's my pet name. All right.
Badge hacking. All right. Open

00:55:57.788 --> 00:56:03.727
CTF. >> Open CTF. No applause.
Open CTF. [ Applause ] >> Open

00:56:07.864 --> 00:56:13.870
CTF almost didn't happen this
year actually. Test test test.

00:56:23.847 --> 00:56:29.853
Close, can you hear me? Open CTF
almost didn't happen this year.

00:56:34.291 --> 00:56:41.331
I'd like to thank Sharelle and
Betty from DEF CON, mark from

00:56:41.331 --> 00:56:45.102
Bally's, and the rest of legit
for 11th hour save. [Applause]

00:56:45.102 --> 00:56:51.108
Open CTF is jeopardy style catch
the flag contest open to all DEF

00:56:58.148 --> 00:57:04.755
CON attendees. Out of over 150
registered teams, 61 teams

00:57:04.755 --> 00:57:07.157
scored this year. Unfortunately
we had to turn some people away

00:57:07.157 --> 00:57:12.029
due to lack of space, but we're
already working to make sure

00:57:12.029 --> 00:57:16.566
that doesn't happen next year
and our winners, best write up,

00:57:16.566 --> 00:57:22.572
mad hacks, hacksters and Los
scriptors. Third place was --

00:57:25.075 --> 00:57:31.081
with 1,960 points. Second place
was Neg 9 with 2,710 points. And

00:57:36.153 --> 00:57:40.857
first place was OX8F who stayed
up all night the first time to

00:57:40.857 --> 00:57:42.859
solve -- I'm sorry, 1500 points
worth of challenges although I

00:57:42.859 --> 00:57:46.463
do think he had some remote
help. And he had 3,410 points.

00:57:46.463 --> 00:57:52.469
For donating we're giving to our
winners. Keep what you kill.

00:58:33.076 --> 00:58:35.579
[Applause] >> We're switching it
up. I was trying to keep audio

00:58:35.579 --> 00:58:41.284
guys guessing. We have our next
one is Warlock games, you guys

00:58:41.284 --> 00:58:47.290
here? These guys a new
organizers this year. I'll let

00:58:50.260 --> 00:58:54.064
him tell you about the contest.
It was a lot of fun to have the

00:58:54.064 --> 00:58:57.634
contest area, there's always a
bunch of craziness going on. The

00:58:57.634 --> 00:59:03.407
guys who are competing seem to
be having a blast. >> Thank you

00:59:03.407 --> 00:59:07.344
very much. How many got chance
to play Warlock games this year?

00:59:07.344 --> 00:59:11.114
Couple of you. >> Nobody played?
>> Some up here. Fair enough.

00:59:11.114 --> 00:59:15.485
Warlock games is a capture --
challenge-based CT if you have

00:59:15.485 --> 00:59:20.023
things that go in, forensics,
digital forensics those kind of

00:59:20.023 --> 00:59:24.594
things, live malware analysis.
We always bring in a physical

00:59:24.594 --> 00:59:27.564
security aspect because it's not
all about the electronics and

00:59:27.564 --> 00:59:29.966
the security world. So you get
in there you get a chance to

00:59:29.966 --> 00:59:34.271
give it a roll padlocks, those
kind ever things. This year we

00:59:34.271 --> 00:59:37.307
also got chance to bring --
bring in some old school like

00:59:37.307 --> 00:59:39.709
street fighter and Pac Man and
what not kind of blast from the

00:59:39.709 --> 00:59:44.347
past. And that way we brought in
entire gaming experience, the

00:59:44.347 --> 00:59:50.620
hacking challenge and physical
security piece. So, we have two

00:59:50.620 --> 00:59:54.324
teams up here with us, our other
teams had to take off. And we

00:59:54.324 --> 00:59:58.361
always talk about that this is a
networking type event. Lot of

00:59:58.361 --> 01:00:01.731
you have been coming here for
many years you start to see the

01:00:01.731 --> 01:00:05.268
familiar faces of people that
you know. So, our second place

01:00:05.268 --> 01:00:11.007
team, I think they knew most --
I think they picked up two

01:00:11.007 --> 01:00:14.211
people while they were standing
in line. And they made up six

01:00:14.211 --> 01:00:17.214
numbers of their team other four
already knew each other I'm

01:00:17.214 --> 01:00:21.818
going to let them come up and
give few moments about their

01:00:21.818 --> 01:00:26.089
team and how they did the
challenge. >> Super nervous. We

01:00:26.089 --> 01:00:31.761
did great. I think we -- commend
these guys for doing great job.

01:00:31.761 --> 01:00:36.266
But it was fun, it was awesome,
you guys -- I'd like to give it

01:00:36.266 --> 01:00:38.635
up to the guys that host this
thing they do such a good job

01:00:38.635 --> 01:00:40.871
spending entire time doing it.
[Applause] Good job. Really good

01:00:40.871 --> 01:00:46.877
job. All of our team had to go
back to their normal lives but I

01:00:49.312 --> 01:00:54.217
had a great time I want to thank
everybody, myself, disco, Mega,

01:00:54.217 --> 01:01:00.156
Dick, molotov for their -- thank
you guys. [Applause] >> Okay. So

01:01:03.059 --> 01:01:07.197
our first place team they're
actually out of Samsung in south

01:01:07.197 --> 01:01:10.800
Korea we've had a few of their
team members compete with us in

01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:13.703
the past. I'm going to let them
come up and give a few seconds

01:01:13.703 --> 01:01:15.705
about their team and how they
accomplished some of their

01:01:15.705 --> 01:01:17.841
challenges. >> I really
appreciate Warlock. Thank you.

01:01:17.841 --> 01:01:19.843
[Applause] >> Short and simple.
Thank you very much. Thank you

01:01:19.843 --> 01:01:21.845
very much for that. We were told
kind of as our contest closed

01:01:21.845 --> 01:01:23.847
out that we were going to be
Black Badge event this year,

01:01:23.847 --> 01:01:29.853
it's kind of a humbling
experience, if you will for

01:01:44.334 --> 01:01:48.271
those that put contests together
to be acknowledged in this way.

01:01:48.271 --> 01:01:51.474
It does take a lot of time and
effort to put this together and

01:01:51.474 --> 01:01:55.912
to get the nod DEF CON staff and
from DT that we're there. I

01:01:55.912 --> 01:01:59.783
would also like to give shout
out to the Goon staff that was

01:01:59.783 --> 01:02:02.752
running that contest, they did
it and they were all over the

01:02:02.752 --> 01:02:05.655
place helping us out and they
were everywhere, so, good job to

01:02:05.655 --> 01:02:11.661
them and congratulations to
them. [ Applause ] >> We'd like

01:02:14.164 --> 01:02:19.069
to do is present the Black Badge
to our first place team from

01:02:19.069 --> 01:02:25.075
Samsung South Korea. [Applause]
>> Thanks very much, DEF CON,

01:02:30.180 --> 01:02:36.186
we'll see you next year.
[Applause] >> Hack fortress,

01:02:42.225 --> 01:02:48.231
where are you at? Heads up crash
and compile you're going to be

01:02:50.433 --> 01:02:56.439
next. You want to get ready. >>
Hey, what's up? First of all

01:02:59.109 --> 01:03:05.048
would the winning team come on
up stand up front real quick. Go

01:03:08.084 --> 01:03:11.454
around up front. Because we
don't want to get this shit on

01:03:11.454 --> 01:03:16.426
people up here. We're going to
get -- otherwise, our fifth year

01:03:16.426 --> 01:03:19.996
at DEF CON we appreciate, our
first year at black badge

01:03:19.996 --> 01:03:23.366
contest we're super excited
about it. For those that don't

01:03:23.366 --> 01:03:27.203
know hack fortress is a contest
that we run, normally bring out

01:03:27.203 --> 01:03:31.708
to DEF CON, 30 minute combined
team fortress 2 and hacking

01:03:31.708 --> 01:03:35.278
competition, winner moves on
usually until they play jolly

01:03:35.278 --> 01:03:38.348
and friends at the finals seems
to be the may it happens every

01:03:38.348 --> 01:03:43.620
year. This year the team is
called not ready for this, the

01:03:43.620 --> 01:03:47.157
genesis of the name was, bunch
of scabs got together signed up

01:03:47.157 --> 01:03:50.427
a team they didn't know each
other we need a team name, we're

01:03:50.427 --> 01:03:54.364
not readied for this. Sweet,
that's your team name. That's

01:03:54.364 --> 01:03:58.835
what they have been tagged with.
They ran the gamut, they had a

01:03:58.835 --> 01:04:02.238
ringer, there's a pro running
around here, actually a pro

01:04:02.238 --> 01:04:04.240
gamer, good job. Random chance
worked out for them very

01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:06.242
effectively. So, on the hack
side of this thing, the team

01:04:06.242 --> 01:04:11.047
fortress 2, who has played team
fortress 2, best video game in

01:04:11.047 --> 01:04:15.518
the world, Whoo! Fantastic game
engine that allows us to control

01:04:15.518 --> 01:04:19.189
the game environment. We can
make realtime manipulation of

01:04:19.189 --> 01:04:24.060
the game environment, and so
what we've done is then add a

01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:28.131
hacking element to it where
there is all these different

01:04:28.131 --> 01:04:31.768
challenges be it forensic,
database, physical, that kind of

01:04:31.768 --> 01:04:35.305
thing. And then what they get a
currency where they can buy

01:04:35.305 --> 01:04:38.241
basically different hints or
they can modify the game

01:04:38.241 --> 01:04:41.177
environment like set the other
team on fire, blind them, freeze

01:04:41.177 --> 01:04:44.280
them, do all that kind of stuff.
It's an interactive process

01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:47.884
between the hacking team and the
TF2 team where they can

01:04:47.884 --> 01:04:50.754
manipulate each other's
environment. Ongoing adventure

01:04:50.754 --> 01:04:54.157
and worked out pretty well
largely runs without too much

01:04:54.157 --> 01:04:58.328
hassle. What they have got
besides one Black Badge for the

01:04:58.328 --> 01:05:01.931
entire team, so if you could
clear out we're going to do like

01:05:01.931 --> 01:05:05.568
a hunger game style thing right
in the middle just let them all

01:05:05.568 --> 01:05:11.674
go at it we've got some shit and
see how it works out. I thought

01:05:11.674 --> 01:05:19.349
it was really funny, actually.
Anyway. What they also get is an

01:05:19.349 --> 01:05:25.388
opportunity to jump the line and
buy a ticket so that they don't

01:05:25.388 --> 01:05:27.757
have to try to hit F 5 for those
that know what that is. We are

01:05:27.757 --> 01:05:29.826
also shitty remembering who won.
So this year we're going to mark

01:05:29.826 --> 01:05:33.396
them all with spray paint so
that we can remember, they can

01:05:33.396 --> 01:05:37.333
show us their hands next year
we'll let them in get the

01:05:37.333 --> 01:05:41.271
ticket. If you can just line
uphold your hands up we'll spray

01:05:41.271 --> 01:05:44.908
all your hands. We'll chrome
them up real good. We also were

01:05:44.908 --> 01:05:49.345
able to raise about $255 for 8
bit processors for EFF. That's

01:05:49.345 --> 01:05:53.483
not a lie that's actually how
much we raised. We appreciate

01:05:53.483 --> 01:05:58.555
the bribes we got from all the
teams. >> Very "Mad Max". >> One

01:05:58.555 --> 01:06:02.458
of the challenges was spray
paint your face with silver, I

01:06:02.458 --> 01:06:06.396
can pick up the bumper from the
scavenger hunt, around the

01:06:06.396 --> 01:06:11.367
contest area screaming "Witness"
as loud as you could. It worked

01:06:11.367 --> 01:06:15.972
out very well. That's good look
for you, X. >> I live, I die, I

01:06:15.972 --> 01:06:19.709
live again! >> It turns out I
haven't seen the movie so I

01:06:19.709 --> 01:06:23.346
actually don't know -- why it's
funny. Anyway, I think that's

01:06:23.346 --> 01:06:28.318
it. Thank you very much. [
Applause ] Hand out the badge.

01:06:28.318 --> 01:06:34.557
Here we go. Actually I'm going
to buy Fiat because I like

01:06:34.557 --> 01:06:38.728
Bitcoin, I'm going to hand this
guy the Black Badge because this

01:06:38.728 --> 01:06:41.831
gentleman here took motivation
to actually commentate the video

01:06:41.831 --> 01:06:48.104
game for us. He's very good
eight, his name is -- Jaysup. >>

01:06:48.104 --> 01:06:52.108
Is that your God-given name. >>
That's not a handle just sounds

01:06:52.108 --> 01:06:56.446
like one. He was very good at
it. He did about five rounds for

01:06:56.446 --> 01:07:00.149
us, he's British it sounded even
better. We really appreciate the

01:07:00.149 --> 01:07:02.151
effort that he put in so
congratulations. [Applause] >>

01:07:02.151 --> 01:07:08.157
If I may take the pulpit for one
second be so bold not to bite

01:07:13.329 --> 01:07:19.335
the hand that feeds me, fewer
cameras next year maybe?

01:07:24.774 --> 01:07:28.278
[Applause] >> Somewhere like
where they're doing the closed

01:07:28.278 --> 01:07:34.450
captioning that person's fingers
are smoking. Motor mouth potter.

01:07:34.450 --> 01:07:40.456
Crash and compile. >> So, those
people that don't know

01:07:58.541 --> 01:08:01.844
combination of ACM -- and a
drinking game. So you get a

01:08:01.844 --> 01:08:05.448
problem, you solve it in code,
and if your code isn't viable

01:08:05.448 --> 01:08:11.454
you take a drink. If it doesn't
the right output you take a

01:08:14.324 --> 01:08:18.528
drink, if another team comes up
with the solution before you do,

01:08:18.528 --> 01:08:22.231
everyone else takes a drink.
Anyway, we've been running this

01:08:22.231 --> 01:08:26.402
for awhile and one of the things
we change this year is we wanted

01:08:26.402 --> 01:08:29.472
more participation. So we
actually ran our

01:08:29.472 --> 01:08:34.410
prequalification round at DEF
CON. So we had more teams, we

01:08:34.410 --> 01:08:37.981
had teams try out for this,
there's only nine spots

01:08:37.981 --> 01:08:41.651
available. So we had excellent
showing, everyone had a great

01:08:41.651 --> 01:08:47.657
time. Our winning team -- so
this is a basketball size, crash

01:08:52.795 --> 01:09:00.303
and compile trophy. This is
originally when we first started

01:09:00.303 --> 01:09:04.407
we had -- decided to program in
random program languages.

01:09:04.407 --> 01:09:08.311
Started out playing the game.
And what better way to pick

01:09:08.311 --> 01:09:14.317
something random than a giant
dice. So, the winner is -- our

01:09:19.022 --> 01:09:22.959
second place team was Frank
rules then third place was Meg

01:09:22.959 --> 01:09:29.832
9. [Applause] Like to present
the Black Badge.

01:09:29.832 --> 01:09:35.838
Congratulations. >> What was the
winning technique? >> the

01:09:38.207 --> 01:09:44.213
winning technique it was the
beer points. Thanks Crux, I'm

01:09:47.517 --> 01:09:51.087
missing others, team
distraction, you were way for

01:09:51.087 --> 01:09:53.122
fucking annoying than last year.
>> It's what we do. >> Thanks

01:09:53.122 --> 01:09:58.761
Ryan for bringing it home, I
couldn't read by the last

01:09:58.761 --> 01:10:04.534
problem set. We've been doing
Cons for ten-plus years. We did

01:10:04.534 --> 01:10:07.503
contests now the last three.
I've met ton of people in the

01:10:07.503 --> 01:10:09.672
last three years, get involved
in the contests, great way to

01:10:09.672 --> 01:10:15.678
meet people. Thanks. [Applause]
>> Thank you very much. All

01:10:23.686 --> 01:10:29.692
right. Next up. Scavenger hunt.
[ Cheers and applause ] Of

01:10:49.612 --> 01:10:55.618
course. Yeah! >> Hi, I'm Salem
with the scavenger hunt, if your

01:11:04.393 --> 01:11:08.431
DEF CON experience is slightly
weird, you're welcome. Or I'm

01:11:08.431 --> 01:11:14.837
sorry, one of the two. I have no
-- I have a bunch of stuff

01:11:14.837 --> 01:11:18.141
specifically for DT, a shirt.
One of our trophies. >>

01:11:18.141 --> 01:11:24.147
Excellent. >> One of our
challenges this year, last year

01:11:26.782 --> 01:11:31.220
we gave out floppy disks which
was a lot of fun because find

01:11:31.220 --> 01:11:35.825
out where to find a floppy
reader. This year we gave out

01:11:35.825 --> 01:11:42.765
VHS tapes. [ laughter ] The VHS
tape on the Scav list was worth

01:11:42.765 --> 01:11:48.204
20 points it had a lot of fun
stuff on it and really fun

01:11:48.204 --> 01:11:54.143
tie-ins with the gold of 23. We
got one specifically for Jeff.

01:11:54.143 --> 01:11:58.781
>> We will encode this make it
available to the public. >> of

01:11:58.781 --> 01:12:04.720
course,, on the list we had 220
possible items. The first place

01:12:09.559 --> 01:12:14.964
team turned in 104 items. Second
place team got 96 items. There

01:12:14.964 --> 01:12:18.434
was literally a two-point
difference between first and

01:12:18.434 --> 01:12:21.838
second place. And told -- held
out to eight items in that two

01:12:21.838 --> 01:12:29.212
points. Our second place team as
well did end up raising some

01:12:29.212 --> 01:12:34.584
money for the EFF. We ended up
getting $216 just for the EFF by

01:12:34.584 --> 01:12:40.489
one random Scav item, it was
great. >> Any live chickens? >>

01:12:40.489 --> 01:12:43.993
What's that? >> Any live
chickens this year? >> No, no

01:12:43.993 --> 01:12:47.330
live chickens no horse heads.
Because I didn't want to deal

01:12:47.330 --> 01:12:52.869
with them again. [ laughter ]
All right, so, before I call up

01:12:52.869 --> 01:12:57.106
my winning team. I can't do this
alone, I'm Salem, I can't do

01:12:57.106 --> 01:13:01.377
this. My team here is what makes
this happen on the end dual flip

01:13:01.377 --> 01:13:07.883
flop, Zora, evil Mofo these guy
make this happen so much harder

01:13:07.883 --> 01:13:13.389
than I do even though my face is
charge. This is my last year

01:13:13.389 --> 01:13:18.294
running this. I am giving my
badge to this guy. I'm making

01:13:18.294 --> 01:13:24.300
him be in charge of this from
now on. [ Applause ] All right.

01:13:28.905 --> 01:13:36.445
Third place. I have no idea if
you're here. >> Yeah! >> Don't

01:13:36.445 --> 01:13:39.181
bother coming up, go over there.
Go over there. Go over there.

01:13:39.181 --> 01:13:44.553
We'll meet you over there. Like
I said two-point difference

01:13:44.553 --> 01:13:51.060
between first and second place.
Second place team, the national

01:13:51.060 --> 01:13:58.634
shit posting agency. Our first
place team, our winners, grit

01:13:58.634 --> 01:14:04.573

times just sitting on the couch.
The contest and events team and

01:15:15.878 --> 01:15:19.615

01:15:52.681 --> 01:15:59.922
>> Get some beer while you're
doing this. Beer is good. >>

01:15:59.922 --> 01:16:04.193
Okay, hi, everybody, I'm grump,
bear we are the legitimate

01:16:04.193 --> 01:16:07.696
business syndicate this is our
third year running DEF CON's

01:16:07.696 --> 01:16:11.700
capture the flag. We would like
to thank DEF CON for having us

01:16:11.700 --> 01:16:15.871
back again. We want to thank all
the fans that come by the room

01:16:15.871 --> 01:16:19.175
throughout the weekend, it was
super rewarding to see the same

01:16:19.175 --> 01:16:22.044
people coming back again and
asking even better questions

01:16:22.044 --> 01:16:25.080
than they were before. We want
to thank the teams that played

01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:29.852
this year, everybody played with
honor and extreme skill. >> How

01:16:29.852 --> 01:16:35.424
many teams tried to qualify? >>
4 --> 000 people registered for our

01:16:35.424 --> 01:16:40.496
qualifying. 4 --> 000 teams
registered our qualifying event

01:16:40.496 --> 01:16:47.169
back in May. Ten people were
invited to come play here.

01:16:47.169 --> 01:16:52.808
Teams. >> Five other teams that
we prequalified through other

01:16:52.808 --> 01:16:59.448
CTFs give everyone a chance.
Highlights, Friday opened up

01:16:59.448 --> 01:17:03.519
with X86-64 binary. Later
standard 32X86 binary. Then we

01:17:03.519 --> 01:17:08.157
opened an embedded form the
CI20. And Friday night we had

01:17:08.157 --> 01:17:14.163
lightning round that we actually
ran on a nexus 9 which is as you

01:17:17.967 --> 01:17:22.271
know android which is arm 46.
Saturday for the first time in

01:17:22.271 --> 01:17:27.810
at least ten years we ran a
Windows 10 challenge on Windows

01:17:27.810 --> 01:17:31.647
10 station IoT core which is
running on Raspberry Pi. Also

01:17:36.485 --> 01:17:41.957
for the first time the DEF CON
CTF Saturday night which we took

01:17:41.957 --> 01:17:45.427
four of the best hackers in the
world we hooked up to their

01:17:45.427 --> 01:17:49.932
computers ran capture cards and
watched what they were doing for

01:17:49.932 --> 01:17:56.372
live hacking challenge. Check
out our that's going to be post

01:17:56.372 --> 01:18:02.311
processed released to the world
very soon. >> Cool. [Applause]

01:18:07.149 --> 01:18:11.153
Yeah. Not a super big surprise.
But PPP won that live CTF

01:18:11.153 --> 01:18:18.127
challenge. [Applause] So if you
guys check out our website

01:18:18.127 --> 01:18:24.133
pretty soon we're going to go
ahead put up a capture of the

01:18:27.369 --> 01:18:31.941
whole game running in fast speed
so you can watch the whole

01:18:31.941 --> 01:18:34.376
visualization. There is missiles
that jump across the screen it's

01:18:34.376 --> 01:18:40.115
really super cool. Okay. Now I'm
going to hand it over to the

01:18:40.115 --> 01:18:43.485
leader of legitimate business
syndicate is Gyno Phage and give

01:18:43.485 --> 01:18:49.491

01:19:22.491 --> 01:19:28.497
[Applause] And in first place a
first timer at the DEF CON

01:19:32.835 --> 01:19:38.841

01:20:24.953 --> 01:20:30.959
First of all thank you for the

01:20:48.510 --> 01:20:54.516
ever. We really enjoyed the CTF
we also thank all the other

01:20:58.854 --> 01:21:04.793
teams that competed with us. And
luckily we won this year, we are

01:21:06.795 --> 01:21:12.968
very happy. And -- secret

01:21:29.151 --> 01:21:35.157
challenge the second night.
Thank you so much. [Applause]

01:21:44.032 --> 01:21:47.636
We'll be here again. >> So the
winning team gets to come back

01:21:47.636 --> 01:21:51.206
to defend in the following year.
We're going to see Def Core next

01:21:51.206 --> 01:21:57.212
year. Thank you. >> Thank you so
much. >> Predict the future but

01:22:03.085 --> 01:22:09.491
on every uber badge there's a
Korean saying that says... Which

01:22:09.491 --> 01:22:15.497
means the Taffy Peddler can do
what he pleases. >> and now -- I

01:22:23.672 --> 01:22:27.142
have one final announcement
about capture the flag. Next

01:22:27.142 --> 01:22:31.246
year, the Thursday before DEF
CON, Darpa would like to show

01:22:31.246 --> 01:22:35.484
the world how far automated
program analysis has come.

01:22:35.484 --> 01:22:39.021
Through the Darpa cybergrand
challenge. In honor of next

01:22:39.021 --> 01:22:42.391
year's DEF CON theme "the rise
of the machines" we would like

01:22:42.391 --> 01:22:45.327
to have the winning computer
from Darpa cyber-grand challenge

01:22:45.327 --> 01:22:48.864
compete against best human
hackers in the world at the DEF

01:22:48.864 --> 01:22:54.870
CON 24 capture the flag. [
Cheers and applause ] >> Details

01:22:59.741 --> 01:23:04.980
will be available on our
website, legitbs.net soon. >> I

01:23:04.980 --> 01:23:10.986
remember the day the machines
took over. >> All right. That

01:23:15.457 --> 01:23:18.594
finishes it off for contests and
events. Thanks to everybody who

01:23:18.594 --> 01:23:23.398
played and all the organizers
again and now we'll turn it over

01:23:23.398 --> 01:23:29.171
to DT. >> So, this is the point
where I tell you the closing

01:23:29.171 --> 01:23:32.140
comments. Which I've already
told you at the beginning you

01:23:32.140 --> 01:23:37.579
see how I did that? So, what
we're doing is as usual every

01:23:37.579 --> 01:23:40.649
year, we'll do it faster this
year going to release -- two

01:23:40.649 --> 01:23:43.018
things. One we're going to
release all the video that we've

01:23:43.018 --> 01:23:48.523
captured with the captioning.
And, two, this year really what

01:23:48.523 --> 01:23:52.694
sort of DEF CON is composed of,
what we get to pass on to those

01:23:52.694 --> 01:23:57.099
people who aren't lucky enough
to be here, is all this video

01:23:57.099 --> 01:24:01.370
and the villages. And so this
year I really want to step that

01:24:01.370 --> 01:24:04.973
up and so we recorded a lot of
the speaking in the villages.

01:24:04.973 --> 01:24:09.378
Never done before. We almost --
you heard how many hours of

01:24:09.378 --> 01:24:12.581
speaking we had. We have almost
double that in all of the other

01:24:12.581 --> 01:24:16.184
villages. So we're going to be
releasing all the video that

01:24:16.184 --> 01:24:18.453
we've captured in all the
villages and all the official

01:24:18.453 --> 01:24:22.858
speaking tracks so that's going
to be a huge amount of data. The

01:24:22.858 --> 01:24:26.228
other thing I want to announce
which is not directly related to

01:24:26.228 --> 01:24:30.365
DEF CON but every year I do a
data duplication village. And

01:24:30.365 --> 01:24:32.768
the last two years I've been
collecting you a the videos from

01:24:32.768 --> 01:24:35.571
all the other hacking
conferences around the world,

01:24:35.571 --> 01:24:38.040
curating it, cleaning it up,
putting it in directory

01:24:38.040 --> 01:24:41.209
structure that's what you get if
you come to the data village

01:24:41.209 --> 01:24:47.916
it's about 5.5 terabytes right
now. And so, all of that data

01:24:47.916 --> 01:24:52.487
from all the other conventions
will be online as well in the

01:24:52.487 --> 01:24:55.357
coming months so I don't have to
do all this work release it just

01:24:55.357 --> 01:24:57.659
once. So in the next couple of
months you're going to see a

01:24:57.659 --> 01:25:00.829
huge data dump all the other
conventions I could find, all

01:25:00.829 --> 01:25:06.635
the speaking at Black Hat, and
at DEF CON and I'll release

01:25:06.635 --> 01:25:13.475
Black Hat data, too. [ Cheers
and applause ] Give me a beer.

01:25:13.475 --> 01:25:19.481
Bring me a beer. I got a new
beer. Full beer. Okay, new beer

01:25:22.451 --> 01:25:28.523
for drinking. I want -- hacker
jeopardy, Wyn Schwartauer won

01:25:28.523 --> 01:25:34.529
jeopardy this year. He didn't
fuck it up. I want to give shout

01:25:37.699 --> 01:25:45.440
out to little Roo. Give a shout
out to the hotel. Who sit, the

01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:48.143
-- mark and Christina from the
hotel for putting up with us in

01:25:48.143 --> 01:25:53.215
the first year. They were
amazing. I want to say that

01:25:53.215 --> 01:25:56.718
video channels for next year now
that we know the infrastructure

01:25:56.718 --> 01:26:02.824
will fix that. My point of it
all is that we're super proud to

01:26:02.824 --> 01:26:06.161
have the biggest conference
ever, we grew about 15% and

01:26:06.161 --> 01:26:08.864
we're super proud to have
captured more of it than ever to

01:26:08.864 --> 01:26:12.734
give it away to the world than
ever so with all that have said,

01:26:12.734 --> 01:26:15.504
this sounds like bullshit but
it's true, DEF CON has become

01:26:15.504 --> 01:26:19.374
what we make of it and this year
I think we've made a fantastic

01:26:19.374 --> 01:26:23.211
conference. So, thank you so
much. We'll be around. I'm

01:26:23.211 --> 01:26:25.380
really looking forward to seeing
you next year, get on the forums

01:26:25.380 --> 01:26:28.784
and give us feedback. With that
I'm going to officially close

01:26:28.784 --> 01:26:34.790
DEF CON 23. >> Thank you
everyone! [ Cheers and applause

01:26:40.395 --> 01:26:42.397
