00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.006
There it was again. This must be
some kind of prophetic truth,

00:00:11.512 --> 00:00:17.851
masked in coincidence certainly
but couldn't be. No these were

00:00:17.851 --> 00:00:21.021
not imagined patterns of the
mind seeking to connect

00:00:21.021 --> 00:00:27.828
accidental thoughts of blurred
lines, this was something real.

00:00:27.828 --> 00:00:34.067
Something elegant in its
simplicity yet dangerous in its

00:00:34.067 --> 00:00:37.437
enigmatic complexity. Deniable
in all its obscure

00:00:37.437 --> 00:00:43.443
imperfections. Could everyone
else be so blind? Or were there

00:00:45.545 --> 00:00:50.117
others who observed this covert
conspicuousness. Able to

00:00:50.117 --> 00:00:53.987
untangle this perplexity.
Understood this cipher that

00:00:53.987 --> 00:00:59.993
surrounds this key. This 23. >>
Well, good morning. I'm glad

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.124
you're here early at Def Con.
This is my first time speaking

00:01:31.124 --> 00:01:35.762
here so I'm glad to be here
myself being here with you guys.

00:01:38.265 --> 00:01:42.336
So let's get on with this. This
track, this talk is about

00:01:42.336 --> 00:01:48.141
network security monitoring for
industrial control systems. A

00:01:48.141 --> 00:01:52.446
little bit about me. My name is
Chris Sistrunk. I'm a registered

00:01:52.446 --> 00:01:56.149
professional engineered. I used
to work for a company called

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:02.089
Entergy for about almost 12
years. I was involved with

00:02:06.426 --> 00:02:11.498
project robust where I was doing
protocol fuzzing and some other

00:02:11.498 --> 00:02:17.371
protocols as well. Now I work at
Mandiant as a senior ICS

00:02:17.371 --> 00:02:22.876
security. Last year at Def Con I
helped bring the ICS village

00:02:22.876 --> 00:02:27.748
here. So we're back again. Real
proud about that. And I also

00:02:27.748 --> 00:02:32.953
run, besides Jackson. And I also
love network security

00:02:32.953 --> 00:02:39.926
monitoring. So what happens when
you use N map or fuzzer on an

00:02:39.926 --> 00:02:45.932
industrial control system? ICS
is vulnerable, but why haven't

00:02:53.273 --> 00:03:00.247
we seen more attacks? Perhaps
we're not looking. If your ICS

00:03:00.247 --> 00:03:03.984
is breached today, would you
know about it? Could you tell if

00:03:03.984 --> 00:03:09.423
it was just commodity malware or
was it a targeted attack or even

00:03:09.423 --> 00:03:13.727
just a misconfiguration? I'll
show you the tools that you need

00:03:13.727 --> 00:03:17.164
to hunt for on your control
systems. I'll show you some

00:03:17.164 --> 00:03:21.068
real-world examples on how to
use the tools, and finally I'll

00:03:21.068 --> 00:03:23.270
give you some nuggets to take
back so you can do this

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:29.276
yourself. The reasons we don't
see more of these attacks. We

00:03:34.915 --> 00:03:39.386
have intent, or the lack thereof
where we just don't have enough

00:03:39.386 --> 00:03:43.957
ICS breach and attack data to
fully understand attackers that

00:03:43.957 --> 00:03:49.196
target control systems, and the
second is visibility. We have a

00:03:49.196 --> 00:03:53.767
lack of visibility of monitoring
control systems. We have lots of

00:03:53.767 --> 00:03:57.737
monitoring of IT systems, but
doing network security

00:03:57.737 --> 00:04:03.610
monitoring and control systems
is generally limited. Let's talk

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:08.715
about some of the intent. Since
we don't have very much data,

00:04:08.715 --> 00:04:14.154
like some examples are Marucci
shire in Australia, Stuxnet and

00:04:14.154 --> 00:04:19.259
lately the German steel plant
attacks. Why are they different?

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:23.130
It's a who, not a what. It's
professional, organized,

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:28.869
well-funded. For the big things
there could be disgruntled

00:04:28.869 --> 00:04:35.876
employees in another way, if you
kick them out, they will return.

00:04:35.876 --> 00:04:40.180
Just like the shark is the top
predator, they come back for the

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:44.651
seals that don't have much
protection. We don't have

00:04:44.651 --> 00:04:49.623
visibility. See no evil. There
may be someone from IT looking

00:04:49.623 --> 00:04:52.526
at the enterprise side of the
network, but most businesses

00:04:52.526 --> 00:04:55.595
don't regularly look at traffic
patterns and logs in the control

00:04:55.595 --> 00:05:00.167
system network, even if they're
available. ICS network alerts

00:05:00.167 --> 00:05:07.174
most likely aren't tied into a
company's operations center. So

00:05:07.174 --> 00:05:11.645
what happens when the FBI shows
up at your door? That should not

00:05:11.645 --> 00:05:19.052
be the way that you detect
attacks. I did some research on

00:05:19.052 --> 00:05:24.291
the publicly known control
system vulnerabilities. And from

00:05:24.291 --> 00:05:30.297
2001 until 2014 there were 949
known publicly -- 342 of those

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:39.806
were exploits, so they made it
-- those packs and three of

00:05:44.244 --> 00:05:51.084
those were malware. The trends
going up is when Stuxnet. After

00:05:51.084 --> 00:05:57.457
Stuxnet happened, people are
starting to look for

00:05:57.457 --> 00:05:59.993
vulnerabilities in control
systems and the things are

00:05:59.993 --> 00:06:05.232
there. There's over 1,100 now in
my last count. I'll be updating

00:06:05.232 --> 00:06:12.372
this slide later this year. If
your ICS gets hacked you can't

00:06:12.372 --> 00:06:18.812
make gadgets or water or
electricity or hammers or cars

00:06:18.812 --> 00:06:25.418
or medicine anymore. It's
critical to our way of life. So

00:06:25.418 --> 00:06:29.422
we've got to protect it. Now
what? We have more government

00:06:29.422 --> 00:06:32.759
security regulations. We have
ICS security is still lagging

00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:38.765
behind IT security. Any time you
scan a device it's in a control

00:06:44.104 --> 00:06:50.110
system, it doesn't have -- to
deal with it. And breaches are

00:06:53.313 --> 00:06:57.217
inevitable. Today we know this,
attacks aren't stopping. They're

00:06:57.217 --> 00:06:59.853
happening in every sector,
including industrial control

00:06:59.853 --> 00:07:05.992
systems. Managements asking
could we be hacked? Maybe they

00:07:05.992 --> 00:07:10.130
are, they should be asking that.
What can we do to get ahead of

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:15.068
this? The answer, I believe, is
network security monitoring, or

00:07:15.068 --> 00:07:18.838
one of the answers. If you don't
know what network security

00:07:18.838 --> 00:07:21.141
monitoring is, this is from the
practice of network security

00:07:21.141 --> 00:07:27.147
monitoring by Richard Bejtlich.
It was invented in 1990, but it

00:07:41.394 --> 00:07:44.497
really started, I think, kind of
with Cliff Stoll and The

00:07:44.497 --> 00:07:48.201
Cuckoo's Egg. If you haven't
read this book, and you're in

00:07:48.201 --> 00:07:54.040
control systems, go get it and
read it. It's very important.

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:59.646
The things they did in 1986 and
1988 and 1990 are still

00:07:59.646 --> 00:08:05.585
applicable today. The network
security monitor in 1990, and

00:08:12.192 --> 00:08:16.730
net ranger, real secure, snort
and others came out and the

00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:23.603
formal definition came out in
2002 with Richard Bejtlich. NSM

00:08:23.603 --> 00:08:25.972
has been around for almost 30
years and has a proven track

00:08:25.972 --> 00:08:31.978
record. Stoll dug into an error
and discovered a hacker in their

00:08:35.115 --> 00:08:39.686
system. The first documented
case major case of catching an

00:08:39.686 --> 00:08:46.960
attacker, of the 80 systems that
the hunter reached, only two of

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:50.997
the system owners noticed.
Because they weren't looking.

00:08:50.997 --> 00:08:55.668
Only two looked. So how can we
look? Before we need to look, we

00:08:55.668 --> 00:08:59.506
need to have one person to watch
and hunt, kind of like Cliff

00:08:59.506 --> 00:09:03.009
Stoll did. And we also have to
have the right tools to collect

00:09:03.009 --> 00:09:09.015
and analyze the data. A security
expert says NSM and hunting are

00:09:11.284 --> 00:09:15.288
two sides of the same coin.
Let's talk about the NSM cycle,

00:09:15.288 --> 00:09:22.195
the collection phase, the
detection phase and analysis.

00:09:22.195 --> 00:09:28.201
And it just keeps going around
and around. To make NSM work,

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:32.705
you have to have both sides of
the coin. Instrumentation to

00:09:32.705 --> 00:09:39.345
collect the data and the network
and at least one person to

00:09:39.345 --> 00:09:43.550
analyze the data to hunt for
evil. It requires people and

00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:46.753
propers not just technology. A
lot of people these days focus

00:09:46.753 --> 00:09:51.858
on buying the latest blinky
thing, right? But we know that

00:09:51.858 --> 00:09:53.860
really resourceful and they can
get around those blinky things.

00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:55.862
So you have to have a
resourceful human on the back

00:09:55.862 --> 00:10:01.868
end defending your networks. So
let's look at the methods of

00:10:04.437 --> 00:10:11.511
monitoring. We have to have a
network tap. If you don't know

00:10:11.511 --> 00:10:16.249
what a network tap is, it just
allows you to physically put a

00:10:16.249 --> 00:10:21.020
network device to capture all
your data, or you can use a spam

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:27.026
port off of a router or switch
that will dump all of the packet

00:10:27.026 --> 00:10:32.866
capture to a device that you
want to collect. A center will

00:10:32.866 --> 00:10:40.540
have a host network interface,
can also collect this data like

00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:45.411
TCB dump or whatever and you
have a zero port or you use

00:10:45.411 --> 00:10:49.516
printers to print out the 9600
baud traffic or whatever it was,

00:10:49.516 --> 00:10:51.518
which still today in many
control systems still have sero

00:10:51.518 --> 00:10:53.520
networks but knew we can use
terminal servers that do full

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:55.522
port capture with port
mirroring. There are seven types

00:10:55.522 --> 00:10:57.524
of network security monitoring
data. Full content data, which

00:10:57.524 --> 00:11:02.195
is unfiltered collection of
packets. So it's the entire

00:11:02.195 --> 00:11:08.201
phone conversation. You have
extracted content, files, web

00:11:12.839 --> 00:11:18.845
pages, data streams, firm ware.
Session data is like the phone

00:11:28.688 --> 00:11:34.928
call list on your phone bill. So
you have your to, who is the

00:11:34.928 --> 00:11:38.598
originator of the call and for
how long, things like that.

00:11:38.598 --> 00:11:43.603
Transaction data is transmit and
receives, statistical data, you

00:11:43.603 --> 00:11:51.544
can analyze when the data occurs
during the day or when someone

00:11:51.544 --> 00:11:55.348
logs in at a certain time, and
you can do analysis that way.

00:11:55.348 --> 00:12:01.354
Metadata is who owns this IP
address or where other data

00:12:01.354 --> 00:12:04.824
about data and the last is
triggers from IDS tools like

00:12:04.824 --> 00:12:10.830
snort or bro. And Richard
Bejtlich's book, he says IT

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:16.903
networks have difficulties for
network security monitoring,

00:12:16.903 --> 00:12:21.040
encrypted networks, wide spread
network access translation,

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:27.046
mobile devices, extreme traffic
volume, so if you have traffic

00:12:31.184 --> 00:12:36.289
blowing up near all your
bandwidth, or privacy concerns

00:12:36.289 --> 00:12:41.628
if you have other countries that
don't allow encryption. This is

00:12:41.628 --> 00:12:44.330
perfect for control systems,
because we don't have any of

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:50.336
that. There's no encryption.
It's very static. ICS devices

00:12:52.438 --> 00:12:55.441
aren't mobile. You just don't
have mobile devices, really.

00:12:55.441 --> 00:12:58.411
Substations don't move. And
devices within substations don't

00:12:58.411 --> 00:13:02.215
move. And you have low
bandwidth. Good old 1200 baud,

00:13:02.215 --> 00:13:08.221
right? And no privacy concerns
since the ICS network is private

00:13:11.224 --> 00:13:17.597
to that company. Here's an
example control system that has

00:13:17.597 --> 00:13:21.701
segmentation. Some that we
encounter in the real world are

00:13:21.701 --> 00:13:26.039
flat but this one actually has
some segmentation. So woo have

00:13:26.039 --> 00:13:30.610
enterprise network up at the
top, have a demilitarized zone

00:13:30.610 --> 00:13:34.847
in the middle or we might have a
historian or a web interface

00:13:34.847 --> 00:13:40.486
where people on the network can
get to the control system data

00:13:40.486 --> 00:13:43.690
without actually getting into
the control system itself. Then

00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:49.295
you have the plan and control
where you have your HMIs, your

00:13:49.295 --> 00:13:55.668
control system servers, your pie
historian and the lower level is

00:13:55.668 --> 00:14:02.975
the PLCs, the RTUs, the centers,
all those things. Each control

00:14:02.975 --> 00:14:05.311
system is different, but this is
the model I'm going to use for

00:14:05.311 --> 00:14:10.116
this talk. In the attack you
have the cyber kill chain,

00:14:10.116 --> 00:14:12.985
everybody should be aware of
this. You have the attacker gets

00:14:12.985 --> 00:14:19.092
in, tries to find out where he
can get in, deeper pivot or do

00:14:19.092 --> 00:14:25.298
whatever attack he wants to do
and get out of there. And a lot

00:14:25.298 --> 00:14:28.768
of these days malware is not
even used. They're using stolen

00:14:28.768 --> 00:14:32.505
accounts. So how can we use
network security monitoring to

00:14:32.505 --> 00:14:36.442
look at accounts? It's pretty
easy to do and I'll show you how

00:14:36.442 --> 00:14:43.683
to do that. If we have attackers
attacking our control systems,

00:14:43.683 --> 00:14:46.519
let's envision some of these.
Since we don't have a lot of

00:14:46.519 --> 00:14:52.825
data, we can gather some of
these things that happen on IT

00:14:52.825 --> 00:14:59.031
networks and envision the
control systems. Let's say he

00:14:59.031 --> 00:15:03.836
might want to damage equipment.
Or steal process information,

00:15:03.836 --> 00:15:08.274
steal a formula the industrial
process of the chemicals and how

00:15:08.274 --> 00:15:12.578
they're mixed or cause a safety
or compliance issue to cause a

00:15:12.578 --> 00:15:16.983
plant to shut down. And it
actually doesn't affect the

00:15:16.983 --> 00:15:20.253
actual operation of the plant.
Just you can't report your

00:15:20.253 --> 00:15:24.424
emissions to the EPA for some
reason. Or let's pivot from a

00:15:24.424 --> 00:15:30.363
vulnerable control system up to
the enterprise. That's happened

00:15:30.363 --> 00:15:35.568
before. So the attacker either
has to get physical access or

00:15:35.568 --> 00:15:39.539
remote access through like a
stolen engineering work station

00:15:39.539 --> 00:15:44.811
or a laptop or compromise a
client machine that has access.

00:15:47.647 --> 00:15:53.786
Let's do some network security
monitoring. Mike Asante, if you

00:15:53.786 --> 00:15:56.722
don't know who he is, he's
really important in helping

00:15:56.722 --> 00:16:02.361
spread the word about control
systems security. You have to

00:16:02.361 --> 00:16:08.367
have an inquisitive mind, you
need to have -- We need to

00:16:15.641 --> 00:16:21.647
protect those too. So what does
collection look like in our

00:16:24.617 --> 00:16:29.322
example control system? We have
standard enterprise collectors

00:16:29.322 --> 00:16:35.962
like sys log and other -- just
imagine any IT collector or

00:16:35.962 --> 00:16:40.733
agents or things like that. You
could put those in your DMZ and

00:16:40.733 --> 00:16:44.370
most DMZ environments could be
in a data center, in standard

00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:47.707
equipment. So that's a
no-brainer there. You have

00:16:47.707 --> 00:16:52.278
network sensors that are doing
full P-caps and capturing

00:16:52.278 --> 00:16:56.148
session data. And if there's a
firewall we can collect the

00:16:56.148 --> 00:17:02.355
firewall logs. On the control
level that's where we have to be

00:17:02.355 --> 00:17:07.093
a little more careful than what
we have available to us. We can

00:17:07.093 --> 00:17:12.865
capture most HMIs are on windows
systems. We can collect SMNP

00:17:12.865 --> 00:17:18.871
traffic like percent CPU
loading. And alerts from any

00:17:25.278 --> 00:17:29.916
agents that might be installed.
From the PLCs they might have

00:17:29.916 --> 00:17:35.254
logs only. So let's talk about
that in relation to hunting. So

00:17:35.254 --> 00:17:40.760
looking at logs is like looking
at tracks in the mud. You can

00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:44.297
see the different animals and
the different paths they're

00:17:44.297 --> 00:17:50.336
taking. Or you can put a camera
to see where they're walking on

00:17:50.336 --> 00:17:55.741
your property or where ever
you're hunting, for instance. If

00:17:55.741 --> 00:17:59.912
you like to hunt. What we would
look for in an industrial

00:17:59.912 --> 00:18:04.650
control system? Well, since it's
well known and static, we should

00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:09.255
be able to get a baseline of
what's happening. A talks to B,

00:18:09.255 --> 00:18:14.126
but machine B never talks to C.
And then you have your top

00:18:14.126 --> 00:18:17.863
talkers. You may have a web cam
that's looking at the security

00:18:17.863 --> 00:18:22.234
gate of the power plant, and
that's always going all the time

00:18:22.234 --> 00:18:26.272
and it's a high bandwidth
traffic and there's some devices

00:18:26.272 --> 00:18:30.176
that may only report two or
three times a day to let's say

00:18:30.176 --> 00:18:32.511
an external source. Unexpected
connectivity to, say, the event

00:18:32.511 --> 00:18:34.513
net or business network or an
attempted connection. You can

00:18:34.513 --> 00:18:40.519
also look for known malicious IP
addresses or domains. There's

00:18:47.727 --> 00:18:53.599
known beaconing malware from IT
investigations. Log in using

00:18:53.599 --> 00:18:59.271
default accounts. Many accounts
and control systems you can't

00:18:59.271 --> 00:19:03.709
change them and there's backdoor
passwords. They look for the

00:19:03.709 --> 00:19:08.047
admin accounts to log in and
have a warning every time that

00:19:08.047 --> 00:19:13.486
happens. Unusual events, error
messages that could correlate to

00:19:13.486 --> 00:19:20.059
vulnerabilities. Updates. A lot
of these things we could easily

00:19:20.059 --> 00:19:24.997
look for on the control system.
The detection phase of network

00:19:24.997 --> 00:19:29.902
security monitoring, an analyst
should look for these anomalies

00:19:29.902 --> 00:19:35.541
and try to categorize those and
escalate them to incident

00:19:35.541 --> 00:19:40.546
response. So we'll look at IDS
alerts that we've learn. So a

00:19:40.546 --> 00:19:45.184
snort rule that says this
payload is being attacked,

00:19:45.184 --> 00:19:49.088
attacking our control system, or
log in with the default

00:19:49.088 --> 00:19:55.027
credentials, high bandwidth
that's way larger than normal,

00:19:55.027 --> 00:19:58.831
devices going on and offline or
behaving strangely, like they

00:19:58.831 --> 00:20:03.402
are fanning goats. Need to look
for those. Or a door alarm that

00:20:03.402 --> 00:20:10.276
is coming in when no one is
checking in in the steps

00:20:10.276 --> 00:20:13.746
station. Going back to the
hunting metaphor, we see tracks,

00:20:13.746 --> 00:20:20.453
but we found a wolf track. It's
a whole lot bigger than a dog

00:20:20.453 --> 00:20:25.758
print. And we look in our web
cam and we see strange things

00:20:25.758 --> 00:20:30.196
happening there. Someone is
eating all our corn that we're

00:20:30.196 --> 00:20:37.069
supposed to be feeding to the
animals that we're hunting. The

00:20:37.069 --> 00:20:40.639
last phase is the analysis
phase, where we're hunting and

00:20:40.639 --> 00:20:44.343
finding evil. So this is where
we'll see the application

00:20:44.343 --> 00:20:48.380
exploitation, third-party
connection, so someone may be

00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:52.618
using ICCP traffic to another
control system and someone is

00:20:52.618 --> 00:20:58.457
coming in that way. Or someone
is doing ICS specific protocol

00:20:58.457 --> 00:21:03.596
attacks, and that's what we're
trying to teach down in the ICS

00:21:03.596 --> 00:21:09.502
village. We're teaching you how
to do these things. And how to

00:21:09.502 --> 00:21:14.773
use those protocols but also how
to watch on how to defend them.

00:21:14.773 --> 00:21:17.777
You can also see things like
what happened with Stuxnet

00:21:17.777 --> 00:21:23.582
calling back to strange DNS
requests like totalfootball.com

00:21:23.582 --> 00:21:28.387
or freesexycelebs. Why would you
even see that happening on a

00:21:28.387 --> 00:21:33.592
control system? So this is a
really great picture I found on

00:21:33.592 --> 00:21:40.966
the Internet. Say we're looking
at our logs and we see our

00:21:40.966 --> 00:21:46.138
little bunny rabbit hopping
along and swoop, an owl comes

00:21:46.138 --> 00:21:51.544
down and attacks the poor little
bunny. And on our web cam we see

00:21:51.544 --> 00:21:56.682
that he's flying off with -- >>
Just step in with an episode of

00:21:56.682 --> 00:22:04.557
wild kingdom? >> Yeah. Welcome
to wild kingdom. So if you look

00:22:04.557 --> 00:22:07.960
for anomalies, you might find
them. Did you know that

00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:14.099
squirrels attack deer?
(Laughter.) If you don't look at

00:22:14.099 --> 00:22:18.204
your control systems, you won't
see this kind of crap happening.

00:22:18.204 --> 00:22:24.210
(Laughter.) So let's do some
real-world examples of network

00:22:28.113 --> 00:22:31.417
security monitoring using free
tools, not a $3 million SIM.

00:22:34.053 --> 00:22:38.457
Have you ever heard of security
onion? Okay, great. This is for

00:22:38.457 --> 00:22:44.463
you. >> May I interrupt? >> You
may. >> So, welcome to Def Con!

00:22:51.036 --> 00:22:57.042
First day. (Applause.) How many
of you are first timers? We have

00:23:00.713 --> 00:23:06.719
a little tradition here at Def
Con. First-time speakers. >> I

00:23:10.623 --> 00:23:13.892
don't mention this anywhere in
my talk, but cyber, everyone.

00:23:13.892 --> 00:23:19.898
(Applause.) >> As you were. You
have to get back to the

00:23:37.283 --> 00:23:43.289
squirrels. >> Jericho keeps
telling me about girls. So we

00:23:46.525 --> 00:23:50.963
look at top talkers. There's a
program that was written that

00:23:50.963 --> 00:23:56.602
was called flow bat by one of my
colleagues named Chris Sanders

00:23:56.602 --> 00:23:59.705
and you can install it on
security onion. I'm an

00:23:59.705 --> 00:24:06.345
electrical engineer. I used to
be a power engineer. I still am.

00:24:06.345 --> 00:24:10.082
I'm not a security guy but I can
install this and use this.

00:24:10.082 --> 00:24:14.053
That's how easy it is to use. So
you can see, this is a real

00:24:14.053 --> 00:24:19.558
world packet capture that we got
from a control system. And just

00:24:19.558 --> 00:24:23.495
looking at the session data, we
can see web traffic. That's the

00:24:23.495 --> 00:24:30.002
number one thing. And why is
that byte count way higher than

00:24:30.002 --> 00:24:32.271
the rest? Is that someone
downloading something, searching

00:24:32.271 --> 00:24:34.273
for a new Ford truck to buy
while they're watching the

00:24:34.273 --> 00:24:40.279
control system, or is someone
exfiltrating data through the

00:24:48.721 --> 00:24:54.727
web. We can see net bias NTP.
There's other tools in security

00:24:59.631 --> 00:25:05.104
onion that do flow, but I really
like silk and flow bat. Network

00:25:05.104 --> 00:25:11.210
miner. It's already installed in
your security union but you can

00:25:11.210 --> 00:25:16.448
download it by itself. You can
find potential arm spoofing and

00:25:16.448 --> 00:25:22.921
many indicators using network
miner. You can look at abnormal

00:25:22.921 --> 00:25:27.426
DNS traffic. So this one has, I
don't know if you can see it in

00:25:27.426 --> 00:25:34.066
the back, but some of the things
it says -- what are those going

00:25:34.066 --> 00:25:40.072
to from my control system to
those strange websites? I see

00:25:42.207 --> 00:25:46.011
also Adobe flash. So that makes
sense someone is updating their

00:25:46.011 --> 00:25:51.417
flash which should be in the
control system anyway. That's a

00:25:51.417 --> 00:25:55.754
bad sign or a good sign if
you're evil. We can also look at

00:25:55.754 --> 00:25:58.824
it with the other tools like
ELSA and looking at the BroIDS

00:25:58.824 --> 00:26:04.463
log. So it's the same thing,
same kind of screen. I know its

00:26:04.463 --> 00:26:10.469
a hard chart. But you get the
idea. You can download the

00:26:12.538 --> 00:26:17.743
presentation later. The packet
inspection. Love this one.

00:26:17.743 --> 00:26:22.181
Malformed Modbus, one of my
devices in my house in my

00:26:22.181 --> 00:26:29.288
network and you know, you can do
a filter on my bus TCP and wire

00:26:29.288 --> 00:26:33.725
shark and all of a sudden it
shows red it says malformed

00:26:33.725 --> 00:26:40.699
packet. If you take the network
statistics, it shows 20% of the

00:26:40.699 --> 00:26:43.902
traffic in mod bus was
malformed. You can probably

00:26:43.902 --> 00:26:47.172
deduce, even though I've already
told you someone was fuzzing

00:26:47.172 --> 00:26:50.742
your network, you can figure it
out yourself just by looking at

00:26:50.742 --> 00:26:56.882
the packet captures. Or we can
see custom modbus going on. Wire

00:26:56.882 --> 00:27:04.056
shark looked at this one and
said there's unknown function

00:27:04.056 --> 00:27:08.927
code 90. Function code 90 is not
normally used in the standard

00:27:08.927 --> 00:27:13.465
for modbus. It just turns out
that snider mod con uses it

00:27:13.465 --> 00:27:17.269
without authentication. And
digital bond a couple years ago

00:27:17.269 --> 00:27:23.275
wrote a module to exploit this
feature. Because that's what

00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:34.219
they do. They exploit features,
unauthenticated and unencrypted.

00:27:34.219 --> 00:27:40.225
So we can detect if it's just
normal traffic. There's three

00:27:45.931 --> 00:27:51.103
IBSs available in security
onion. Bro I haven't DS, snort

00:27:51.103 --> 00:27:57.109
and SCADA. The great thing about
bro it will deduct it on any

00:27:59.912 --> 00:28:02.915
port. So if someone is running
modbus on port 80, it will

00:28:02.915 --> 00:28:05.517
detect that. It's really great.
The folks at Urbana, they're

00:28:05.517 --> 00:28:07.519
developing more ICS protocols
for bro. That's really exciting.

00:28:07.519 --> 00:28:09.521
Snort, they have processors, and
emerging threats has the rule

00:28:09.521 --> 00:28:11.523
pack for snort and digital bond
has the quick draw snort rules

00:28:11.523 --> 00:28:13.525
available that were recently
updated. The folks just unveiled

00:28:13.525 --> 00:28:16.261
a new DMP 3 parser, probably
after all the stuff we've been

00:28:16.261 --> 00:28:22.267
doing, and they also have the
emerging threat rules there as

00:28:28.907 --> 00:28:30.909
well. The modbus are everywhere
and these are free tools that

00:28:30.909 --> 00:28:32.911
you can look at your control
system traffic and look for

00:28:32.911 --> 00:28:34.913
anomalies. I did another example
here I fuzzed my bus and sent

00:28:34.913 --> 00:28:36.915
some strange things. This is the
bro weird log, they also have

00:28:36.915 --> 00:28:38.917
modbus and DB 3 logs by
themselves. And also it will

00:28:38.917 --> 00:28:40.919
show up in ELSA. Squeal is a
nice GUI, if you like those.

00:28:40.919 --> 00:28:42.921
Some people like GUIs,
especially the one that have all

00:28:42.921 --> 00:28:44.923
the different screens happening
and the weather map and the golf

00:28:44.923 --> 00:28:46.925
game going on over here. So you
can see in your sock what's

00:28:46.925 --> 00:28:48.927
going on. So you can see someone
scanning or using modbus attacks

00:28:48.927 --> 00:28:50.929
or you can see standard going on
or other things. Sys log is kind

00:28:50.929 --> 00:28:52.931
of new in control systems. And I
have an RTU that just has sys

00:28:52.931 --> 00:28:54.933
log and I was so happy to see
that. Sys log has been around

00:28:54.933 --> 00:28:56.935
for a long time. Let's start
collecting it directly from our

00:28:56.935 --> 00:28:59.972
devices in the control system. I
set it up and bro picked it out

00:28:59.972 --> 00:29:05.777
of the wire. Whenever I tried to
log in incorrectly, that's what

00:29:05.777 --> 00:29:09.648
I have highlighted there,
Mandiant log-in attempt failed

00:29:09.648 --> 00:29:15.954
three times. And then locked me
out. So here's some RTUs, if you

00:29:15.954 --> 00:29:20.792
have control systems, these are
mainly for the electric sector

00:29:20.792 --> 00:29:26.064
that I'm aware of, Switzer, GTE,
Novatec and Cooper. If you have

00:29:26.064 --> 00:29:30.769
these devices, start collecting
sys log please. And if they

00:29:30.769 --> 00:29:32.771
don't have sys log, put it in
your procurement language when

00:29:32.771 --> 00:29:34.773
you buy the darn thing and say
please allow sys log so I can

00:29:34.773 --> 00:29:36.775
have logs instead of FBI Jesus
showing up knocking on my door

00:29:36.775 --> 00:29:38.777
saying you've been breached.
Because we've had that happen,

00:29:38.777 --> 00:29:40.779
you know, if someone calls we've
been breached, do you have any

00:29:40.779 --> 00:29:42.781
logs? No. What can we help you
with. There's really not a whole

00:29:42.781 --> 00:29:44.783
lot we can do to put the picture
together. So the logging is

00:29:44.783 --> 00:29:46.785
seriously important. Security
onion allows you to look at the

00:29:46.785 --> 00:29:48.787
seven data types and these are
some of the different tools.

00:29:48.787 --> 00:29:50.789
That was kind of neat. I was at
a power company and we were

00:29:50.789 --> 00:29:52.791
getting traffic from them and so
I said to one of the folks that

00:29:52.791 --> 00:29:54.793
I was working with, I said go to
a website and showed them in

00:29:54.793 --> 00:29:56.795
network miner and I saw one of
the operators was looking at

00:29:56.795 --> 00:29:58.797
getting a new Ford truck. So
it's neat that you can show them

00:29:58.797 --> 00:30:00.799
that hey, I see exactly what's
going on. It's really great

00:30:00.799 --> 00:30:03.335
tools that security onion has
been doing. Just mor examples of

00:30:03.335 --> 00:30:05.337
some of the GUIs. Some of the
net flow tools that's really

00:30:05.337 --> 00:30:07.339
important. That's one of the
neatest things that you can do.

00:30:07.339 --> 00:30:09.341
You can even put silk on a box,
you can put it on a pie with a

00:30:09.341 --> 00:30:11.343
big card and start collecting
net flow. That's really

00:30:11.343 --> 00:30:13.345
important. And you can save net
flow for a long time, as opposed

00:30:13.345 --> 00:30:15.347
to P-caps. Go to flobat.com and
you can install security onion

00:30:15.347 --> 00:30:17.349
with just two scripts. Really
nice features there. So what if

00:30:17.349 --> 00:30:19.351
we want to install security
onion and the control system?

00:30:19.351 --> 00:30:21.353
Well, as an engineer who had
control systems, what do we do?

00:30:21.353 --> 00:30:23.355
We test it in the lab first just
to see what we can see. And

00:30:23.355 --> 00:30:25.357
sometimes if you just go put it
in production, we all know what

00:30:25.357 --> 00:30:27.359
happens there, right? You know,
more RAM the better, the bigger

00:30:27.359 --> 00:30:29.361
hard drive the better. But think
about where it is going to go.

00:30:29.361 --> 00:30:31.363
If it's going to be in the data
center, just go grab the thing

00:30:31.363 --> 00:30:33.365
with 128 gigs of RAM and go to
down. But if you're going to put

00:30:33.365 --> 00:30:35.367
it in a power plant or
substation, you're going to have

00:30:35.367 --> 00:30:37.369
to keep things like heat and
chemicals and vibration in mind

00:30:37.369 --> 00:30:39.371
and figure out how you're going
to get the packets to that

00:30:39.371 --> 00:30:41.373
center. And also in the proper
placement. So there's two books,

00:30:41.373 --> 00:30:43.375
the practice of network security
monitoring and applied network

00:30:43.375 --> 00:30:45.377
security monitoring that shows
you all the different places

00:30:45.377 --> 00:30:47.379
that you can put a center, make
sure that you're collecting all

00:30:47.379 --> 00:30:49.381
the right IP addresses. If you
have NAT going on, then you get

00:30:49.381 --> 00:30:51.383
the real IP addresses. And also
you want to work with the right

00:30:51.383 --> 00:30:53.385
stakeholders. If you're a gung
ho IT security person, you net

00:30:53.385 --> 00:30:55.387
to get a box of doughnuts and
get the engineer from

00:30:55.387 --> 00:30:57.389
automation, you need to get the
vendor who makes the control

00:30:57.389 --> 00:30:59.391
system, probably might need to
grab a manager somewhere and

00:30:59.391 --> 00:31:01.326
have a big meeting with
doughnuts down in the control

00:31:01.326 --> 00:31:03.328
room and talk about where are we
going to put these things

00:31:03.328 --> 00:31:05.330
because we're going to start
monitoring our control system

00:31:05.330 --> 00:31:07.332
now. Here's an example of a
hardened control system sensor.

00:31:07.332 --> 00:31:09.334
This is an example from
Schweitzer. You can select a lot

00:31:09.334 --> 00:31:11.336
of data for a terabyte. I pick
on them, I love them. It's like

00:31:11.336 --> 00:31:13.338
a George foreman grill. George
loves cooking in the substation

00:31:13.338 --> 00:31:15.340
with his new line of industrial
grills from Schweitzer. Sorry

00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:17.342
not sorry. That's a great tool.
And you can throw it in there

00:31:17.342 --> 00:31:19.344
and the new 3560 is the one on
the right. It's this big and you

00:31:19.344 --> 00:31:21.346
just throw it in a go bag. And
if you've got to go to an IR and

00:31:21.346 --> 00:31:23.348
start collecting packet captures
and it's in a plant or on an oil

00:31:23.348 --> 00:31:25.350
rig, you can take that with you
and it will work. So let's talk

00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:27.352
-- maybe we should call it
security onion for ICSs. Onions

00:31:27.352 --> 00:31:33.325
have layers, security has
layers. Onions smell bad. Poor

00:31:33.325 --> 00:31:39.331
security can make you cry,
scream and cuss. Welcome to

00:31:56.381 --> 00:32:02.320
security ogre. If you like
references and if you like to go

00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:21.506
watch YouTube, I recommend go
watch The Cuckoo's Egg. If you

00:32:33.051 --> 00:32:39.057
don't already have the book,
it's a great little show. And it

00:32:50.802 --> 00:32:53.705
opened my eyes to how we can
defend our control system

00:32:53.705 --> 00:32:57.309
networks just by looking at what
you have. Because more times

00:32:57.309 --> 00:33:01.179
than not, an attacker is going
to know your network better than

00:33:01.179 --> 00:33:03.782
you. So let's flip the tables
and know our networks better

00:33:03.782 --> 00:33:06.384
than the attackers. You have the
practice of network security

00:33:06.384 --> 00:33:08.386
monitoring from Richard
Bejtlich, NSM wiki and

00:33:08.386 --> 00:33:11.489
securityonion.net. You can
implement security monitoring in

00:33:11.489 --> 00:33:14.092
your control system today
without impacting your

00:33:14.092 --> 00:33:16.695
operations. Because it's
passive. You're not scanning,

00:33:16.695 --> 00:33:20.799
you're not making your goats
fall over. And fail over. There

00:33:20.799 --> 00:33:25.270
are free tools available to help
you start looking at ICS and

00:33:25.270 --> 00:33:29.374
hunting for evil. And the most
important part is people. You

00:33:29.374 --> 00:33:33.845
can have all the alerts and all
the gigabytes and all the

00:33:33.845 --> 00:33:37.949
things, but if you don't have
someone there to interpret it,

00:33:37.949 --> 00:33:40.452
it's not any good. You can
analyze the data and understand

00:33:40.452 --> 00:33:42.754
what's normal and what's not,
and remember adversaries are a

00:33:42.754 --> 00:33:45.724
who, not a what. I'm getting
close to the end of the talk

00:33:45.724 --> 00:33:48.493
here. I've got some thanks. If
you don't already know about the

00:33:48.493 --> 00:33:51.229
ICS village, go see those folks
over there. Go play with modbus.

00:33:51.229 --> 00:33:57.235
And the real protocols. Robert
Emily, NSM for ICS drum, my

00:34:13.852 --> 00:34:19.858
folks at Mandiant, and my other
ICS peeps. I see a few of you

00:36:13.505 --> 00:36:17.108
out here in the audience and I
really appreciate you coming to

00:36:17.108 --> 00:36:23.114
my talk. And I challenge you to
go find networks. (Applause.)
